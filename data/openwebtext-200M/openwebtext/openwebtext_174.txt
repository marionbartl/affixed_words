Good news for public health : Bioengineering researchers from the EPFL in Lausanne , Switzerland , have developed and patented a nanoparticle that can deliver vaccines more effectively , with fewer side effects , and at a fraction of the cost of current vaccine technologies .
Described in an article appearing online September 16 in the journal Nature Biotechnology , the vaccine delivery platform is a deceptively simple combination of nanotechnology and chemistry that represents a huge advantage over current vaccine methods .
This technology may make it possible to vaccinate against diseases like hepatitis and malaria with a single injection .
And at an estimated cost of only a dollar a dose , this technology represents a real breakthrough for vaccine efforts in the developing world .
A vaccination is an injection of a non-virulent form of a pathogen or molecule from a pathogen ( known as an antigen ) , to which the immune system responds , destroying and then developing a " memory " for the pathogen .
Later , when a virulent form of the pathogen comes along , this memory kicks in and the intruder is quickly eradicated .
Most vaccines protect against viruses or bacteria , but vaccine techniques are also being explored as a way to kill cancer cells .
Thanks to recent advances , an immune response can be triggered with just a single protein from a virus or bacterium .
Recent research has also shown that the best way to get sustained immunity is to deliver an antigen directly to specialized immune cells known as dendritic cells ( DCs ) .
This technique is not yet used clinically because there are two difficulties to overcome in targeting the DCs : first , there are not very many of these cells in the skin or muscle , where injections are usually made , so obtaining an adequate immune response with a single injection is difficult ; and second , activating the DCs requires co-delivering a " danger signal " of some sort , otherwise the immune system will just ignore it .
Current approaches mimic bacterial molecules already known to the immune system , but this can cause side effects or even be toxic .
EPFL professors Jeff Hubbell and Melody Swartz and PhD student Sai Reddy have engineered nanoparticles that completely overcome these limitations .
At a mere 25 nanometers , these particles are so tiny that once injected , they flow through the skin 's extracellular matrix , making a beeline to the lymph nodes .
Within minutes , they 've reached a concentration of DCs thousands of times greater than in the skin .
The immune response can then be extremely strong and effective .
In addition , the EPFL team has also engineered a special chemical coating for the nanoparticles that mimics the surface chemistry of a bacterial cell wall .
The DCs do n't recognize this as a specific invader , but do know that it 's something foreign , and so a low - level , generic immune reaction known as " complement " is triggered .
This results in a particularly potent immune response without the risk of unpleasant or toxic side effects .
" People have been exploring nanoparticles for a while , " says Hubbell .
" Our ideas -- to activate complement as a danger signal , and to exploit the slow interstitial flow towards the lymph nodes -- are completely new .
But it meant that our particles had to be much smaller than anything currently being developed .
No other labs have managed to engineer so many levels of functionality into nanoparticles that are smaller than biologically occurring particles , " he adds .
" The beauty of it is that once we have developed the recipe , any lab can make them . "
Cost and logistics are important factors , especially for use in developing countries .
Unlike other nanoparticle vaccine technologies that degrade in water and thus require expensive drying and handling procedures , the EPFL team 's nanoparticles wo n't degrade until they are in the body .
They are in liquid form and do n't require refrigeration , so preparation and handling costs are reduced , and they are easy to transport .
The group is collaborating with the Swiss Tropical Institute in Basel to determine the strength and duration of the immune response in the context of a nanoparticle malaria vaccine .
Toxicity studies are also in the works .
Swartz says that the team is also planning to use this technique to target cancer cells .
" If , as we hope , this vaccine technique can confer sustained immunity with a single injection for around a dollar a dose , without toxic side effects , it could have a real impact on public health , in the developing world as well as right here at home , " says Swartz .
" More study is required to achieve these goals , " she adds , " but we have every reason to believe this technique could be in use within five years . "
KENNEBUNKPORT , Me. , Aug. 11 — The tricolor flag of France flapped in the wind on Saturday afternoon over the craggy seaside promontory known here as Walker ’s Point .
President Bush greeted his French counterpart , Nicolas Sarkozy , with a hearty clap on the shoulder .
Mr. Sarkozy , looking relaxed in a blazer and jeans , kissed Barbara Bush ’s hand .
And the menu , for what the White House billed “ a casual family lunch , ” most certainly did not include freedom fries .
“ We ’re going to give him a hamburger or a hot dog , his choice , ” Mr. Bush said as he waited for Mr. Sarkozy to arrive .
He was flanked by the first lady , Laura Bush , and his parents .
Looking on were members of the extended Bush clan , including grandchildren who had made welcome signs — “ Bienvenue Monsieur Le President ” — with pictures of lobsters .
Mr. Bush went on with the menu , occasionally interrupted by his wife : “ He ’s got some baked beans , ” Mr. Bush said .
“ If he likes baked beans he can have that as well . ” ( “ Native Maine corn , ” Mrs. Bush interjected . )
“ There ’s corn on the cob , real fresh this time of year , ” he continued .
( “ Salad , fresh tomatoes , ” the first lady added . )
“ If he feels like it , he can have him a piece of blueberry pie , fresh blueberries up here in Maine . ”
There are 47 million people in this country without health insurance .
Richmond resident Joey Palmer is one of them .
He learned how costly this can be after fracturing a rib in a relatively minor motorcycle accident and subsequently being hit with a bill for more than $ 12,000 from San Francisco General Hospital .
" There 's no way I could pay something like that , " Palmer , 32 , told me .
" I 'm not a bum , but I 'm not making a lot of money right now .
How is anyone supposed to pay a bill like that ? "
Iman Nazeeri-Simmons , director of administrative operations at San Francisco General , said she sympathizes with Palmer 's situation .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
" It 's not us , " she said .
" It 's the whole system , and the system is broken .
We need to look closely at making changes and at how we can deliver care in a rational way . "
Palmer 's story illustrates the broader problem of runaway health care costs in the United States and a system that leaves millions of Americans to fend for themselves .
It also underlines the importance of universal coverage that guarantees affordable health care to anyone , anywhere -- a goal that 's become a central issue in California and in the current presidential campaign .
" We are the only developed country that does n't cover all its people , " said Stan Dorn , a senior research associate at the nonpartisan Urban Institute .
" We also spend a lot more than the rest of the developed world . "
The United States spent an average of $ 6,102 per person on health care in 2004 ( the latest year for which figures are available ) , according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development .
Canada spent $ 3,165 per person , France $ 3,159 , Australia $ 3,120 and Britain a mere $ 2,508 .
At the same time , life expectancy in the United States was lower than in each of these other countries and infant mortality was higher .
But those are just statistics .
When you talk about America 's health care crisis , you 're really talking about people .
And Palmer 's experience speaks volumes .
He was riding his motorcycle through San Francisco 's Presidio on Sept. 19 .
It was late afternoon .
Palmer was heading toward the Golden Gate Bridge and then home to Richmond .
Suddenly his brakes locked , sending the motorcycle into a slide .
Palmer slammed into a guardrail .
He was pretty shaken up , but he could tell he was n't badly hurt .
A passer - by saw the accident and called for help .
An ambulance arrived within minutes .
Palmer said he told the paramedics that his ribs felt banged up , possibly broken , but that he was basically OK .
He said he preferred to be treated in Contra Costa County , where he lives and would probably qualify for reduced hospital rates because of his income level .
Palmer is a woodworker who specializes in the decorative touches on wealthy people 's yachts .
He said he made only about $ 7,500 last year , getting by primarily with the assistance of relatives .
Palmer said the paramedics were concerned that he may have sustained internal injuries and insisted that he be treated immediately at a hospital .
So he was driven by ambulance to San Francisco General , the only trauma center in the city .
Palmer got lucky here .
The ambulance was from the Presidio Fire Department , which is run by the federal government and does n't charge for ambulance service .
Had the trip been made by a private ambulance company , it likely would have cost Palmer between $ 700 and $ 1,000 .
On the other hand , what Palmer did n't know is that as soon as the paramedics radioed ahead to say they were bringing in an accident victim , San Francisco General , as per the hospital 's procedures , issued a trauma alert to its staff .
Basically , that means a page was sent to doctors and anesthesiologists on call at the time .
That page alone cost Palmer $ 4,659 , and he had n't even set foot yet inside the hospital .
The actual hospital experience was , to put it mildly , a nightmare .
After blood was drawn for a variety of tests ( the cheapest of which cost $ 44 and the priciest $ 107 ) , some X - rays were taken ( $ 423 ) .
Then , Palmer said , he was left in a room ( $ 2,070 ) with a junkie " who was having a real bad trip . "
He asked to be moved elsewhere but was told no other rooms were available .
So Palmer ended up on a gurney in the hallway .
And he waited there for five hours .
Palmer 's bill indicates that he was twice given Vicodin ( $ 22 ) to ease his pain during this interval , but he insists he took no medication .
" I finally saw someone and asked if I could check myself out , " he said .
" The guy said they were still waiting for the results of my CT scans .
I said that I had n't had any CT scans .
It turns out they forgot to put me on the list . "
So Palmer was put on the list for CT scans .
And he waited another hour .
At last the CT scans were taken ( $ 3,334 ) and then another round of X - rays because , Palmer said , the first batch apparently had n't been done correctly .
" Finally a doctor came to me -- it 's now almost 2 in the morning -- and said , yes , I had a fractured rib and some bruised muscles , " Palmer recalled .
" That was that .
End of conversation . "
Shortly afterward , he said , a clerical staffer approached with discharge papers for Palmer to sign .
" She asked how I intended to pay for everything , " Palmer said .
" I told her I did n't have any insurance .
She looked at me and then asked if there was anyone I could sue . "
Several weeks later , he received a bill for $ 11,082 in hospital charges and a separate bill for $ 922 in doctors ' fees .
Palmer 's hospital visit was expensive and time consuming , but it was n't unique .
Many people could cite similar ( and similarly costly ) experiences in receiving " emergency " medical care at U.S. facilities .
" We view health care as a chance to make as much money as you can , " said Dorn at the Urban Institute .
" The goal of health care should be improving people 's health . "
San Francisco General 's Nazeeri-Simmons was unable to comment on Palmer 's lengthy hospital stay because she did n't have access to his medical records .
But with Palmer 's permission , she was able to examine his billing file .
" These charges are comparable to the entire health care market , " Nazeeri - Simmons said .
" They are n't out of line with what other hospitals are charging .
They 're actually lower . "
Not always .
Trauma activation charges , for example , typically range from about $ 2,000 at some Bay Area hospitals to $ 7,000 .
At Marin General Hospital , the charge can run as high as $ 12,636 .
Nazeeri-Simmons said a sliding scale is offered for low - income San Francisco residents .
But Palmer , as a resident of Contra Costa County , was n't eligible for the program .
" If you were uninsured and making less than $ 10,000 , you would pay nothing , " Nazeeri - Simmons said .
" But that 's only if you live in the City and County of San Francisco . "
After receiving his bill , Palmer complained to the hospital about how much he was being charged .
Nazeeri -Simmons acknowledged that a second look was given to the bill at Palmer 's request " and we decided to eliminate the trauma activation charge . "
That reduced the amount due by $ 4,659 .
But Palmer still owes more than $ 7,000 for an eight - hour hospital visit that involved , by his estimate , only about 15 minutes of actual care .
" It 's unfortunate that he's in the situation he 's in , " Nazeeri - Simmons said .
" But what is an individual hospital to do ?
Are we supposed to eat the costs ? "
She said a government - run program similar to systems in place in all other developed democracies would almost certainly keep costs in check while ensuring that everyone has access to treatment ( without being impoverished in the process ) .
" Universal coverage would mean that a Joey Palmer does n't get left out in the cold just because he was in the wrong county , " Nazeeri - Simmons said .
For his part , Palmer said he 'll try to pay off his hospital bill as best he can .
And then , if he can swing it , he 'll leave the country .
He 's thinking seriously about moving to France .
" If you get sick over there , " Palmer mused , " you can go to any hospital and it wo n't cost a fortune . "
He said that with a tone of quiet disbelief .

BBC News , Scottsboro , Alabama
It is the warehouse of the lost and never found , the final destination of airline luggage that goes missing in the US and is never reclaimed .
The centre 's collection of goods often throws up surprises
The building is situated on the edge of the sleepy town of Scottsboro in Alabama .
It does not seem like the kind of place that would attract a million visitors a year , but bargain hunters from around the world converge on the centre every day , eager to see what treasures the Unclaimed Baggage Center has uncovered .
It is a company that buys all the lost and unclaimed luggage from airlines across the US and then sells on everything from clothes to expensive jewellery at discount prices .
" When they come in , we always tell people to plan a few hours to go on their treasure hunt , " says Brenda Cantrell , the centre 's marketing manager .
" Dig through it , have fun with it , you never know what you might find . "
Sight unseen
The luggage is only sold to the Unclaimed Baggage Center once 90 days have passed , and the owners have not been traced .
Worldwide 30 m pieces of luggage went missing last year
They receive it , sight unseen , and then unpack , sort and display the items inside the warehouse that is the size of a city block .
For the most part that means clothes , rows and rows of them , but it also means some very unusual and valuable items , sometimes sewn into the linings of cases or hidden in crates .
" We had a 19th Century full suit of armour , an underwater camera from Nasa , Egyptian artefacts and props from movies , " says Brenda as she proudly stands next to a display case that holds a puppet from the Jim Henson film , Labyrinth .
He was discovered staring out at the staff in a packing case back in the 1980s .
His name is Hoggle and he now resides in the centre 's museum along with a set of bagpipes , and ancient maps of Afghanistan .
Over the years , shoppers have made their own special finds .
One woman discovered $ 1,000 ( £ 500 ) hidden in the lining of a case she bought for pocket change , while another found out that the glass vase she had bought as a trinket was actually worth a small fortune .
Hoggle is not for sale
Abby , who describes herself as a Chanel No. 5 girl , has been coming to the warehouse for more than 30 years and bought most of her jewellery for around half - price .
Her entire collection is worth a great deal , and she feels no guilt that many of the items were possibly heirlooms or precious keepsakes .
" Most of the pieces that people have lost , they got the insurance money from and have bought something to replace it .
Somebody like me that loves it and cherishes it every day , it 's got a good home you know . "
Finders keepers
Over in the sporting goods and electronics section there are piles of mobile phones , ever popular iPods , golf clubs , a ukulele ( with one string ) , and even a shotgun that was misplaced by one careless owner .
The chance of securing a bargain is a big draw
Steve Mare and his mother - in - law have flown all the way from Texas just to visit the warehouse .
" Both of us had heard about it for years and we wanted to come and see what bargains we could find , " says Steve , who is looking for a new suitcase .
The Unclaimed Baggage Center started down the road in a shack , when the founder began the business by buying lost luggage from the Greyhound Bus Company .
In those days things were literally thrown onto a table and people sorted through , in search of a bargain .
But now the centre is one of Alabama 's top tourist destinations proving that " finders keepers , losers weepers " is a big attraction for those in search of a new suit of clothes or a suit of armour .
In this paper Hansen and Kharecha consider “ realistic ” ( they use EIA data ) reserves for oil and gas and conclude that due to approaching peaks it is feasible to keep atmospheric CO 2 from exceeding approximately 450 ppm as long as coal and unconventional fossil fuels are used responsibly .
James Hansen is a physicist , adjunct professor : Earth and Environmental Sciences , Columbia University and director : NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Science .
Outside the scientific community Hansen is probably best known for accusing the Bush administration of trying to silence him after he gave a lecture in December 2005 calling for prompt reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases linked to global warming .
The title is that of a paper recently ( 20th April 2007 ) submitted by James Hansen and Pushker Kharecha .

Introduction
The twin problems of peak oil and climate change are rarely considered with respect to one another , in fact some leading climate change campaigners advocate not talking about peak oil at all ( see George Monbiot ’s recent speech here and my response here ) .
The problems are closely related and the best course of action must fully consider the best thinking on both subjects .
For this reason I applaud Hansen as one of the very few climate scientists who does fully integrate an understanding of peak oil ( and gas ) into his work on climate change .
In this paper Hansen briefly introduces Hubbert ’s notion of peaking oil production rates when about half of the economically recoverable resource has been exploited , going on to mention subsequent work highlighting geological and geographical constraints that similarly lead to the pattern of growth , a production peak followed by declining production of minerals , natural gas and coal .
This seemingly obvious fact of life does not feature largely in today ’s studies of climate change :
Despite the obvious relevance of “ peak oil ” to future climate change , it has received little attention in projections of future climate change .
For instance , in the CO 2 emissions scenarios outlined in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios ( SRES ) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC , 2000 ) , socioeconomic and technological changes are employed as determinants of future energy use , without explicitly addressing the consequences of peak production of fossil fuels .
2
Reserves
The focus of the paper is the relevance that theof remaining fossil fuels have to avoiding “ dangerous anthropogenic interference ” which is taken as likely at COconcentrations of 450 ppm and possibly lower .
This chart illustrates the fossil fuel reserves Hansen is working with .
They are expressed in terms of their carbon content rather than energy content .
Fig 1 .
Historical fossil fuel emissions ( Marland et al. , 2006 ; BP , 2006 ) , current proven conventional reserve estimates for oil and gas ( EIA , 2006 ) and coal ( IPCC , 2001a ) , reserve growth estimates for oil and gas ( EIA , 2006 ) , and possible amounts of unconventional resources ( IPCC , 2001a ) .
CO 2 Pulse Response
2
CO 2 ( t ) = 18 + 14 exp ( - t/420 ) + 18 exp ( - t/70 ) + 24 exp ( - t/21 ) + 26 exp ( - t/3.4 )
2

In addition to the magnitude of stated reserves this analysis also depends on how carbon emissions relate to atmospheric COconcentrations .
For this Hansen uses the following parameterisation of the Bern carbon cycle model :
This pulse response function for anthropogenic COemissions illustrates the proportion of COthat remains airborne t years after emissions and looks like this :
Fig 2 . Decay pulse
[ the expression ] implies that one - third of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions remain in the atmosphere after 100 years and one - fifth after 1000 years .
2
However , the nonlinearities and climate feedbacks do not appear to have played a large role in the increase of atmospheric CO 2 from 280 to 382 ppm , so their effects may remain moderate if further CO 2 increase is limited .
Hansen also points out that this should be considered as a “ lower bound ” as the uptake capacity of the oceans decreases as the dissolved carbon increases and there exists the potential for feedbacks to make additional COemissions .
On feedbacks he makes this observation :
We hear a lot about feedbacks these days with many mechanisms proposed however there seems to be little direct evidence that such nonlinear responses startapposed to say 30 ppm earlier or perhaps 30 ppm later .
This is a critical point , if feedbacks are not yet playing a critical role as Hansen hopes then perhaps we have a little linear “ breathing room ” to mitigate dangerous climate change through controlling our emissions .
However if feedbacks are now critical climate drivers then there seems little scope for mitigation through anthropogenic emission control – in a feedback dominated system anthropogenic emissions are simply no longer the dominate variable , rendering much of this analysis academic .
Testing this pulse response with known anthropogenic emissions from 1750 to 2005 against measured CO 2 concentration increases shows an underestimation of approximately 15 ppm – this Hansen ascribes to deforestation and soil disturbance .
Scenarios
2
In the BAU scenario peak oil emission occurs in 2016 , peak gas in 2026 , and peak coal in 2077 .
Coal Phase - out moves peak coal up to 2022 .
Fast Oil
Use causes peak oil to be delayed until 2037 , but oil use then crashes rapidly .
Reduced Oil Reserves results in peak oil moving from 2016 to 2010 , under the assumption that usage approximates the near symmetrical shape of the classical Hubbert curve .
Coal Phase - out , is meant to approximate a situation in which developed countries freeze their usage rate of coal by 2012 and within a decade developing countries similarly halt increase in coal use .
Between 2025 and 2050 it is assumed that both developed and developing countries will linearly phase out emissions of CO2 from coal usage .
Thus in Coal Phase - out we have global CO2 emissions from coal increasing 2 % per year until 2012 , 1 % / year growth of emissions between 2013 and 2022 , flat emissions from 2023 - 2025 , and finally a linear decrease to zero CO2 emissions from coal in 2050 .
Four scenarios are modelled based on realistic reserves , the COpulse response and varying exploitation responses .
Coal phase out modelled thus :
The results of these scenarios are summarised in this table and detailed in the following charts :
Scenario Peak emission Year of peak Peak CO 2 level Year of peak BAU 14 Gt C/ yr 2077 580 ppm 2100 Coal Phase - out 10 Gt C/yr 2017 440 ppm 2050 Fast Oil Use 11 Gt C/yr 2025 460 ppm 2050 Less Oil Reserves 9 Gt C/yr 2022 425 ppm 2040

The lower chart shows the atmospheric COconcentration resulting from the COemissions scenarios outlined in the IPCC ’s Special Report on Emissions Scenarios ( SRES ) .
The Fourth Assessment Report ( 2007 ) has updated the temperature forecasts slightly from this chart however it's the COconcentrations we are most concerned with here .
Fig 11 .
IPCC Scenarios
Source : IPCC 2001 : Summary for Policymakers ( .pdf )
For reference the A1F and A2 scenarios call for emissions in 2100 from fossil fuels of 30.3 GtC / yr and 28.9 GtC / yr respectively compared with 1990 emissions of 6.0 GtC / yr .
The shear magnitude of fossil fuel reserves required to steadily increase emissions to approximately four times what they are now is incredible .
Even the lowest A1T and B1 scenarios double 1990 emissions by 2050 before returning to a little below 1990 by the century ’s end .
Source : IPPC : Emissions Scenarios ( .pfd ) .
Compare these emissions with those in Hansen 's table above .
Note how most of the IPCC scenarios produce CO 2 concentrations far higher than even Hansen ’s BAU scenario when he considers realistic fossil fuel reserves .
By comparing the two BAU scenarios we can see how Peak oil is clearly good news for climate change .
Hansen 's Business as usual scenario tops out at 580 ppm compared to the IPCC 's over 900 and rising .
In fact reading back from Hansen 's CO 2 concentrations to the corresponding IPCC temperature change curve suggests less than 3°C .
Hansen Interview
Kate Sheppard from the environmental news and commentary website Grist have an interview with James Hansen this week .
The full text can be read here : Clarion Caller :
An interview with renowned climate scientist James Hansen
When asked what needs to happen in the next few years he replies :
A moratorium on coal - fired power plants and phasing those out over the next few decades .
I think that 's perhaps the most important thing .
Then we also need to conserve the liquid and gas fuel so that we can develop the next phase of the industrial revolution because we 're going to have to find energy sources that do n't produce CO 2 .
In order to give us time to do that , we need to use oil and gas , which are precious fuels , as if they were precious .
2
On oil and gas Hansen adds : Critically he's not taking about COfrom oil and gas here - he 's talking about gaining maximum utility from oil and gas , making best use of the finite resource .
Later in the interview he explains how the CO 2 in oil and gas is all it takes to get to close to 450 ppm adding “ It 's pretty clear we 're going to use those fuels … ” .
This means we can't afford to burn much coal in a CO 2 free manner .
He also says :
A molecule of CO 2 from coal , in a certain sense , is different from one from oil or gas , because in the case of oil and gas , it does n't matter too much when you burn it , because a good fraction of it's going to stay there 500 years anyway .
If we wait to use the coal until after we have the sequestration technology , then we could prevent that contribution . "

Activism and Conclusion

Sequestration of COfrom oil is likely never to be feasible but might work for coal .
From a COpoint of view it does n’t really matter when the oil is burnt , any policy driven changes are only going to be on the order of years whereby COatmospheric life is many decades , even centuries .
The timescales do n’t correlate .
Whilst in this paper Hansen limits his recommendations to a moratorium on “ free CO ” ( my shorthand term to represent non-sequestrated CO ) exploitation of coal and unconventional fossil fuels and establishing a price on carbon emissions I have some further observations to make .
Hansen ’s analysis suggests that oil and gas production is going to peak soon and as a result carbon in remaining reserves is relatively limited .
Less than the IPCC scenarios assume and likely not enough to cross the “ dangerous ” threshold of 450 ppm COatmospheric concentration .
It follows then , that the climate change challenge we face is not so much to reduce oil and gas demand through policy and behavioural changes – to put it bluntly – we can leave natural depletion to reduce COemissions from these sources .
As we move into the post peak era , annual oil and gas combustion is determined by supply rather than demand , with increasing unsatisfied demand any achieved demand reductions will likely be absorbed elsewhere in the global economy leaving the global combustion and therefore emissions unchanged from what they would otherwise have been – the maximum that can be supplied .
To suggest otherwise is to suggest that in the post peak era , policy decisions will further reduce oil supply from the geological potential .
Where mankind does have a degree of freedom to influence CO 2 emissions and the resulting concentration is in the exploitation of coal and unconventional fossil fuels , these being demand rather than supply limited for the time being .
Primarily this means addressing electricity as that is where the vast majority of coal is used .
This brings me back to environmentalists , not just the extreme who advocate against talking about peak oil but the majority who advocate addressing oil consumption as the number one response in the name of climate change .
In light of Hansen ’s work I am unconvinced that policies addressing oil demand will influence the CO 2 contribution from oil , the bulk of which I expect to be burnt following the envelope of Hubbert ’s curve over the next few decades .
The mainstream view seems to be that aviation and driving , particularly SUVs are climate change enemies number one and two .
This misconception arises from failure to consider the implication of peak oil .
Whilst advocating reduced aviation and driving is a thoroughly good thing for a wide range of reasons it is not an effective response to climate change , the most serious of threats .
We are not making the best use of available time , money and political capital that would be better spent on combating coal and unconventional fossil fuel exploitation .
Hansen shows us how an appreciation of realistic fossil fuel reserves is necessary to drive an effective response to climate change , this analysis is current lacking from the IPCC and from leading environmental NGOs in their lobbying of governments , leading to a less than optimal response to climate change being proposed .
Professor Kjell Aleklett
In the present climate debate , however , the amount of available fossil fuels does not appear to be an issue .
The problem , as usually perceived , is that we will use excessive amounts in the years ahead .
It is not even on the map that the amount of fossil fuels required in order to bring about the feared climate changes may in fact not be available .
...
We do not have to discuss or doubt the established historic rise in temperature , but we have to discuss and doubt the future temperature increases that the IPCC scenarios project and the fossil resources that IPCC assumes in its prognoses .
We need a new assessment of future temperature increases based on a realistic consumption of oil , natural gas and coal .
Previously on The Oil Drum
Professor Kjell Aleklett , Uppsala University physicist and president of ASPO , The Association for the Study of Peak Oil & Gas , has recently written along similar lines considering oil , gas and coal peaks in comparison to the IPCC emission scenarios and finds the reserves wanting .

" Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld were both on television last night , answering questions , " said Jon Stewart on Wednesday 's Daily Show , comparing the rarity of the event to " a giant squid having sex with Bigfoot as the ghost of Jim Morrison claps giddily . "
" Rummy 's been gone a long time .
Does he remember the dance ? " asked Stewart , showing a clip of Rumsfeld 's testimony concerning the friendly fire death of Pat Tillman .
" I was not intimately knowledgeable , " said Rumsfeld .
" I do n't recall .
... I 'm not aware .
... I was not involved .
... I have a vague recollection .
... I do n't understand the question . "
" He 's been gone a while but he jumps right back in , " said Stewart appreciatively .
" It 's like raping a bicycle . "
" Obviously Cheney 's a little more on top of his game than Rumsfeld , " Stewart went on .
" He 's going to skip right to the ' nothing to regret ' part . "
" Do n't you ever say , ' Maybe I 'm wrong ? ' "
Larry King asked Cheney in an hour - long interview broadcast on Tuesday .
" No , " Cheney replied flatly .
" You would still go into Iraq ? " " Yes , sir . "
" Although there were mistakes ? " " Oh , sure .
There are always things in war that happen that nobody anticipated . "
" Maybe what we 're dealing with is n't so much a man in denial of reality as a happy optimist , " said Stewart , leading into a clip of King asking , " Does it bother you that the Iraqi parliament is taking August off ? " and Cheney responding , " That 's better than taking two months off . "
Stewart finally showed King asking " Would you make an overt move on Iran ? "
Cheney replied , " For what reason ? " and grinned broadly .
" Every time Dick Cheney smiles like that , an angel gets water - boarded , " commented Stewart .
The following video is from Comedy Central 's The Daily Show , broadcast on August 1 .
The mile upon mile of tall maize waving to the horizon around the small Nebraskan town of Carleton looks perfect to farmers such as Mark Jagels .
He and his father farm 2,500 acres ( 10sq km ) , the price of maize - what the Americans call corn - has never been higher , and the future has seldom seemed rosier .
Carleton ( town motto : " The center of it all " ) is booming , with $ 200 m of Californian money put up for a new biofuel factory and , after years in the doldrums , there is new full - time , well - paid work for 50 people .
But there is a catch .
The same fields that surround Jagels ' house on the great plains may be bringing new money to rural America , but they are also helping to push up the price of bread in Manchester , tortillas in Mexico City and beer in Madrid .
As a direct result of what is happening in places like Nebraska , Kansas , Indiana and Oklahoma , food aid for the poorest people in southern Africa , pork in China and beef in Britain are all more expensive .
Challenged by President George Bush to produce 35bn gallons of non-fossil transport fuels by 2017 to reduce US dependency on imported oil , the Jagels family and thousands of farmers like them are patriotically turning the corn belt of America from the bread basket of the world into an enormous fuel tank .
Only a year ago , their maize mostly went to cattle feed or was exported as food aid .
Come harvest time in September , almost all will end up at the new plant at Carleton , where it will be fermented to make ethanol , a clear , colourless alcohol consumed , not by people , but by cars .
The era of " agrofuels " has arrived , and the scale of the changes it is already forcing on farming and markets around the world is immense .
In Nebraska alone , an extra million acres of maize have been planted this year , and the state boasts it will produce 1bn gallons of ethanol .
Across the US , 20 % of the whole maize crop went to ethanol last year .
How much is that ?
Just 2 % of US automobile use .
" Probably has n't looked any better than it looks right now , " Jerry Stahr , another Nebraskan farmer , told his local paper recently .
Jagels and Stahr are part of a global green rush , one of the greatest shifts that world agriculture has seen in decades .
As the US , Europe , China , Japan and other countries commit themselves to using 10 % or more alternative automobile fuels , farmers everywhere are rushing to grow maize , sugar cane , palm oil and oil seed rape , all of which can be turned into ethanol or other biofuels for automobiles .
But that means getting out of other crops .
The scale of the change is boggling .
The Indian government says it wants to plant 35 m acres ( 140,000 sq km ) of biofuel crops , Brazil as much as 300 m acres ( 1.2 m sq km ) .
Southern Africa is being touted as the future Middle East of biofuels , with as much as 1bn acres ( 4 m sq km ) of land ready to be converted to crops such as Jatropha curcas ( physic nut ) , a tough shrub that can be grown on poor land .
Indonesia has said it intends to overtake Malaysia and increase its palm oil production from 16 m acres ( 64,000 sq km ) now to 65 m acres ( 260,000 sq km ) in 2025 .
While this may be marginally better for carbon emissions and energy security , it is proving horrendous for food prices and anyone who stands in the way of a rampant new industry .
A year or two ago , almost all the land where maize is now being grown to make ethanol in the US was being farmed for human or animal food .
And because America exports most of the world 's maize , its price has doubled in 10 months , and wheat has risen about 50 % .
The effect on agriculture in the UK is price increases all round .
" The world price [ of maize ] has doubled , " says Mark Hill , food partner at the business advisory firm Deloitte .
" In June , wheat prices across the US and Europe hit their highest levels in more than a decade .
These price hikes are likely to trigger inflation in food prices , as processors are forced to pay increased costs for basic ingredients such as corn and wheat . "
UK flour millers , for example , need 5.5 m tonnes of wheat to produce the 12 m loaves sold each day in the UK .
The majority of this wheat is grown in the UK , and in the last year milling wheat prices moved from around £ 100 a tonne to £ 200 a tonne .
Hovis raised the price of a standard loaf from 93 p to 99 p in February and has said more increases are on the way .
In France , consumers have also been warned that their beloved baguette will become more expensive .
The era of cheap food is over , says Hill .
World commodity prices of sugar , milk and cocoa have all surged , prompting the biggest increase in retail food prices in three decades in some countries .
" Meat , too , will cost more because chicken and pigs are fed largely on grain , " says Hill .
" And while anyone growing grains will be better off , dairy and livestock producers may well struggle in this environment . "
But the surge in demand for agrofuels such as ethanol is hitting the poor and the environment the hardest .
The UN World Food Programme , which feeds about 90 m people mostly with US maize , reckons that 850 m people around the world are already undernourished .
There will soon be more because the price of food aid has increased 20 % in just a year .
Meanwhile , Indian food prices have risen 11 % in a year , the price of the staple tortilla quadrupled in Mexico in February and crowds of 75,000 people came on to the streets in protest .
South Africa has seen food - price rises of nearly 17 % , and China was forced to halt all new planting of corn for ethanol after staple foods such as pork soared by 42 % last year .
In the US , where nearly 40 million people are below the official poverty line , the Department of Agriculture recently predicted a 10 % rise in the price of chicken .
The prices of bread , beef , eggs and milk rose 7.5 % in July , the highest monthly rise in 25 years .
" The competition for grain between the world 's 800 million motorists , who want to maintain their mobility , and its two billion poorest people , who are simply trying to survive , is emerging as an epic issue , " says Lester Brown , president of the Washington - based Worldwatch Institute thinktank , and author of the book Who Will Feed China ?
It is not going to get any better , says Brown .
The UN's World Food Organisation predicts that demand for biofuels will grow by 170 % in the next three years .
A separate report from the OECD , the club of the world 's 30 richest countries , suggested food - price rises of between 20 % and 50 % over the next decade , and the head of Nestlé , the world 's largest food processor , said prices would remain high as far as anyone could see ahead .
A " perfect storm " of ecological and social factors appears to be gathering force , threatening vast numbers of people with food shortages and price rises .
Even as the world 's big farmers are pulling out of producing food for people and animals , the global population is rising by 87 million people a year ; developing countries such as China and India are switching to meat - based diets that need more land ; and climate change is starting to hit food producers hard .
Recent reports in the journals Science and Nature suggest that one - third of ocean fisheries are in collapse , two - thirds will be in collapse by 2025 , and all major ocean fisheries may be virtually gone by 2048 .
" Global grain supplies will drop to their lowest levels on record this year .
Outside of wartime , they have not been this low in a century , perhaps longer , " says the US Department of Agriculture .
In seven of the past eight years the world has actually grown less grain than it consumed , says Brown .
World stocks of grain - that is , the food held in reserve for times of emergency - are now sufficient for just over 50 days .
According to experts , we are in " the post - food - surplus era " .
The food crisis , Brown warns , is only just beginning .
What worries him as much as the new competition between food and fuel is that the booming Chinese and Indian populations - the two largest nations in the world , with nearly 40 % of the world 's population between them - are giving up their traditional vegetable - rich diets to adopt typical " American " diets that contain more meat and dairy products .
Meat demand in China has quadrupled in 30 years , and in India , milk and egg products are increasingly popular .
In itself , this is no problem , say Brown and others , except that it means an accelerated demand for water to grow more food .
It takes 7 kg of grain to produce 1 kg of beef , and increased demand will require huge amounts of grain - growing land .
Much of this , of course , will need to be irrigated .
" Water tables are now falling in countries that contain over half the world 's people , " Brown points out .
" While numerous analysts and policymakers are concerned about a future of water shortages , few have connected the dots to see that a future of water shortages means a future of food shortages . "
New figures from the World Bank , he says , show that 15 % of the world 's present food supplies , on which 160 million people depend , are being grown with water drawn from rapidly depleting underground sources or from rivers that are drying up .
In large areas of China and India , the water table has fallen catastrophically .
Scientists are becoming increasingly alarmed .
Earlier this year , water specialists from hundreds of institutes around the world published the biggest ever assessment of water and food .
Their conclusions were chilling .
With the earth 's water , land and human resources , it would be possible to produce enough food for the future , they said .
" But it is probable that today 's food production and environmental trends will lead to crises in many parts of the world , " said David Molden , deputy director general of the International Water Management Institute .
Climate change , meanwhile , is leading to more intense rains , unpredictable storms , longer - lasting droughts , and interrupted seasons .
In Britain , the recent floods will result in a shortage of vegetables such as potatoes and peas , and cereals such as wheat .
This comes on top of a 4.9 % rise in food prices in the year to May - well over consumer price inflation - and a 9.6 % hike in vegetable prices .
Britain can get by , but elsewhere climate change is proving disastrous .
" I met leaders from Madagascar reeling from seven cyclones in the first six months of the year , " Josette Sheeran , new director of the World Food Programme , told colleagues in Rome recently .
" I asked them when the season ends and was told that such questions are becoming more difficult to answer .
Farmers know that predictable patterns in weather are becoming a thing of the past .
How does the global food supply system deal with such changing risk ? "
The answer is : with ever greater difficulty .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that rain - dependent agriculture could be cut in half by 2020 as a result of climate change .
" Anything even close to a 50 % reduction in yields would obviously pose huge problems , " said Sheeran .
Within a week , Lesotho had declared a food emergency after the worst drought in 30 years and greatly reduced harvests in neighbouring South Africa pushed prices well beyond the reach of most of the population .
All this is far too gloomy , say other analysts and politicians .
Earlier this year , Brazil 's president , Luiz Lula , told the Guardian that there was no need for world food shortages , or any destruction of forests to grow more food at all .
" Brazil has 320 m hectares [ 3.2 m sq km ] of arable land , only a fifth of which is cultivated .
Of this , less than 4 % is used for ethanol production ...
This is not a choice between food and energy . "
Others say that the food price rises now being seen are temporary and will fall back within a year as the market responds .
Technologists pin their faith on GM crops , or drought - resistant crops , or trust that biofuel producers will develop technologies that require less raw material or use non-edible parts of food .
The immediate best bet is that countries such as Argentina , Poland , Ukraine and Kazakhstan will grow more food for export as US output declines .
Back on the great plains , meanwhile , ethanol fever is running high .
This time last year , there were fewer than 100 ethanol plants in the whole United States , with a combined production capacity of 5bn gallons .
There are now at least 50 more new plants being built and over 300 more are planned .
If even half of them are finished , they will help to rewrite the politics of global food .

Irish peace activist ’s speech at Dallas event gets standing ovation
By JAMES HOHMANN / The Dallas Morning News
Nobel Peace Prize winner Betty Williams came from Ireland to Texas to declare that President Bush should be impeached .
In a keynote speech at the International Women ’s Peace Conference on Wednesday night , Ms. Williams told a crowd of about 1,000 that the Bush administration has been treacherous and wrong and acted unconstitutionally .
( Original Article )
Of the estimated 7,000 languages spoken in the world today , linguists say , nearly half are in danger of extinction and are likely to disappear in this century .
In fact , they are now falling out of use at a rate of about one every two weeks .
Some endangered languages vanish in an instant , at the death of the sole surviving speaker .
Others are lost gradually in bilingual cultures , as indigenous tongues are overwhelmed by the dominant language at school , in the marketplace and on television .
New research , reported today , has identified the five regions of the world where languages are disappearing most rapidly .
The “ hot spots ” of imminent language extinctions are : Northern Australia , Central South America , North America ’s upper Pacific coastal zone , Eastern Siberia and Oklahoma and Southwest United States .
All of the areas are occupied by aboriginal people speaking diverse languages , but in decreasing numbers .
The study was based on field research and data analysis supported by the National Geographic Society and the Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages , an organization for the documentation , revitalization and maintenance of languages at risk .
The findings are described in the October issue of National Geographic magazine and at www.languagehotspots.org.
BANGOR ( Reuters ) - Dolphins living off the coast of Wales whistle , bark and groan in a different dialect from dolphins off the western coast of Ireland , scientists have discovered .
Different physical environments might have contributed to the mammals developing distinctive sets of vocalisations or “ dialects ” , said Simon Berrow from the Shannon Dolphin and Wildlife Foundation .
Berrow supervised a master ’s thesis by student Ronan Hickey at University of Wales , Bangor , who analysed 1,882 whistles from the dolphins in the Shannon estuary and bottlenose dolphins in Cardigan Bay in Wales .
The study found 32 different sound categories , of which eight were only produced by the Shannon animals .
“ The idea that the sounds are different is not a bad notion -- you ’d expect the information had to be different given the diversity of the areas where they reside , ” Berrow told Reuters , adding he would use the data to create a dictionary of sounds and pursue the research further , should time and money allow .
The myth of discoverability is the belief that in a design it ’s possible to make everything equally easy to find .
I ’m here to tell you that you can ’t .
You have limited screen real estate , people have limited attention spans , and brains have limited abilities to perceive things with their eyes .
A designer is always forced to make tradeoffs and choose which things are worthy of more attention than others .
If the designer fails to find the courage to prioritize , the result is a design where nothing is easy to discover or to use .
Everything is emphasized , which means nothing is emphasized .
For example , compare this sentence :
YOU CAN NOT MAKE EVERY SINGLE WORD STAND OUT .
To this one :
You can not make every SINGLE word stand out .
Why everything ca n’t be discoverable
Imagine a car where every UI element was the same size , putting the steering and dozens of other equally sized controls for the stereo and air conditioning in a random order across the entire dashboard .
Although the stereo and air conditioning might be easier to discover , the overall tradeoff is a disaster .
Since the steering wheel is used ever time a user drives , and is used in every moment while they are driving , it deserves the greatest real estate and convenience possible , even if it ’s at the expense of the discoverability and convenience of nearly every other feature in the car ( of course the windshield is the largest UI element in the car , and is nearly infinitely discoverable ) .
Everyone is glad the steering wheel in their automobile is easier to discover than the defroster button or glove box ( oddly named since no one puts gloves there anymore ) .
They expect that whoever designed the automobile , or web site , is making good basic choices in their interest , so that they do n’t have to think too much about how to find the most frequently used interfaces in the car .
In part , that ’s what they ’re paying for .
This means that anyone that builds things that people will use has to consider what things need to be discoverable first , and where the emphasis of a given design should be .
This turns out to be difficult , and as a result , many designers and engineers do everything they can to avoid these kinds of considerations .
Many mediocre designs are the result of the avoidance of tough decisions on the part of the designer , rather than an inability to design well .
Or worse , the design reflects decision by committee , where everything gets equal emphasis because no one designer was empowered to make the necessary tradeoff decisions .
Is discoverability the primary element of design ?
Discoverability is one link in the chain of elements that make for good design .
Of course if you ca n’t find the steering wheel or the gas pedal , you ca n’t even begin to do the long sequence of steps required to drive the car to the store .
Given that it ’s impossible to click on something you can’t locate , discoverability is certainly important .
However , discoverability does not guarantee success .
It ’s possible for a user to discover the correct item , but not know how to use it ( e.g. grayed out commands in an application ) .
It ’s also possible for an item to be discoverable , but difficult to use .
I may know exactly where the spare tire is in the trunk of my car , but that does n’t make it any easier for me to successfully change a flat .
Lastly , a user might be able to discover an item the first time , but have trouble locating the item a second or third time .
So the fact that something can be discovered does not imply that their experience after the moment of discovery will be good .
How do you decide what to make discoverable ?
You have to prioritize .
Whether you ’re designing a toaster oven or an airplane cockpit , you must prioritize the tasks you believe users will do .
Some designers call this scenario based design , where you create a list , preferably based on user research , for the typical things your users need to accomplish with the design .
There are many different methods and it does n’t matter which you use provided you ’re using one .
To generate a prioritization for your design requires stepping away from the functional , engineering view and focus on the perspective most people who will use the thing will probaby have .
Everyone thinks they can easily switch gears in their mind to obtain this perspective , but most fail .
Usability studies , when done early , commonly show how different user expectations are than the designer ’s .
It takes hundreds of hours watching real people use real things to develop good instincts for what should be most discoverable and how to design to achieve it .
The golden rule for what to make discoverable
Here is the golden rule :
Things that most people do , most often , should be prioritized first .
Things that some people do , somewhat often , should come second .
Things that few people do , infrequently , should come last .
That ’s it .
If you want more detail , here is a deeper prioritization of how to think about the relative importance of tasks and features :
1 . Things most people do , most often .
2 . Things most people do , somewhat often .
3 . Things some people do , most often .
4 . Things some people do , somewhat often .
5 . Things few people do , most often .
6 . Things few people do , somewhat often .
Depending on what you ’re designing , and who you ’re designing for , you might have different categories , and place them in a different order : that ’s fine .
The important point is that you are prioritizing the kinds of tasks and frequency of occurrence , and using that to drive how you allocate resources in your design .
Designing systems for expert use can bend the rule significantly .
An airline pilot or air traffic controller is an expert doing expert tasks , and may need much more complexity than your average consumer design .
There may be mandatory training that shifts the needs of the design towards optimizing for expert efficiency , rather than than initial ease of use .
Notable Exceptions to the rule :
Start up tasks .
You may have an important thing that people need to do only once , but it has to be done to enable everything else .
( e.g. login , registration , application install , etc. ) .
So even though this might not be done frequently , it may score high in the priority list .

( e.g. login , registration , application install , etc. ) .
So even though this might not be done frequently , it may score high in the priority list .
Some features might be needed only in emergencies .
So while they are n’t used frequently , they need easy availability .
( E.g .
No pilot wants to use the eject button , but if ever they need it , they should n’t have to look for it .
Car horns are another good example ) .

Complex systems may require more complex considerations .
Systems involving real time ( air traffic control terminals ) , or intimate usage ( development tools ) , make prioritization more difficult .
The more complex the usage patterns , the more design thinking and iteration that may be required .
This is more common in application design , than in web design .
. Systems involving real time ( air traffic control terminals ) , or intimate usage ( development tools ) , make prioritization more difficult .

This is more common in application design , than in web design .
Diverse user groups .
For sophisticated applications , there may be specific types of usage patterns associated with certain roles ( administrator , user , teacher , student , etc. ) .
It ’s possible that the usage patterns are so different , that you might choose to optimize around those roles .
You might want to invest in making different things discoverable for different types of users .
Applying the rule to designs
Once you ’ve identified the things that are most important to the design , you can go and focus whatever design , engineering , and usability resources you have on those things first , and on making the important elements of your design discoverable .
Perhaps the most flagrant mistake in design are websites or computer terminals that use the most important sections of screen real estate for things that are at the bottom of the priority list .
Progressive discoverability & Context
Another part of the myth of discoverability is that the home page or the toolbar are the only place where discoverability matters .
Often top level discoverability is useless for features that are only used in a certain context .
For example , when you go to the movie theatre , you do n’t need to know about where the drinking straws are , until after you ’ve purchased your soda .
It ’d be silly to have straws at the ticket counter , where they make no sense , but are arguably more discoverable , since the ticket counter is the first thing you see when you enter a theater .
It ’s more sensible to worry about the discoverability of a given command or link in the places where it has a strong relationship to whatever the user is currently doing , or trying to accomplish .
Carefully choosing how and when to make commands or items discoverable could be described as designing for progressive discoverability .
That you give users information on a need to know and useful to know basis , and disclose more depth as users progress deeper into your design , and can make use of those commands .
( Note : do n’t take this to the other extreme , where you restrict yourself to only showing one command or link on the screen a time .
That ’s just as silly as showing too many .
As usual it ’s all about balance ) .
The difference between discoverable and discovered
Think of the last time you saw someone on the highway drive past an exit , and at the last possible moment , realizing their mistake , cut back across the divider to get off the highway .
You probably smiled or snickered , thinking how oblivious they must have been to miss it .
Now , think about the last time you missed an exit .
Not so funny anymore .
When we ’re honest with ourselves , we realize that some of the mistakes we make when interacting with systems are not entirely the designers fault .
It ’s well documented that human perception is entirely fallible .
We are sensitive to thousands of subtle variables and differences in what ’s going on around us , and an individual ’s performance in perception related tasks is at best unreliable , and at worst , difficult to accurately predict .
This means that simply making something discoverable , does n’t guarantee it will be discovered .
You could do everything in your power as a designer or a programmer , and still , some percentage of people that use what you made will miss certain things you thought were obvious .
I do n’t mention this to discourage anyone : it ’s just a fact .
And if you ’re going to go about doing this stuff , you should understand that no matter how smart you are , or how much we ’d like a smarter population , you just ca n’t circumvent the limits of the species .
This often means that smart designs account for human limitations .
They ’re forgiving , they make it easy to recover from mistakes , and sometimes allow for multiple ways to do something , without adding confusion .
That ’s a hallmark of master level work .
How do you actually make something discoverable ?
As a designer , you have a handful of resources for emphasizing things , and trying to draw attention to them :
Real estate :
You get a certain amount of pixels to use however you want .
Larger targets are likely to be located first , and easier to be found again .
Big targets are easier targets .
: You get a certain amount of pixels to use however you want .
Larger targets are likely to be located first , and easier to be found again .
Big targets are easier targets .
Order :
You can place things in specific orders , from left to right , and top to bottom , that might form patterns people can learn to follow , depending on their language ( some are left to right , some are right to left , etc. ) .

Form :
You can use color , font , shape , shadow , composition , and other graphic design constructions to help make use of the real estate you have .

Expectation & Flow : Depending on how you use the above , you can put things into forms or patterns that are in some way familiar to people .
The most obvious examples are printed newspapers , and how columns , line breaks , and headings are used .
This might be achieved by emulating another design from another website , or from something in the real world .

This might be achieved by emulating another design from another website , or from something in the real world .
Consistency :
If you use the screen in consistent ways , you can teach people to look for certain kinds of commands in certain places .
By being predictable , you can score some extra discoverability points .
This can often be assisted by using available conventions , and trying to make use of knowledge your users already have .
Every metaphor or paradigm you might be familiar with ( GUI , Windows , Mac , amazon.com , etc. ) makes use of real estate , order and form to achieve the results they do .
Good systems provide some basic constructions for making elements discoverable that can easily be reused .
Does prioritizing discoverability eliminate user choice ?
Yes and No .
When the guy who designed the highway you drove to work today decided to space exits 5 miles apart from each other , he or she eliminated many possible choices from your driving options .
You ca n’t leave the highway in the middle of those two exits ( unless you drive an M - 1 tank and have amazing insurance ) .
But this can work to your advantage .
The system of exits gives you a standard way to tell people how to get on and off the highway , and helps to maintain a regular pace of traffic .
So while that one exit might be one mile out of your way , the holistic value of those kinds of choices works to your benefit .
So yes , you do give up some degree of freedom , but if the designer is a good one , you wo n’t mind .
The overall benefits outweigh the limited sacrifices .
In other words , eliminating stupid , unnecessary or infrequent choices from the list of decisions people need to make , is almost always a good thing .
They do n’t care about what they do n’t need to care about .
In many cases , we create self - fulfilling prophecies in our user interfaces .
People trust us .
They think we know what we ’re doing .
So when we create a link on the web page that says “ Modify turbo overdrive optimization threshold ” they think there ’s a reason they might need to do that , when in reality , it ’s probably only the programmer , and the programmers friend across the hall , the really even understand what this is , much less have a reason to ever use it .
But by putting it there , we suggest to people that there is a good reason for it .
Way too much of the time , there is n’t .

ANOTHER U.S. WAR BREWING IN MIDEAST Ex-aide to Dick Cheney spills the beans ; real trouble brewing in northern Iraq By Richard Walker An insane plan authorized by President Bush to join Turkey in a covert war to assassinate leaders of a Kurdish rebel group in northern Iraq was exposed after a former Dick Cheney aide briefed lawmakers on Capitol Hill .
Within days of the visit to the Hill by Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Eric Edelman , columnist Robert Novak got wind of the plan and made it public .
It transpired that Edelman boasted that the plan involved U.S. Special Forces helping their Turkish counterparts behead the leadership of the Kurdish guerrilla group the PKK , also known as the Kurdistan Workers Party , in its hideout in mountains bordering northern Iraq and Turkey .
When lawmakers questioned the sanity of the United States getting caught up in yet another guerrilla war , Edelman assured them it would be a success .
The U.S. role would be hidden and vigorously denied if made public .
Some members of Congress thought the strategy was risky , especially at a time when the United States was bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Edelmans response was that the plan was a slam dunk and that it would not take long to accomplish .
Some lawmakers also raised concerns that doing Turkeys dirty work could have unforeseen consequences and could only add to further isolation of the United States around the world .
The Turks have long argued that the PKK , which wants Kurds within Turkey to be granted autonomy , has been aided by Iraqi Kurds who have been staunch American allies .
Iraqi Kurds have no love for Turkey but deny involvement with the PKK .
Nevertheless , they will not look kindly on U.S. involvement in a campaign against fellow Kurds .
Several months ago , Turkey , which is a NATO member , alarmed the EU and the United States by massing large numbers of troops on the border .
At the time , Turkish generals talked openly of invading Iraq with over 200,000 troops .
The reaction from the Iraqi parliament , as well as from the regional Kurdish government in northern Iraq , was swift .
They warned an invasion by Turkey would not only be a breach of Iraqi sovereignty but would be repulsed .
It now seems the United States has encouraged Turkey to jettison its invasion plans in return for a joint U.S. - Turkish dirty war against the PPK , using U.S. air power and hi-tech surveillance .
The PKK is regarded as a terrorist group by many western
Turkey is not without blame .
Some 30,000 Kurds have been killed during several decades of fighting between the PKK and the Turkish military .
The Turks have been accused of carrying out assassinations , rapes , torture and the kidnapping of large numbers of Kurdish nationals .
During the Cold War the PKKs Marxist - Leninist leanings made it an enemy of the West and the United States .
The CIA even went so far as to train Turkish assassination squads and militias to track down PKK members and sympathizers .
U.S. involvement in that secret war is rarely discussed but lawmakers who may be aware of it would certainly not wish a repeat of American participation in what could turn out to be a dangerous game .
There is yet another aspect to the Bush plan that may concern some on the Hill .
Turkey has its own agenda in respect to how it would like to see the Iraq conflict resolved .
The Turks have never been happy about Americas closeness to the Kurds who helped the United States bring down Saddam Hussein .
But , they are more concerned about those Iraqi Kurds sitting on huge oil reserves around Kirkuk .
Therefore , if Iraq descended into all - out civil war , Kurdistan in northern Iraq could become a totally separate and very rich entity on Turkeys border .
The problem is even more complicated than that .
Israel is supportive of Iraqi Kurds and has gone out of its way to train militias under the control of the Kurdish regional government .
Israel may well see the Kurds as an ideal bulwark against fundamentalist Iran and a Turkey with the potential to move in the future from a secular region to a state controlled by Islamic radicals .
Still , there is a more troubling connection between the United States and the PKK .
The PKK no longer sees itself as a Marxist - Leninist organization
and accuses Turkey of denying Kurds within its borders the same human rights as the rest of the Turkish population .
The PKKs opposition to Turkey is matched only by its hatred of Iran because of Irans treatment of Kurds within its borders .
In the past year , evidence has mounted that the CIA and the Israelis have been encouraging , if not actively supporting , PKK attacks within Iran in an effort to destabilize the Iranian government .
Taking all that into consideration , theres no wonder some lawmakers are jittery about the Cheney - Bush tendency to think foreign policy is best served by secretive , but very bloody military actions .
Richard Walker is the nom de plume of a former mainstream news producer who now writes for AFP so he can expose the kinds of subjects that he was forbidden to cover in the controlled press .

History

“ There has been an intimate relationship between them from the beginning , ” Mr. Riedel said of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia and the senior leaders of the broader Qaeda group .
But the precise relationship between the Al Qaeda of Osama bin Laden and other groups that claim inspiration or affiliation with it is murky and opaque .
While the groups share a common ideology , the Iraq - based group has enjoyed considerable autonomy .
Ayman al - Zawahri , Osama bin Laden ’s top deputy , questioned Mr. Zarqawi ’s strategy of organizing attacks against Shiites , according to captured materials .
But Mr. Zarqawi clung to his strategy of mounting sectarian attacks in an effort to foment a civil war and make the American occupation untenable .
The precise size of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia is not known .
Estimates are that it may have from a few thousand to 5,000 fighters and perhaps twice as many supporters .
While the membership of the group is mostly Iraqi , the role that foreigners play is crucial .
Abu Ayyub al - Masri is an Egyptian militant who emerged as the successor of Mr. Zarqawi , who was killed near Baquba in an American airstrike last year .
American military officials say that 60 to 80 foreign fighters come to Iraq each month to fight for the group , and that 80 to 90 percent of suicide attacks in Iraq have been conducted by foreign - born operatives of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia .
At first , Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia received financing from the broader Qaeda organization , American intelligence agencies have concluded .
Now , however , the Iraq - based group sustains itself through kidnapping , smuggling and criminal activities and some foreign contributions .
With the Shiite militias having taken a lower profile since the troop increase began , and with Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia embarking on its own sort of countersurge , a main focus of the American military operation is to deprive the group of its strongholds in the areas surrounding Baghdad — and thus curtail its ability to carry out spectacular casualty - inducing attacks in the Iraqi capital .
The heated debate over Iraq has spilled over to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia as well .
Mr. Bush has played up the group , talking about it as if it is on a par with the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks .
War critics have often played down the significance of the group despite its gruesome record of suicide attacks and its widely suspected role in destroying a Shiite shrine in Samarra in February 2006 that set Iraq on the road to civil war .

A few hundred ( approx . ) protesters broke off from the main march at the end and attempted to cross the overpass bridge into Virginia , which would lead into the Pentagon itself .
Virginia State Police faced them off on the bridge .
While on the bridge we hung the sign on the overpass .
When the police decided to cross the bridge and push the aggravating protesters back into DC , we almost lost the sign !
…
It took some hassle , but thankfully I managed to convince a non -riot - gear - uniformed policeman to retrieve the banner for us !
We stood in front of the media stand for much of this part of the rally hoping for a good shot !
At the moment , though , it looks like Yahoo ! has taken down [ this ] particular picture .
Because of the word “ impeach ” ?
Maybe .
Also , I could n’t find any mention of this in the media , World Ca n’t Wait provided a substantial number of placards , and as a result there were a * substantial * number of impeachment placards — all of the orange ones in the pics , in fact .

The report appeared in Wednesday 's edition of the British daily , The Guardian .
Citing batches of foreign ministry files marked " Top Secret , " the newspaper reported that the program was carried out to loot Germany 's technical and commercial assets .
According to The Guardian , the papers in the British Archive in Kew " make it clear " that for more than two years after the end of the Second World War , the British authorities were subjecting scientists to a program of " enforced evacuation " .
A separate but related program also apparently forced German business leaders to travel to Britain to provide trade secrets to their British rivals .
Gestapo methods
Many of the scientists worked in the armaments industry
The Guardian noted that one memo , written in August 1946 by an unidentified senior civil servant working within the British military government in Germany , explained the system of abductions .
" Usually an NCO ( non-commissioned officer ) arrives without notice at the house or office of the German and warns that he will be required .
He does not give him any details of the reason , nor does he present his credentials .
Some time later the German is seized ... and removed under ground .
" This procedure savors very much of the Gestapo methods and , quite apart from causing great and unnecessary inconvenience to the individual and to the industry employing him , it is bound to create feelings of alarm and insecurity .
" I have not been able to get to the bottom of the matter , but there appear to be two bodies which carry out these kidnappings . "
According to The Guardian , the two bodies referred to are the British Intelligence Objectives Sub-Committee , and the Field Information Agency ( Technical ) , a joint Anglo - American military intelligence agency , which identified suitable scientists for abduction from the US and French zones , and Berlin .
Germans considered bounty
The newspaper reported that the legality of these actions was never questioned as the 2nd proclamation made by the British military government in Germany declared that Germany would " provide such transport , plant , equipment and materials of all kinds , labor , personnel , and specialist and other services , for use in Germany or elsewhere , as the allied representatives may direct . "
At least seven scientists were taken from IG Farben
According The Guardian , it is not clear how many Germans were forcibly evacuated , but the paper reported that some 1,500 scientists were earmarked as candidates .
However , another document uncovered by the paper quotes an official as saying they could n't cope with more than 600 .
The Guardian said the papers show little evidence of industry being concerned about the employment of Nazis .
Its mission seems as humane as it is clear : to develop " weapons that are explicitly designed and primarily employed so as to incapacitate personnel or material , while minimizing fatalities , permanent injury to personnel , and undesired damage to property and the environment . "
To some critics , however , the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate ( JNLWD ) , established by Congress in 1997 under Marine Corps command , is obsessed with developing a high - tech arsenal that contravenes U.S. and international law .
" Forcing drugs on large crowds of civilians is not a cool and high - tech war of tomorrow , " said Edward Hammond of the Sunshine Project , an international network of activists against biotech weapons .
" It 's not gee - whiz , it 's not Star Trek , it 's not our big , bright technological future .
It is sick and repugnant ....
It is illegal . "
Other critics contend non-lethal weapons are too soft a solution .
According to a report by Lt. Colonel Margaret - Anne Coppernoll of the Army National Guard , non-lethal weapons " not only fail to strengthen the nation 's position when dealing with ( irrational ) adversaries but convey that it is too squeamish to inflict serious harm on enemies or to accept casualties . "
But one member of a National Academy of Sciences panel assessing the role of non-lethal weapons maintains that the truth is situational .
The panel member , who requested anonymity pending the release of the group 's report later this year , said : " There is no such thing as a lethal or non-lethal weapon ; the determinant is the application . "
The panel member used the Cold War nuclear arms race to illustrate the point .
" It is a tough stretch to envision a scenario for the non-lethal application of a nuclear bomb , yet we and the Soviets fought the Cold War almost entirely with nuclear weapons .
And , at least after the long - term effects of exposure to radiation were understood and taken into account in testing , we never killed a soul , " the panel member said .
" All those latter - day nuclear bomb tests were n't really tests – the science was proven .
They were the strategic use of the most deadly weapons ever invented to impress and give pause to a sworn enemy who might be considering an attack .
" The amazing thing was it worked brilliantly .
Nuclear deterrence was the most successful enforcer of peace between superpowers in the history of mankind . "
The source cited " taggants " – invisible bio-organisms that are painted on a small part of a structure , grow until they cover the entire building , and can be remotely triggered to illuminate and provide a homing signal for bombers or missiles – as an example of an " ethically neutral " JNLWD project .
" Paint a taggant on an oil - storage tank and it's a non-lethal weapon , " the panel member said .
" Paint it on a munitions factory and it's a lethal weapon . "
A survey of a few JNLWD projects makes clear the difficulty of classifying non-lethal weapons technologies .
Item : calmatives , better known as psychotropic , central nervous system depressants or , more simply , downers .
The JNLWD is studying their use – including such substances as fentanyls ( an ultra - potent , heroin - like synthetic ) and rohypnol , aka " roofies , " the so - called date - rape drug – as crowd - control mechanisms .
Opponents say the use of all such drugs is banned by the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention .
The Sunshine Project claims the JNLWD has an " advanced development program for long - range delivery devices for ( such ) chemicals , in particular a ' non- lethal ' 81 mm mortar round with a range of 2.5 kilometers which is designed to work in standard - issue U.S. military weapons ( like ) M252 mortar . "
The anti-bioweapons group also accuses the JNLWD of considering the use of the sedative Precedex , which increases a patient 's sensitivity to electroshock , as an instrument of torture .
Item : active - denial weapons ( ADWs ) , which fire wide - angle 95 gigahertz electromagnetic waves that heat water molecules in the outer skin and cause debilitating pain .
Critics contend ADWs target innocent bystanders as well as enemies , and say the temptation to crank up the power to " kill " level may prove irresistible .
Item : genetically engineered anti-material agents ( GAMAs ) , man -made micro-organisms that eat things like concrete , metal , asphalt , paint and plastic .
GAMAs could theoretically be used to slowly and stealthily destroy military airstrips – or create World Trade Center - magnitude disasters .
Opponents say GAMAs violate a Geneva Protocol , ratified by Congress in 1975 , prohibiting bacteriological weapons .
Proponents say non-lethal bioengineered substances are exempt .
Item : veiling - glare lasers .
Researchers hope wide - angle laser beams in the violet to ultraviolet spectrum will blind enemies by making their eyes fluoresce , that is , glow .
The JNLWD says temporarily blinding enemies is legal under a 1996 Geneva Convention vision - weapon protocol .
Critics say such weapons could cause permanent eye damage , making them illegal .

U.S. Military Uses the Force
U.S. vs. Them : Fresh Perspectives
By Patrick Jackson and Olivia Macleod
BBC News
The phone camera footage of Saddam Hussein 's execution may prove to be the most controversial media disclosure from Iraq since snapshots of US guards abusing prisoners inside Abu Ghraib were published in 2004 .
Mobiles have become part of life for many Iraqis in just a few years
While those pictures were revealed in the US media , the Saddam video appears to have been a purely Iraqi affair .
As foreign news organisations downloaded it from the internet , it was already being swapped among ordinary Iraqis on their mobile phones .
The Iraqi government 's own , edited version , was undermined by the ugly audio of the shouted sectarian Shia slogans .
The mobile phone , that symbol of freedom and independence , had come into its own in Iraq in the most dramatic way .
Alarming images
For many outsiders , one of the most graphic horrors of the Iraqi conflict has been the posting of beheading videos on the internet but , within the country , interactive communications rest on the phone , not the web .
COMMUNICATIONS IN IRAQ Population : 26.5 million
Land and mobile phone lines today : 4.6 m today Land lines in 2003 : 1.2 m
Part of population with internet access : 0.1 % Sources : USaid , Internet World Stats
Just 0.1 % of a population of nearly 27 million has web access , according to a 2006 estimate published by Internet World Stats .
By contrast , neighbouring Iran has about 100 times as many , it says .
Meanwhile , websites like YouTube and Ogrish.com positively teem with clips posted by US soldiers of their service in Iraq .
Officially , the US military confines its monitoring to scouring blogs for factual inaccuracies but there is also concern about some of the videos and stills appearing , a US military public affairs officer in Iraq told the BBC last year .
Such material , he said , might be used by America 's enemies to portray US soldiers as " barbaric warmongers " .
It appears that Iraq 's government was similarly concerned about how the execution of Saddam would be portrayed .
" Before we went into the room we had an agreement that no - one should bring a mobile phone , " Sami al - Askari , an adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki , said afterwards .
Execution for sale
Phones are what Iraqis now have in relative abundance : since the 2003 invasion , the number of handsets has gone from 1.2 m land lines to 4.6 m land and mobile lines , according to the US government .
This is not something that governments are likely to prevent unless they have great experience
Anthony Cordesman
US strategy analyst
Pentagon keeps eye on war videos
" The new handsets are reliable and widely affordable , " Amer al - Harky , a 25 - year - old doctor in the Iraqi Kurdish city of Irbil , told the BBC News website .
After the February 2006 attack on the Shia shrine in Samarra , staff at the BBC bureau in Baghdad noted a surge in gory video of the conflict being swapped between mobile phones .
One clip , for instance , showed what appeared to be Shia gunmen killing a Sunni man .
HAVE YOUR SAY
They should n't have done the execution in this manner .
They should have done it with full respect
Reza , Shiraz , Iran
Send us your comments
And for those without a mobile , video of Iraq 's death squads and their victims is available to buy on DVD .
" The DVDs are not openly on sale but you can go to certain shops and buy these things for less than one US dollar , " says Dr Harky .
Simon Henderson of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , who has written a biography of Saddam , recalls that " horrific " footage of political suspects being tortured under Saddam 's rule was sold on tapes or DVDs in the streets after he was overthrown .
' Inexperience '
Given the interest in Saddam 's own execution , how could the Iraqi authorities and their US allies have allowed a camera to enter the gallows room along with the official one ?
A secret camera was used at an execution in the US in 1928
US - based media analyst Danny Schechter , who describes the execution as a " colonial hanging " , believes it was a " unique example of a total screw - up " , coming after what he describes as a long procession of miscalculations by the Iraqi and US authorities .
Its handling , he said , showed a refusal to listen to advice and a willingness to risk sectarian violence in Iraq .
However , concealed cameras at executions are nothing new , US strategy analyst Anthony Cordesman of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies says .
" This is not something that governments are likely to prevent unless they have great experience and certainly this government obviously didn't , " he told the BBC News website , recalling how a US reporter secretly photographed an execution in 1928 with a camera strapped to his ankle .
Mr Cordesman points out that the execution had to be conducted at short notice in a way where it " could not become the subject of terrorism , there could n't be rescue attempts and witnesses had to be rushed in with very little preparation " .
" This is wartime , it is a situation where the Iraqi government is in considerable disarray and you are operating in a region where Western standards , to put it mildly , do n't apply , " he says .
Simon Henderson suggests that the desire of some Iraqis to see footage of Saddam 's execution owes much to the brutalisation of society under his rule .
This , after all , was a man who used to take his own sons Uday and Qusay to witness torture sessions .

Woodstock It 's All In The Price .
You 'll Be Instantly Floored !
Prices can vary enormously and start at under $ 2.00 S / F but can go up to more than $ 8.00 S/F .
As the price is often a deciding factor when buying a floor it will be better if you first work out how much you are willing to spend before going on to choose the exact type of bamboo floor for you .
To get a better idea of what you can buy for the price , you may want to visit some merchants ( see below ) to see exactly what is available in each price range .
Bamboo floors are most commonly available in the following price ranges .
Under $ 2.00 S/F
$ 2.00 - $ 2.99 S / F
$ 3.00 - $ 3.99 S / F
$ 4.00 S/ F and above Do bear in mind that pricing of flooring at the cheaper end of the scale is often determined by which UV coating is used to finish the floor .
If the particular flooring that you have chosen has been finished with Klumpp lacquer , you can be sure that you have an extremely hard wearing Super Aluminum Oxide finish that is certified to be very low in , or free of , dangerous & toxic substances .
You will also find that a bamboo floor with a Klumpp coating is usually provided with a longer warranty than one that has been coated with an inferior brand .
Quite simply , Klumpp is the industry standard and is therefore much favored by reputable bamboo floor manufacturers that are seeking to provide their customers with outstanding flooring products that will stand the test of time .
Hand Scraped bamboo flooring will also attract a higher price due to the manual manpower that has gone into its manufacture .
Its limited availability also keeps its price above that of the more widely available types .
An advantage is it 's uniqueness , which is something you 'll find hard to beat and therefore makes it worth considering if you are looking for something a little different to a standard bamboo floor .
Up and Down , Left to Right .
Will It Be Horizontal or Vertical Flooring ?
Next you will need to decide whether you want to buy horizontal or vertical grain flooring .
Not sure what the difference is ?
This refers to the way the individual bamboo slats are laminated together .
With horizontal , the pieces are arranged and laminated side by side flatways .
With the vertical type the slats are stood upright on edge and then laminated .
Here are some examples , as you can see , the look varies considerably for each of them .
Horizontal Vertical
The choice is yours !
The one that you buy will simply come down to personal preference , this is because in most of the individual price groups there will be little or no price difference between the horizontal or vertical types .
Sink , Swim ... or Float ?
Consider Your Options
Another very important consideration will be the type of installation required for the flooring , and whether or not you will be installing the floor yourself will be a big deciding factor in this regard .
Many Do-It - Yourselfers will choose a floating floor as they are usually straightforward snap / click together , prefinished , types that simply sit on top of an existing floor that has been suitably prepared and leveled .
Those wanting more control over the installation might want to choose a nail , staple or glue down floor .
You may have more options with these with regard to the finish on them , as some will be pre-finished , whereas others are unfinished and will therefore require on site finishing during installation .
Do bear in mind though that installation of the latter type is a highly complex task that should only be carried out by a professional fitter .
The main options that you have available are listed below : Floating
Nail / Staple
Glue Additional options : Prefinished
Unfinished Paint The Town ' Cognac ' Red Finally , you will want to choose which color or shade of bamboo flooring you want to buy .
This should be easy and is probably something that you 've already given some thought to .
Here are some things to bear in mind :
Your own color preferences
The color theme of the room in which the floor will be installed
How much traffic the floor will have ( a heavily used floor may be more easily marked , therefore a darker floor color may be preferable to a lighter one )
What color options are available
These are just a few of the magnificent color options currently being offered by bamboo flooring manufacturers : Burnt Mocha Carbonized Medium Gunstock Irish Moss Natural medium Red Cognac Images Courtesy of iFloor
So there you have it , you are almost there .
We hope that our tips have helped take you a step closer to purchasing a bamboo floor that is right for you .

RMN is an RA production .
L - O-S- E- R. Boston resident Stephen Dunne has asked a federal court to dismiss his ridiculous lawsuit that claimed his religious rights were violated when he was presented with a question on same - sex marriage .
His 268.866 score on the November 2006 bar just missed the passing score of 270 points .
This is the question that offended Mr. Dunne :
“ Yesterday , Jane got drunk and hit ( her spouse ) Mary with a baseball bat , breaking Mary ’s leg , when she learned that Mary was having an affair with Lisa .
As a result , Mary decided to end her marriage with Jane in order to live in her house with ( children ) Philip ( and ) Charles and Lisa .
What are the rights of Mary and Jane ? ”
In July I blogged about this suit , after Dunne launched a website , christianlawsuit.com ( it only goes to his dismissal document now ) , he put up a batsh*t insane statement :
My dream is to become a Lawyer , but I cannot defile my Christian faith simply to pass an examination .
I will not pay the price that the Defendants are forcing me to pay in order to practice law in Massachusetts .
There is no price tag on my faith .
It is not for sale .
He also modestly proclaimed :
I am challenging the constitutionality of Homosexual Marriage and Homosexual Parenting in Massachusetts .
In 2003 , four unelected judges legalized Homosexual Marriage in Goodridge v. Dept. of Public Health , 798 N.E. 2d 941 ( Mass. 2003 ) .
I sincerely believe that this ruling is profoundly undemocratic and un-American .
I have preemptively fired the first shot that has been heard around the world .
Uh , not really .
A question of this nature was not included in the most recent bar exam , so Dunne tries to claim victory much in the same way the American Family Association ’s Don Wildmon likes to think Ford is being hurt by his fundie boycott :
In court documents , Dunne said he wanted to drop his suit because the July bar exam did n’t include what he called the “ patently offensive and morally repugnant ” gay marriage question .
He characterized that as a “ corrective action ” by the board .
In a move to quickly smack down that assertion …
The complete archive of renowned American science - fiction writer Robert Heinlein will be made available online , thanks to an unusual partnership of the University of California - Santa Cruz and the Heinlein Prize Trust .
Heinlein , who lived in Santa Cruz for two decades , was one of the grand masters of science fiction .
He became a pop icon in the 1960s with the publication of “ Stranger In A Strange Land , ” one of the most successful science - fiction novels ever published .
He died in 1988 .
The entire contents of the Robert A. and Virginia Heinlein Archive – housed in the UC - Santa Cruz Library ’s Special Collections since 1968 – have been scanned in an effort to preserve the contents digitally while making the collection easily available to both academics and the general public .
The digitization project was the brainchild of Art Dula , director of the Heinlein Prize Trust .
The first collection released includes 106,000 pages , consisting of Heinlein ’s complete manuscripts – including files of all his published works , notes , research , early drafts and edits of manuscripts .
The documents offer a window into Heinlein ’s creative process and provide background and context for his work .
Other collections soon to be added to the online archive will feature Robert and Virginia Heinlein ’s business and personal correspondence , scrapbooks , photo albums , and unpublished works , including communications with Heinlein ’s editor and agent .
First , let ’s get some administrative issues out of the way .
I will be using data from the Congressional Budget Office ’s historical data the Bureau of Economic Analysis , the St. Louis Federal Reserve and the National Bureau of Economic Research
Reagan was the first person to implement supply - side economic policy .
According to the NBER , the primary expansion under Reagan ’s leadership occurred between November 1982 ( the fourth quarter of 1982 ) and July 1990 ( the third quarter of 1990 ) .
According to the BEA , the median quarterly percentage change in GDP over this period was 3.85 % .
That ’s a very good number .
But let ’s look deeper into the numbers .
First , there was a mammoth explosion of government debt during this expansion .
Here ’s a chart from the St. Louis Federal Reserve of total government debt outstanding .
In other words , this was financed growth ; the US borrowed heavily to achieve this growth rate .
The primary reason for this explosion in debt is Reagan never balanced a budget ; he continued to increase government spending .
Here is a chart of federal revenues and expenditures from the St. Louis Federal Reserve .
Notice first the scale on the right side of the chart is lower than the left side of the chart .
Then notice that federal receipts were always lower than federal expenditures .
Let ’s now turn to receipts from personal income taxes .
According to the Congressional Budget Office ’s historical budget data , tax receipts from individuals totaled $ 297 billion in 1982 and $ 466.9 billion in 1990 .
That ’s an increase of 57.20 % .
Over the same period of time the GDP price deflator increased from 63.866 to 82.053 , or an increase of 28.476 % .
In other words , the increase of tax revenue from individuals really is n’t that impressive after adjusting for inflation .
Let ’s stop here and make a few observations .
1. ) The overall rate of growth was very good .
A 3.85 % median quarterly rate of GDP growth is a very good number .
2. ) But the economy was grown on credit .
And the rate of growth in total government debt was very high .
3. ) The high growth rate in total government debt outstanding was caused by a continuing increase in government spending at a rate higher than government revenues .
4. ) After adjusting for inflation , the growth in receipts in personal income taxes is n’t that impressive .
Let ’s fast - forward to Bush II
According to the National Bureau of Economic Research , the current expansion started in November 2001 .
Since then , the median rate of quarterly GDP growth in 2.7 % and the average ( mean ) is 2.74 % .
While this is n’t the most impressive median GDP growth number we could expect , it certainly is n’t the worst either .
This falls into the " fair " category .
But like Reagan , the expansion has been grown on credit .
Reference the total government debt outstanding chart from above and notice the upward trajectory the chart takes .
Here is a report from the Department of the Treasury of the total federal debt outstanding at the end of the last 6 federal fiscal years :
09/30/2006 8,506,973,899,215.23
09/30/2005 7,932,709,661,723.50
09/30/2004 7,379,052,696,330.32
09/30/2003 6,783,231,062,743.62
09/30/2002 6,228,235,965,597.16
09/30/2001 5,807,463,412,200.06
09/30/2000 5,674,178,209,886.86
The main problem is ( again ) that federal expenditures have far exceeded federal revenues .
Here is the chart of federal revenues and receipts from above .
Again notice the hard part of " supply - side " economics is cutting spending .
While cutting taxes is easy , cutting spending is hard .
Let ’s look at tax revenues to see how they have responded .
First , remember that Bush first cut taxes in 2001 and again in 2003 .
So let ’s go back to the first tax cut to see what happened from that point forward .
According to the Congressional Budget Office ’s Historical Budget Data , total revenue from individual taxpayers was $ 994 billion in 2001 and $ 1.043 trillion in 2006 .
Since the fourth quarter of 2001 , the GDP price deflator has increased from 103.1221 to 117.003 ( this was the price deflator in the third quarter of 2006 when the federal government ’s fiscal year ends ) .
This is an overall increase of 13.46 % .
In short , after adjusting for inflation , the overall increase in tax revenues from 2001 when the first tax cutting began is nothing to write home about .
Republican commentators usually start their analysis from 2003 .
First , note the tax revenues decreased from $ 994 billion in 2001 to $ 793.7 billion in 2003 .
This is hardly the result the Republicans predicted for the 2001 tax cuts .
However tax revenues increased from $ 793.7 billion in the 2003 to 1.043.9 trillion in 2006 .
This is an increase of 31.52 % .
The GDP price deflator in the third quarter of 2003 was 106.616 and was 117.003 in the third quarter of 2006 , or an increase of 9.74 % .
So using 2003 as the starting point we can see that total tax revenues have increased , but again not as impressively as Republican pundits like to think .
Notice we can draw the same conclusions for Bush II that we can for Reagan :
5. ) The overall rate of growth was fair .
A 2.7 % median quarterly rate of GDP growth is decent , but not great ..
6. ) But the economy was grown on credit .
And the rate of growth in total government debt was very high .
7. ) The high growth rate in total government debt outstanding was caused by a continuing increase in government spending at a rate higher than government revenues .
8. ) After adjusting for inflation , the growth in receipts in personal income taxes is n’t that impressive .
First , let ’s note the growth in tax revenues from individuals after adjusting for inflation is good , but not the result the Republican commentators promised .
In addition , look at the CBO historical budget tables for other expansion and you ’ll see tax revenues grew at similar or higher rates during economic expansions .
This leads to the conclusion that growing individual tax revenues is as much a function of overall economic growth as it is of overall tax rates .
Secondly , while I would agree that cutting marginal tax rates from a high level to a lower level is probably going to be stimulate the economy , smaller cuts clearly are n’t the amazing panacea the Republicans advertise them to be .
As an example , I do think that Kennedy ’s cuts were clearly a cause for the 1960s economic expansion .
But arguing that a small cut from 40 % to 37 % is the greatest thing since sliced bread is overselling the idea .
At this point we get into a discussion about the underlying policy about the appropriate use of government debt : when to use it , how much to use when we use it and when to pay it down .
The bottom line is economic growth from the last two great supply - side experiments has been financed by using government debt .
Neither Reagan nor Bush meaningfully cut government spending , largely because that ’s the hard part of supply - side economics .
Both used government debt to finance the shortfalls between government spending and revenue .
None of this debt has been paid - off , and probably wo n’t be in our lifetime .
Regarding government debt , I would argue the following .
Government debt should be used sparingly .
In times of an economic slowdown deficit spending is warranted to mitigate the negative effect of a slowing economy .
But when the economy is doing well , the government should work to pay - off its debt .
This will allow the government to engage in deficit spending when the next recession happens .
This overall idea is hard politically , which is why it ’s probably not done .
In essence , the US is faced with a policy decision -- how to finance growth .
Do we pay as we go , or pawn off the cost of growth on future generations ?
I would argue that paying as we go does not propose a radical or anti-growth situation because the 1990s demonstrated that increasing taxes on upper - income taxpayers dies not thwart growth .
In addition , we balanced budgets in the 1990s and it did not thwart growth .
In short , paying for growth as we go is the sane and sensible answer .
And it's one the Democrats need to embrace .

[ Are the Rich Necessary ?
Great Economic Arguments and How They Reflect Our Personal Values .
By Hunter Lewis .
Axios Press , 2007 . Viii + 277 pgs. ]
Hunter Lewis 's excellent book differs from nearly all other books on economics .
Most books defend a particular point of view : a work by Duncan Foley , e.g. , will be much more favorable to Marxism than one by Ludwig von Mises .
Lewis instead presents the arguments both for and against the free market , allowing readers to judge for themselves .
Why does he do this ?
Not because he has no point of view of his own .
Judging by the way he presents the arguments , I strongly suspect that he favors the free market ; and at the end of the book , he does offer some policy suggestions .
But he thinks that judgments about economic policy rest on premises about values that can not be fully reconciled .
We cannot escape the problem these conflicting value judgments pose by throwing some of them overboard .
They all have merit :
Indeed , I [ Lewis ] believe that if we take the trouble to look beneath the surface of clashing economic ideas , we will generally find ideals on all sides that are inspiring , and others that are at least worthy of respect .
( p. 12 )
As we shall see , Lewis has a creative proposal that he hopes will elicit agreement from proponents of the major value perspectives .
But the battle over the free market occupies most of the book .
As Lewis points out , a common attack on the free market indicts the rich as parasites .
Is it not grossly unfair , e.g. , that Bill Gates has billions of dollars , far in excess of what he needs to lead a life of luxury , while others must struggle for a pittance ?
Precisely the excess that the opponents of the market protest against is a principal point in favor of the market .
People wish to have more and better goods , and this goal can only be attained through investment on a massive scale .
Investment , in turn , requires savings , and only the rich can save the large amounts needed :
The poor cannot be expected to save , because they need every dollar for basic needs such as food and shelter .
Middle class people will save something for emergencies , children 's education , or old age .
But they have many immediate needs and desires , and in any case their savings will eventually be consumed , especially after retirement .
The rich , however , are different .
They have so much money that , in aggregate , they simply cannot spend it all .
They are , in effect , forced to save .
( p. 20 )
The rich then , are necessary , at least if we want a prosperous society .
But must one not say , on the other side , that the vast profits that some people get in a capitalist economy make goods more expensive for the poor ?
If profits were curtailed , would this not lower prices ?
Lewis notes in rebuttal that profit and loss guide producers to meet the demands of consumers .
If a business makes a large profit , this indicates that consumers want more of the product , and entrepreneurs will shift resources to satisfy this demand .
Losses indicate the contrary , and resources shift away from items that generate them .
But does this response answer the objection ?
Even if profits are indispensable signals for the market , do they not result in high prices that gouge the poor ?
Lewis quotes an unexpected witness to the contrary .
In the Communist Manifesto , Marx pointed out that capitalism conquers through low prices :
The cheap prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with which [ the profit system ] … compels all nations , on pain of extinction , to adopt the [ profit ] mode of production .
( p. 50 , quoting the Manifesto )
Even if profits are essential , though , why must they go to owners of firms ?
Why cannot workers manage their own affairs , retaining profits for themselves ?
Of course , in a market system , workers are free to organize firms in this way if they wish , but the objection rests on a false premise .
In speaking of workers retaining profits , the objection ignores a fact that we have already discussed .
Growth in a free economy depends on savings and investment .
In a growing economy , the bulk of profits must be reinvested .
The presupposition of the objection is that workers who owned a firm themselves would have the profits to spend , but this would derail growth .
Most importantly , if employees owned the entire economy , saving would plummet .
As we have seen , it is the special role of the rich to be forced to save and invest — they alone have more than they can possibly spend .
( p. 58 )
Suppose , though , that one grants this part of the case for the free market .
Can one still not object that this system subordinates the workers of one country to the vagaries of the world market ?
Workers are driven out of their jobs by competition from foreign firms that pay low wages .
Here once more the objection to the market fails .
Ricardo's law of comparative advantage long ago showed that free trade increases total wealth .
Specialization increases the total wealth of the countries that trade ; and , Lewis adds with great insight , this applies to jobs as well .
These principles [ of comparative advantage ] are well established for the import or export of goods .
It is not as widely recognized that they are just as relevant for the " outsourcing " of service jobs over the internet or telephone lines .
The savings achieved by importing electronic services has enabled many companies to prosper , where they otherwise might have stagnated or failed , and thus to hire more employees rather than fewer .
( p. 92 )
As often happens , misguided efforts to help the poor worsen their condition .
Tariffs make goods more expensive for them , and even Paul Krugman , hardly known for undue partiality to the free market , recognizes the value of free trade for the poor : " [ Opponents of global free trade ] , whatever their intentions , are doing their best to make the poor even poorer " ( p. 97 , quoting Krugman ) .
Faced with the undoubted benefits of the market , few today call for its outright abolition .
Rather , opponents of the market contend that it must be restrained and guided by a beneficent government .
In arguing in this way , though , do they not rely on a very questionable assumption ?
They believe , without justification , that government officials act to benefit the public .
The primary charge against government is that it is predatory , a devourer of society 's capital .
But predation is not the whole story .
More often than not , government is also corrupt .
Moreover , the opportunities for corruption multiply the more deeply government gets into the economy .
( p. 152 )
But even if government is in most cases corrupt , must we not rely on it in emergencies ?
Suppose the economy plunges into depression .
Surely the government needs to intervene in order to revive the economy .
Lewis answers , to the contrary , that the government will do best by following a " hands - off " policy :
Before the 1930s , and the advent of an activist government , there were depressions to be sure , but they were brief …
This was in sharp contrast to the Great Depression of the thirties , when falling prices were combated and wages kept artificially high by both the Hoover and Roosevelt administrations .
As a direct result , unemployment kept deepening and depression lingered on amidst terrible human suffering .
( p. 75 )
Lewis 's penetrating argument can be strengthened even more by asking , how do depressions arise ?
Mises , Hayek , and Rothbard have to my mind convincingly shown that government policy , not the market , bears full responsibility .
Expansion of bank credit drives the market rate of interest below the natural rate , generating an artificial boom that must eventually collapse .
Lewis does not discuss the origins of the Great Depression , but he offers a comprehensive indictment of central banking policy .
In the United States , the Federal Reserve System is supposed to stabilize the economy ; but the economy was more stable before the system was established than afterwards .
Free - market economists do not all agree about how past economic contractions occurred .
But all agreed with [ Milton ]
Friedman 's assertion that " The stock of money , prices and output was decidedly more unstable after the establishment of the Reserve System than before . " ( p. 173 )
Supporters of the present order will no doubt say that despite past errors of the Fed , we now know better how to manage things .
As Lewis notes , the monetary expansion pursued by Alan Greenspan during his long tenure as Chairman of the Fed hardly inspires confidence that this is so .
Lewis once more shows his skill at summoning an unexpected witness for his case .
Alexander Hamilton strongly favored a national bank , but even he drew the line at paper money :
The emitting of paper money by the authority of Government is wisely prohibited …
The stamping of paper is an operation so much easier than the laying of taxes , that a government , in the practice of paper emissions , would rarely fail … to indulge itself … even to [ the point of creating ] an absolute bubble .
( pp. 185 –86 , quoting Hamilton . )
Lewis 's presentation of the arguments leaves us in a quandary .
If the case for the free market is so strong , why do so many oppose it ?
For Lewis , as mentioned earlier , the explanation lies in conflicting values .
Lewis distinguishes four value systems : fraternalism , reciprocalism , equalitarianism , and philanthropism .
He characterizes each of these insightfully , but for our purposes the essential point is this :
Some people think that a morality of individual responsibility , characteristic of a free market , is inadequate .
People ought to be charitable , acting for the motive of benefiting the unfortunate .
Even if the market helps the poor , this is merely an unintended consequence of people 's actions .
Lewis does not take sides on these various values , though one gathers that he thinks philanthropism has a good deal to be said for it .
He suggests a way in which the various values can be partially reconciled , thus avoiding the need to choose one system and reject the others .
He wishes to expand the non-profit sector of the economy , which now " represents about 8 % of the U.S. economy , and considerably less elsewhere . " ( p. 209 ) .
In particular , he proposes that private organizations take over as much as possible of the welfare activities of the government .
To achieve this aim , Lewis suggests that donors to charity be able to deduct the full amount of their contribution from taxes :
This would leave the taxpayer with a simple choice ; would I prefer my money to go to the government or to charity , since a credit would mean that the government is bearing the full cost .
( p. 211 )
Readers interested in further elaborations of the plan can consult the book , but the basic idea seems to be one of great importance .
Often , supporters of a complete free market must face the objection that , without government welfare , some people could not survive .
The standard reply to this is that , in a free market , private charity would attend to these people .
Lewis 's ingenious idea gives us a way gradually to approach a fully private system .
TurboGears and Pylons are two popular web frameworks ; TurboGears hit the scene about a year and a half ago , Pylons started picking up steam maybe six months ago .
They are both modern MVC frameworks , targeting a similar style of development .
Here 's a description of the technical differences :
You 'll note there 's not a lot of high level philosophical differences .
And I do n't think I glossed over that -- they just are n't there .
The details of their differences are very ... detailed .
Very technical , very specific , often not particularly intentional .
I 'd have a hard time describing the technical differences in a meaningful way to someone who did n't already know something about Python web development .
As communities the two frameworks are fairly similar .
They both borrow heavily from existing projects , and have spawned projects in their own right .
Technically not everything is the same , but the question would be : what are the essential differences , and which differences are just incidental ?
For instance , TurboGears is probably easier for a newbie to start with , but it 's not because Pylons does n't want to be easier to start with , there simply has n't been as much investment in that .
And TurboGears has less WSGI support inside the framework , which is not because they do n't want to support WSGI in that way , again the investment simply has n't been made .
Actually " merging " the two is probably unlikely .
It 's the kind of weird political maneuver that open source projects do n't really do , unless they are part of weird " foundations " and have " managers " and stuff like that -- it 's too much politics for programmers , and reeks of strategy and plans .
You are n't supposed to announce plans for your software , you are supposed to implement your plans and then announce them .
If a merge happens , it should be more like a realization than a strategy .
I can also imagine the two bleeding into one another -- where one uses Genshi , the other Mako , one uses object publishing , the other Routes , etc .
The differences could become much more shallow .
That itself could become difficult -- the differences might be shallow , but the effect on documentation is not much better than if they were two completely different frameworks .
And do people float around between communities , or in some middleground , or subscribe to all the lists or ... what ?
Maybe at least by partitioning the communities it can help keep the newbies sufficiently diluted among the experienced users .
Technically the biggest difference is definitely CherryPy vs. Paste .
This is something of a sensitive point and has been the source of some discord .
The templating language differences are fairly shallow , since both are fairly agnostic anyway .
The Javascript differences are n't heavy with intention , they are more coincidental than anything .
So ... what should be done ?
Plans are being made for TurboGears post - 1.0 through version 2 .
The younger Pylons is still a blank slate in many areas .
At the moment several people have feet in both communities .
Push hard right now , when plans are being made ?
Let things develop naturally ?
( Of course , these are people making these decisions , so " natural " should still include discussion -- it 's not like we 're decided whether to transplant a hydrangea . )
Discuss !
Yesterday the Petitioners in the Al Odah case submitted their brief to the Supreme Court .
At issue in the case is whether detainees at Guantanamo Bay have constitutionally protected rights to habeas corpus and due process .
In February , the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals held that the elimination of habeas corpus rights for Guantanamo detainees under the Military Commissions
Act did not violate the Suspension Clause of the Constitution because that clause does not apply to aliens held outside of U.S. sovereign territory .
The Supreme Court originally refused to hear the case , but in a highly unusual move , it later reversed itself and granted cert .
The case , which seems likely to produce a historically significant opinion one way or the other , is scheduled for oral argument in December .
I 've read through the brief submitted on behalf of the detainees ( full text here ) , and it 's quite compelling .
I do n't think the D.C. Circuit 's bright - line holding that the Suspension Clause does n't apply to foreigners held outside of U.S. sovereign territory is likely to hold up .
It flies in the face of the Supreme Court 's Rasul decision and it's just too rigid a rule , particularly if you 're going to define Guantanamo Bay - - a place that has long been under U.S. control and subject to U.S. law -- as being outside of U.S. sovereign territory ( as the brief notes , even the iguanas at Guantanamo are protected by U.S. law ) .
Plus , if the Supreme Court agreed with the D.C. Circuit on this technical point , I find it hard to understand why they would have reversed themselves and agreed to hear the case .
So if we assume that the Suspension Clause does apply to detainees at Guantanamo , the question then becomes : has Congress either validly suspended habeas or provided an " adequate and effective " substitute for it ?
Under the terms of the Suspension Clause , Congress is only allowed to suspend habeas corpus in cases of " rebellion and invasion " -- which is pretty clearly not the case here .
So the ultimate issue is whether the Combatant Status Review Tribunals established by the President and ratified by Congress are an adequate and effective substitute for habeas under the holding of Swain v. Pressley , 430 U.S. 372 , 382 ( 1977 ) ( " [ T ] he substitution of a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor ineffective to test the legality of a person 's detention does not constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus . " ) .
And this is where the Petitioners ' brief is particularly compelling .
The Combatant Status Review Tribunal ( CSRT ) process is supposed to afford detainees the opportunity to meaningfully challenge their designation as enemy combatants , which is the sole legal basis for their detention .
The government contends that that CSRT hearings are an adequate and effective substitute for habeas corpus , but as the Petitioner 's brief makes abundantly clear , they are anything but .
Here 's one example of how the process works :
Abdullah Al Kandari was designated an enemy combatant principally because , more than a year after he was brought to Guantanamo and more than a year after this suit was brought , an " alias " of his name was allegedly found on a list of names on a document saved on a computer hard drive allegedly " associated with a senior al Qaeda member . "
S.A. 1360 .
Mr. Al Kandari stated that he is not known by any alias , and asked what name appeared on the list .
He was not allowed to know ; the information was classified .
J.A. 68 .
The name of the " senior al Qaeda member " was likewise classified , as was the place where the hard drive was found .
Mr. Al Kandari was thus left to defend himself against the accusation that an unknown alias of his appeared on a list on a computer found somewhere in the world associated with someone .
It is impossible to rebut such a charge , and Mr. Al Kandari said so : " The problem is the secret information , I can't defend myself . "
Id .
And how about the assistance of counsel ?
Not only were the detainees not informed of the key accusations against them , they were also not allowed lawyers , something they would clearly be entitled to in habeas .
And they were denied counsel even though each of the petitioners was already represented by counsel in these habeas cases when their CSRTs took place .
Instead of a lawyer , the detainees were assigned a “ personal representative ” who was instructed to tell the detainee : “ I am neither a lawyer nor your advocate , but have been given the responsibility of assisting your preparation for the hearing .
None of the information you provide me shall be held in confidence and I may be obligated to divulge it at the hearing . " . . .
Assistance of counsel was particularly important here because the detainees were isolated at Guantanamo with virtually no ability to communicate with the outside world .
In these circumstances , assistance of counsel was essential to test the allegations and gather evidence to disprove them .
For instance , one of the principal reasons for detaining Murat Kurnaz as an enemy combatant was that he was a friend of Selcuk Bilgin , who was “ alleged to have been a suicide bomber . ”
App. 107 . Detained at Guantanamo , without counsel or access to the outside world , Mr. Kurnaz could only express shock at that allegation .
He did not know and could not find out that that his friend , Mr. Bilgin , far from being a suicide bomber , was alive and well and living peacefully and without criminal suspicion in their hometown of Bremen , Germany .
That is something his counsel could have found out and proved in short order , had he been allowed counsel .
Because he was not , the allegation that his friend was a suicide bomber was accepted by the CSRT as true , as it would be on review under the DTA , even though it was objectively false .
Thus , even when the detainees were informed of the accusations against them , without the assistance of counsel , they were deprived of a meaningful opportunity to rebut the accusations and to develop and present the evidence needed to establish their innocence .
Victims of mistaken identity – a serious risk in this unconventional conflict , see Hamdi v. Rumsfeld , 542 U.S. 507 , 529 ( 2004 ) ( plurality opinion ) – also were helpless without the assistance of counsel at their CSRT hearings .
For example , one detainee was seized from his home by Pakistani officers , shipped to Guantanamo and accused at his CSRT of being Abdur Rahman Zahid , a former Taliban deputy foreign minister .
The detainee protested that his name is Abdur Sayed Rahman , not Abdur Rahman Zahid , and that “ I am only a chicken farmer in Pakistan . ”
Pleading the obvious , however , Mr. Rahman stated : “ I have no proof because I am here at Guantanamo . ”
Id .
Unfortunately for Mr. Rahman , his counsel would be precluded now by the narrow review provisions of the DTA from presenting evidence of his client ’s true identity to the court ; a preclusion unimaginable under habeas review .
And what sort of evidence can the government use ?
As Judges Rogers and Green both pointed out , the CSRT procedures allow continued detentions to be justified on the basis of evidence resulting from torture -- something that would clearly be prohibited in habeas proceedings and which the common law " has regarded . . . abhorrence for over 500 years . "
A. v. Sec'y of State [ 2006 ] 2 A.C. 221 , 51 ( H.L. ) ( appeal taken from Eng. ) ( Bingham , L. ) .
Judge Green described the case of Mamdouh Habib , who alleged that he had been sent by the United States to Egypt for interrogation where he was subjected to severe beatings , locked in handcuffs in a room that gradually filled with water to a level just below his chin as he stood for hours on the tips of his toes , and that he was suspended from a wall with his feet resting on an electrified cylindrical drum .
Mr. Habib alleged that , while undergoing this treatment , he admitted to doing many things he had never done .
App. 112-13 .
Without resolving the accuracy of Mr. Habib ’s allegations , the CSRT relied on the statements that he made while in Egypt and concluded that he was an enemy combatant .
App. 111-13 .
Interrogation techniques officially approved for use at Guantanamo included isolation for up to thirty days ; twenty - hour interrogations ; extreme and prolonged stress positions ; sleep deprivation ; sensory assault ; deprivation of clothing ; hooding ; and use of dogs .
Judge Green , in her opinion , refers to a number of cases of alleged abuse there and quotes from a memorandum by an FBI agent , produced in response to a Freedom of Information
Act request , summarizing his observations of interrogation methods used at Guantanamo :
On a couple of occassions [ sic ] , I entered interview rooms to find a detainee chained hand and foot in a fetal position to the floor , with no chair , food , or water .
Most times they had urinated or defacated [ sic ] on themselves , and had been left there for 18 - 24 hours or more .
On one occassion [ sic ] , the air conditioning had been turned down so far and the temperature was so cold in the room , that the barefooted detainee was shaking with cold .
When I asked the MP ’s what was going on , I was told that interrogators from the day prior had ordered this treatment , and the detainee was not to be moved .
On another occassion [ sic ] , the A/C had been turned off , making the temperature in the unventilated room probably well over 100 degrees .
The detainee was almost unconcious [ sic ] on the floor , with a pile of hair next to him .
He had apparently been literally pulling his own hair out throughout the night .
On another occassion [ sic ] , not only was the temperature unbearably hot , but extremely loud rap music was being played in the room , and had been since the day before , with the detainee chained hand and foot in the fetal position on the tile floor .
Although the new statutory rules require CSRTs to determine , to the extent practicable , whether statements were the result of coercion , they do not require that such evidence be disregarded .
This is justice Guantanamo style .
This is the process that the government contends is the functional equivalent of habeus corpus .
It 's a joke .
The question is whether the Supreme Court will have the courage to say so .

When TorrentFreak reported that Media Defender ( MD ) was behind the video site MiiVi , they cast doubt on us .
Now , in what is surely the biggest BitTorrent leak ever , nearly 700 mb of MD 's emails have gone public .
When MD's Randy Saaf found out we rumbled MiiVi he said , " This is really fucked . "
This is too , but much more so .
When we reported in July that an Anti-Piracy Gang Launches their own Video Download Site to Trap People and that the company was called Media Defender and , as anyone who aims to be a credible news resource would , we checked and double checked our sources .
We said , with some confidence :
Media Defender , a notorious anti piracy gang working for the MPAA , RIAA and several independent media production companies , just launched their very own video upload service called “ miivi.com ” .
The sole purpose of the site is to trap people into uploading copyrighted material , and bust them for doing so .
However , in comments made to Ars technica , Media Defender ’s Randy Saaf chose to rubbish our claims , calling it an ‘ accidentally un-secured internal project ’ .
From the emails we cannot be sure that it ’s an entrapment site or that it is related to the MPAA ( perhaps it ’s a legit a P2P video client ? ) , but it does look suspicious .
Unfortunately for Media Defender – a company dedicated to mitigating the effects of internet leaks – they can do nothing about being the subject of the biggest BitTorrent leak of all time .
Over 700 mb of their own internal emails , dating back over 6 months have been leaked to the internet in what will be a devastating blow to the company .
Many are very recent , having September 2007 dates and the majority involve the most senior people in the company .
Apparently this is not the first time that a MediaDefender email leaked onto the Internet .
According to the .nfo file posted with the Mbox file the emails were obtained by a group called “ MediaDefender - Defenders ” .
It states : “ By releasing these emails we hope to secure the privacy and personal integrity of all peer - to - peer users .
The emails contains information about the various tactics and technical solutions for tracking p2p users , and disrupt p2 p services , ” and “ A special thanks to Jay Maris , for circumventing there entire email - security by forwarding all your emails to your gmail account ”
Note :
The mbox formatted file is circulating publicly on BitTorrent , completely unedited .
However , for publication here we have removed the username and password logins for Media Defender ’s servers , and replaced them with asterisks and avoided publishing emails of a personal nature , e.g pay negotiations etc .
We believe that the emails are the real deal and all the info posted here serves the public interest .
At first we could n’t believe that it was real , but after we scanned through the e-mails it became clear that it was indeed the real deal .
Hundreds of IPs and logins to their servers , lists of their decoy / entrapment trackers , decoy strategies , the effectiveness of their fake torrents ( in many cases with a breakdown of success , title specific ) , high and low priority sites , . torrent watchlists , information on their monitoring of competitors , pictures of their weekend trips and even the anti-piracy strategy for dealing with The Simpsons Movie leak :
# REMINDER : “ The Simpson ’s Movie ” premieres this Friday ( to Torrents ) .
* Decoy files are available in torrents MDfile server .
* Use Public Trackers for pre-Leak releases .
* Create two new trackers for this project .
o Ebert to inform Torrents of these new machines .
* Send a list of 5 release names from each torrent team member to Ebert .
* REMEMBER to input torrent file into interdiction if a real Leak is available this weekend .
It ’s impossible to sum up all the juicy details in one post as the amount of information is staggering , so as much as we ’d like to tell you about the custom Media Defender software ( called ProxyMaster ) included in the leak , we ’ll focus mainly on the MiiVi case .
Let ’s start off with their response to our story about MiiVi.com .

And the response from Randy Saaf himself .
This is really fucked .
Let ’s pull miivi offline .
Apparently our reports about MiiVi made them really paranoid .
They are worried that reporters will apply for jobs just to find out more about their secret project .
From Ben Grodsky , Media Defender Subject : care in interviewing Given all the recent Digg , SlashDot and derivative online articles about MD , be careful what you say in job interviews .
Specifically , I ’m concerned about giving any information BEYOND what ’s already on the mediadefender.com website .
I ’m worried about someone interviewing for a position just for the purpose of getting more info to post online .
For example , if anyone asks anything about MiiVi , just reiterate what Randy has said online ( it was an internal video project that we probably should have password protected ; we were in no way directed to , or working with , the MPAA on that project ; NO part of the project was a honeypot designed to trap downloaders ) .
Seemingly every last detail of the MiiVi preparations are laid bare for all to see , such as these attempts to deal with some unexpected content .
Interestingly , if MiiVi was only an internal operation , where on earth did this content come from ? :
From Ben Grodsky , Media Defender Dylan , I would n’t normally e-mail you directly about MiiVi stuff , because a lot of what I say about this is total crap ( so keep that in mind ) and Jay filters the crap from the important stuff for you .
Is there a way to add this hash / title to the porn filter explicitly ?
hash=30755326A4E4B28E678BFF8CB2AF5FC4A4FBF710&i=3
( the title is Celebrity deathmatch : Korn vs slipknot and the exact URL is http://129.47.9.160/zonie/media.php?hash=30755326A)
I just flagged it as Other Terms of Use violation .
It ’s a warthog ( or maybe it ’s a big bushy dog , I ca n’t tell ) having sex with a woman and NOT a Korn vs. Slipknot mash - up video .
If this is a big deal , do n’t worry about it for now .
And ,
If MiiVi was an internal project only , how does that sit with these attempts to generate lots of traffic ?
Dylan ,
Another thing we can do to increase Google and other search engine traffic is to get more link - ins .
At the next MiiVi meeting , I ’m going to ask Randy for permission to incentivize people to link - in a MiiVi video on their MySpace .
Colin is already doing this and it helps the word - of - mouth spread , even if the link - ins are nominal .
I ’m not sure what we could do in the link - in regard early on , but getting the cumulative ~1000 +
MySpace friends of MediaDefender employees to see MiiVi link - ins ca n’t hurt … .
Colin — start coming up with a list the list of keywords and descriptors for hidden metadata entries , per Dylan ’s e-mail below .
Thanks ,
Ben
One can only speculate what the MiiVi client might ’ve been capable of , should it have gotten off the ground :

Just about every aspect of the company ’s operations on every file sharing network is revealed in the emails , including their fake eDonkey server and Soulseek activities , not to mention payroll issues and discussions about what to eat for lunch .

Reply from : Colin Keller Vidorama would be my first choice ( though it is a bit 70 ’s , kind of like a bad video rental store ) .
Vidber does n’t spark much interest ( kind of ends too abruptly ) , and bivvid I ’m not really feeling .

Michael ,
When you get a chance , we would love you to start taking a look at www.viide.com.
That is the current home of our MiiVi site .
We have totally locked - down the site , while we improve the look and feel from the blogosphere saw .
Accordingly , to access the site you will need to login using the following login / password *****/**** ( we have also made a login / password for Bobby , in case you think we could use some help with our graphics :) — *****/*****).
Once you log on the site , surf over to www.viide.com/download.php to get our application .
The website currently acts a GUI for the application .
When we go live with the site for the general public , there will also be a java applet that also minimal / one - off type use of MiiVi ( but this feature is inaccessible with the current locked - down version of the site ) .

I ’m not sure if you guys are planning on going live with the Viide domain nameâ€¦ .
but in case you areâ€¦ .
you might want to remove all references of Miivi on the homepage of viide.com before it gets Googled or someone public comes across it .
For example , at the bottom under terms of service and on the HTML Title where it says “ MiiVi , Inc ” , and probably the default image of the skyscrapers ( which are the same as Miivi ) .
Also , the WHOIS information is still linked to MediaDefender , Inc. -TH
Yes , they need to get on top of the WHOIS situation before someone sees it .
After the MiiVi incident , we later reported that Media Defender owned the p2p.net domain name .
A little later , our claims were proven correct when they made the p2p.net domain link back to our own article , which it still does to this day .
We took this as a compliment and this is what the guys had to say about it :

now there ’s an article about the redirected p2p.net !
We admit it , it was quite funny at the time and proved that even anti-piracy guys have a sense of humor but sadly , it ’s doubtful that the comedy will extend through this latest episode , as it ’s expected that thousands of file - sharers will dissect and disseminate their commercially sensitive data into every corner of internet .
For a business model that gets its life - blood from piracy , in a twisted way this leak is likely to help generate even more business and develop the market .

Update : MediaDefender Phone Call and Gnutella Tracking Database Leaked
LEVITTOWN , N.Y . ( AP ) —
In 1951 , 7 - year - old Louise Cassano could n’t imagine a better life than the one here , where she rode her bicycle past rows of cookie - cutter houses , children had backyard campouts in makeshift tents and nobody locked their front doors .
“ It was an absolute ideal community , ” said Mrs. Cassano , whose love affair with Levittown never waned — she still lives in the Long Island town dubbed by some as America ’s first suburb .
Mrs. Cassano is among the organizers of a huge 60th birthday party for the Nassau County town , set for today and featuring high school bands , floats , local groups , war veterans and the fire department .
Nearly two dozen original Levittown homeowners will serve as grand marshals .
It was October 1947 when developer William Jaird Levitt opened the first of what became 17,544 Cape Cod and ranch houses rising from blighted potato fields 40 miles east of New York City , handing post - World War II GIs the keys to their American dream .
It was an instant success , a prototype widely chronicled and duplicated nationwide .
Cape Cods originally sold for $ 6,990 ; ranches were slightly more expensive .
Each house had four rooms , a bath , an unfinished attic and amenities — steel kitchen cabinets , Bendix washer , GE refrigerator , Hotpoint electric range .
None had basements , since excavations would have slowed the almost assembly - line construction .
Today , “ you ca n’t get a house in Levittown for less than $ 400,000 , ” Mrs. Cassano said .
Virtually all the original houses have been renovated , in some cases making the original structure nearly invisible .
“ It ’s to the point they ’re almost McMansions , ” said Polly Dwyer , president of the Levittown Historical Society .
Mr. Levitt initially prohibited blacks from joining the suburban exodus .
After Supreme Court rulings and the civil rights movement , minorities eventually were permitted to purchase homes , but Levittown remains a largely white community .
“ I think black people were hurt and offended by the blatant rejection , and simply when given the opportunity chose to go elsewhere , ” said Barbara Kelly , former director of the Long Island Studies Institute at Hofstra and author of “ Expanding the American Dream : Building and Rebuilding Levittown . ”
Levitt also built “ village greens ” that featured a grocery store , pharmacy and other shops — all within walking distance for women , since their husbands typically drove the family car to work .
Since those days of stay - at - home wives , Mrs. Cassano has worked as a reporter for a local weekly , started her own public relations company and served as president of the chamber of commerce .
She and her husband Mauro have two sons , one of whom still lives nearby and sends his children to Levittown schools .
“ There is a real genuine hometown feeling here and I think our generation was so involved and so enthusiastic about school , about the community , ” Mrs. Cassano said .

DROMAHAIR , Ireland
ONE afternoon in August , in this rural village in County Leitrim in Western Ireland , Grace Weir and Joe Walker climbed the nearest hill visible from their living room .
It was only a mile away , but when they reached the top and looked back toward the house , they could not see it .
Covered on all sides with tilted glass that reflects its green surroundings , and topped with a grass roof , the 1,500 - square - foot house had disappeared .
“ It took us 15 minutes , ” Mr. Walker said .
“ Eventually we spotted it . ”
The house is almost as hard to find on Google Earth , where it is delineated only by mismatched grain in the meadows that looks like “ a bad Photoshop job , ” as Ms. Weir put it .
When Ms. Weir and Mr. Walker , married artists who lived in a Dublin apartment for five years , decided to build a getaway on the scraggly sloped plot in 2001 , they knew only that their budget was limited to 50,000 Irish pounds , or about $ 60,000 , and that they “ wanted to build something ambitious and counterculture , ” Mr. Walker said .
Image Large windows and tilted glass facades reflect the landscape .

“ Everybody told us the planning permission would be a nightmare , ” Ms. Weir added .
Although Ireland ’s relatively new prosperity has led to a spate of home building in the last decade , planning commissions have not rushed to embrace innovative architecture .
The dominant model for the appropriate rural house — a thick - walled , pitched - roof cottage — was set in 1972 by the house - pattern book “ Bungalow Bliss , ” by Jack Fitzsimons , which has been reprinted many times and has become a bible for both developers and planners .

Acupuncture is said to release the body 's vital energy
A German team found almost half the patients treated with acupuncture felt pain relief .
But the Archives of Internal Medicine study also suggests sham acupuncture works nearly as well as the real thing .
In contrast , only about a quarter who received drugs and other Western therapies felt better .
Acupuncture represents a highly promising and effective treatment option for chronic back pain
Dr Heinz Endres
Ruhr University Bochum
The researchers , from the Ruhr University Bochum , say their findings suggest that the body may react positively to any thin needle prick - or that acupuncture may simply trigger a placebo effect .
One theory is that pain messages to the brain can be blocked by competing stimuli .
Researcher Dr Heinz Endres said : " Acupuncture represents a highly promising and effective treatment option for chronic back pain .
" Patients experienced not only reduced pain intensity , but also reported improvements in the disability that often results from back pain and therefore in their quality of life . "
Needles not manipulated
More than 1,100 patients took part in the study .
They were given either conventional therapy , acupuncture or a sham version .
Although needles were used in the sham therapy , they were not inserted as deeply as in standard acupuncture .
Neither were they inserted at points thought key to producing a therapeutic effect , or manipulated and rotated once in position .
After six months 47 % of patients in the acupuncture group reported a significant improvement in pain symptoms , compared to 44 % in the sham group , and just 27 % in the group who received conventional therapy .
Dr James Young , of Chicago 's Rush University , said : " We do n't understand the mechanisms of these so - called alternative treatments , but that does n't mean they do n't work . "
Acupuncture is based on the ancient Chinese theory that needles can be used to release the body 's vital energy , or qi .
Conventional therapies tested in the study included painkillers , injections , heat therapy and massage .
It is estimated that as many as 85 % of the population experiences back pain at some point , and the problem costs the NHS around £ 500 m a year .
The study echoes the findings of two studies published last year in the British Medical Journal , which found a short course of acupuncture could benefit patients with low back pain .
Mike O'Farrell , of the British Acupuncture Council , said : " Through these controlled research findings demonstrating the effectiveness of acupuncture , we believe that both the medical health profession and members of the public will see the benefits of acupuncture as part of an integrated healthcare service . "
However , Paul Ingraham , a registered massage therapist , said the study did not provide evidence that acupuncture was an effective therapy for back pain .
" On the contrary , it strongly shows that the central claims of acupuncturists are empty , and that all the ' skill ' and ' craft ' of acupuncturists is no better than random needling .
" Patient optimism is a key factor in back pain rehabilitation , and any therapy that people feel good about is likely to outperform conventional therapy . "
Today 's Boston Globe contains three poems taken from a new book of poetry by prisoners at Guantanamo Bay .
The book is " Poems from Guantánamo : The Detainees Speak , " and is edited by Marc Falkoff .
Its contents were screened by the Pentagon .
Jumah Al Dossari
Jumah al Dossari , a 33 - year - old Bahraini national , is the father of a young daughter .
He has been held at Guantánamo Bay for more than five years .
Detained without charge or trial , Dossari has been subjected to a range of physical and psychological abuses , some of which are detailed in " Inside the Wire , " an account of the Guantánamo prison by former military intelligence soldier Erik Saar .
He has been held in solitary confinement since the end of 2003 and , according to the US military , has tried to kill himself 12 times while in the prison .
On one occasion , he was found by his lawyer , hanging by his neck and bleeding from a gash to his arm .
DEATH POEM
Take my blood .
Take my death shroud and
The remnants of my body .
Take photographs of my corpse at the grave , lonely .
Send them to the world ,
To the judges and
To the people of conscience ,
Send them to the principled men and the fair - minded .
And let them bear the guilty burden , before the world ,
Of this innocent soul .
Let them bear the burden , before their children and before history ,
Of this wasted , sinless soul ,
Of this soul which has suffered at the hands of the " protectors of peace . "
On June 27 , the New York Times and Wall Street Journal vied for attention with feature stories on oil giants ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips " walking away from their multi- billion - dollar investments in Venezuela " as the Journal put it or standing " Defiant in Venezuela " as the Times headlined .
Both papers can barely contain their displeasure over Hugo Chavez wanting Venezuela to have majority ownership of its own assets and no longer let Big ( foreign )
Oil investors plunder them .
Those days are over .
State oil company PDVSA is now majority shareholder with a 78 % interest in four Orinoco joint ventures .
That 's up from previous stakes of from 30 to 49.9 % .
That 's how it should be , but it can't stop the Journal and Times from whining about it .
What ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips reject , oil giants Chevron , BP PLC , Total SA and Statoil ASA agreed to .
They 're willing to accept less of a huge profit they 'll get by staying instead of none at all by pouting and walking away as their US counterparts did .
Or did they ?
The Wall Street Journal reports " Conoco is n't throwing in the towel in Venezuela yet .
By not signing a deal , the Houston company kept open the option of pursuing compensation through arbitration . "
Exxon , however , is mum on that option for now .
Responding to Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez saying the two oil giants will lose their stakes in the Orinoco oil fields altogether , a company spokesperson expressed " disappoint ( ment ) that we have been unable to reach an agreement on the terms for migration to a mixed enterprise structure ( but will ) continue discussions with the Venezuelan government on a way forward . "
So what 's likely ahead as most Big Oil giants agree to Venezuela 's terms while two outliers have n't yet but may in the end do so .
The country 's oil reserves are too lucrative to walk away from , especially with Russia now pressuring foreign investors the same way .
It also wants majority stakes in its own resources with its giant oil and gas company Gazprom in control .
It has a monopoly over the country 's Sakhalin gas field exports and has taken over two of the largest energy projects in eastern Russia .
If these actions by Venezuela and Russia succeed as is likely , they may influence other oil producing nations to follow a similar course and pursue plans for larger stakes in their own resources as well .
Why not ?
They own them and even with less ownership interests , Big Oil will still earn huge profits from their foreign investments .
They just wo n't be quite as huge as they once were with one - sided deals benefiting them most .
So the end of this story may not be its end according to Michael Goldbert , head of the international dispute resolution group at Baker Botts , an influential law firm representing major international oil companies .
He said he did n't think the June 26 actions were " necessarily the end of the story , ” adding , “ The prospects of a deal are never over until a sale is made or an arbitrator reaches a decision . "
The investments are large , ranging from $ 2.5 - $ 4.5 billion for Conoco and $ 800 million for Exxon if Venezuela assumes ownership of its heavy oil projects .
Conoco explained " Although the company is hopeful that the negotiations will be successful , it has preserved all legal rights , including international arbitration . "
Exxon also expressed its hope an agreement could be reached permitting it to continue operating in an ownership role .
It looks like Conoco and Exxon want one foot in and the other outside Venezuela to keep its interests in the country alive .
It also looks like they 're playing games and letting the Wall Street Journal and New York Times do their moaning about what they ought to be grateful for - the right to invest and earn huge profits the way other Big Oil investors are opting to do .
Despite their June 26 decisions , Exxon and Conoco may , in the end , make the same choice .
If they do n't , the stakes they relinquish will shift to other producers according to James Cordier , president of Liberty Trading Group in Tampa , Florida .
He said production wo n't halt , and " Before everyone walks out , a deal will be struck and production there will continue . "
Caracas - based petroleum economist Mazhar al - Shereidah agrees saying " Venezuela is now free to find other partners ( and ) this does n't constitute a dramatic situation . "
There are plenty of capable and willing takers around .
Conoco and Exxon may in the end accept less of a good investment , stop whining about it , and continue operating in Venezuela .
Why not ?
The country is more open than many other oil - producing nations with much of their world 's proved reserves controlled by state monopolies barring private investment .
Venezuela barred them from 1975 - 1992 when the nation 's energy sector was completely nationalized .
That changed with a series of partial privatizations in the 1990s , and Chavez said he has no plans to reinstitute a complete oil industry nationalization .
Private investors can thus remain in the country and continue earning huge profits doing so .
Conoco and Exxon may decide after all to share in them .
Venezuelan V. Iraqi Oil Policies - A Study in Contrasts
High - level US officials from the administration , Congress , and Pentagon are pressuring the puppet Iraqi parliament to pass its new " Hydrocarbon Law " drafted in Washington and by Big US and UK oil companies .
Its provisions are in stark contrast to Venezuela 's oil management policies under Hugo Chavez .
For Chavez , his nation and peoples ' interests come first .
In Iraq , however , Big Oil licensed plunder will become law if the parliament agrees to accept what its occupier and corporate interests demand .
At this stage , it 's nearly certain it will clearing the way for stealing part of what a US state department spokesperson in 1945 called " a stupendous source of strategic power , and one of the greatest material prizes in world history " - the vast ( mostly Saudi ) Middle East oil reserves .
In Venezuela , the nation and its people will benefit most from the country 's oil wealth .
In Iraq , their resources are earmarked mostly for Big US and UK Oil .
The new " Hydrocarbon Law " is a shameless act of theft on the grandest of scale .
It 's a privatization blueprint for plunder giving foreign investors a bonanza of resources , leaving Iraqis a mere sliver for themselves .
As now written , its complex provisions give the Iraqi National Oil Company exclusive control of just 17 of the country 's 80 known oil fields with all yet - to - be - discovered deposits set aside for foreign investors .
Even worse , Big Oil is free to expropriate all earnings with no obligation to invest anything in Iraq 's economy , partner with Iraqi companies , hire local workers , respect union rights , or share new technologies .
Foreign investors will be granted long - term contracts up to 30 or more years , dispossessing Iraq and its people of their own resources in a naked scheme to steal them .
The Wall Street Journal , New York Times and rest of the dominant US media shamelessly denounce Hugo Chavez for his courage and honor doing the right thing .
In contrast , their silence , and effective complicity , on what will be one of the greatest ever corporate crimes when implemented shows their gross hypocrisy .
It 'll be up to the people of Iraq to resist and reclaim what Venezuelan people already have from its social democratic leader serving their interests above all others .

Off topic , I have to comment on introductory regexp : s/ girlfriend / wife / [ download ]
Boy , one can encapsulate a huge amount of life change in 18 chars of perl !
Also it is good you did't have to use the /g modifier there !
that can be shortened :
tr/glrind/wi/d ;
= )
Could someone explain what exactly does it do ?
tr/glrind/wi/d
Thanks .
Have you noticed areas of confusion ?
When trying to explain your code to others , have you noticed where they get confused ?
Have you noticed where you get confused ?
Spend some time in those areas .
Try refactoring , simplifying , or rewriting until the confusion goes away .
I hate when this happens , but it happens to me .
I spent a couple of hours renaming several sets of modules because one sentence in the documentation made no sense with their original names .
A tough idea : Having checked your code several times , you might know it by hard .
So , rewrite it all again without peeping at the original one .
Then compare boths scripts .
There might be some significant differences , that might brainstorm or ( lateral think ) some solutions .
And if you are not able to know it by hard , it might be too long and should be shorten into more simple chunks of well structured code :) .{\ ( ' v ' ) / }

A typical problem for people developing CGI code on Windows / IIS - My script runs from the command line but breaks when I run it under IIS .
Problems like this usually relate to the script being run under a restricted user account .
Scheduled jobs suffer from a similar range of problems .
Things that may not work if you have user / permissions issues include : Read / write to a local file .
Accessing network shares .
Read / write registry settings .
Working with functionality that depends on any of the above e.g. ODBC .
Great node ++.
Some oft - repeated advice but it is great to have it all in one place , I can see this being a much linked to node and worthy of promotion to tutorials ( it is currently under consideration for readmore tags ) .
On the topic of references I do n't have The Perl Pocket Reference but I do have Perl in A Nutshell which lives permanently on my desk , I have long since given up trying to put it back on the shelf for exactly the reasons you describe .
You might be emotionally attached to a certain part of the code , so you do not change it .
A lot of writers fall into this same trap of emotional attachment " but I like this sentence / passage " and because they like it they can't see that it detracts from the piece of writing .
The golden rule of editing is " be bloody ruthless " , it seems like good advice for coding as well .

Fantastic Node !! ++
A couple of suggestion I 'd add , some in alignment with some of your own suggestions .
Is your code intuitively simple ? :
I 've only been programming for a little while but one thing I found once I got use to the concepts / ideas the best solutions have a simple - ness about them .
And often have less bugs .
If you find your solution is a bit convaluted / verbose chances are there is a neater and cleaner way of doing it .
By chance , my recent node 375782 is a perfect example of what I mean ( a few suggestion but the final solution { thanks to tye} only required two small changes to a problem I 'd been considering for quite a while ) .
I love that about programming .
In addition to " Personal Responsibility "
Make the effort to solve it yourself : Programming , the knowledge behind and the ability to research it are skills that are acquired in time .
The time spent debugging and finding solutions is a skill unto itself .
In time this skill develops and you get faster at it .
The ability to research for yourself ( to be self reliant ) is a skill also .
Later when you get a problem you can solve it in a matter of moments because of the problem - solving skills you 've developed .
And trust me this comes from experience ...
I 've NEVER EVER done a computer course or training .
NOT ONE !
I 'm completely self taught .
A skill that now has be challenging even some of the senior technicians at my work .
Take a shower :
Hey it works for me !
The break from the screen and code gives your mind time to relax , rethink .
The water is meditative and soothing .
I often walk out of the shower with my mind flowing with new ideas ( excuse the pun ! )
Plus after 12 + hours in front of a monitor the hygiene is probably beneficial . :-)

In the line of verifying everything , you said that you did an s/ girlfriend / wife / but do n't appear to have actually done it . :- P
Otherwise this is all good advice .
UPDATE : It 's been done now .
Most of these things also apply to any programming task in any language not just Perl .
At a first glance the only thing that does n't fit into any language is " Are you using the right special variable ? " .
There is also the Perl pragma's , using perldoc , several mentions of the perl documentation , using Data : : Dumper , using the perl debugger , checking module versions , setting the environment in %ENV , using Test : : Harness , and probably a few other things . :) --
brian d foy < bdfoy@cpan.org >
Yes , but other languages has profilers , docs and so on .
These things are not perl only . :)
In general , it 's a good idea to declare variables using my instead of using a global or using local .
It forces namespace and scope awareness and eliminates pernicious bugs caused by same - named variables with different scope .
Practically anything you can do with a local or global variable , you can do with a change in design using my , and you 'll get a much more robust design .
Also , in general , avoid exporting variables from modules .
Exporting methods can sometimes be OK , although I still think it 's better to say use Foo : : Bar ; ... my $ barian = Foo : : Bar -> baz ( ) ; [ download ] so the method 's origin is clear .
Variable and method names should be communicative of the intended use ; it 's better for a name to be long and communicative than short and cryptic .
Document , document , document .
Also : I 'm astonished no one 's mentioned using functional spec's and test suites before now .
( Visit this Joel Spolsky article and scroll down to the second headline , " Painless Functional Specifications , " for information on the former ; perldoc Test : : Harness and perldoc LWP :: UserAgent for details on the latter , and on user agents which are also an enormous boon to web developers seeking a means of testing functionality and sounding the alarm when things go wrong . )
Writing a spec before the program saves loads of time and heartache , as well as keeping the MBA 's and the techies on the same page .
Similarly , fleshing out the spec into a test suite before any code gets written -- and continuing to flesh out the test suite while coding -- reduces the likelihood of bugs , increases confidence in the final product , and makes a predictable timeline actually possible .
Ideally , you want to test as high up the call chain as possible , drilling down into the nitty gritty only when -- and to the extent that -- the need presents itself .
There are even times where it can be helpful to write a tiny program whose specific purpose is to test the syntax or the effect of some ( for you ) uncharted Perl functionality .
I did this in my formative Perl years and it saved me an enormous amount of time .
Oh , and also it helps -- particularly if you 're working in a country whose primary language is English -- not to comment your code in , say , Croatian .
( Do n't laugh , I actually inherited a project some years ago containing some sections of code in which this had been done ! )
Along similar lines as that last point , I 'd find myself ( particular for CPAN modules ) always writing my APIs in American English , despite being in Australia .
It just makes life similar if everybody uses the same spelling for classes and methods .
It 's a swallowing your pride thing .
Any reason why you type all of require Data : : Dumper ; print Data :: Dumper :: Dumper (... ) ; [ download ] rather than use Data :: Dumper ; print Dumper ( ... ) ; [ download ] ?
Also , in your particular example , I always prefer the output of Dumper ( \ % hash ) to that of Dumper ( %hash ) .
Recently , I 've been sometimes using the even - less - typing - required use YAML ; print Dump ( ... ) , but that requires actually installing YAML first .
And I 'm still not nearly as used to the YAML format as I am to Data : : Dumper format .
Most style guides I work under ask for the full package name of external functions , and I generally agree with that .
I have found that I should n't expect others to know where all of these functions came from .
Also , I do n't have to keep track of every modules exports .
Some decided to have the same names for things .
Remember : @EXPORT is evil .
This way would cause a problem if someone wanted to use YAML as a drop in replacement , though .

Most style guides I work under ask for the full package name of external functions , and I generally agree with that .
I have found that I should n't expect others to know where all of these functions came from .
I totally agree that you should know where a subroutine comes from , but i pretty strongly disagree with using FQ package names to acomplish that , and I definately do n't think that using require is wise at all .
There are two reasons for these opinions .
The first has to do with encapsulation .
When you use FQ subroutine names you are totally violating the encapsulation of your package code .
Take the following contrived example : Package Foo has two subs defined , BarA ( ) and BarS ( ) , BarA is defined for export , BarS is defined as a more or less private internal version .
You want to use BarA ( ) , so you write Foo : : BarS ( ) and then wonder why your program A ) doesnt fail when it gets to that line , and B ) why its just done something horrible to your data that BarA ( ) promises not to do .
With use and explicit exports you dont have this problem .
You EXPLICTLY request the export of a subroutine .
Assuming the private version isnt in @EXPORT_OK then youll never blow your foot off by saying : use Foo qw ( BarS ) ; [ download ]
A second serious objection i have to using require like this is that requires are run time constructs .
Your program could have half finished before it gets to the require only to fail , leaving your program in the tough position of having to recover , something that it may be bad at , which could leave your overall system in an indeterminate state .
Wheras with use the error would have occured at compile time , and would have happened before almost anything else did , a situation much easier to recover gracefully from .
My personal feeling is that require is a badly named keyword .
Most often when I see the keyword in use is when the code doesnt in fact " require " the module at all , but rather would just prefer it to be there .
AFAICT when code really require s a module its much better to use it instead .
Anyway , good thread .
Thanks .

Most style guides I work under ask for the full package name of external functions
What an awful idea .
Just being explicit about what you import from any module you use is a much better idea .
@EXPORT is evil but @EXPORT_OK makes for easier - to - read / - write code and provides reasonable interface verification ( at compile time , no less ) .
demerphq already said all of this , but I just boggle at the sentence I quoted so I had to chime in against such insanity .
- tye
I agree that @EXPORT is evil but in your case you miss possible invocation of " import " function , which could do some necessary setup .
Yet you do n't do require strict ; , do n't you ?
use YAML ; print Dump ( ... ) , but that requires actually installing YAML first .
You might try installing Data : : Dump :: Streamer ( along with the DDS alias . )
Then its just use DDS ; Dump ( ... ) ; :-)
Its a Data : : Dumper replacement ( not drop in ) which does a more or less breadth first dump of your data so its usually a lot easier to read , especially for cyclic and selfreferential data structures .

demerphq

So , your suggestion to sfink 's drawback of having to install a module is to install a module ?
The best debugger in the universe is print .
print STDERR
" The value is [ $ value ]
" ; [ download ]
To which I 'd add , while not earthshaking or original , that I like using warn even more than print STDERR .
Besides being shorter , the fact that it 's different makes it easier to find such statements and comment out those lines when I 'm through with them .
More particularly , I put my debugging ' warn ' messages at the start of a line .
Since most of my perl code has been indented a couple of tabs away from column 1 , the fact that these statements are ' debug ' type statements stands out .
And since I might want to reuse the same debugging statements from time to time , rather than erase them when I 'm done , I just comment them out when I'm " through " with them .
This way , when I 'm desparate later to know what 's happening in some region , those previously written warn statements are there , waiting to be uncommented .
And if I uncomment seven or eight of them ( among the dozens / hundreds in my code :-) , I can easily find them again to turn them off when I 'm done with them by doing a vim search for them at the start of a line .
/ ^warn
Then repeat my search with n and repeat my ' uncomment ' with a dot .
Because these statements are at the start of a line , they can be found differently than the warn statements that are in the clear and are SUPPOSED to fire when triggered by real problems . )
I also find that including use Carp qw( cluck ) ; early in my program and using cluck statements at the start of a line ( a la warn ) helps me figure out just how a particular subroutine got invoked .
I use warn ( ) for program warnings rather than debugging output .
However , if I 'm doing really big things , I usually have a debug ( ) or trace ( ) function lying around .

brian d foy < bdfoy@cpan.org >
However , if I 'm doing really big things , I usually have a debug ( ) or trace ( ) function lying around .
But not a log ( ) function .
( Do n't laugh , I 've been bitten by this one . )
Being right , does not endow the right to be rude ; politeness costs nothing .
Being unknowing , is not the same as being stupid .
Expressing a contrary opinion , whether to the individual or the group , is more often a sign of deeper thought than of cantankerous belligerence .
Do not mistake your goals as the only goals ; your opinion as the only opinion ; your confidence as correctness .
Saying you know better is not the same as explaining you know better .
Of course it 's fine to save warn ( ) for " real " error messages , but then the same could be said for only using print ( ) for real output messages .
My problem , for which I 'd welcome suggestions , is that I 'm not familiar with how to use debug ( ) in the midst of debugging a huge Tk - based application that I 'm working on .
The subroutines I am debugging get fired when I click one of the Tk buttons , and I know for sure that I can get at my warn ( ) messages as above via my STDERR files .
Out of ignorance , I 'm just expecting use of debug ( ) to be impractical .
A most enlightening post , if I may say so , brian_d_foy .
I also used to use warn ( ) until I realised that , when re-running Test : :* based modules , it [ the use of warn ( ) ] ' gets in the way ' of true warnings - ever since when I , like you , define an additional sub to printf STDERR ... - thus the code behaves as I think it should whilst still generating debugging messages that do n't cause test case failures .
A user level that continues to overstate my experience :-) )
Somebody updated their French translation with your patch ... :-)
Somebody ? :)
I 'm getting a lot of good comments here ( I 'm surprised really : not by the quality but the quantity ) , so I 'll eventually roll them back into the other version along with credit to anyone who helped .
I should also list all transations in the main document too .
I could really use a Russian translation though .
And maybe a Swedish Chef one . --

Have you watched The Daily Show with Jon Stewart ? , Several people commented along the lines of " take a break and do something else and it will come to you " .
This has happened to me enough times that I really started to think about how / why it worked .
My theory is that it puts your mind into a different problem solving mode , similar to problem solving in the dream - like state , which I 've also experienced .
This seems to allow greater creativity , new approaches , and synthesis .
I 've learned to love my dry erase board at work .
When the mental block is on full it sometimes helps to step back and diagram the problem showcasing both flow and \or expectation of how the code is intended to work .
More often than not , if there is a problem in logic , it becomes apparent from the flow and if it is a choice of code function , the expectation becomes apparent .
Dry erase makes it easy to edit and if all else fails , I guess sniffing the marker comes to mind .
Great article Brian .
Two possible typos : " The value is ] $ value ]
"
You can check the most module version with a simple perl one - liner
I particularly like these two suggestions :
Does the problem look different on paper ?
Explain your problem aloud .
Actually say the words .
Cheers .
I find going for a pee solves most of my problems .
You think I 'm joking ?!!
( forgot to login the first time doh ! ! )
Amazing text first of all , a ++ to it and all other good suggestions around it
now my part of contribution
If you want to do some changes in order make your ( huge in number of lines of code ) script working ( on which you recently faced some problems during extending code or adding new functionality ) , before incorporating the new change in the original script try to write a small script ( probably a perl one liner ) and check whether your that small logic will work in the small script , they try applying in the original script I use this method if I want to include a regular expressions in to my existing scripts ( huge in size ) , and it is assured that it works correctly provide I check it simple program or one liner .

9/11 widows demand release of CIA 's Inspector General report RAW STORY
Published : Monday June 18 , 2007 Print This Email
This A group composed of widows of 9/11 victims are demanding the release of a key CIA report .
" The report , prepared by the CIA 's inspector general , is the only major 9/11 government review that has still not been made publicly available , " Michael Isikoff reported in January .
" When it was completed in August 2005 , Newsweek and other publications reported that it contained sharp criticisms of former CIA director George Tenet and other top agency officials for failing to address the threat posed by Al Qaeda , as well as other mistakes that might have prevented the attacks . "
In a statement obtained by RAW STORY , September 11th Advocates Patty Casazza , Monica Gabrielle , Mindy Kleinberg , and Lorie Van Auken write , " Almost six years have passed since the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , yet critical information continues to be withheld from the American public regarding the attacks .
" In 2002 , after reviewing the evidence produced by the Joint Inquiry of Congress into the 9/11 Attacks , both Republican and Democratic Congressmen agreed that a CIA Inspector General review into individual responsibility was necessary , " the statement continues .
" Faced with the facts , these Congressmen understood that accountability in the Intelligence Community was crucial . "
The 9/11 widows add , " Their intent was that a final declassified CIA / IG report be released to the public and where deemed appropriate by the report , for personnel at all levels to be held accountable for any omission , commission , or failure to meet professional standards in regard to the events of September 11 , 2001 .
To date , despite enormous efforts from the Senate Intelligence Committee , nothing has happened . "
According to 9/11 Truth.org , a petition entitled " The Public 's Right to Know - Declassification and Release of Documents " ( link ) garnered over 15,000 signatures and was " hand delivered ... to lawmakers in Washington , DC . "
Further excerpts from September 11th Advocates ' statement : # Michael Isikoff wrote in his January 2007
Newsweek article that , " When it [ the CIA / IG report ] was completed in August 2005 , NEWSWEEK and other publications reported that it contained sharp criticisms of former CIA director George Tenet and other top agency officials for failing to address the threat posed by Al Qaeda , as well as other mistakes that might have prevented the attacks . "
Isikoff goes on to say , " What 's really behind the intelligence community 's refusal to release the report , the senators suspect , is a desire to protect the reputations of some of the main figures . "
Since sources and methods are not revealed in a declassified report , national security is protected and thus not an excuse for withholding this document .
Since when does embarrassment meet any standard for keeping a government report secret ?
Is nt it time for our elected and appointed officials to do the job that they were sent to our Nations Capitol for : to protect the public and not reputations ?
Americans have the right to know that the problems identified in this report have been addressed and corrected .
We have the right to know that competent people are serving us in strategic positions  our safety and security depends on it .
Incompetence costs lives .
Legislation , co-sponsored by Senators Ron Wyden D-OR and Kit Bond R-MO , calling for the release of the 9/11 CIA / IG report , already exists , has passed the Senate and has strong bipartisan support .
Yet , the White House and the CIA continue to refuse to release the already declassified version of the report .
It is sadly and abundantly clear that , once again , only heightened public pressure on the Administration and the CIA will force accountability .
We call on the public and the press to demand the release of the declassified version of the 9/11 CIAs Inspector General report .

Ok , so I have been messing with these .png transparencies , and I gotta tell ya - these guys are tricky buggards , especially if you want to use them in your divs as backgrounds .
If you use a transparent background in a your links wont work in IE .
So below is how to get everything to work just fine .
* One note of apology - Mac Users - I 'm sorry ...
I dont have one - so if it doesnt work on yours , please post your fixes .
First off to have transparent .pngs work in IE you need to use the AlphaImageLoader filter .
This basically allows the alpha channel in the .png file to be transparent .
Below are examples of a transparent .png file used on different colored backgrounds .
I personally found that using the AlphaImageLoader filter in declaring each use of a specific .png graphic was difficult to get working and all in all just a pain to work with , so through the magic of google I found this great document , pngbehavior.htc , it controls the filtering of .png files and how the images render in IE .
Just place pngbehavior.htc in the same directory as your CSS style sheet - Download PNGBEHAVIOR.HTC
Then place this code in your CSS
< style type =" text /css " >
img {
behavior : url ( " pngbehavior.htc " ) ;
}
</style >
Note :
You need to have a transparent gif called " blank.gif " in the same directory also - Download blank.gif
Using .PNG as a background image
Now that we have .png transparencies to work with just placing the image inside your document , now I want to address the difficult part , transparent .pngs as a background .
If you look at the image above you can see that it is able to be done .
First , for Mizolla , its very easy - just use your transparent image as your background image and everything works out hunky dorey - BUT not for IE .
The above div actually has two seperate css's , one for IE and then another for the other browsers .
First off I gave the above div a class called transbak and defined the class as follows
. transbak {
background - color : # 66CCCC ;
background - image : url( images / transparent-02.png ) ;
height : 200 px ;
width : 300 px ;
background - repeat : repeat ;
border : 1 px dotted # 000000 ;
}
For IE browsers I had to have a seperate style sheet defined -
It was declared below my first style sheet
<!--[ if IE ] >
< style type =" text /css " >
. transbak {
background - color : # 66CCCC ;
background - image : none ;
filter : progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader
( src='images/transparent-02.png ' , sizing Method=' crop ' ) ;
height : 200 px ;
width : 300 px ;
background - repeat : repeat ;
border : 1 px dotted # 000000 ;
</style >
<![endif ] -->
And there TADA !
you know have your transparent div working - BUT - There is one more thing , what if you want to have text in your div and links ?
Guess what - if you just do it the way I described above - your links wont work - so now we need to fix that !
Below you will see that the link inside does n't work in IE
here is some text to show you that links wont work without a special declaration www.clikproductions.com
So all we really need to do is place the text inside another div and make that a positioning relative , and there ya go ... it all works - I like to just have a class defined as IEFix and just make that class relative - and place the defined class in your [ If IE ] section
www.clikproductions.com
here is some text to show you that links wont work without a special declaration
<!--[ if IE ] >
< style type =" text /css " >
. transbak {
background - color : # 66CCCC ;
background - image : none ;
filter : progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader
( src='images/transparent-02.png ' , sizing Method=' crop ' ) ;
height : 200 px ;
width : 300 px ;
background - repeat : repeat ;
border : 1 px dotted # 000000 ;
. IEFix {
position : relative ;
}
</style >
<![endif ] -->
If you need to see how any of this was done , you can always look at my source .
“ Israel must be wiped off the map ”
This is a famous quote of Iran ’s President Ahmadinejad that is used over and over to show how dangerous Iran allegedly is .
Considering the publicity of this quote , it is quite surprising that almost noone knows that this is a mistranslation and crudely taken out of context .
In an article titles “ WIPED OFF THE MAP ” – The Rumor of the Century , Arash Norouzi shows the errors in the translation , and the history of this twisted quote .
The correct translation would be :
The Imam said this regime occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the page of time .
Arash also explains the context of this quote in great detail , so make sure you take a look at his article if you really want to understand what Ahmadinejad was saying , read the linked article .
Here ’s a very short excerpt describing a part of the quote ’s context .
Ahmadinejad acknowledges that the removal of America ’s powerful grip on the region via the Zionists may seem unimaginable to some , but reminds the audience that , as Khomeini predicted , other seemingly invincible empires have disappeared and now only exist in history books .
Note that the speech also does not contain any announcement to actively cause this “ vanishing ” of the regime .
Another article ( Putting Words in Ahmadinejad ’s Mouth ) nicely concludes the meaning of the quoted phrase :
It 's all fun and games until somebody gets their arm broken by a robotic arm wrestling machine .
Atlas Co. is recalling its " Arm Spirit " arm wrestling arcade game from the market in Japan after the 150 machines scored three broken person arms between them .
Spokeswoman Ayano Sakiyama had some smack for gamers puny enough to get their arms broken over the pink barrel : " The machine is n't that strong , much less so than a muscular man .
Even women should be able to beat it . "
Yeah , she just shot down any robo - warrior cred you suckers might 've been hoping for out of the situation .
" We think that maybe some players get overexcited and twist their arms in an unnatural way , " but they 're recalling the machine as " a precaution . " [ Via Engadget Japanese

Severn Trent Water says 150,000 homes are without water in Gloucestershire after a treatment works was flooded .
Power supplies to 500,000 people in Gloucestershire are also threatened and the RAF has been drafted in to protect a substation at risk of flooding .
Meanwhile , Prime Minister Gordon Brown has chaired a meeting of the government 's emergency committee Cobra .
This involves several ministers and the Chief Constable of Gloucestershire Police , Tim Brain .
Mr Brown will visit flood - hit areas on Monday .
Earlier , Environment Agency chief executive Baroness
Young told the BBC that about £ 1bn a year was needed to improve flood defences .
She said more investment was essential because climate change would lead to increased rainfall , but added : " It will take some time to get flood defences into place and it wo n't completely remove the risk of flooding . "
Upton - on - Severn was badly hit by flooding

Environment Secretary Hilary
Benn defended the government 's flood response , saying conditions were " unprecedented " .
Mr Benn told BBC News 24's Sunday programme there had been a cut in the Environment Agency 's forward planning budget , but capital expenditure was being increased from £ 600 m to £ 800 m by 2010 / 11 .
" This was very , very intense rainfall , with five inches in 24 hours in some areas , even some of the best defences are going to be overwhelmed , " he added .
Meanwhile , the Association of British Insurers has said the total bill for the June and July floods could reach £ 2bn .
Water supplies in north Gloucestershire were running out on Sunday evening after a treatment plant flooded .
Severn Trent
Water urged people not to panic and to do all they could to conserve water .
Emergency services in Gloucester are also using sandbags to protect the Walham electricity substation , but 450 homes in Tewkesbury are already without power , along with 150 in Gloucester and 150 in Evesham .
Electricity supplier Central Networks has advised customers to ring 0800 328 1111 to report loss of supply .

Water has also reportedly begun to infiltrate 12th century Tewkesbury Abbey , after the town itself was cut off .
Elsewhere , the Army has taken humanitarian aid to Upton - upon - Severn in Worcestershire and swathes of Warwickshire are submerged .
Severe warnings are also in place for Oxfordshire , Berkshire and parts of London , and the Environment Agency said " serious flooding " was likely in Oxford on Sunday night .
The main developments include :
Water levels in the River Severn at Gloucester are running at a height of 34ft ( 10.4 m ) .
Flood defences are 35ft ( 10.7 m ) .
Flood water levels are now said to be at the same level as the 1947 floods .

The Red Cross has been called in to help with the evacuation of about 20 patients from Tewkesbury Hospital .
John Ford , from Gloucestershire Primary Care Trust , said they were being relocated from the Severn and Avon wards to other local hospitals .
Parts of Worcestershire are under 6ft ( 1.82 m ) of water and up to 4,000 people in and around Bromyard in Herefordshire are without water after a treatment works near Worcester was flooded .
Sutton and East Surrey Water has warned 80,000 households and businesses in Sutton to boil tap water before drinking it after the firm discovered rain had leaked into a tank of water which had gone out to customers .
Wide areas of Berkshire are flooded , including 400 homes in Pangbourne where the main road into town is closed .
The government has refused to comment on a leaked draft of its soon - to - be released Housing Green Paper .
The document , which was obtained by the BBC , says it is " not realistic " to rule out new developments in areas at risk of flooding .
Sir Menzies Campbell , the Liberal Democrat leader , agreed more needed to be spent on flood defences .
" It was known for some days that this was likely to happen .
I think there 'll be questions asked about the degree of preparedness there was to meet what is obviously a very , very dramatic outcome , " said Sir Menzies .
Conservative leader David Cameron , who has called for a public inquiry into the crisis , said people wanted to know why flood defence resources were often miles away from where they were needed .
Rest centre
In one of the RAF 's biggest peacetime rescue operations around 100 people in Worcestershire were airlifted to safety over the weekend , while more than 1,000 spent a two nights in emergency rest centres .
Despite the heightened risk of flooding to central and southern England , the Met Office does not have any severe weather warnings in place .

The BBC Weather Centre said outbreaks of rain are expected , some heavy , across the north east of Scotland on Sunday evening , but in Wales showers should be lighter and more scattered , giving some relief to the worst affected areas in the east around the River Wye .
BBC forecaster Susan Powell said more rain was expected on Monday , but most would be away from the severely flooded parts of the Midlands .
Instead , she said concern could shift to areas in southern England , close to the River Thames , where an inch of rain could fall on Monday .

In a sign of the seriousness of the standoff , the American Embassy here suspended diplomatic missions outside the Green Zone and throughout Iraq on Tuesday .
The shooting , which took place on Sunday , has angered Iraqi officials and touched off a harsh debate about private security companies , which operate outside Iraqi law , a privilege extended to them by Americans officials while Iraq ’s government was still under American administration .
Blackwater , which guards all top American officials here , had its work suspended , and Iraqi officials agreed to rewrite the rules to make the companies accountable .
In video shot shortly after the episode , the child appeared to have burned to the mother ’s body after the car caught fire , according to an official who saw it .
The New York Times reports today that the Iraqi government has completed their investigation into the recent incident when Blackwater mercenaries opened fire on a group of Iraqi civilians , killing 20 Iraqis , including a young couple and their infant child .
I can't begin to fathom what that means .
Are things so dangerous , despite the surge , that our diplomats and civilian workers dare not leave the Green Zone without heavily - armed trigger - happy escorts ?
Do n't we have enough military personnel , given the recent surge , to protect our non-military personnel ?
The article goes on to state : Now , it 's been a long time since Paul " Jerry " Bremer and the CPA ( Coalition Provisional Authority ) left Iraq .
And the last I heard , things were just jim - dandy there .
Why , did n't our very own senators McCain and Lindsay Graham assure us that things were back to normal , and brag about how they 'd gone rug - buying at the local bazaar ?
And did n't Mike Pence tell us that it was just as safe as the local market in Indiana ?
Then it 's high time to remove these ridiculous legal provisions .
Mercenaries have no place in the new , peaceful , improving Iraq .
And nobody should be above the law .
Or are they ALL LYING TO US ???
At first , I thought that the U.S. Embassy lockdown was meant to implicate Iran somehow , but that looks less and less like the case .
Now it looks like they 've just all lost their minds .
Just go read the articles at the NYTimes and at Will Bunch 's site ( Attytood ) .
What 's going on in Iraq is , everybody 's lying to everyone else , the surge did n't accomplish a damned thing , except killing a few more Americans and a lot more Iraqis , and we 're in the midst of a giant clusterfuck .
Approximately 150 Iraqis are killed each day , many of them families with young children .
And the mental picture I 'm carrying is of the infant in that car .
The article states : What business do we have immolating infants ?

RAMLA , Israel —
The Abu Ghanem women are buried just inside the main gate of the old Muslim cemetery , eight in the last seven years .
Reem eloped with a lover to escape an arranged marriage .
Her brothers , one a pediatrician , are on trial for murder .
Sabrin rests under a bare concrete slab with her name roughly scratched on by hand .
She is said to have been killed by a cousin whom she refused to marry .
Shirihan , 15 , the youngest of the dead women , is also said to have rejected a marriage .
Her stepbrothers are suspected of having killed her .
Others lie in crudely marked graves , covered with plain marble or a mound of earth marked with an oval of stones — all a few minutes ’ drive from Israel ’s gleaming new international airport , here in this hardscrabble town of 64,000 Jews and Arabs .
So - called honor killings among Muslims are a phenomenon across the Middle East , including in Israel , where Arabs , most of them Muslim , make up almost 20 percent of the population .
The Israeli police and courts have caught and convicted some of the killers ; unlike the laws in some Arab societies , Israel ’s do not make allowances for such acts .
FEDERAL WAY , WASH . — Frosty Hardison is neither impressed nor surprised that An Inconvenient Truth , the global - warming movie narrated by former vice president Al Gore , received an Oscar nomination this week for best documentary .
" Liberal left is all over Hollywood , " he grumbled after the nomination was announced .
Hardison , a parent of seven in the suburbs of Seattle , has himself roiled the global - warming waters .
It happened early this month when he learned that one of his daughters would be watching An Inconvenient Truth in her seventh - grade science class .
" You will not teach or show that propagandist Al Gore video to my child , blaming our nation — the greatest nation ever to exist on this planet — for global warming , " he wrote in an e-mail to the Federal Way School Board .
The computer consultant is an evangelical Christian who says he believes that a warming planet is " one of the signs " of Jesus Christ 's imminent return for Judgment Day .
Hardison 's e-mail ( along with complaints from a few other parents ) kept the film from being shown to the class .
The teacher , Kay Walls , says she was told by her principal that she would receive a disciplinary letter for not following rules that require her to seek permission to present " controversial " materials in class .
The e-mail also pressured the school board to impose a ban on screenings of the film for the district 's 22,500 students .
The ban was lifted Tuesday night , subject to rigorous conditions .
An Inconvenient Truth now may be shown only with the written permission of a principal — and only when it is balanced by alternative views .
Hardison was pleased , but the action has triggered a national backlash .
Members of the school board say they have been bombarded by e-mails and phone calls accusing them of ignorance , pandering to religion and imposing prior restraint on free speech .
Walls , meanwhile , said she is struggling to find authoritative articles to counter the Gore documentary .
" The only thing I have found so far is an article in Newsweek called ' The Cooling World , ' " the teacher said .
It was written 32 years ago .
During the remarkable cascade of events in photosynthesis , plants approach the pinnacle of stinginess by scavenging nearly every photon of available light energy to produce food .
Yet after many years of careful research into the exact mechanisms , some key questions remain about this fundamental biological process that supports almost all life on Earth .
Now a research team led by Neal Woodbury , a scientist at the Arizona State University ( ASU ) Biodesign Institute , has come up with a new insight into the mechanism of photosynthesis .
The discovery involves the orchestrated movement of proteins on the timescale of a millionth of a millionth of a second .
“ This pioneering research gives us new insights into the basic mechanism of photosynthesis , ” said Kamal Shukla , program director in the National Science Foundation Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences .
“ Understanding such basic biological processes can lead to important societal benefits . ”
For example , the answer may be good news for the development of organic solar cells , said Shukla , which have been of commercial interest because of their relatively low cost compared to traditional silicon solar cells .
Traditional solar cells use semi-conductor devices ( silicon chemistry ) to convert solar energy into electricity , whereas organic solar cells are based on biological systems that use the same chemistry as living organisms to harvest the energy of sunlight to drive photosynthesis .
So , inspiration for the design of organic solar cells would be based upon the principle of photosynthesis .
Woodbury ’s research is focused on understanding the basic principles of photosynthesis and it could be valuable in the design of organic solar cells .
The efficiency of energy conversion by photosynthesis is much higher than traditional solar devices .
To get a closer look at what happens during photosynthesis , the research team used a well - studied purple photosynthetic bacterium named Rhodobacter sphaeroides .
This organism is likely one of the earliest photosynthetic bacteria to evolve .
The researchers focused their efforts on studying the center stage of photosynthesis , the reaction center , where light energy is funneled into specialized chlorophyll - binding proteins .
Woodbury and his colleagues tried to uncover more of the physical mechanism driving photosynthesis by creating mutants that would tweak the electron transfer relationships between molecules in the reaction center .
The researchers started to inch closer to an answer when Haiyu Wang , a postdoctoral research associate in Woodbury ’s lab , noticed something in common with all of the different mutants : a similarity in how fast electrons moved in the reaction center .
He decided that there must be some sort of underlying physical principle involved .
Few research groups are equipped to measure the early events in photosynthesis because of the extremely short timescale–similar to the amount of time it takes a supercomputer to carry out a single flop .
Wang used ASU ’s ultrafast laser facility , funded by NSF , which acts like a high - speed motion picture camera that can capture data from these lightning - fast reactions .
The movement of the reaction center proteins during photosynthesis allows a plant or bacteria to harness light energy efficiently , even if conditions are n’t optimal .
The findings are described in the journal Science , and were funded by NSF .
The research team includes lead author Haiyu Wang , ASU Biodesign Institute ; Su Lin , ASU Biodesign Institute ; James Allen , ASU Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry ; JoAnn Williams , ASU Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry ; Sean Blankert and Christa Laser , ASU Biodesign Institute .
Scientists in India are reporting an advance toward discovering a Holy Grail of the illumination industry — a white LED , a light - emitting diode that produces pure white light suitable for interior lighting of homes , offices and other buildings .
Their study is in the Sept. 9 issue of ACS ’ The Journal of Physical Chemistry C .
In the report , D. D. Sarma and Angshuman Nag point out that practical versions of these so - called white LEDs would be brighter , longer - lasting and more energy efficient than conventional light sources such as incandescent and fluorescent lamps and could replace them in the future .
However , scientists have faced several difficulties in developing pure white LEDs with all the requirements and desirable properties .
Existing versions produce tinted , unstable shades of white light that mar their performance .
The researchers report the first success in developing a new LED based on a new phosphor from semiconductor nanocrystals of cadmium sulfide mixed with manganese .
It produces a stable shade of white light that remains constant over time and appears superior in overall performance in comparison to previous generations of white LEDs .
The scientists now are working to boost its efficiency so that the white LED can be used in everyday applications .

WILLIAMSBURG , Va .
Robert Gates has been a godsend .
After a bombastic defense secretary , we now have a candid one .
After ego , we have self - effacement .
After domination , we have a man who welcomes discussion .
Gates was decisive during the Walter Reed hospital fiasco .
He is honest and trustworthy on Iraq .
And on Monday , at the World Forum on the Future of Democracy at Colonial Williamsburg here , Gates delivered a speech that could define the center ground of American foreign policy .
He ran through the history of the never - ending debate between realists and idealists .
He noted that this debate began just after the founding of the Republic .
Thomas Jefferson saw the French Revolution as a triumph for liberty .
John Adams saw it as reckless radicalism .
Throughout the messy years that followed , Gates explained , we have made deals with tyrants to defeat other tyrants .
We ’ve championed human rights while doing business with some of the worst violators of human rights .
The US government has been secretly supporting a Pakistani militant group that has staged a series of deadly attacks against Iran , ABC News reported , citing unnamed US and Pakistani intelligence sources .
The group , known as Jundallah , or " God 's Brigade , " is made up of members of the predominantly Sunni Muslim Baluchi tribe which inhabits Pakistan 's gas - rich province of Baluchestan , as well as neighboring regions in Iran and Afghanistan .
In their exclusive report , which aired on Tuesday evening and was posted online on Wednesday morning , ABC News reporters Brian Ross and Christopher Isham said that while the US provides no direct funding , the group has been " secretly encouraged and advised " by the American government since 2005 .
U.S. officials say the U.S. relationship with Jundullah is arranged so that the U.S. provides no funding to the group , which would require an official presidential order or " finding " as well as congressional oversight .
Tribal sources tell ABC
News that money for Jundullah is funneled to its youthful leader , Abd el Malik Regi , through Iranian exiles who have connections with European and Gulf states .
Jundullah , which claims that Iran 's Shiite regime is oppressing its Baluchi minority , has claimed responsibility for bombings , kidnappings , and televised beheadings that have killed more than a dozen Iranian troops and officials .
In February the group said it carried out a car - bomb attack targeting Iran 's Revolutionary Guard in Zahedan , the provincial capital in southeastern Iran , killing 11 .
Jundullah 's leader Mr. Regi , who founded the group in 2003 at the age of 23 , has – according to ABC – admitted to personally executing captured Iranian soldiers .
" He used to fight with the Taliban .
He 's part drug smuggler , part Taliban , part Sunni activist , " said Alexis Debat , a senior fellow on counterterrorism at the Nixon Center and an ABC News consultant who recently met with Pakistani officials and tribal members .
" Regi is essentially commanding a force of several hundred guerrilla fighters that stage attacks across the border into Iran on Iranian military officers , Iranian intelligence officers , kidnapping them , executing them on camera , " Debat said .
The ABC News report said US Vice President Dick Cheney spoke to Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf about Jundullah and its campaign against Iran during Mr. Cheney 's surprise visit to Pakistan in February .
When asked by Reuters about the meeting , a Cheney spokeswoman said , " We do n't discuss conversations between the vice president and foreign leaders . "
Reuters also quoted a CIA official as saying the ABC " account was not accurate . "
An analysis by Strafor , a global intelligence consulting firm based in Texas , noting that Jundullah has stepped up its attacks recently , says that the US could be using Jundullah as a " poking device " [ subscription only ] against Iran .
U.S. support for Jundallah fits into the larger picture of U.S. - Iranian negotiations over Iraq .
Iran has made painfully clear that it has -- and can use -- a variety of militant assets throughout the region to pressure Washington to meets its demands in Iraq .
At the same time , the United States has an interest in demonstrating that it has friends among Iran 's minority groups to gather intelligence , stir up public unrest and distract the clerical regime from its Iraqi agenda .
White House , Senate headed for subpoena showdown Nick Juliano

The Bush Administration and a Senate committee have entered an apparent standoff as the White House failed to meet a 2:30 p.m. deadline from the Senate Judiciary Committee , which seeks compliance with subpoenas related to President Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program .
The committee 's chairman threatened criminal charges if the administration continues to withhold requested documents .
" We should not have to legislate in the dark when the administration hides behind a fictitious veil of secrecy , " Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said at a Capitol Hill press conference Monday afternoon .
The Vermont Senator said he 'll begin contempt proceedings in the Judiciary Committee if the Bush administration does not comply with the subpoenas by the end of the current congressional recess .
A majority of Judiciary Committee members would have to endorse the decision to begin criminal proceedings before the full Senate could consider pursuing prosecution .
" The time is up , " Leahy told a few dozen reporters in the Judiciary Committee 's hearing room .
" We 've waited long enough . "
However , the White House has been granted a de facto extension for compliance because contempt hearings could not begin until Congress reconvenes after Labor Day .
Leahy did not specify which administration officials could face charges .
Leahy said he hoped the White House and committee would be able to avoid criminal charges by working out an agreement over access to the requested documents , but he criticized the administration 's unwillingness to negotiate or lay out reasonable accommodations in the past .
" The only accommodations we tend to get from the White House is , ' Do it our way and we 'll be happy , ' " Leahy said .
Leahy also said he had received a letter Monday from the Office of the Vice President indicating that Vice President Dick Cheney is not part of the Executive Office of the President .
Because of that , Cheney 's lawyer Shannen W. Coffin wrote , he is not required to respond to subpoenas targeting him that were sent to the President 's office and Department of Justice .
" That is wrong , " Leahy said , explaining that the subpoenas were clearly crafted to include the vice president .
Senator Leahy imposed the Monday deadline for his demand of legal justifications for the National Security Agency 's surveillance of Americans without court approval .
On Friday , White House counsel Fred Fielding told the committee he would not be producing the requested documents in time .
By withholding the documents , the White House has handicapped Congress ' ability to oversee the spying program and has delayed a permanent overhaul of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which regulates such activity , Democrats say .
Just before a monthlong recess , the House and Senate approved a temporary overhaul that dramatically expanded the NSA 's ability to eavesdrop in on Americans ' phone calls and e-mails abroad .
The temporary expansion , which Leahy opposed , expires in six months , and Leahy said he would continue to fight against a FISA overhaul unless the administration complies with the subpoena .
" I made my position clear by not voting for it , " Leahy said in response to a question from RAW STORY , but he would not predict what the Democrats as a whole would do .
In a letter to President Bush earlier this month , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) urged the White House to comply with the subpoenas and other requests for information .
" Prompt action on these requests and full access to this information is critical as the Congress considers modifications to FISA that will ensure effective intelligence gathering in a manner that protects national security and is consistent with fundamental American freedoms , " the Congressional leaders wrote .
In a separate letter to Leahy and Intelligence Committee Chairman John D. Rockefeller ( D - WV ) , Reid deferred to the chairmen on specifics of a permanent FISA update but said he would like to see a bill come before the Senate " as soon as possible . "
The House Judiciary Committee authorized contempt of Congress charges against White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolton and former - counsel Harriet Miers last month when they failed to comply with subpoenas demanding testimony about the administration 's decision to fire nine US Attorneys last year .
It 's been nearly two months since Leahy first subpoenaed the wiretapping documents on June 27th .
And more than a month has passed since the White House missed its first compliance deadline of July 18 .
Leahy had agreed to extend the initial deadline if the White House would produce the documents by the beginning of this month .
Nearly three weeks later , the White House continues to withhold the documents .
In his Friday letter , Fielding asked Leahy to grant the White House another extension until after Labor Day .
The White House lawyer said the request called for the production of " extraordinarily sensitive national security information , " and warned much of the information could be kept secret because of executive privilege .
· Generation losing out on family life , says report · Affluent children less likely to have bedroom TV
TVs and computers are the " electronic babysitters " for a generation of children who are losing out on family life and becoming more materialistic , a report says today .
The study paints a picture of a breed of " screen kids " who are spending more and more time watching TV and surfing the net in their bedrooms , unsupervised by adults .
The Watching , Wanting and Wellbeing report from the National Consumer Council found nearly half the children from better - off families surveyed had televisions in their bedrooms , compared with 97 % of the nine - to 13 - year - olds from less well - off areas .
Children from poorer areas were also six times more likely to watch TV during the evening meal .
And around a quarter of youngsters in this group admitted that they regularly watched the television at lunchtime on Sundays , compared with one in 30 children in better - off neighbourhoods .
The NCC 's report links increased TV viewing hours with greater exposure to marketing and higher levels of materialism .
The authors , Agnes Nairn , Jo Ormrod and Paul Bottomley , also found that materialistic children were more likely than others to argue with their family , have a lower opinion of their parents and suffer from low self - esteem .
NCC chief executive Ed Mayo said : " Today 's children are now ' screen kids ' .
In some streets , every bedroom has a television for children and many have a computer .
" With many children watching or surfing when they wake up , at breakfast , after school , during dinner and in bed before sleep , we need to ask whether the electronic screen has now become the electronic babysitter . "
Children in more deprived areas were most likely to watch commercial television and TV shows made for an older audience .
Twice as many children in this group said they " believed " adverts as those in more affluent areas .
Youngsters in disadvantaged areas also had greater levels of unsupervised access to television and the internet .
The research also shows that children 's TV appears to be losing its appeal to youngsters , who say they are not watching programmes targeted at a younger age group .
Fewer than half of all the 12 - to 13 - year - olds questioned listed any children 's programmes in their three favourite shows .
And children as young as nine picked out soaps , reality and horror shows among their favourites .
Dr Nairn , a researcher on children and marketing and affiliate professor of marketing at EM - Lyon Business School , told the Guardian : " The effect of so much television viewing and computer usage is that things are replacing people and family relationships are suffering .
This is a bad cycle . "
The NCC 's research - the biggest such study carried out in the UK - was based on questionnaires completed by 557 nine - to 13 - year - olds across schools ranked in the most affluent 15 % and in areas ranked in the most deprived 15 % .
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Boston police questioned a 7 - year - old boy on Tuesday who shot and killed his 8 - year - old cousin with an illegal gun , the latest example of the toll of gun violence in U.S. cities .
The family had told police three armed intruders burst into their home and gunned down LaQuarrie Jefferson , 8 , on Sunday night .
But after further interviews with family members , the truth emerged on Monday as the boy died in a hospital .
The victim ’s mother , Lakeisha Gadson , 30 , apologized for lying and said the slaying was a tragic accident .
She had briefly disappeared with the 7 - year - old and police launched a city - wide search for the two .
The boy was the youngest murder victim in Boston since 2002 , when a 3 - year - old was killed in gang gunfire .
Police spokeswoman Sharon Dottin said the 7 - year - old and Gadson were interviewed by police after voluntarily coming to police headquarters but declined to say if charges would be pressed .
The boy can be charged as a juvenile .
LaQuarrie ’s father is a convicted killer who had served time for the 1997 stabbing death of a homeless man and is now in prison for a series of 2004 armed robberies .
Boston Mayor Thomas Menino said the gun was illegal .
No one in the home was licensed to own a firearm .
Like Boston , many U.S. cities are struggling to stem a wave of violent crime and murder .
Data released by the FBI this month showed more murders and robberies in 2006 sent U.S. violent crimes higher for a second straight year .
A combination of expensive health insurance and an ever - increasing rate of obesity appear to be behind a startling fall by the US in the world rankings of life expectancy .
Despite being one of the richest countries in the world , America has dropped from 11th to 42nd place in 20 years , according to official US figures .
Dr Christopher Murray , head of the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington , said : " Something 's wrong here when one of the richest countries in the world , the one that spends the most on health care , is not able to keep up with other countries . "
The lack of health care available to many Americans - 45 million have no health insurance - is set to be one of the biggest issues in next year 's presidential election campaign .
The Democratic contenders all promise universal health care .
The decline reflects the disparity in wealth .
The life expectancy of African Americans is 73.3 compared with 77.9 for whites .
For African - American males , it is even shorter : 69.8 .
Jim McDermott , a Democratic Congressman , said : " Health care coverage is the single biggest domestic crisis facing America .
It threatens all but the wealthiest Americans .
" If you are n't part of the richest 1 % , then you know you are living one phone call , accident or illness away from financial ruin because of a medical crisis . "
Obesity is frequently cited as among the causes of lower life expectancy .
Almost a third of US adults are obese , according to the National Centre for Health Statistics , which compared US life expectancy with the rest of the world .
Paul Terry , an assistant professor of epidemiology at Emory University in Atlanta , said : " The US has the resources that allow people to get fat and lazy . "
The drop is also due to improved health care , nutrition and lifestyle elsewhere in the world .
Countries with longer life expectancy include most of Europe , Japan , Singapore and Jordan .
The US also has a higher infant mortality rate than many other countries : 6.8 deaths for every 1,000 live births .
The worst life expectancy figures are in Africa , with Swaziland at the bottom , at 34.1 years .

A giant hole in the Universe is devoid of galaxies , stars and even lacks dark matter , astronomers said on Thursday .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A giant hole in the Universe is devoid of galaxies , stars and even lacks dark matter , astronomers said on Thursday .
The team at the University of Minnesota said the void is nearly a billion light - years across and they have no idea why it is there .
“ Not only has no one ever found a void this big , but we never even expected to find one this size , ” said astronomy professor Lawrence Rudnick .
Writing in the Astrophysical Journal , Rudnick and colleagues Shea Brown and Liliya Williams said they were examining a cold spot using the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe satellite , and found the giant hole .
“ We already knew there was something different about this spot in the sky , ” Rudnick said .
The region stood out as being colder in a survey of the Cosmic Microwave Background -- the faint radio buzz left over from the Big Bang that gave birth to the Universe .
“ What we ’ve found is not normal , based on either observational studies or on computer simulations of the large - scale evolution of the Universe , ” Williams said in a statement .
The astronomers said the region even appeared to lack dark matter , which cannot be seen directly but is usually detected by measuring gravitational forces .
The void is in a region of sky in the constellation Eridanus , southwest of Orion .

James Quintiere , Ph.D. , former Chief of the Fire Science Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) , has called for an independent review of NIST ’s investigation into the collapses of the World Trade Center Towers on 9/11 .
Dr. Quintiere made his plea during his presentation , “ Questions on the WTC Investigations ” at the 2007 World Fire Safety Conference .
“ I wish that there would be a peer review of this , ” he said , referring to the NIST investigation .
“ I think all the records that NIST has assembled should be archived .
I would really like to see someone else take a look at what they ’ve done ; both structurally and from a fire point of view . ”
“ I think the official conclusion that NIST arrived at is questionable , ” explained Dr. Quintiere .
“ Let 's look at real alternatives that might have been the cause of the collapse of the World Trade Towers and how that relates to the official cause and what 's the significance of one cause versus another . ”
Dr. Quintiere , one of the world ’s leading fire science researchers and safety engineers , also encouraged his audience of fellow researchers and engineers to scientifically re-examine the WTC collapses .
“ I hope to convince you to perhaps become ' Conspiracy Theorists ' , but in a proper way , ” he said .
In his hour - long presentation , Dr. Quintiere discussed many elements of NIST ’s investigation that he found problematic .
He emphasized , “ In every investigation I ’ve taken part in , the key has been to establish a timeline .
And the timeline is established by witness accounts , by information from alarm systems , by any video that you might have of the event , and then by calculations .
And you try to put all of this together .
And if your calculations are consistent with some of these hard facts , then perhaps you can have some comfort in the results of your calculations .
I have not seen a timeline placed in the NIST report . ”
Dr. Quintiere also expressed his frustration at NIST ’s failure to provide a report on the third skyscraper that collapsed on 9/11 , World Trade Center Building 7 .
“ And that building was not hit by anything , ” noted Dr. Quintiere .
“ It ’s more important to take a look at that .
Maybe there was damage by the debris falling down that played a significant role .
But other than that you had fires burning a long time without fire department intervention .
And firefighters were in that building .
I have yet to see any kind of story about what they saw .
What was burning ?
Were photographs taken ?
Nothing ! ”
http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/IMAGES/WTC7_Collapse.wmv ]
Dr. Quintiere said he originally “ had high hopes ” that NIST would do a good job with the investigation .
“ They ’re the central government lab for fire .
There are good people there and they can do a good job .
But what I also thought they would do is to enlist the service of the ATF [ Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ] , which has an investigation force and a laboratory of their own for fire .
And I thought they would put people out on the street and get gumshoe - type information .
What prevented all of this ?
I think it ’s the legal structure that cloaks the Commerce Department and therefore NIST .
And so , instead of lawyers as if they were acting on a civil case trying to get depositions and information subpoenaed , those lawyers did the opposite and blocked everything . ”
In his presentation , Dr. Quintiere also criticized NIST ’s repeated failures to formally respond to serious questions raised about its conclusions regarding the WTC building collapses and the process it employed to arrive at those conclusions .
“ I sat through all of the NIST hearings .
I went to all of their advisory board meetings , as an observer .
I made comments at all . ”
Responding to a comment from a NIST representative in the audience , Dr. Quintiere said , “ I found that throughout your whole investigation it was very difficult to get a clear answer .
And when anyone went to your advisory panel meetings or hearings , where they were given five minutes to make a statement ; they could never ask any questions .
And with all the commentary that I put in , and I spent many hours writing things , and it would bore people if I regurgitated all of that here , I never received one formal reply . ”
Although Dr. Quintiere was strongly critical of NIST ’s conclusions and its investigatory process , he made it clear he was not a supporter of theories that the Twin Towers were brought down by pre-planted explosives .
“ If you go to World Trade Center One , nine minutes before its collapse , there was a line of smoke that puffed out .
This is one of the basis of the ‘ conspiracy theories ’ that says the smoke puffing out all around the building is due to somebody setting off an explosive charge .
Well , I think , more likely , it ’s one of the floors falling down . ”
Dr. Quintiere summarized the NIST conclusion about the cause of the collapses of the Twin Towers .
“ It says that the core columns , uninsulated due to the fact that the aircraft stripped off that insulation ; they softened in the heat of the fire and shortened and that led to the collapse .
They pulled in the external columns and it caused it to buckle .
They went on further to say that there would be no collapse if the insulation remained in place . ”
Dr. Quintiere then presented his and his students ’ research that contradicts the NIST report and points to a different cause for the collapses ; the application of insufficient fire - proofing insulation on the truss rods in the Twin Towers .
“ I suggest that there ’s an equally justifiable theory and that ’s the trusses fail as they are heated by the fire with the insulation intact .
These are two different conclusions and the accountability for each is dramatically different , ” he said .
Dr. Quintiere ’s presentation at the World Fire Safety Conference echoed his earlier statement to the U.S. House of Representatives , Committee on Science , on October 26 , 2005 , during a hearing on “ The Investigation of the World Trade Center Collapse : Findings , Recommendations , and Next Steps ” , at which he stated :
“ In my opinion , the WTC investigation by NIST falls short of expectations by not definitively finding cause , by not sufficiently linking recommendations of specificity to cause , by not fully invoking all of their authority to seek facts in the investigation , and by the guidance of government lawyers to deter rather than develop fact finding .

In the address Edwards said that the only way to force the Iraqis to take responsibility and negotiate a political solution is to begin withdrawing troops - immediately .
Edwards criticized President Bush for refusing to change " the only strategy he has ever had - more time , more troops and more war . "
Edwards concluded his remarks by reminding the American people that Congress must answer to them .
" Tell Congress you know the truth - they have the power to end this war and you expect them to use it , " said Edwards .
" When the president asks for more money and more time , Congress needs to tell him he only gets one choice : a firm timeline for withdrawal .
No timeline , no funding .
No excuses . "
Full transcript :
This week - as we will forever - we remember those lost on September 11th .
And this week , Washington refocuses on Iraq .
But the question of Iraq is separate from September 11th - as it has always been , whatever George Bush would have us believe .
Likewise , supporting our troops and pursuing a failed war are not the same things - whatever George Bush would have us believe .
All Americans honor the incredible sacrifice of our troops .
They have done everything asked of them with courage and resolve .
Now we should bring them home .
They are policing a civil war , and the only way to end that civil war is for both sides , Sunni and Shia , to take responsibility to end it by agreeing to a political solution .
And the only way to force them to take responsibility is to withdraw our troops - starting now .
Unfortunately , the president is pressing on with the only strategy he has ever had - more time , more troops , and more war .
In January , after years of evidence that military actions cannot force a political solution , the president announced a military surge to force a political solution .
In May , he vetoed a plan to end the war , demanded more time to show the surge could work , and Congress gave it to him .
Now , after General Petraeus reports the surge has produced no progress toward a political solution , what does the president want ?
More time for the surge to work , when we know it wo n't .
Our troops are stuck between a president without a plan to succeed and a Congress without the courage to bring them home .
But Congress must answer to the American people .
Tell Congress you know the truth - they have the power to end this war and you expect them to use it .
When the president asks for more money and more time , Congress needs to tell him he only gets one choice : a firm timeline for withdrawal .
No timeline , no funding .
No excuses .
It is time to end this war .
Customers have been withdrawing money despite appeals for calm
Savers have rushed to take money out of Northern Rock , amid concerns over its emergency Bank of England loan .
Its branches saw long queues of worried customers on Friday and Saturday .
Meanwhile , BBC business editor Robert Peston says a number of banks are considering a takeover of the bank - but no deal looks likely soon .
Northern Rock insists that the problems with its website are " entirely logistical " and " in no way related to the bank 's solvency " .
According to online customers the only way they can get to their money is via the internet , due to the terms of their accounts .
But demand is so high that many cannot access the site .
If we believed that Northern Rock was not solvent , we would not have allowed it to remain open
Financial Services Authority
Robert Peston 's blog Cameron hits out over crisis
" For us online savers they appear to have taken no account of the problems with their website , " Paul Hancock from west Sussex told BBC Radio Five Live .
" Their chief executive has said all the time that it 's business as normal but with their website being down it 's been far from normal for us online savers . "
Martin Lass , from Pinner in Middlesex , said he 'd recently transferred money into Northern Rock because their online systems were usually very good .
" I 'm worried about what the outcome is going to be , " he said .
" Whether they 've got the liquidity to meet all the panic demands of people like myself trying to get to the accounts and get their money to somewhere they know is safe "
Investment bank Merrill Lynch was appointed in the summer to sound out possible buyers , with interest thought to have come from overseas , says the BBC's Robert Peston .
Reputation
But he said that given how difficult and expensive it is to borrow from the money markets and banks , no firm was keen to pay for Northern Rock 's assets of about £ 113bn .
The emergency lending facility granted to Northern Rock by the Bank of England would also have to be removed if there were a takeover .
" If it did n't do that , the Bank of England could be accused of subsidising the sale of Northern Rock and propping up the value of Northern Rock 's shares and bonds , which is the last thing it wants to do , " he said .
Northern Rock has struggled since money markets seized up over the summer .
The bank is not short of assets , but they are tied up in loans to home owners .
Because of the global credit crunch it has found it difficult to borrow the cash to run its day - to - day operations .
Despite reassurances over the safety of their savings , customers have taken out well over £ 1bn in the last few days .
Northern Rock has not confirmed how much money has been withdrawn from branch savings accounts .
Chancellor Alistair Darling and City watchdog the Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) have tried to reassure customers that the bank was still functioning .
The bank says difficulties with the bank 's website " are in no way related to the bank 's solvency or its underlying ability to deliver funds to savers who wish to withdraw " .
Northern Rock spokesman Brian Giles said the website was running slowly owing to a high number of customers , and insisted : " There is no gate blocking anyone from accessing their account . "
As SCO faced a bankruptcy judge for the first time today , a recently filed 10 - Q form reveals that the company doubts its ability to survive if it is required to make significant payments to Novell for UNIX licensing royalties that a judge ruled were wrongfully retained .
The SEC filling paints a grim picture of SCO 's prospects for recovery .
" As a result of both the Court 's August 10 , 2007 ruling and our entry into Chapter 11 , there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern , " reads the filing .
" If a significant cash payment [ to Novell ] is required , or significant assets are put under a constructive trust , the carrying amount of our long - lived assets may not be recovered . "
The 10 - Q also provides more insight into just how badly SCO 's UNIX business is failing .
SCO 's UNIX revenue decreased by 37 percent for the three months ended July 31 , the filing shows .
" We do not have a history of profitable operations and our cash resources are limited , " warns SCO .
SCO also showed up in bankruptcy court today , and Groklaw has published some reader narratives which describe today 's proceedings .
According to the reports , little of actual relevance has transpired thus far , but the stage has been set , and the initial statements have been made .
The judge granted SCO 's request for permission to spend approximately $ 60,000 on taxes , $ 6,000 on utilities debt to keep the lights on , and $ 20,000 on accounting temp workers because the company 's entire accounting department has already fled or been laid off .
SCO claimed that its new software offerings in the mobile market , which involve a mobile phone group messaging service and mobile UNIX administration tools , could enable it to compete directly with companies like Research in Motion and Motorola .
The company attributed its steady decline in revenue to competition from Linux , which it described as a " knock off " of its own UNIX products .
While describing SCO 's prospects for growth , a company representative claimed that seven out of ten retail systems utilize Novell technologies , and then corrected himself , saying that he meant SCO .
According to a Groklaw reader present at the hearing , this little gaffe elicited laughter from those present in the courtroom .
A Novell representative also spoke and explained that under the terms of SCO 's agreement with Novell , 95 percent of the revenue generated by SCO 's licensing agreements for original UNIX intellectual property belong to Novell 's and should not be used to keep SCO running .
Novell wants the money now , but the judge declined Novell 's request because he did n't want to give preferential treatment to Novell over other debtors who " could be in the same position . "
The bench trial that was originally scheduled to begin yesterday has been stayed , but the judge told Novell that it could move to have the stay removed .
The court proceedings and 10 - Q filing paint a dire picture for SCO .
It looks as though the serial litigator has virtually no chance of recovery and will likely have to dissolve if forced to pay a significant portion of the $ 30 million claimed by Novell .
Media center maker endorses Torrentspy and Mininova
So you got yourself a nice connected home theater setup .
A fat media server with up to a Terabyte of hard disk space .
A media receiver that streams HD data to your living room .
And of course a nice , big flat panel TV .
So where do you get the media to enjoy with this setup ?
Well , of course Torrentspy and Minnova .
At least that 's what the media center maker Helios Labs is suggesting .
Helios Labs has recently been running ads through Google Adwords , some of which appeared on this site , that read :
The ad also shows the logos of Torrentspy Isohunt and Mininova , as well as a TV screen with images from the popular TV shows House and Heroes .
The Helios labs website is n't that blunt and merely suggests their products are good for people who have " hundreds of gigs of downloaded media : including videos , music , and images " .
Of course this is n't the first time device makers have been courting downloaders .
In fact , many electronics makers have been running ads on Torrent websites for years .
They tend to blame ad agencies for these campaigns , but of course it 's only logical that they would go where their customers are .
You just usually do n't expect them to be as honest about it as Helios Labs .
The hill of Kronos , overlooking Olympia , was engulfed by fire
Flames licked the edges of the original Olympic stadium and scorched the yard of the museum , home to one of Greece 's greatest archaeological collections .
Fires have ravaged large parts of Greece , affecting the Peloponnese , areas around Athens and Evia island .
On Sunday five bodies were found on Evia , bringing the death toll to 56 .
Five fire engines are protecting the archaeological museum , which houses sculptures from the Temple of Zeus and artefacts from the ancient Olympics , and anti-fire systems have been switched on , according to the secretary general of the culture ministry , Christos Zahopoulos .
A new fire protection and sprinkler system was installed at the Unesco World Heritage site for the 2004 Athens Olympics .
Culture Minister George Voulgarakis has arrived in Olympia to oversee the emergency effort .
" We do n't know exactly how much damage there is in the Olympia area , but the important thing is that the museum is as it was and the archaeological site will not have any problem , " he told Associated Press news agency as he visited the area .
A fire brigade spokesman said that six planes , two helicopters , 15 fire engines and 45 firemen had participated in the effort to protect the site .
However , villages and woodlands in the surrounding area were not so fortunate .
The BBC's Malcolm Brabrant in the nearby village of Pelopi says that village after village succumbed to the flames and people began to flee for their lives .
OLYMPIA
An ancient Greek religious site dating back 10 centuries before Christ Home of the ancient Olympics , first held in 8th Century BC Was location of giant ivory and gold Statue of Zeus , one of seven wonders of the world Olympics continued until banned by Roman Emperor Theodosius I in 394 AD Place where Olympic flame is still lit
Inside a fire starter 's mind
One local villager , speaking to Greek television by telephone , told of the battle to save homes :
" We have no water , we are at God 's mercy , " they said .
" Please tell someone we are putting out the fire with our own hands , we have no help .
The village will disappear from the map . "
Angela Katsiki , a resident of the village of Kolliri , near to Olympia , told the BBC that she was devastated about the damage the fire had caused to the surrounding area .
" Horrified , absolutely ... sad , really really sad .
This is the worse I 've seen - I 've seen other fires here , but this is the worse .
It 's completely destroyed the area . "
Sun obscured
The rapidly advancing fires caught many people unawares .
Those who left the decision to flee too late were caught in their houses , cars , or as they stumbled through olive groves .
On Sunday , officials announced that five more people had been killed by fires in Evia , an island north of the capital Athens .
Towns on the island of Evia were being evacuated on Sunday , with ferries carrying people to the mainland near Athens .
" The fire is racing towards the town , " a resident of the island town of Aliveri told Greek TV .
This is complete hell .
The front is 30 km long and has now reached the first houses
Petros Filippou
Mayor of Kalyvia , Athens
In pictures : Fires unabated Witnesses tell of fire horror
" We are leaving or else we will burn to death .
There is no one to help us , " he said .
Meanwhile Athens itself was shrouded in smoke that obscured the sun as several fires threatened the city 's outskirts .
Houses and industrial buildings in the suburbs of Keratea and Kalyvia were destroyed .
" This is complete hell , " said Kalyvia mayor Petros Filippou .
" The front is 30 km ( 19 miles ) long and has now reached the first houses .
That 's it . "
At least 39 people were reported to have been killed in the worst affected region , around the town of Zaharo in the western Peloponnese , by a fire that broke out on Friday and quickly spread .
Another four bodies were discovered in the central Peloponnese region of Arcadia .
International effort
The Greek PM has implied that many fires were started deliberately .
In a nationally televised address , Costas Karamanlis said : " So many fires breaking out simultaneously in so many parts of the country cannot be a coincidence .
The Greek fires are seen from space in this Nasa picture
A 65 - year - old man has been charged with arson and murder relating to a fire which killed six people in Areopolis , in the far south of Greece .
Two youths were also detained on suspicion of arson in the northern city of Kavala .
Mr Karamanlis has declared a nationwide state of emergency and said the country had to " mobilise all means and forces to face this disaster " .
" Fires are burning in more than half the country , " fire department spokesman Nikos Diamandis said .
" This is definitely an unprecedented disaster for Greece . "
Emergency workers and fire - fighting planes from other European Union countries have joined the battle against the fires , and more help is expected from countries outside the bloc .
" Thirty - one planes and helicopters from various European countries and from Israel will be sent .
We also have an offer of assistance from the American and Russian governments with whom I communicated yesterday evening , " Greek Foreign Affairs Minister Dora Bakoyannis said .
先日のLL魂後の飲み会の席にて、id:amachangとかid:masa_edwとかid:scinfaxiと話をしていたときに、途中で話が切れてしまっていたことをWebの虚空に向かって叫んでみる。
Scheme ( Gauche ) は、自分にとっては帰るべき家のようなものだ。プログラミングをするにしても、Gaucheだけに留まることはできないし、留まる気もない。C、Java、PHP、Ruby、、、色々な言語を必要に迫られて使ったり、あるいはFortressみたいな言語に冒険してみたりもする。でも、それは帰るべき家があるからこそ冒険ができるんだ。自分が初めて心から好きになれた言語であり、最もいごこちのよい言語があるからこそ、プログラミングが楽しい。大変なときは、GaucheのREPLに帰ればほっと一息つくことができる。
なぜSchemeが好きなのか、ということに理由はない。便利な機能や、Schemeの強力な点を挙げることはできるが、それは重要じゃない。Schemeに不向きな問題をSchemeで解こうとは思わない。重要なのは、自分がいごこちがよいと感じるかどうかなんだ。自分の本能がそれを欲っするから。それだけでいい。
プログラミングという作業が好きで、言語は単なる道具である、という人もいるだろう。自分も振り返れば、Schemeに出会うまではそうだったと思う。でも、いまはSchemeという愛すべき言語と出会えて、そしてGaucheという素晴しい処理系に出会えて、以前よりも幸せになれたと感じてる。
つまり何が言いたいかっていうと、プログラマならば自分が心から愛することができる言語を見つければ、今よりも幸せになれると思うよ、ってこと。別にSchemeじゃなくなっていい。アセンブリだっていい。自分の愛することができる言語に出会えるってことは、とっても幸せなことなんだ！感謝すべきことなんだ！

Presidential candidate and senator Barack Obama said something earlier this week worth noting â€ ” and the audience he said it to as well .
Sen .
Obama stood before a sea of Wall Street executives at Nasdaq headquarters and told them to behave :
Our free market was never meant to be a free license to take whatever you can get , however you can get it .
And so from time to time , we have put in place certain rules of the road to make competition fair and open and honest .
According to The New York Times , he “ described this summerâ€™s subprime lending crisis as a case study of greed among mortgage lenders and the agencies that provide information about them . ”
He argued for protections of the middle class and additional oversight of those agencies that rate credit .
If more Americans were armed with this kind of information before they purchased risky mortgage loans , the current crisis might not have happened .
Not being an economist , it ’s beyond my ken to note whether what he plans to do if elected president concerning oversight of the marketplace will be appropriate .
That he said it at all , and that he said it on their turf to Wall Street securities and investment executives , is remarkable .
But what ’s stunning is that Sen .
Obama has raised more than $ 3.3 million from the securities and investment industry in the first six months of this year , second only to presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani .
That ’s big news in the “ bite the hand that feeds you ” department .
Cynics might say : “ Yeah , he said it , but it was wink , wink , nudge , nudge .
He ’s just pandering to that very middle class he says he wants to protect .
All he wants is their votes . ”
Perhaps .
But at the moment , he ’s succeeding in getting enough of my attention to keep better track of what he says and does .
Fuzzlight high output led grow light is perfect for your DIY greenhouse hydroponic system gardening .
The ultimate ratio of red+blue light .
NOT
All LED grow lights perform the same ig the lumens are identical and all conditions are the same such as nutrient solution , air mixture co2 systems .
becuase nobody has emitters that put out optimum photosynthetic active radiation ( PAR ) for the types of chlorophyll .
Fuzzlights are superior becuase all the rest are spotlight lamps which do not mic the red and blue spectrum led light properly .
The best light is outdoors .
A perfect hydroponics setup would be led grow lamps inside a greenhouse and timed to turn on at different times of the day .
Fuzzlight is a replacement for poor quality high pressure sodium bulbs or metal halide grow lamps .

A special report on the turmoil in the world 's financial markets
The tremors in financial markets have gone far beyond their beginnings in the US subprime mortgage sector , and indeed far beyond the borders of the US .
The full impact on the markets , and the repercussions on the global economy , remain unclear , but we can sketch out three broad scenarios :
• Scenario 1 . The Economist Intelligence Unit 's central forecast , to which we attach a probability of 60 % , sees the impact being contained by timely monetary policy action , with only a modest effect on the global economy .
• Scenario 2 .
Our main risk scenario , with a 30 % probability , envisages the US falling into recession , with substantial fallout in the rest of the world .
• Scenario 3 .
Should the US enter recession , another , darker scenario arises : that corrective action fails , and severe economic repercussions cascade from the US into the world economy with devastating effect .
We attach only a 10 % probability to this outcome , but the potential impact is so severe that it warrants careful consideration .
Since scenario 1 informs our regular output and Scenario 3 has a low probability , the bulk of the report focuses on scenario 2 .

Government Must Respond by August 31
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : media@aclu.org
WASHINGTON - In an unprecedented order , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ( FISC ) has required the U.S. government to respond to a request it received last week by the American Civil Liberties Union for orders and legal papers discussing the scope of the government 's authority to engage in the secret wiretapping of Americans .
According to the FISC 's order , the ACLU 's request " warrants further briefing , " and the government must respond to it by August 31 .
The court has said that any reply by the ACLU must be filed by September 14 .
" Disclosure of these court orders and legal papers is essential to the ongoing debate about government surveillance , " said Anthony D. Romero , Executive Director of the ACLU .
" We desperately need greater transparency and public scrutiny .
We 're extremely encouraged by today 's development because it means that , at long last , the government will be required to defend its contention that the orders should not be released . "
The ACLU filed the request with the FISC following Congress ' recent passage of the so - called " Protect America Act , " a law that vastly expands the Bush administration 's authority to conduct warrantless wiretapping of Americans ' international phone calls and e-mails .
In their aggressive push to justify passing this ill - advised legislation , the administration and members of Congress made repeated and veiled references to orders issued by the FISC earlier this year .
The legislation is set to expire in six months unless it is renewed .
" These court orders relate to the circumstances in which the government should be permitted to use its profoundly intrusive surveillance powers to intercept the communications of U.S. citizens and residents , " said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU 's National Security Project .
" The debate about this issue should not take place in a vacuum .
It 's imperative that the public have access to basic information about what the administration has proposed and what the intelligence court has authorized . "
FISC orders have played a critical role in the evolution of the government 's surveillance activities over the past six years .
After September 11 , President Bush authorized the National Security Agency ( NSA ) to inaugurate a program of warrantless wiretapping inside the United States .
In January 2007 , however , just days before an appeals court was to hear the government 's appeal from a judicial ruling that had found the NSA program to be illegal in a case brought by the ACLU , Attorney General Gonzales announced that the NSA program would be discontinued .
Gonzales explained that the change was made possible by FISC orders issued on January 10 , 2007 , which he characterized as " complex " and " innovative . "
Those orders are among the documents requested by the ACLU .
Since January 2007 , government officials have spoken publicly about the January 10 orders in congressional testimony , to the media and in legal papers - the orders remaining secret all the while .
They have also indicated that the FISC issued other orders in the spring that restricted the administration 's surveillance activities .
House Minority Leader John Boehner stated that the FISC had issued a ruling prohibiting intelligence agents from intercepting foreign - to - foreign calls passing through the United States .
To a large extent , it was the perception that the FISC had issued an order limiting the administration 's surveillance authority that led Congress to pass the new legislation expanding the government 's surveillance powers .
Yet the order itself , like the January 2007 order , has remained secret .
The ACLU 's request to the FISC acknowledges that the FISC 's docket includes a significant amount of material that is properly classified .
The ACLU argues , however , that the release of court orders and opinions would not raise any security concern to the extent that these records address purely legal issues about the scope of the government 's wiretap authority , and points out that the FISC has released such orders and opinions before .
The ACLU is seeking release of all information in those judicial orders and legal papers the court determines , after independent review , to be unclassified or improperly classified .
A copy of the FISA court order , the ACLU 's motion to the FISC , as well as information about the ACLU 's lawsuit against the NSA and other related materials are available online at : www.aclu.org/spying
In addition to Jaffer , lawyers on the case are Steven R. Shapiro , Melissa Goodman , and Alexa Kolbi-Molinas of the ACLU and Art Spitzer of the ACLU of the National Capital Area .
The brain , moreover , has evolved to make snap judgments about causation , and will leap to conclusions well before logic can be applied .
In an experiment presented last fall at the Society for Neuroscience meeting , Ben Parris of the University of Exeter in England presented magnetic resonance imaging scans taken from the brains of people watching magic tricks .
In one , the magician performed a simple sleight of hand : he placed a coin in his palm , closed his fingers over it , then opened his hand to reveal that the coin was gone .
Dr. Parris and his colleagues found spikes of activity in regions of the left hemisphere of the brain that usually become engaged when people form hypotheses in uncertain situations .
These activations occur so quickly , other researchers say , that they often link two events based on nothing more than coincidence : “ I was just thinking about looking up my high school girlfriend when out of the blue she called me , ” or , “ The day after I began praying for a quick recovery , she emerged from the coma . ”
For people who are generally uncertain of their own abilities , or slow to act because of feelings of inadequacy , this kind of thinking can be an antidote , a needed activator , said Daniel M. Wegner , a professor of psychology at Harvard .
( Dr. Wegner was a co-author of the voodoo study , with Kimberly McCarthy of Harvard and Sylvia Rodriguez of Princeton . )
“ I deal with students like this all the time and I say , ‘ Let ’s get you overconfident , ’ ” Dr. Wegner said .
“ This feeling that your thoughts can somehow control things can be a needed feeling ” — the polar opposite of the helplessness , he added , that so often accompanies depression .
Magical thinking is most evident precisely when people feel most helpless .
Giora Keinan , a professor at Tel Aviv University , sent questionnaires to 174 Israelis after the Iraqi Scud missile attacks of the 1991 gulf war .
Those who reported the highest level of stress were also the most likely to endorse magical beliefs , like “ I have the feeling that the chances of being hit during a missile attack are greater if a person whose house was attacked is present in the sealed room , ” or “ To be on the safe side , it is best to step into the sealed room right foot first . ”
“ It is of interest to note , ” Dr. Keinan concluded , “ that persons who hold magical beliefs or engage in magical rituals are often aware that their thoughts , actions or both are unreasonable and irrational .
Despite this awareness , they are unable to rid themselves of such behavior . ”
On April 21 , 2020 , the West Virginia Supreme Court released its decision upholding the state ’s right - to - work law , the Workplace Freedom Act .
The law was passed in 2016 , but after its passage , the West Virginia AFL - CIO and other labor unions sued the state , arguing that the law was unconstitutional .
A group of dissident lawmakers led by Representatives Ron Kind , Democrat of Wisconsin , and Jeff Flake , Republican of Arizona , is still pushing a plan to curtail the subsidies sharply .
But they have been largely outmuscled by the Agriculture Committee .
It 46 members are slightly more than 10 percent of the House but their districts received more than 40 percent of all farm subsidies from 2003 to 2005 , according to a database compiled by the Environmental Working Group , which opposes the subsidies .
Critics in Congress include fiscal conservatives who deride the payments as wasteful government spending and liberals who call them corporate welfare for agribusiness .
All say the measure will simply perpetuate the overly generous subsidy system , at a point when American farmers are well - positioned to weather changes .
“ When farm prosperity is as good as it is right now , this is the time to reform , ” said Representative Paul D. Ryan , Republican of Wisconsin and a member of the dissident group .
“ If we ca n’t reform these farm programs at this moment in our history , we will never be able to do it . ”
The group has proposed an amendment to the farm bill that would cut subsidies and increase spending on environmental conservation , rural development and nutrition programs , including food banks .
It would end subsidies to farmers earning more than $ 250,000 a year , similar to the $ 200,000 cap proposed by the Bush administration .
It would also substantially limit payments that farmers receive under guaranteed loan programs .
The effort by Mr. Kind has exposed divisions among House Democrats , some of whom argue that he could cost the party its new majority .
The fear is that freshmen Democrats from rural swing districts could lose their seats if voters blamed them for lower farm subsidies .
Mr. Kind rejected such assertions .
“ The vast majority of our new members benefit from our proposal , ” he said .
The White House , in a statement Wednesday , said that Mr. Bush would veto the farm bill in its current form because it was too expensive and would require raising taxes while fixing the subsidies .
SkySails fuel conservation system
SkySails , based in Hamburg , Germany are developing an international patent pending propulsion system , harnessing the power of wind .
World trade relies on cargo vessels to transport good around the globe with 98.2 % of all intercontinental goods carried via sea , and 98 % of all cargo vessels powered by diesel engines .
All this equates to the fact 25 billion Euros worth of fuel was bought in the year 2002 alone .
The innovative SkySails system saves a considerable amount of fuel over long voyages , therefore cutting costs and helping the environment .
The Skysails system consists of a large towing kite filled with compressed air , and an autopilot and wind - optimised route management system .
The features of the SkySails technology enable ships to use wind power with entirely novel performance characteristics .
The optimally shaped aerofoil profiles of the Skysail , available with sail areas of up to 5,000 square metres can be be released to a fully adjustable height of 500m .
The high altitude operation of the Skysail is important as wind speed increases at height , even when little wind is perceived at sea level sufficient wind energy is available higher in the sky .
This combined with refined weather route management systems ensures adherence to schedules is easy .
A ship with a SkySails system does not heel , i.e. it does not tilt to the side with the force of the wind .
The ship and its crew are not put at risk .
Any potential danger to the ship is excluded by the aerodynamic autopilot force control .
Because the SkySails system operates fully automatically the existing crew is sufficient for the operation of the ship and the sail .
During flying operations an autopilot controls the handling of the Skysail .
Almost every sea -going vessel or cruising vessel as well as motor and sailing yachts can be equipped or retrofitted with the SkySails system .
And when not in use the Skysail can be folded and stored in any compact location .
Tests of the SkySails system at the Hamburg Ship Model Basin in back in February 2003 helped find the ideal towing point of the kite on the ship .
Interaction of the cargo vessel hull with the Skysail was also investigated .
To do this the model cargo vessel was towed through the 300 metre long towing basin .
These tests formed the basis for later full size tests on the Baltic sea .
Some 50 million Euros was invested in developing the SkySails technology before the system was made commercially available .

The condescension to and mockery of the sole Republican candidate who seems to care about individual liberty has begun to tick me off .
Chris Matthews can be heard groaning " Oh , God , " after Paul spoke of the " original intent " of the Founders with respect to the Constitution .
And in the YouTube clip below , Rudy Giuliani actually seems to be guffawing after Paul 's defense of habeas corpus .
I 'm glad Paul 's supporters are fighting back on the web .
He deserves more respect than he has gotten thus far , not least because compared to the pandering of his competitors , Paul actually seems to believe what he says .
And what he says has more to do with conservatism than the crap the rest of them are peddling .
Here 's a clip worth watching again :
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
You may remember a video shown on Autoblog some years ago ( Obama was still in the U.S. Senate – Ed. ) where someone poked a hole in a tennis ball , lined up the hole in the ball with the keyhole of a car , pressed really hard , and the door unlocked .
After reading your comments from that post we decided that it was definitely worth testing to see if this tennis ball technique works for ourselves .
One of the commenters on this subject used pressurized air to attempt unlocking four different doors to no avail , and another used a plunger ( we wish we had video of that ) , but no one tried a tennis ball like the video in question .
Take a look at the video below to see what happened when we tested the use a tennis ball to unlock your car trick .
We tried it on four different vehicles , and used two tennis balls , each with a different - sized hole in it to verify our findings .
Check it out , and if you have a tennis ball and a screwdriver lying around the house , try it yourself and let us know in the comments if you got the same result we did .
We 're guessing you probably will .

Thanks to nine processors on a single silicon die , the Cell Broadband Enginea processor jointly designed by IBM , Sony , and Toshiba and used in the PlayStation 3  promises lots of power .
The good news is that the Cell is really fast :
It provides enough computational power to replace a small high - performance cluster .
The bad news is that it 's difficult to program : Software that exploits the Cell 's potential requires a development effort significantly greater than traditional platforms .
If you expect to port your application efficiently to the Cell via recompilation or threads , think again .
In this article , we present strategies we 've used to make a Breadth - First Search on graphs as fast as possible on the Cell , reaching a performance that 's 22 times higher than Intel 's Woodcrest , comparable to a 256 - processor BlueGene / L supercomputer and all this with just with a single Cell processor !
Some techniques ( loop unrolling , function inlining , SIMDization ) are familiar ; others ( bulk synchronous parallelization , DMA traffic scheduling , overlapping of computation and transfers ) are less so .
Computing Is Changing
In the last 10 years , processors are faster mainly due to increasing clock frequencies or more complex architectures .
The trend can't continue because fabrication technologies are reaching physical limits .
Transistors are getting so small that a gate is only a few atoms thick .
Additionally , smaller circuits means higher heat production :
It 's more and more difficult to remove heat fast enough to avoid circuit burndown .
This is why the computing community is so interested in multicore architectures : IBM is pushing the Cell , and AMD and Intel quad - core processors .
Intel also has shown its TeraScale prototype , a single chip with 80 cores .
Architectures are changing fast , and developers have to keep up .

My favourite scheme implementation is scheme48 , which takes its name from its being initially implemented in 48 hours by Richard Kelsey and Jonathan Rees in August 1986 .
They used Common Lisp on a Symbolics 3600 and Maclisp on a PDP - 10 .
Now , thanks to Jonathan Tang ’s tutorial , you can write yourself a scheme in 48 hours , but using Haskell instead of Lisp .
The tutorial is intended as an introduction to Haskell for Schemers ( and ( brave ) programmers in general ) wanting to get started in the purest member of the functional family .
And it is extremely fun , for instead of following the boring language features overview way , it plunges right on in interesting , hands - on stuff like parser combinators ( one of the most beautiful applications of Haskell , if you ask me ) or monads .
The lessons include exercises , so that you have really no excuse for not learning Haskell once and for all .
Believe me , it ’s good for your ( mental ) health .
If you ’re totally new to Haskell and find the pace of Jonathan ’s tutorial a bit hard to follow , you may start with a tour of the Haskell syntax and the Hitchikers ’ guide to Haskell , after making sure , of course , that you have your towel at hand .
As for me , well i’ve been planning to learn Haskell for some years now and , since i happen to love books , i have accumulated a little ( but selected )
Haskell library , together with a sort of learning roadmap that , unfortunately , i have yet to complete .
Just in case the above links whetted your appetite and you happen to have more time than i do , here you have my bookworm guide to Haskell enlightenment .
The little Haskeller
There are many introductory Haskell books , but i was ( at the time i started learning ) keen of those providing also a good basis on functional programming ( which was a totally new world for me at the time ) .
Therefore , my first Haskell book , and still a wholehearted recommendation , was Richard Bird and Philip Wadler ‘s Introduction to Functional Programming Using Haskell , one of the most elegant books on programming i’ve ever read .
One of the nicest things about writing Haskell code is that it ’s the closest one can probably get to writing pure maths while programming .
Thus , learning Haskell is an excellent way to learn more about maths and logic .
If that sounds to you like doubling the fun ( and you ’re not yet a math wizard ) , The Haskell Road to Logic , Maths and Programming ( see also this extensive review ( PDF ) ) by Jan van Eijck and Kees Doets is definitely the book for you .
Its purpose is to teach logic and mathematical reasoning in practice , and to connect logical reasoning with Haskell programming .
And , in my opinion , it does a pretty good job at that .
Although it begins with the very basics , it includes chapters on far from trivial ( i.e. , fun ! ) stuff like , for instace , corecursion or Cantor sets .
And i found amazing how natural it was to express logical and mathematical ideas in Haskell .
But maybe you prefer to learn a bit of applied Computer Science , instead of abstract maths , with Haskell .
No problem : just grab a copy of Fethi Rabhi and Guy Lapalme ‘s Algorithms , a functional programming approach , which challenges the academic establishment by teaching algorithms using Haskell , that is , in a purely functional context .
Revisiting classical ( and apparently imperative ) algorithms like sorting , tree and graph traversal or dynamic programming methods under a functional light is a refresing experience , and an eye - opener : the fact that all the typical algorithms are covered in just 256 pages is a testament to the authors ’ claim that functional programming leads to smaller , clearer and more elegant program .
Besides , as you probably know , Haskell features lazy evaluation , which poses entirely new ( and pretty instructive ) challenges when it comes to evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm .
The seasoned haskeller
Once you ’re comfortable with the language and have learnt all about monads , the best thing to do is to study non-trivial Haskell applications .
To that end , you can hardly find a better book than The fun of programming , a Festschrift celebrating Richard Bird ’s sixtieth birthday .
Including thirteen chapters by luminaries in the field , this book describes fun applications on such fun things as musical composition or graphical design , as well as covering advanced programming techniques such as data structures design , interpreters or optimization .
Amazing .
I also own a copy of Paul Hudak ‘s The Haskell School of Expression , which is often recommended as as Haskell primer .
In my opinion , it goes too quickly into the nitty - gritty details of ( music and multimedia ) implementations to be a good first book , but it is probably a good second book on Haskell programming .
But that ’s just me : as you can read in the review above , some people have diverging opinions .
The fun never ends …
After all these readings , and a bit more about monads , you ’ll begin to feel an expert , and may be interested in more advanced stuff .
I ’ve got a couple of books reserved for that moment .
The first one is The Algebra of Programming , by Richard Bird and Oege de Moor , and its purpose , simply stated , is to show how to calculate programs algebraically using and old friend of ours : category theory , including the bananas that will be the main theme of my second post on these matters .
There you ’ll find and in - depth , abstract treatment of algorithmic strategies with an eye of correctness proofs .
Although heavy on theory , there are interesting applications of this algebra of programming , like the conversion between binary and decimal numbers in TeX , the best way of drawing a cylinder in LaTeX or good data compression algorithms .
A slight nuisance is that this book uses an old Haskell dialect ( a precursor , actually ) called Gopher , but the conversion to modern notation is pretty straightforward .
Finally , anyone serious about algorithms and data structures should read Chris Okasaki ’s Purely Functional Data Structures , and amazing tour on advanced algorithimcs using functional programming languages , with source code in SML and Haskell .
The exposition is extremely elegant and synthetic , and i’ve spent many , many hours immersed in its 220 pages ( i ca n’t think of any other programming book with a better signal to noise ratio , really ) .
That ’s it .
I just hope that 48 - hours days are invented any time soon .
Happy reading !
Much to the annoyance of animal welfare groups , men from a rural Scottish community will this weekend keep alive a tradition dating back more than 500 years .
The annual slaughter of thousands of juvenile seabirds has been likened by animal rights activists to the clubbing to death of baby seals by Canadian hunters , yet they are powerless to stop it .
For centuries the men of Ness on Lewis in the Western Isles have embarked on an annual expedition every August to scale the rocky 300ft cliffs of the remote island of Sula Sgeir and harvest the birds , which are considered a culinary delicacy .
It has been a rite of passage for generations of the Gaelic - speaking fishermen since the early 15th century , when guga , as the gannets are known locally , was a popular dish among the island communities , which relied on the salted birds as a staple part of their winter diets .
Each year about 10 men sail the 60 miles across the rough Atlantic waters to the rocky outcrop and spend a fortnight on the uninhabited island .
Using 10ft poles with nooses on the end , they pluck the birds from their nests on the cliffs before throttling , gutting and salting them .
They are then preserved in an empty beer keg filled with pickling brine .
Once the catch is complete , the men return as heroes to Ness , where they are met at the quayside by their friends and neighbours who , despite the grotesque olive - green and stubbly appearance of the gutted gugas , queue for a share of the harvest for about £ 20 a brace .
However , many islanders admit that it is an acquired taste .
Usually boiled , the rich oily meat tastes much better than it smells and , devotees say , is best served with potatoes and a glass of milk .
Although the hunt is licensed and the islanders ' right to carry it out is enshrined in law , the expedition to the narrow , guano - covered rock with a ruined chapel built by an old hermit and a few prehistoric stone shelters remains controversial .
For years animal welfare campaigners have tried to have it banned .
Despite keeping the exact date of their departure a secret , John McFarlane , the leader of the hunt this year , confirmed that by this morning the team will be on the island and keeping tradition alive .
' As far as I 'm concerned we 're licensed to do it and that 's the end of the story , ' he said in response to campaigners who call the hunt barbaric and outdated .
Western Isles MSP and resident of the Isle of Lewis Alasdair Allan said the hunt enjoyed his full support .
' It 's not being done for sport , it 's being done for food purposes , ' said Allan , a member of the Scottish National Party .
' The arguments against it are essentially vegetarian .
People can be vegetarian if they want , but I do n't think they should impose that on other people .
They should be careful not to associate it with hunting or sport , because that 's not what this is .
The guga hunt is part of the tradition of the island .
It 's continuing existence is because it 's a traditional food , traditional to the island , a traditional activity .
It 's not done out of entertainment , but because it 's a local delicacy and a foodstuff . '
However , Advocates for Animals has called on the Scottish Executive to stop what it has labelled a ' barbaric ' tradition .
' We believe this is a brutal practice , ' said Ross Minett , the group 's campaigns director .
' We do n't believe it can be justified on the grounds of tradition .
It is n't right in the 21st century in a civilised country that young birds should be killed by strangling , clubbing or having their necks broken .
' We hope that the new SNP Scottish government will be prepared to stop giving the annual licence that allows this slaughter to continue . '
Sula Sgeir is home to about 10,400 breeding pairs of gannets , of which the islanders harvest no more than 2,000 juveniles each year , the maximum specified in the licence issued by the Scottish Executive .
Since 1954 , when the Protection of Birds
Act made it illegal to harm the gannet population , the men of Ness have been granted special permission to continue with their harvest , with the backing of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals .
Both organisations believe the hunt does not cause unnecessary suffering to the birds and do not share the same concerns expressed by Advocates for Animals and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( Peta ) which have been encouraging supporters to lobby the Scottish Parliament .
' Clubbing helpless baby chicks like cave people is right out of the stone ages , ' said Anita Singh , spokeswoman for Peta .
' Baby gannets may not be as cute and cuddly as puppies and kittens , but they too suffer and feel pain .
It 's time to relegate this cruel , outdated activity to the history books , where it belongs .
There is desperate need to protect these animals .
We are encouraging all caring members of the public to raise their voices in protest at this cruelty by contacting the Scottish Parliament . '
However , it is unlikely the Scottish Executive will intervene , as its own advisory group , Scottish Natural Heritage , has said there are no grounds for trying to stop the practice .
' We would only interfere if it was shown to be hitting the gannet population as a whole and was no longer a sustainable harvest , but there 's been nothing to indicate that is the case , ' said a spokesman .
Five centuries of guga hunting
· Guga is the Gaelic for the pressed , salted and pickled chick of the gannet , or solan goose .
A century ago , islanders culled guga from all over the Hebridean coast .
· It has been variously described as ' unspeakable ' and tasting like something between rotten leather and turkey laced with motor oil .
Gordon Ramsay declared it a cross between duck and mackerel .
· The sturdiest 10 men of Ness - as far north - west as you can go in Europe , at the Butt of Lewis - have a special licence from the Scottish executive to continue the tradition .
Each summer they sail for six hours across the Atlantic to the remote rock of Sula Sgeir and land by leaping against a small cliff from a rocking boat .
· The ancient drystone cells on Sula Sgeir are so earwig - infested that the men sleep with scarves wound around their heads .
· The cull is ancient - in 1549 , Dean Munro wrote that the men of Ness would ' fetche hame thair boatful of dry wild fowls with wild fowl fedderis ' .
· The baby gannets , pictured , are caught on open cliffs using a long pole .
It requires agility and nerve .
· In the 1980s a hunter was lost overboard but the most famous drama was in 1912 , when the expedition did not return .
A search patrol reported the rock was deserted and Ness mourned but several weeks later the men returned .
It turned out the rescue party had searched the wrong island .
· These days , locals queue on the quayside for the hunters who sell the guga , rationed to a brace per person , for £ 20 .
· The practice has been attacked by animal rights activists for years .
' When the English stop killing five million turkeys for Christmas , ' a supporter declared two decades ago , ' we 'll stop catching guga . '
· Guga is boiled and the rich , oily meat is traditionally eaten with potatoes and a glass of milk .
An old joke goes : ' To best enjoy guga , boil it with a stone .
Boil it until the stone is tender .
And then eat the stone . '

They may not have been the kinds of reaction that Ms. Mealy , a Detroit - born former transit worker serving her first term , was expecting .
“ They buried the n-word , but what about the other words that really affect women , such as ‘ b , ’ and ‘ ho ’ ?
That ’s a vile attack on our womanhood , ” Ms. Mealy said in a telephone interview .
“ In listening to my other colleagues , that they say that to their wives or their friends , we have gotten really complacent with it . ”
The resolution , introduced on July 25 , was first reported by The Daily News .
It is being considered by the Council ’s Civil Rights Committee and is expected to be discussed next month .
Many of those interviewed for this article acknowledged that the b-word could be quite vicious  but insisted that context was everything .
“ I think it ’s a description that is used insouciantly in the fashion industry , ” said Hamish Bowles , the European editor at large of Vogue , as he ordered a sushi special at the Condé Nast cafeteria last week .
“ It would only be used in the fashion world with a sense of high irony and camp . ”
Mr. Bowles , in salmon seersucker and a purple polo , appeared amused by the Council measure .
“ It ’s very ‘ Paris Is Burning , ’ is n’t it ? ” he asked , referring to the film that captured the 1980s drag queen scene in New York .
The b-word has been used to refer to female dogs since around 1000 A.D. , according to the Oxford English Dictionary , which traces the term ’s derogatory application to women to the 15th century ; the entry notes that the term is “ not now in decent use . ”
But there is much evidence that the word  for better or worse  is part of the accepted vernacular of the city .
The cover of this week ’s New York magazine features the word , and syndicated episodes of “ Sex and the City , ” the chronicle of high - heeled Manhattan singledom , include it , though some obscenities were bleeped for its run on family - friendly TBS .
A feminist journal with the word as its title is widely available in bookstores here , displayed in the front rung at Borders at the Time Warner Center .
For a second there , I was worried that Micky Dees was going to have RFID implanted Hamburgers .
I know they are supposed to work subdermally , but I was n't sure about inter-intestinelly .
Yeah , I know thats not a word .
The text of the full page advertisement in it 's entirety stated :
Congress is a group of elected officials constantly at war with the electorate .
In 2006 they continually insisted that if elected they would bring an end to the disastrous war and ongoing occupation of Iraq .
Last week the leaders of both branches said , " We have achieved progress , and we are obviously going to do everything that we can to build on the progress . "
Yesterday , they had the opportunity to pass two important bills to advance their support for our troops in Iraq and alter the direction of the ongoing catastrophe .
Instead they chose to condemn an article we placed in the New York Times .
We hear of bruised egos , hurt feelings , and improprieties .
But we do n't hear of how many more troops will be hurt or killed because of their willful inaction .
More importantly , Congress cannot admit what everyone knows : Iraq is a bloodbath with or without us .
They will not admit that American troops are condemned to remain in Iraq through at least one more election cycle .
CENTCOM Commander Admiral William Fallon has referred to " Surge Architect "
General David Petraeus has an " Ass - kissing little chickenshit " , far worse than the " Betray Us " invective coined by his own troops and pointed out by us .
Today , perhaps , it is Congress that has actually betrayed us .

Inspired by the Creation Museum , the Brotherhood of Fantasy Creatures decided to make their very own Unicorn Museum as a web parody .
Based on the idea of ' if it's in the Bible , it must be true ' , The Unicorn Museum promotes belief in the Biblical Truth of unicorns , a creature mentioned nine times in the KJV Bible .
This website has been published as an act of protest by the Brotherhood of Fantasy Creatures ( MiddleEarth Div.157 ) in response to the injurious actions of the Creation Museum .
The Creation Museum is a new $ 27 Million facility designed to teach the ‘ truth ’ of Creationism and the Christian Bible .
We of the BFC feel that this group represents a threat to continued belief in other fantasy creatures / BFC signatory members and have constructed this website as a protest against their monopolistic and anti-competitive practices .
Waxman : ' Systematic ' security failures in Bush White House Michael Roston
Published : Monday April 23 , 2007 Print This Email This
The head of the House Committee on Oversight and Governance Reform warned today of a " systematic failure " in basic security procedures as well as the safeguarding of classified information in the White House of President George W. Bush .
" Multiple current and former White House security personnel have informed my staff that White House practices have been dangerously inadequate with respect to investigating security violations , taking corrective action following breaches , and physically securing classified information , " Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) wrote to former White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card today .
Waxman sought Card 's cooperation in his probe of a " systematic breakdown " in White House security procedures .
According to Waxman , the security personnel " described a systemic breakdown in security procedures at the White House , " and he warned that they suggested " that the security lapses that characterized the White House response to the leak of [ former covert CIA Agent Valerie Plame ]
Wilson 's identity were not an isolated occurrence , but part of a pattern of disregard for the basic requirements for protecting our national security secrets . "
The Oversight Committee chairman listed consistent allegations presented to his committee .
The White House , he reported in the letter , ignored security breaches , blocked West Wing security inspections , and condoned mismanagement of the White House Security Office .
Waxman 's letter noted criticism of James Knodell , the Director of the White House Security Office , and Ken Greeson , the Deputy Director , for their inexperience and poor management .
" Security procedures prohibit bringing electronic communication devices into a sensitive compartmented information facility ( SCIF ) , " Waxman wrote .
But in fact , subjects interviewed by his committee reported that " Mr. Knodell and Mr. Greeson habitually violate this prohibition by bringing Blackberry devices and cell phones into the SCIF ... and allowed others , such as visiting White House personnel , to do the same .
They said that this practice continued even after security officers repeatedly informed Mr. Knodell and Mr. Greeson that the practice violates security rules and sets a poor example . "
In another case , Waxman 's letter did not name anyone , but referred to an alarming breach committed by Bush White House staff .
" A White House official left [ Sensitive Compartmented Information ] material behind in a hotel room during a foreign trip with the President .
Although the CIA recovered the SCI material and reported the incident , the White House Security Office did not investigate , seek remedial action , or discipline the responsible official , " he wrote .
The Oversight Committee 's letter is up at its website .
Ruby
Java Bytecode
compiler
I just finished up compilation on BEGIN and END blocks , which brings the compiler to completion .
I 've also successfully been able to compile the entire standard library and run IRB and RubyGems entirely off compiled scripts ( i.e. I deleted all the .rb files ) .
For the first time ever , there is a complete , fully - functional Ruby 1.8 compiler .
There have been other compilers announced that were able to handle all Ruby syntax , and perhaps even compile the entire standard library .
But they have never gotten to what in my eyes is really " complete " : being able to dump the stdlib .rb files and continue running nontrivial applications like IRB or RubyGems .
I think I 'm allowed to be a little proud of that accomplishment .
JRuby has the first complete and functional 1.8 - semantics compiler .
That 's pretty cool .
Compiler # 2 will basically take a Ruby class in a given file ( or multiple Ruby classes , if you so choose ) and generate a normal Java type .
This type will look and feel like any other Java class :
You can instantiate it with a normal new MyClass ( arg1 , arg2 ) from Java code
You can invoke all its methods with normal Java invocations
You can extend it with your own Java classes
I 've been thinking through implementation - independent ways to specify signatures for Ruby methods .
The requirement in my mind is that the same code can run in JRuby and any other Ruby without modification , but in JRuby it will gain additional static type signatures for calls from Java .
The syntax I 'm kicking around right now looks something like this :
class MyClass
...
{ String => [ Integer , Array ] }
def mymethod ( num , ary ) ; end
end
If you 're unfamiliar with it , this is basically just a literal hash syntax .
The return type , String , is associated with the types of the two method arguments , Integer and Array .
In any normal Ruby implementation , this line would be executed , a hash constructed , and execution would proceed with the hash likely getting quickly garbage collected .
However Compiler # 2 would encounter these lines in the class body and use them to create method signatures like this :
public String mymethod ( int num , List ary ) {
...
}
Charles Nutter has been working on the JRubytofor some time - and now it 's finished This completes some of the items in the mentioned in the JRuby 1.1 plans .
With this done , JRuby 1.1 , scheduled to be released in time for RubyConf 2007 in early November , can be shipped with the compiler .
More details can be found in the blog announcement of the JRuby compiler Another type of compiler is already .
This is supposed to further facilitate integration between Java and Ruby : This integration also needs some enhancements to make it possible to use these classes from Java .
For instance , defining methods with a certain signature .
As Ruby does n't have explicit type information for signatures , some kind of workaround would be needed :

The robot was a model for how these desires and emotions are reflected in facial expression and how those expressions in turn affect social interaction .
Take the drive for novelty .
With no stimulus nearby , Kismet ’s eyes would droop in apparent boredom .
Then a lovely thing happened .
If there was a person nearby , she would see Kismet ’s boredom and wave a toy in front of the robot ’s eyes .
This activated Kismet ’s program to look for brightly colored objects , which in turn moved the robot into its “ aroused ” affective state , with a facial expression with the hallmarks of happiness .
The happy face , in turn , led the human to feel good about the interaction and to wave the toy some more — a socially gratifying feedback loop akin to playing with a baby .
Kismet is now retired and on permanent display , inert as a bronze statue , at the M.I.T. Museum .
The most famous robot now in Breazeal ’s lab , the one that the graduate students compete for time with , looks nothing like Kismet .
It is a three - foot - tall , head - to - toe creature , sort of a badger , sort of a Yoda , with big eyes , enormous pointy ears , a mouth with soft lips and tiny teeth , a furry belly , furry legs and pliable hands with real - looking fingernails .
The reason the robot , called Leonardo ( Leo for short ) , is so lifelike is that it was made by Hollywood animatronics experts at the Stan Winston Studio .
( Breazeal consulted with the studio on the construction of the robotic teddy bear in the 2001 Steven Spielberg film “ A.I. ” )
As soon as Leo arrived in the lab , Breazeal said , her students started dismantling it , stripping out all the remote - control wiring and configuring it instead with a brain and body that operated not by remote control but by computer - based artificial intelligence .
I had studied the videos posted on the M.I.T. Media Lab Web site , and I was fond of Leo even before I got to Cambridge .
I could n’t wait to see it close up .
I loved the steadiness of its gaze , the slow way it nodded its head and blinked when it understood something , the little Jack Benny shrug it gave when it did n’t .
I loved how smart it seemed .
In one video , two graduate students , Jesse Gray and Matt Berlin , engaged it in an exercise known in psychology as the false - belief test .
Leo performed remarkably .
Some psychologists contend that very young children think all minds are permeable and that everyone knows exactly what they themselves know .
Older children , after the age of about 4 or 5 , have learned that different people have different minds and that it is possible for someone else to hold beliefs that the children themselves know to be false .
Leo performed in the video like a sophisticated 5 - year - old , one who had developed what psychologists call a theory of mind .
In the video , Leo watches Jesse Gray , who is wearing a red T - shirt , put a bag of chips into Box 1 and a bag of cookies into Box 2 , while Matt Berlin , in a brown T - shirt , also watches .
After Berlin leaves the room , Gray switches the items , so that now the cookies are in Box 1 and the chips are in Box 2 .
Gray locks the two boxes and leaves the room , and Leo now knows what Gray knows : the new location for the chips and cookies .
But it also knows that Berlin does n’t know about the switch .
Berlin still thinks there are chips in Box 1 .
The amazing part comes next .
Berlin , in the brown T - shirt , comes back into the room and tries to open the lock on the first box .
Leo sees Berlin struggling , and it decides to help by pressing a lever that will deliver to Berlin the item he ’s looking for .
Leo presses the lever for the chips .
It knows that there are cookies in the box that Berlin is trying to open , but it also knows — and this is the part that struck me as so amazing — that Berlin is trying to open the box because he wants chips .
It knows that Berlin has a false belief about what is in the first box , and it also knows what Berlin wants .
If Leo had indeed passed this important developmental milestone , I wondered , could it also be capable of all sorts of other emotional tasks : empathy , collaboration , social bonding , deception ?
Unfortunately , Leo was turned off the day I arrived , inertly presiding over one corner of the lab like a fuzzy Buddha .
Berlin and Gray and their colleague , Andrea Thomaz , a postdoctoral researcher , said that they would be happy to turn on the robot for me but that the process would take time and that I would have to come back the next morning .
They also wanted to know what it was in particular that I wanted to see Leo do because , it turned out , the robot could go through its paces only when the right computer program was geared up .
This was my first clue that Leo maybe was n’t going to turn out to be quite as clever as I had thought .
When I came back the next day , Berlin and Gray were ready to go through the false - belief routine with Leo .
But it was n’t what I expected .
I could now see what I had seen on the video .
But in person , I could also peek behind the metaphoric curtain and see something that the video camera had n’t revealed : the computer monitor that showed what Leo ’s cameras were actually seeing and another monitor that showed the architecture of Leo ’s brain .
I could see that this was n’t a literal demonstration of a human “ theory of mind ” at all .
Yes , there was some robotic learning going on , but it was mostly a feat of brilliant computer programming , combined with some dazzling Hollywood special effects .
You know , it 's funny .
I can well remember the day I saw my first syntax - highlighted code in an IDE .
It looked a little weird compared to the flat Notepad look of yester - editors , but , from that point on , non- syntax - highlighted code just became harder to read .
It was as if we had been shown the z - axis from having lived in Flatland for so long .
And then came code completion lists .
You'd be typing along and if you suddenly became stuck trying to remember a member name , you could wait half a second or so and a list would pop up showing the identifiers you could type in at that particular spot .
And again , you were shown another dimension to your code , and there was a split from the past .
And now I see comments like this : " I have to laugh when I see what these tools do .
Any coder worth his salt will be instinctively writing code as good as if not better than this tool produces . "
In case you had n't guessed , the writer was talking about refactoring tools .
In particular , the fake Yorkshireman macho - ness ( " When I were a lad , we were lucky to ' ave _fastcall " ) that infuses the prose might have indicated to you that he was a C++ programmer , and you 'd have been right .
This just seems nutty to me and it's not because I work for a company that puts out a refactoring tool .
Yes , we all know what refactorings are , the great geek god Martin Fowler wrote a best - selling eponymous book on them .
And we all know the names of the most popular ones : Extract Method , Inline Temp , Extract Interface , Move Method , Rename Identifier , and so on .
Their names have become a mantra almost , a paean to the new agilism .
But , surely -- he says in a baffled voice -- having an automated tool is better than doing them by hand ?
Are n't refactoring tools just another small step on the way to better visualization of our code and of writing it better and faster ?
What am I missing that this comment writer implicitly understands , or , rather , vice versa .
The writer of this comment also seems to imply that Code , Once Written , Is Never Changed .
It must have been the eleventh commandment , but God ran out of ink when printing it on the stone tablet .
But we all know from our own experience , without recourse to statistics , that most code is changed .
No matter how good we are , how much we 're worth our salt , no matter what language we use , we introduce bugs when we write code .
It may be we change it immediately ( " Duh , that should be a less than , not a greater than " ) or it may be later , after testing .
And , sure , when we modify our code , or we modify someone else 's ( because we are lucky indeed if the only code we ever work on is our own ) , we make use of refactorings as we make fixes .
Think of it like this .
Since code will get changed ( there 's a bug ; the requirements change ; you prefer to code in an organic fashion as if you were playing with Play - Doh ) , why not take advantage of a tool that helps you do it ?
Certainly you can do it all by hand and have members of the opposite sex swoon as they watch you manipulate the code with the keyboard , but to be honest who gives a damn .
I think of the way I write code .
I 'm an experimentalist developer : someone who develops with TDD ( Test - Driven Development ) .
Despite years of programming , I always approach a programming task as a blank sheet of paper .
Since I do TDD my blank sheet of paper always starts off with something I 'd like to be true ( my first test ) .
And then I write the code that satisfies the test , and then I write something else I 'd like to be true ( another test ) , and I write more code that makes it so .
And so on so forth .
During this continual piecemeal advance towards software of value , my code is completely malleable .
Just because I wrote it one way for one test , does n't mean that it 's going to stay that way for ever .
I refactor ad nauseam and utterly rely on my refactoring tool to do that .
The refactorings I use most of all are these :
1. Rename Identifier .
This one is the most important refactorings in my ever so humble opinion ( it 's my blog so what I say goes ! ) .
When I 'm coding , I never seem to get the names of things right the first time .
Indeed , I 've given up trying to , since it just interrupts the flow of getting an algorithm down .
And the names of things are perhaps the most important thing about our code .
We can't do anything about the syntax of our language , but , by gum , we can about our identifiers .
Name them badly and we obfuscate our code quickly .
We 've all heard the ( apocryphal ? ) stories about programmers coming across some code where the previous programmer in an effort to be funny used names of flowers or mountains to name local variables .
Compilers do n't give a fig about what you name your identifiers .
It 's your human audience that does , and you can guarantee you 'll have one : the hapless maintenance programmer that follows in your footsteps , which , sometimes , is you .
You are writing for your human reader first , and your compiler second .
Beware if you think it 's the other way round , because you 'll appear on The Daily WTF .
I 've learned that the real name for an identifier only becomes obvious once you use it .
Sometimes if you find it hard to name an identifier it indicates that your code is not expressing the problem domain properly .
So , being able to rename an identifier , without worrying about search - and - replace destruction , is a boon beyond compare .
2. Extract Method .
I 'm an advocate of small , low - cyclomatic - complexity methods , and ones that have a single responsibility .
Ditto for classes , by the way .
But constructing a set of interacting methods as a complete thought exercise and getting them all down in source code is a talent that has always eluded me .
Call me a stream - of - consciousness programmer by all means , but that generally means slamming it all down and then sorting out the mess afterwards .
This is where Extract Method come into its own .
Hey , that code over there is essentially the same as this over here , let 's extract it into a common method that can be called ( reused ! ) from both locations .
And an automated Extract Method is great : it works out the parameters , constructs the right method signature , inserts calling code at the location where the code was extracted , and in less time it takes to think about the possibility .
Toss in a few Rename Identifier refactorings and your code becomes more readable and simpler to understand .
Mind you , me , I can't wait for a tool that will find duplicate code for me .
Oooh , at that point the combination may topple Rename Identifier from the top of the list .
3. Create Method Stub .
This is n't really a refactoring per se ( it makes temporarily non-compilable code into compilable code ) , but it 's so handy for TDD enthusiasts .
You 're writing a test that defines how you 'd like something to read and to work and you find you 've used a method name that does n't exist yet .
Hit the refactoring key , and boom , the tool adds a stub method to the right class .
Invaluable .
4. Decompose Parameter .
This one is rapidly moving up the list ever since I started playing with an early beta version of it from Refactor !
Pro .
The set up for understanding why this is so good is a little long - winded , but the payoff has all the more impact for it .
When we use a framework like the .NET Framework we find ourselves writing a lot of event handler code so that we can get called back from the framework when something happens .
Oftentimes , we 'll get a nice handy object passed in as part of the call containing property values we can use in our handler code .
The unfortunate thing is these event handlers tend not to be reusable , because the caller has to construct a new handy object to pass in some values .
All in all a pain .
Especially so when , in general , we are given a particularly rich or heavy object and we only use a couple of its properties .
Far better to extract out the specific code into another method , pass in the property values ( and not the rich , heavy object ) , and reuse this new method , including calling it from our event handler .
Enter Decompose Parameter : it works out what 's actually being used inside the method 's implementation and constructs a method that has those properties as parameters .
It then patches up the calling code and you 're done .
So , instead of a non-reusable event handler that needs an EventArgs but just uses the EventArgs ' Graphics property , and hence that requires an EventArgs object to be set up before calling , you get a method that expects a Graphics object instead , and can be used from other painting methods , for example .
5. Move Type to File .
One of Refactor !
Pro's invaluable refactorings and every time we demo it , people in the audience " get it " immediately .
The way we write code these days is to have one class per source file , the latter named after the former .
Makes it easy to find the code for classes , and great for when you have multiple programmers working on the same team .
But writing code in that way is a pain in the neck .
You want a new class , but have to stop what you 're doing in order to add a new file to the project , name it accordingly , switch to it , add the new class , switch back to where you were , etc .
It 's a complete drag to productivity .
For the past couple of years , I just continue writing code to build a class model in the same one source file .
When I 'm ready to extract the classes , I just invoke this refactoring on one class after the other .
Boom , boom , boom .
Much easier .
6. Extract Interface .
Another great refactoring .
You 've written a class believing it to be the only one you 'll need , and , wham , you discover another exemplar that 's slightly different .
I much prefer interface inheritance to implementation inheritance , and so I 'd be doing an Extract Interface so quick it would make your head spin .
Mock me , baby .
7. Inline Temp .
A quick simple refactoring , nevertheless very useful .
It changes code that declares a temporary variable , sets it , and then uses the variable in an expression .
This refactoring just gets rid of the temporary variable and moves the initialization into the expression .
Sometimes this can make the code a little clearer .
Sometimes it wo n't and you 'll need the opposite refactoring ; Introduce Temporary Variable .
I do tend to use both as I polish code .
8. Use String .
Format .
Another refactoring that audiences at demos instinctively " get " and that I use all the time .
Face it , writing a String .
Format call is great for localization efforts , but it 's just a real pain to write .
It 's much easier to write an expression that consists of a bunch of string concatenations , but unfortunately that 's hopeless from a localization viewpoint .
So , do the easy thing and let the refactoring tool do the tedious work .
I love just writing a string concatenation expression , getting it exactly the way I want it , and then convert it to a String .
Format call as if I 'd done it that way all along .
I 'll stop there .
My intent here is not to list out all the refactorings I use , only those I use most of all .
In doing so , I wanted to indicate why I think a refactoring tool is deserving of being in your coding environment .
Sure , the refactorings I 've listed can all be done by hand .
Indeed if I were stern and hard - core I 'd say do them by hand a couple of times so that you get a real feeling for what each refactoring means and how it works .
And I 'd laugh my evil taking - over - the - world laugh while you did so .
Afterwards you 'd just use the automated tool and be thankful that you can save time .
Because in the end , we 're not all great programmers who write code correctly in the first pass .
We 're all programmers writing code to enhance / fix / extend existing code ( and even green field projects turn into a marathon of altering code ) .
We 're all maintenance programmers to a smaller or larger extent .
We 're all programmers who have to live with other people 's code , and recognize that our code after a few months could be someone else's .
And because we 're all that and more we deserve the best coding tools we can get .
And that includes automated refactoring tools .

Cindy Sheehan Occupies John Conyers ’ Office
Submitted by bob fertik
Cindy Sheehan led 2-300 impeachment activists on a march from Arlington Cemetary to the Congressional office of Rep. John Conyers , whose job as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee puts him in charge of impeachment .
AP reports :
“ Impeachment is not a fringe movement , it is mandated in our Constitution ; Nancy Pelosi had no authority to take it off the table , ” Sheehan told her group of orange - clad activists Monday .
“ If Nancy Pelosi does n’t do her constitutionally mandated job by midnight … I will announce that I ’m going to run against her . ”
I just got a live report from David Swanson , who says Conyers is nowhere to be found – but Sheehan , Rev. Lennox Yearwood , and former CIA presidential briefer Ray McGovern are inside his office holding a press conference !
In fact , there are so many reporters with Cindy that they are taking turns going into the packed office to ask questions .
At least 300 activists are lining the halls outside the office , both the marchers and those who went directly to the Capitol .
Update 1:30 EST : Conyers staff is negotiating with activists to move the protest to a larger room .
In Detroit , 50 people went to Conyers ’ district office , but they only let 5 people in and would n’t let them keep their cellphones so we ’re not getting any reports .
Update 1:35 EST : Conyers just arrived !!
As he walked down the hall , activists shouted IMPEACH so loud the whole floor echoed .
Conyers and his staff took Cindy , Rev. , and Ray into a private office without the media .
Stay tuned !
Update 2:55 EST : After an 80 - minute meeting , Cindy emerged and told the activists that Conyers said “ our only recourse is elections , ” and the activists groaned .
Cindy announced she will run against Pelosi because she and Conyers have n’t “ stepped up , ” and the activists cheered .
Rev. Yearwood is giving a fired - up speech and activists are crowding in to Conyers ’ office for the sit-in .
Update 3:43 EST : Capitol Police arrested Cindy Sheehan , Ray McGovern , Rev. Yearwood , David Swanson , and 20 other activists and put them on a police bus .
But all is not grim – Cindy is calling it her “ campaign bus . ”
( Original Article )
ALSO :
E-mail from Debra Sweet of WCW :
Cindy Sheehan , Ray McGovern and Rev. Lennox Yearwood met with John
Conyers this afternoon , while about 300 of us were outside in the hall .
We had arrived after a really spirited , really ORANGE march from
Arlington Cemetery where the response from people in cars , on the Mall ,
and in offices was
mostly very positive .
There was a loud , permitted “ Gathering of
Eagles / Free Republic ” counter - rally of 30 people with a guy criticizing
WCW , Cindy ,
and Medea Benjamin .
Cindy announced after meeting with Conyers , that he said the 208
elections were the way to end the Bush regime , and that nothing was more
important
than the Democrats winning the presidency .
Rev. Yearwood said how
disappointing it was to have Conyers , his mentor , turn his back on the
peoples ’
demand fo rjustice .
Immediately , about 30 people jammed into Conyer ’s outer office , and were
arrested wtihin about 20 minutes .
Hundreds of others were in the hallway ,
and some of them were arrested when they sat down in protest .
50 people met outside Conyer ’s Detroit office this morning .
Homeland
Security allowed only 5 people in , who sat for hours in solidarity with
the people
demanding impeachment in Washington .
More on all of this soon … .

On and off for the past two years , I have been investigating anti-counterfeiting measures in banknotes , in particular the Counterfeit Detection Systems ( CDS ) .
At the request of the Central Banks Counterfeit Deterrence Group ( CBCDG ) , this software was added to scanner and printer drivers , as well as to image manipulation packages , in order to detect images of currency and prevent them from being processed .
I wrote a webpage on some experiments I ran on the CDS and gave a talk presenting the results of reverse engineering .
Unsurprisingly this drew the attention of the involved parties , and while none of them contacted me directly , I was able to see them in my web logs .
In September 2005 , I first noticed Digimarc , who developed the CDS , followed a few hours later by the European Central Bank and the US Treasury ( both CBCDG members ) , suggesting Digimarc tipped them off .
However none of these paid as much attention as the Bank of England ( also a CBCDG member ) who were looking at my pages several times a week .
I did n’t notice them for a while due to their lack of reverse DNS , but in December I started paying attention .
Not only was their persistence intriguing , but based on referrer logs their search queries indicated a particular interest in me , e.g. Project Dendros Steven Murdoch ( Dendros is one of my research projects ) .
Perhaps they just found my work of interest , but in case they had concerns about my research ( or me ) , I wanted to find out more .
I did n’t know how to get in contact with the right person there , so instead I rigged my webpage to show visitors from either of the Bank of England ’s two IP ranges a personalised message .
On 9 February they found it , and here is what happened …
The first visitor went to my homepage after a Google search for Steven Murdoch Cambridge University , but instead found my message .
It was only three paragraphs long , but after 43 seconds the visitor closed my webpage , without clicking any links .
I am guessing a personalised webpage was surprising enough to make this user give up on their original task .
The second visitor came 25 minutes later , and did n’t send a referrer , so this could be via a bookmark or a link copied and pasted from an email .
This time only 7 seconds were spent on the message before continuing to my original homepage .
However after 8 seconds this visitor went back to the message , as if doing a double take in disbelief , before closing the window 2 seconds later .
Our third visitor was another 5 hours later , but instead of going to my homepage , went directly to the “ Continue ” link on the message page , but without loading the message .
It might be the same person as before , but this user did n’t have a cookie set , so I suspect one of the previous visitors emailed that link to this user .
This visitor spent over 10 minutes on my homepage , but did n’t seem to follow any links .
The final visitor came the following day , but not directly .
Instead he or she used Google to search for notes cambridge " steven murdoch " , and then requested the Google cache .
My website was up and running at that time , so I presume this visitor wanted to hide their request .
However the Google cache is not designed with privacy in mind , so external references like stylesheets still get through .
I saw this behaviour from the Bank of England before , but did n’t have the logs to explain it fully .
I also note that the Bank of England IT system uses a Blue Coat proxy .
This adds a header X - Bluecoat - Via , which is used to prevent looping .
Another anomalous header is Novinet , produced by the Novell NetIdentity client , used to perform authentication on an intranet .
I do think that it is a minor security risk to give away information on LAN infrastructure to random web servers .
There is also some unusual pre-fetching behaviour , I presume from the Blue Coat proxy .
Although based on the user - agent , the HTML pages are downloaded by IE on Windows , other embedded content , such as images and stylesheets , has a spoofed user - agent and missing referrer .
It seems that the proxy server requests pre-requisites before the browser has rendered the page , in order to speed up the download .
Finally , I pointed out that two IP addresses in separate netblocks are in use ( Bank - Of - England and BANKENGL01 ) .
I initially thought these were different departments , but it now seems that they are used interchangeably , and I have observed switching between them while downloading a single webpage .
So in conclusion , you can learn a lot from web logs , Google cache does not make you invisible ( use Tor instead ) , and do not underestimate the dedication to procrastination of a PhD student writing up .
Finally , the Bank of England did n’t visit again , at least from the IP ranges I know about , and did n’t contact me either .
Perhaps I scared them off ?
Jon Stewart grades Iraq benchmark report as ' not un - bad ' David Edwards and Nick Juliano

In a dig at the rhetoric employed by members of the Bush administration in describing the war in Iraq , the Daily Show on Monday examined the " Cirque du Soleil - like contortions " used to spin progress in the war .
Host Jon Stewart also lamented the loss of some ripe material when President Bush decided to commute the prison sentence of former vice presidential aide I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby .
" I thought for sure , for sure , that we'd be coming back from break to a Scooter Libby goes to jail perp walk thing ... nice clever over - the - shoulder ( graphic ) , ' Pokey - man , ' you know what I mean ? "
Stewart said .
" Yeah , that 's not great , but the graphic was cute , it was Libby being sodomized by Pikachu . "
After the brief aside , Stewart returned to the news of a recent report on Iraqi government benchmarks .
" As you know we are now entering our fifth year of making very good progress in Iraq , " he said .
" Obviously , the president defining progress now as ' moving forward through time . ' "
Stewart then showed President Bush noting that the Iraqi government has achieved satisfactory progress on eight of 18 benchmarks , according to an interim progress report recently delivered to Congress .
" There ya have it , eight out of 18 , otherwise known as a gentleman 's F , " Stewart said .
" By the way that 's the report card the Bush administration themselves submitted .
why did n't they cherry - pick the results ?
They did . "
" What was really amazing about the report , " Stewart continued , " was the Cirque du Soleil - like contortions needed to spin it positive . "
Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice said the Iraqis have made " not inconsequential movement forward " in a clip played on the show .
" Wait , not inconsequential , " Stewart mused , " so that 's like not un -bad .
Tell me not less . "
The following video is from Comedy Central 's The Daily Show , broadcast on July 16 .
My co-bloggers and I have written several posts about the chaos that the dictatorship of Robert Mugabe has brought upon the African nation of Zimbabwe .
Today , though , the London Telegraph reports that things have gotten so bad that the nation is four months away from complete chaos :
The economy of Zimbabwe is facing total collapse within four months , leaving the country facing a slide into Congo - style anarchy , The Sunday Telegraph has been told .
Western officials fear the business , farming and financial sectors may be crippled by Christmas , triggering a collapse of government control that could leave the country prey to warlords and ignite long - suppressed tribal tensions .
(…)
Speaking anonymously because of the sensitivity of the subject , one Western official said : “ It is hard to be definitive , but probably within months , by the end of the year , we will see the formal economy cease to work . ”
He added : “ One of the great dangers in all this , if Mugabe hangs on for much longer , is that the country will slip from authoritarianism to anarchy , the government will lose control of the provinces , it will lose control of the towns and you will have a situation where the central authority ’s writ no longer holds . ”
Asked which other African nation Zimbabwe might end up resembling under a worst - case scenario , the official cited as an example the Democratic Republic of Congo ( the former Zaire ) , beset for years by famine , civil war and inter-ethnic conflict .
The collection contains more than 600 silver coins
The treasure
The most important Viking treasure find in Britain for 150 years has been unearthed by a father and son while metal detecting in Yorkshire .
David and Andrew Whelan uncovered the hoard , which dates back to the 10th Century , in Harrogate in January .
The pair kept their find intact and it was transferred to the British Museum to be examined by experts , who said the discovery was " phenomenal " .
It was declared as a treasure at a court hearing in Harrogate on Thursday .
North Yorkshire coroner Geoff
Fell said : " Treasure cases are always interesting , but this is one of the most exciting cases that I have ever had to rule on .
" I 'm delighted that such an important Viking hoard has been discovered in North Yorkshire .
We are extremely proud of our Viking heritage in this area . "
' Astonishing discovery ' Metal detectorists David and Andrew Whelan , who uncovered the treasures , said the find was a " thing of dreams " .
The pair , from Leeds , said the hoard was worth about £ 750,000 as a conservative estimate .
They told the BBC News website : " We 've been metal detecting for about five years ; we do it on Saturdays as a hobby .
" We ended up in this particular field , we got a really strong signal from the detector ...
Eventually we found this cup containing the coins and told the antiquity authority .
" We were astonished when we finally discovered what it contained . "
The ancient objects come from as far afield as Afghanistan in the East and Ireland in the West , as well as what is now Russia , Scandinavia and continental Europe .
The hoard contains 617 silver coins and 65 other objects , including a gold arm-ring and a gilt silver vessel .
Dr Jonathan Williams , keeper of prehistory in Europe at the British Museum , said : " [ The cup ] is beautifully decorated and was made in France or Germany at around AD900 .
" It is fantastically rare - there are only a handful of others known around the world .
It will be stunning when it is fully conserved . "
Turbulent times
Most of the smaller objects were extremely well preserved as they had been hidden inside the vessel , which was protected by a lead container .
The British Museum said the coins included several new or rare types , which provide valuable new information about the history of England in the early 10th Century , as well as Yorkshire 's wider cultural contacts in the period .
It was probably buried for safety by a wealthy Viking leader during the unrest following the conquest of the Viking kingdom of Northumbria in AD927 .
A spokeswoman for the museum said : " The size and quality of the hoard is remarkable , making it the most important find of its type in Britain for over 150 years . "
The find will now be valued for the Department of Culture , Media and Sport by the Independent Treasure Valuation Committee .
Dr Williams said that the British Museum and the York Museums Trust would be looking to raise the funds to purchase the collection so it could eventually go on public display .
The proceeds would be split between the finders and landowners .

Deep inside the woods of Belarus ( Belorussia ) right in the middle of nowhere , among swamps and valleys there is a military base .
Eighteen tall poles pump out of the ground , visible from many miles away from the site .
To climb up one should overpass about 1000 ft .
But the author of the pictures below not only wasnt frightened of such height but got through the dense forest , leaving behind swamps , and made breath - taking footage .

Working Hours
Oh dear , another report making a fundamental error :
Family life is under unprecedented strain because increasing career pressures force couples with children to work longer hours , a report has found .
Nearly two thirds of parents believe they get insufficient time with their children , while half say they have to put their job first - even if it affects their family life .
...
The survey was conducted among 1,148 adults by GfK NOP for the Children 's Society and follows a Unicef study which found that British children were the unhappiest in the West .
" These results reflect the dilemmas over child care British parents can feel when trying to juggle the many demands of modern life in a country that already puts in the longest working hours in Western Europe , " says the report .
Full - time employees in the UK work an average of 43.5 hours a week compared with 38.2 and 39.9 in Germany .
The error is that leisure hours have been rising , as they have been for the past century .
So how can people have less time for their children if in fact they actually have more time for them ?
This report , like all too many others on the subject , fails because it only counts paid working hours .
It does not include unpaid working hours in the home .
The basic pattern right across the western world has been that male paid and male unpaid working hours have been falling , female paid rising and female unpaid falling ( for a net fall in female working hours ) pretty much since records were first kept .
I agree that this is a comparison of Germany with the USA but I think it 's generally accepted that the UK has a pretty similar pattern of working hours to the US ?
Indeed , that this is part of the complaint , that we do , rather than the slightly more relaxed hours of our continental cousins ?
So how to explain this ?
The conventional view is that Americans work longer hours than Germans and other Europeans but when time in household production is included , overall working time is very similar on both sides of the Atlantic .
Americans spend more time on market work but German invest more in household production .
In fact , the average German housewife works 1.5 hours a week longer than her US counterpart .
So the most basic analysis , that we are in fact working longer hours than our forefathers , or that we are working more than the continentals , is flawed , perhaps even wrong .
Which makes something of a mockery of whatever it is that they suggest should be done about it , no ?

The bit you quote says :
Nearly two thirds of parents believe they get insufficient time with their children , while half say they have to put their job first - even if it affects their family life
Yet much of the difference in ' unpaid work ' between Germany and the US was looking after children , was n't it ?
A large chunk of the rest was ' eating ' .

One hazy morning in 1917 the senior mistress of Bournemouth High School For Girls stood up in front of the assembled sixth form and announced to her hushed audience : " I have come to tell you a terrible fact .
" Only one out of ten of you girls can ever hope to marry .
This is not a guess of mine .
It is a statistical fact .
" Nearly all the men who might have married you have been killed .
You will have to make your way in the world as best you can .
" The war has made more openings for women than there were before .
But there will still be a lot of prejudice .
You will have to fight .
You will have to struggle . "
Scroll down for more ...
Sitting in the assembly hall among her shocked and silent schoolfellows was 17 - year - old Rosamund Essex .
She was never to forget those chilling words , recalling : " It was one of the most fateful statements of my life . "
When Rosamund , who never married , wrote her memoirs 60 years later she accepted that her teacher 's pronouncement had been prophetic .
" How right she was , " she recalled .
" Only one out of every ten of my friends has ever married .
" Quite simply , there was no one available .
We had to face the fact that our lives would be stunted in one direction .
" We should never have the kind of happy homes in which we ourselves had been brought up .
" There would be no husband , no children , no sexual outlet , no natural bond of man and woman .
It was going to be a struggle indeed . "
Rosamund , and so many of the classmates who sat with her that morning , joined what came to be known as The Surplus Two Million - women whose dreams of marriage and children died alongside their men .
World War I deprived Britain of three - quarters - of - a- million soldiers , leaving as many more incapacitated .
In 1919 a generation of women who unquestioningly believed marriage to be their birthright discovered there were simply not enough men to go around .
The make - up of British society had changed irrevocably - as Isie Russell - Stevenson discovered to her horror .
Towards the end of the war in 1918 she received a message to say that her husband , Hamilton , would be returning home from the Front .
Wearing her prettiest dress , Isie waited eagerly at the docks for his boat to arrive .
But the dreamed - of moment turned suddenly to nightmare .
Hamilton appeared on a stretcher , mangled and clearly dying .
Isie took him home and nursed him and not long afterwards he died .
Isie mourned - nevertheless she was young , and the following year she was invited to a ball in London .
She willed herself into the mood , did her hair and put on her ballgown .
But when she walked into the ballroom , the party seemed to be women - only .
" But if it 's a hen party , " she thought to herself , mystified .
" Why is every woman in full evening dress ? "
At last , through the crowd , she spotted a man in tails ... and again through the crowd another ... and then a couple more .
And gradually she realised that this pathetic clutch of males were the men who were left .
There were about ten women to every man .
She recalled : " It 's hard to explain .
It was as if every man you had ever danced with was dead . "
May Jones , the daughter of a carpenter , knew - as she held a letter informing her of her fiance 's death - that she would never marry or hold a baby in her arms .
Before the onset of war , May had fallen in love with Philip , a Cambridge scholar who read her poetry .
When Philip - a stretcherbearer - was due to return home on leave , May was walking on air .
But she wrote in her memoirs : " Then everything was shattered ; a letter came from the War Office to say he had been killed in action .
" The shock and loss was terrible , I felt I had lost half of myself , or was it my twin soul ?
I knew then that I should die an old maid . "
She added sadly : " I was only 20 - years - old . "
Like a generation of other women in post - war Britain , Phyllis Bentley , born in 1894 and raised on fairy tales of love and marriage , headed for the dance halls as the best place to meet and mate .
For the men , the lure of the dance was great ; they could take their pick from the prettiest of the bunch .
For the girls , there was the agony of waiting to be asked .
Lack of men meant looks were at a premium .
Phyllis was not pretty , and the competition for partners was fierce , so all too often there were awkward gaps when she was unclaimed and would sit , in the cloakroom , reading her books .
Then one day a man who seemed different from the others asked her to dance .
He was , she remembered " large and agreeably ugly . . . "
He also seemed kind , warmhearted and well - read .
Phyllis 's heart quickened .
And yet that one foxtrot when her dream took shape was painfully fleeting .
She remembered : " For the space of a dance I thought my destiny was settled . "
Minutes later , Phyllis 's partner rejoined his group .
" And I perceived that he was already deeply in love with an old schoolfellow of mine , a more than pretty , intelligent , altogether delightful girl whom I greatly liked .
I perceived also that she was deeply in love with him . "
And so the dream ended .
Phyllis 's ugly man married the pretty schoolfriend within the year .
Not long afterwards , in 1919 , Phyllis had her second and final brush with romance .
It lasted a little longer ; this time the man paid court to her over several months , but then abruptly got engaged to another girl .
Phyllis Bentley - who never was to marry - was one of the sober statistics of the 1921 census , which showed the imbalance of the sexes .
For those aged between 25 and 29 , there were 1,209 single women for every 1,000 men .
When the next census was taken ten years later , 50 per cent of those women were still single .
Long - term statistics showed that 35 per cent of them failed to marry during their reproductive years .
Botched affairs , dashed hopes , the prospect of loneliness ; two million women now saw their dreams slipping away from them .
Women like Alix Kilroy , who confided sadly in her diary on her 26th birthday " I seem to want very badly to see some chance of matrimony in the future - for children and the physical side , too . "
But other women sought solace among their own sex - with an explosion of lesbian relationships .
Author Sybil Neville - Rolfe noted : " The war left behind it a generation of Eves in an Adamless Eden ...
Starving for love , deprived of homes and denied the joys of motherhood , many women found in friendship , one with another , some sort of substitute for these normal but lost relationships . "
Unlike male homosexuality , lesbianism was not illegal - and a Bill to outlaw it in 1921 failed because MPs considered that it was wiser to sweep the whole issue under the carpet .
In the fashionable clubs of London 's West End , women danced cheek to cheek with their female partners - unafraid of being pointed out , because the shortage of men had made this such a common sight .
The writer Esther Harding noted that more and more women seemed to be adopting " a somewhat masculinised dress and manner , as well as certain masculine characteristics " .
Marie Stopes , the campaigner for women 's rights , received many letters from single women agonising over their lesbian leanings .
In 1922 , a Miss L. Redcliffe wrote to her saying : " I have a very strong tendency to be attracted by my own sex .
" I have made great efforts to overcome this - but the force of it is so strong that it seems to me most important that if there is anything I am ignorant of I should have advice ... "
Stopes replied : " Keep your mind off the physical side of that aspect as much as possible ... I think you will find this phase passes entirely away . "
For some , it was a lifesaver .
Denied a husband and family by the war , Elizabeth Goudge nursed her elderly mother .
When her mother died , Elizabeth was racked with loneliness .
A friend arranged a meeting with another single girl - and Elizabeth later recalled : " We looked at each other .
I saw a young woman with a head of hair like a horse chestnut on fire , and the white magnolia skin that goes with such hair .
She looked young enough to be my daughter ... when I went to bed that night I found myself flooded with happiness .
Jessie has stood by me for 21 years and has been the most wonderful event that ever happened to me . "
Many lesbians settled down with their chosen partner for a lifetime of tender intimacy .
Alice Skillicorn , principal of a teacher training college in Cambridge , met Dorothy Sergeant in the early 1930s .
By week , Alice lived in college and played out her headmistressy - role to perfection .
But weekends and vacations were different - the couple shared a house .
They remained together for nearly 40 happy years , until Dorothy died in 1969 .
Broken - hearted , Alice was finally laid to rest in the same grave , with the tombstone recording their " dear and devoted friendship " .
But other spinsters continued with their desperate search for a husband and magazine problem pages in the 1920s dealt with a barrage of letters from women desperate to fill the gap in their lives .
The following answer from the Fireside Friends page in a Woman 's Friend of 1926 was addressed to " A Lonely Girl " .
" I am very sorry that I can not put you in touch with a young man , my dear , but it is against our rules to give private addresses . "
A little further on , the article suggests women might consider emigrating to find a husband .
The sex psychologist Walter Gallichan - a popular voice of the day - urged single women to check the local population statistics when deciding where to go husband - hunting : Sussex and Leicester , he pointed out , were particularly unpromising areas to look for spare men , as they already had a disproportion of married men or surplus women .
Many placed advertisements in the Press in their hope of finding any man - like the following heartfelt plea published during the war : " Lady , fiancè killed , will gladly marry officer totally blinded or otherwise incapacitated by the War . "
By 1921 publications like the Matrimonial Times were carrying columns of advertisements placed by spinsters and widows .
They included :
MATRIMONY - Spinster , 38 , loving disposition , fond of children , entertaining and country life , is anxious to correspond with a wounded officer of cultured tastes , with view to a matrimonial alliance ; one with some means .
LADY , aged 49 , spinster , cultured , bright temperament , small capital ... would like to meet officer or civilian age 45 - 60 ... could be very happy with disabled officer needing a cheerful companion and pal .
The stigma of being a spinster was so fearful that many women succumbed to sex , believing they 'd get a husband that way .
So much so that after the war some wag suggested fixing a plaque to the wall of a famous London hotel , " To the women who fell here during the Great War "
Men could take their pick and were often ruthless .
Betty Milton , who was a kitchen maid , felt that at 26 her marriage prospects were receding .
Life in service did n't offer many opportunities for meeting men , apart from the boy who delivered the groceries .
She was n't very keen on him , but started seeing him and eventually agreed to have sex because he promised to marry her .
" I began to consider myself left on the shelf , an ' old maid ' . . .
I hated it but at 26 I was dead scared of losing him . "
Betty got caught by the man 's mother , and her suitor fled .
She was lucky not to get pregnant - society did not tolerate extramarital sex and many unmarried mothers were condemned to asylums , while their babies were put out for adoption or sent to reformatories .
But with headlines like " A Million Women Too Many - 1920 Husband Hunt " from the Daily Mail , many eligible young men became afraid that every woman who approached them , however innocently , was trying to hijack them into marriage .
After her brother Edward was killed in June 1918 , the writer Vera Brittain was desperate to learn the particulars of his fate , and relentlessly pursued his injured colonel , who had not only been awarded a VC but was also tall and good - looking .
Despite this , Vera had no interest in him but for his knowledge of Edward 's last hours ; to this end she haunted his hospital bedside and took every opportunity to get him to talk .
But the young colonel was vain , cold and reluctant .
He seemed , she wrote : " Nervously afraid that every young woman he met might want to marry him . "
The more she pursued him , the more he avoided her .
She was never able to get him to divulge what he knew , and finally " lost sight of him altogether " .
Whatever became of this selfobsessed young man , we will never know .
Suffice to say , his life post - war was probably far happier than the fates of those two million young women for whom love , family and a home of their own had been shot away for ever .

A prominent independent developer labelled modern games such as World of Warcraft " unethical " at a recent Melbourne conference .
Jonathan Blow , creator of upcoming time - bending game Braid , told the Free Play conference at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image that games can be art but he is concerned about what they are really teaching players .
" I believe that games are important to the future of humanity , " Mr Blow says .
" It sounds like a grand statement but it 's obviously true for other forms of art that we 're very familiar with .
Films and novels have drastically shaped the society that we live in ; without them our lives would be very different .
Nothing triggers a fanboy frenzy like when a magnificent game with a running streak of near - perfect review scores finally gets tripped up with a rating that yanks its head down out of the clouds .
After a series of scores ranging from 95 % - 100 % at metacritic , Gamespot dashes the hopes of those seeking perfection with an abysmal rating of 90 % .
Oh , just shut down the whole site now as it is obviously teeming with incompetence ( give me a break ) .
This is not the sort of uneducated / satirical review posted at Sony Defense Force yesterday .
This is the vastly - experienced opinion of Gamespot ’s Editoral Director Jeff Gerstmann , who has been with the site for ten years .
Also , to be fair , Jeff has most likely played System Shock 2 , and those blessed enough to have experienced that little stroke of genius will most likely be merely impressed , rather than amazed , by BioShock .
Now there may be some foundation to the debate that the console on which the game was tested may have been malfunctioning , as Jeff criticizes in - game “ freezing ” that has not yet been mentioned by those who snagged early Toys R Us copies nor by journalists who had reviewed the game beforehand .
Nonetheless , all of this has generated some interesting reading in the rapidly - growing flame war that was corralled into a sticky in Gamespot ’s BioShock forum .
( UPDATE : The topic has since been removed . )
Some people have a standard complaint …
After reading this review iam convinced that gamespot writers love to shoot , shoot and nothing more , they do n’t care about the story or the variety of a game , the 9.0 score would have been good if games like “ gears of no story justshoot war ” had receive an 8.0 .
Graphics are good , but not everything – “
… others take it a bit more seriously …
I am writing the better business bureua on jeff seriously his reign has gone on dfar too long and i personally think he uses the fact that we call him phat and stupid as a disgiuse to how menicle he really is and how he wants to spin the media his way . ”
… and finally there are the elite wordsmiths who manage to stagger us all with their profundity :
THE REVIEW SUCKS DONKEY ”
In all honesty , I do have to agree with one person who complained that –gameplay differences aside–BioShock got the same score as Perfect Dark Zero .
Anyway , just had to share all this before spending my day off in Rapture .
I ’ll let you know how it is .
See you all tomorrow .

Bugatti , the end is nigh , maybe .
Those lovable scamps over at Shelby SuperCars are poised to break the production car speed record ( 242 mph ) currently being held hostage somewhere in Sweden by Koenigsegg .
The unofficial production - car speed record of 253 mph is , of course , safe and sound somewhere in the German French Alps .
This time out , SSC has enlisted the help of the Guinness Book of World Records to properly sanction their attempt .
To set the record , the 1,183 horsepower Ultimate Aero TT must go really frigging fast in one direction , flip a bitch and then come rocketing back along the same road within one hour 's time .
The two speeds will be averaged to establish the official v-max .
SSC will be commandeering a public highway in their home state of Washington and employing the services of Dewetron ( they measure the speed of missiles ) , which will be using between 4 and 12 satellites to track the Ultimate Aero 's run .
To refresh your memories , last time out , the TT hit 241.4 mph at a driver - reported " 71 percent throttle . "
I know I speak for everyone at Jalopnik when I say that we expect 110 percent throttle this time out .
As for when , the press release does n't say .
Regardless , good luck boys .
The full press release and an offer from SSC after the jump .

From the man with the very best name on planet earth , Junus Khan , " SSC is launching its 250 MPH Club which offers a variety of insider information .
One lucky member from the 250 MPH Club will be selected at random to be flown in to SSC for a day of driving and spending time with Jerod Shelby , the owner of SSC . "
Good luck to you , dear reader : http://www.shelbysupercars.com/

Press Release :
Following on yesterday 's post about a newly unearthed document that contradicts Yahoo's statement to Congress about its involvement in China 's jailing of a dissident , the same human rights group has translated emails in another case , showing that in 2002 Yahoo turned over emails about a democratic political movement that led to political persecution by China .
Wang Xiaoning , whose poignant story Luke O'Brien told for Wired several months ago , is now serving a 10 - year sentence for " subversion , " following an investigation that involved subpoenas to Yahoo 's China office .
Wang 's wife Yu Ling ( pictured ) is now attempting to sue Yahoo for turning over the emails .
The new translations from the Dui Hua Foundation , a human rights group .
show that Yahoo China was informed that the investigation was about " inciting subversion , " which should have been a clear tip - off to the company that the investigation involved political speech .
Additionally , since the government was asking for the contents of the emails , not just the subscriber information , the company should have been able to see that the investigation was political in nature after performing the search .
The emails ( .pdf ) in question were communications from the new , democracy - promoting political party Wang had formed called the Third Way .
On April 23 , 2002 , agents of the Beijing State Security Bureau approached Yahoo ! ’s
Beijing office with a notice requesting information about a Yahoo !
Groups account as well as registration and login information for two Yahoo ! email addresses .
In a subsequent request for information on August 14 , 2002 , police sought registration information , login information , and email messages for another Yahoo !
email account , all of which appear to have been provided on that same day by Yahoo ! ’s
Beijing office .
Both of the police notices clearly state “ suspected inciting subversion ” as the cause of the investigation .
On September 1 , 2002 , Wang Xiaoning was taken into custody by police in Beijing on suspicion of “ inciting subversion . ”
He was charged with using an online newsletter to attack the government and advocate multi-party elections , and he was alleged to have used his Yahoo !
accounts to disseminate the political writings of his “ Chinese Third Way Party ” to hundreds of recipients .
Sentenced to 10 years ’ imprisonment by the Beijing Number One Intermediate People ’s Court on September 12 , 2003 , Wang is due for release from Beijing Number Two Prison on August 31 , 2012 .
Yahoo spokesperson Jim Cullinan says :
Yahoo !
China is run by Alibaba .
This has been true since 2005 , but we do own a 40 % stake in Alibaba .
You would have to ask Alibaba and Yahoo !
China what their current policy is .

With low crime , little threat from instability or terrorism and a highly developed transport and communications infrastructure , Canada and Australia are home to the most liveable destinations in the world .
Four of the ten most liveable cities surveyed by the Economist Intelligence Unit are in Australia , and two of the top five are Canadian ( see full report ) .
Vancouver is the most attractive destination , with a liveability index of just 1.3 % ( see table ) .
While liveability considers factors of recreational and cultural activity , the " big city buzz " can hamper the scores of some cities , although not to the extent that a city will present significant challenges .
Global centres such as New York , Tokyo , London , Hong Kong and Paris may find themselves let down precisely because of their size and attractiveness .
Traffic congestion and higher crime rates associated with large urban centres have , to some extent , offset the obvious cultural gains of living in such locations .
This has also been compounded by fears that large centres like London and New York will remain targets for high - profile terror attacks .
Despite this , most major centres do not present any significant challenges to liveability .
Of the 132 cities surveyed , only nine cities present the worst - case scenario in which most aspects of living quality are severely restricted , reflecting general improvements on a global scale in areas such as education , health care and infrastructure .
Four of these are in Asia , mainly South Asia .
The other five are in Africa ( accounting for three ) and the Middle East ( accounting for two ) .
The threat of terrorism and civil unrest is a major contributing factor to the cities that suffer from the worst liveability scores , as are poor development indicators .
Algiers is the least liveable destination in the survey , with a score of 64.7 % .

Apple has filed a patent application on a technology for tethering rechargeable devices ( like iPods ) to particular chargers .
The idea is that the device will only allow its batteries to be recharged if it is connected to an authorized charger .
Whether this is good for consumers depends on how a device comes to be authorized .
If “ authorized ” just means “ sold or licensed by Apple ” then consumers wo n’t benefit – the only effect will be to give Apple control of the aftermarket for replacement chargers .
But if the iPod ’s owner decides which chargers are authorized , then this might be a useful anti-theft measure – there ’s little point in stealing an iPod if you wo n’t be able to recharge it .
How might this work ?
One possibility is that when the device is plugged in to a charger it has n’t seen before , it makes a noise and prompts the user to enter a password on the iPod ’s screen .
If the correct password is entered , the device will allow itself to be recharged by that charger in the future .
The device will become associated with a group of chargers over time .
Another possibility , mentioned in the patent , is that there could be a central registry of stolen iPods .
When you synched your iPod with your computer , the computer would get a digitally signed statement from the registry , saying that your iPod was not listed as stolen .
The computer would pass that signed statement on to the iPod .
If the iPod went too long without seeing such a statement , it would demand that the user do a synch , or enter a password , before it would allow itself to be recharged .
How can we tell whether a DRM scheme like this is good for users .
One sure - fire test is whether the user has the option of turning the scheme off .
You do n’t want a thief to be able to disable the scheme on a stolen iPod , but it ’s safe to let the user disable the anti-theft feature the first time she syncs her new iPod , or later by entering a password .
We do n’t know yet whether Apple will do this .
But reading the patent , it looks to me like Apple has thought carefully about the legitimate anti-theft uses of this technology .
That ’s a good sign .

War is like it says in the Book of John : " In that house there are many mansions . "
And the best war mansions are the ones nobody ever visits - like old war paperbacks you find for 50 cents at storefront bookstores , the kind that smell like mould and make the rent on old porn mags .
That 's where I found my current favourite book , I Was A Kamikaze , by Ryuji Nagatsuka .
I bought the book for two reasons : the title and the cover art .
The cover art was like a letter from home for me , the kind of art they just do n't do any more : a Zero zooming down toward a U.S. aircraft carrier .
It 's the details that make battle paintings so wonderful to look at , and this one had all the classics : the ragged AA holes in the Zero 's tail flaps , the bigger gashes in the wing fabric , and the brown oil smoke trailing from the fuselage .
If you 're any kind of a man at all , you were once the kind of boy who used to trace those bullet holes with your fingertips while making little kaSHOO !
noises from the AA shells zipping past .
I know I used to spend hours lying in bed eating Oreos and looking at covers like this , trying to figure out whether this particular Kamikaze was going to hit his target or end up as a big waterspout , going down cursing like a Japanese Yosemite Sam just yards short of the U.S. flight deck .
" I Was a Kamikaze Squadron Mascot " by Kutize Puppy And then there was the title .
How can you not buy a book called I Was A Kamikaze ?
That is what they call in the communications business " A Grabber . "
Not to mention a riddle : whaddaya mean , I " WAS " a kamikaze ?
You do n't see too many suicide bombers with their grandkids on their knee telling war stories .
Turns out Nagatsuka , the author , was a cadet pilot in the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force who survived the war because his unit 's big mission was scrubbed on account of bad weather , and by the time they found enough fuel to try again , the war had ended .
You'd think the pilots would have had a hard time pretending they were sincerely disappointed not to blow themselves up : " Gosh darn that pesky rain !
I was so looking forward to being blown into teriyaki ! " - but you 'd be wrong .
Nagtsuka is a diehard believer in the Imperial way of seeing things , and the way he tells it , he and his comrades really were sorry they did n't get to die .
Decline and fall : From kamikaze moms to neon tourists
That 's the real fun of reading a book like this : soaking up the feel of a totally weird world .
And they do n't come much weirder than Japan , pre-1945 .
That world is gone , gone , gone .
We totally gelded the Germans and the Japanese , turned them into shuffling tourists .
That 's why people are always doing " Boys from Brazil " books and movies about the revival of Nazism : because the fact is there 's nothing as dead as the Nazis and Imperial Japan .
Jurassic
Park will happen before those dinosaurs come back .
Everybody should read books like this just to see how dirt - dull and namby - pamby our world is compared to the zoo of a world we had in the first half of the good ol ' 20th century .
What we have now is a Nerf multi-culture , where people chow down on Japanese or Ethiopian or whatever food but make damn sure that the Japanese and Ethiopians and everyone else are turning into Ohioans as fast as we can squeeze them .

PBS : Weapons of US soldiers in Iraq ' plagued with problems '
David Edwards and Greg Wasserstrom

The M - 16 , the choice rifle of the United States Armed Forces , turns 50 years old this month and is still plagued by many of the same problems it had half a century ago , putting American troops in Iraq at a severe disadvantage when it comes to small arms combat , the PBS program Newshour reported tonight .
" That AK - 74 outhits the M - 16 by two to one on full automatic , " said Jim Sullivan , referring to the Russian - made assault rifle , now in its third generation .
" And the reason there were 100 million AK 's made was n't to equip the Russian army - it was to give [ to ] our Third World opponents .
The United States can't win ground wars anymore . "
The M - 16 and its successor , the shorter M4 , are known for their finickiness , jamming in even the most innocuous conditions .
In combat , the unreliability of the rifle can be deadly .
Regarding his son currently serving in Iraq , Sullivan said , " He should have an AK . "
The following video is from PBS 's Newshour , broadcast on September 24 .
The heart of the system is the super - cooled , solenoid - style electromagnet and the metal plate that causes an asymmetry in the magnetic field .
The U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) is typically not in the business of developing propulsion systems for NASA , but it is continually working on better superconducting magnets and very rapid , high - power solid - state switches .
In the mid-1990s , Goodwin chaired a session for NASA 's Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Project , which is working to design propulsion systems that have no propellant , use a very high energy system and can eventually overcome inertia .
" It seemed that there should be some way to use this technology that [ DOE scientists ] were developing to help NASA meet their goals , and it basically sprang from that , " Goodwin said .
What sprang from the DOE research was Goodwin 's idea for a space propulsion system that uses super - cooled , superconducting magnets vibrating 400,000 times per second .
If this rapid pulse can be directed in one direction , it could create a very efficient space propulsion system with the ability to achieve speeds on the order of a fraction of 1 percent of the speed of light .

During the first 100 nanoseconds ( billionths of a second ) of an electromagnet ramping up , the electromagnet is in a non-steady state that allows it to pulse very rapidly .
After it ramps up , the magnetic field reaches a steady state and no pulsing occurs .
Goodwin describes the electromagnet he is using as a solenoid , which is basically a superconducting magnetic wire wrapped around a metal cylinder .
The entire structure will have a diameter of 1 foot ( 30.5 cm ) , a height of 3 feet ( 91.4 cm ) and a weight of 55.12 pounds ( 25 kg ) .
The wire used for this propulsion system is a niobium - tin alloy .
Several of these wire strands will be wrapped into a cable .
This electromagnet is then super - cooled with liquid helium to 4 degrees Kelvin ( - 452.47 F / - 269.15 C ) .
For the magnet to vibrate , you need to cause an asymmetry in the magnetic field .
Goodwin plans to deliberately introduce a metal plate into the magnetic field to enhance the vibrating movement .
This plate would be made of either copper , aluminum or iron .
The aluminum and copper plates are better conductors and have a greater effect on the magnetic field .
The plate would be charged up and isolated from the system to create the asymmetry .
Then the plate would be drained of electricity in the few microseconds ( millionths of a second ) before the magnet were allowed to oscillate in the opposite direction .
" Now , the catch here is , can we use this non-steady state condition in such a way that it only moves in one direction ? "
Goodwin said .
" And that 's where it 's very uncertain that that can be done .
That 's why we would like to do an experiment to find out . "
Together with the cooperation of Boeing , Goodwin is seeking funding from NASA to perform such an experiment .
The key to the system is the solid - state switch that would mediate the electricity being sent from the power supply to the electromagnet .
This switch basically turns the electromagnet on and off 400,000 times per second .
A solid - state switch looks something like an oversized computer chip -- imagine a microprocessor about the size of a hockey puck .
Its job is to take the steady - state power and convert it to a very rapid , high - power pulse 400,000 times per second at 30 amps and 9,000 volts .
In the next section , you 'll learn where the system draws its power from and how it may send future spacecraft beyond our solar system .
On Monday night comedian and host of HBO 's " Real Time " , Bill Maher , appeared on " The Factor " and talked politics will Bill O'Reilly .
Knowing he was out - gunned in the brains department , BillO treads lightly through most of the interview , but manages to get his digs in along the way .
This was classic Maher , intertwining brilliant comedy with serious and and honest facts -- even BillO laughed at some of his jokes -- the ones he understood ...

Q : When is a blogger not just a blogger ?
A : When that blogger helps candidates win an election .
That 's the premise of two recent complaints to the Federal Election Commission about political bloggers , some of whom are charged with being little more than toadies for various political campaigns .
Both complaints request that the FEC apply federal election rules to such bloggers so that campaigns can't simply evade spending limits by funding Internet - only attack groups .
But the FEC remained unimpressed by the complaints , and yesterday ruled that in both cases bloggers had the right to do what they were doing without Commission regulation .
The first complaint was against popular leftie blog DailyKos .
One John Bambenek asked the FEC this summer to look into the issue of whether DailyKos had failed to register as a " political committee . "
Bambenek seized on statements that the blog was out to " elect Democrats " and that it contributed at least the equivalent of $ 1,000 per year ( in hosting fees and salaries ) toward this goal .
Thus , in his view , DailyKos was a political committee .
" Can a political committee avoid campaign regulations by simply organizing in the form of a blog ? " he asked .
" Surely not . "
The FEC disagreed with this line of reasoning .
The Commission tossed the complaint because it found that DailyKos was eligible for the " media exemption " to these kinds of campaign finance rules .
Back in 2006 , the FEC announced that it would not generally regulate blogs , and it also made clear that the media exemption set up in 1974 explicitly applied to online publications .
Blog posts do n't count as contributions to a candidate unless the blog in question is " owned by a political party , committee , or candidate " ( regardless of earlier FUD from an FEC Commissioner ) .
DailyKos was understandably pleased with the decision .
According to their reading of the law , " if you 're doing news , commentary or editorial , and you 're not owned / controlled by a political candidate , party or committee , you 're exempt . "
The situation for bloggers is similar to that of newspapers , which can also endorse candidates without being political entities for purposes of the law .
Bloggers against Bono
The Commission also rejected a second complaint against another blogger who worked to defeat California Representative Mary Bono back in 2006 .
The complaint , filed by Bono 's counsel , charged that the blogger in question had engaged in " fraudulent misrepresentation of campaign authority " and unreported " coordination " with a political campaign .
In dismissing this complaint , the Commission found that the blogger had received no contributions from Bono 's opponent and was acting on a volunteer basis .
The Federal Election Campaign
Act exempts such volunteer activity from regulation .
Two decisions , two years apart , both coming to similar conclusions : the FEC has little apparent interest in regulating speech in the blogosphere unless that speech is directly paid for by a candidate .
Everyone else , though , is welcome to step up to the Internet driving range , pull out a 3 wood , and tee off .
In a pastoral setting , the gorgeous cast - glass facade of Neutelings and Riedijk ’s Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision masks an efficient ecological machine .
Built to house the Dutch television and radio archives , the center ’s galleries and offices are insulated from extreme weather by a facade of double glass panels .
The archives themselves are buried in underground vaults — the surrounding earth is used to cool the warren of storage rooms .
The building is split into two climatic zones , not just to save energy but to reinforce the experience of two different environments : the dark world of the underground vaults , which the architects dubbed the inferno , and the twinkling , light - filled world above .
Neutelings was quick to note that a building ’s efficiency should be measured not just by its mechanical systems but also by how much energy it uses over its lifetime .
More energy is expended in a building ’s construction than at any other stage , so a structure that lasts 100 years will use far less energy than one that lasts 5 , no matter how efficient .
“ From this point of view the Pyramids are the most sustainable buildings in history , ” he said .
For now , the United States has no federal regulations that would guarantee a minimal level of sustainability in new construction — or spur an ecologically attuned approach to new architecture .
The LEED guidelines , which were drawn up by the U.S. Green Building Council , a nonprofit group founded in 1993 , are a voluntary program that is now more than a decade old .
Even when they are adhered to — they ’ve been adopted by a number of government agencies , most notably the General Services Administration , which oversees the construction of federal buildings — they still have little effect on the majority of commercial or residential construction .
In most cases , the decision to make an efficient building still rests with the client .
What ’s more , the guidelines often lead to a constricted idea of what sustainability means .
“ In Europe the guidelines tend to have to do with broader organizational ideas , ” Thom Mayne , the founder of the Los Angeles - based architectural firm Morphosis , told me .
“ Energy consumption , the organization of the workplace , urbanism — they ’re all seen as interlinked .
Here , the whole focus is on how to get these points .
You just check them off : bike racks , high - efficiency air - conditioning units — it ’s very narrow . ”
Stefan Behnisch , an architect who has long been considered a leader in sustainable research and has worked in both Europe and the United States , agrees .
“ The problem is that these ideas become clichés , ” he says .
“ They do n’t allow for anything interesting and new .
They rule out real invention . ”
There are , nonetheless , some significant , innovative projects in the United Sates .
Norman Foster ’s new Hearst Tower in Manhattan has many of the sustainable features he began exploring in the Commerzbank in Frankfurt , like natural ventilation and high - performance glass that deflects heat .
And the San Francisco Federal Building , completed this year by Morphosis , looks as if it could have been assembled in Germany : the building ’s narrow width gives everyone access to natural light and ventilation , operable windows let in fresh air , elaborate shading devices filter sunlight .
“ In San Francisco , ” Mayne told me , “ we did n’t even bother to go after the LEED ranking because it does n’t necessarily lead to the most efficient building . ”
But architects who choose to be inventive often find that the slightest deviation from the norm is fiercely resisted .
Mayne relates how some federal workers at his San Francisco building mocked the idea of office - building windows that could be opened and closed , arguing that birds would nest on their desks while they were away over the weekend .
Bloggers , meanwhile , claimed that some government bureaucrats had to wear sunglasses indoors because of the amount of natural light .
Mayne countered that the shades have yet to be installed .
To be sure , it is not just Americans who resist seeing a building as an integral part of the environment .
Sauerbruch and his partner , Louisa Hutton , told me that workers at the environment agency in Dessau — long in the habit of toiling in sealed , air - conditioned buildings — often forget to close their windows when they leave the office .
Apparently , many of them still find the effort a nuisance .
After the overwhelmingly positive responses to and praise for the original 7 Abandoned Urban Wonders article , we were compelled to create a sequel .
Thanks to reader - submitted links and locations , we have compiled a follow - up that should rival ( or even top ) the original ( 75,000 views ) !
Without further ado , here are seven more amazing examples of abandoned cities and other deserted urban wonders from around the world :
( Check out our complete collection of 100 + Abandoned Buildings , Places and Property . )
(7) Gunkanjima , Japan :
Once known for having one of the highest population densities in the world ( 1.4 people per square meter ) “ Battleship Island ” is now completely deserted .
Known today as “ Ghost Island , ” this strange place stands out from other hundreds of abandoned Japanese islands for its massive concrete sea walls and omnipresent and ominous concrete architecture .
Some people have snuck onto the island to take photographs and explore .
(6) Varosha , Cyprus : Photographing this city , fenced off by the Turkish military in 1974 , is forbidden .
These images show a rare glimpse inside of this eerie ghost town .
The area was once home to thousands of Greek Cypriots who have been denied for decades the right to return to their homes .
The photographer who took these images nearly lost his camera to a military patrol , and the slanted angles are a result of shooting from his side when he could .
(5) Verona , New Jersey : The Essex Mountain Sanatorium is an amazing example of a prevalent type of abandonment .
Mental hospitals were largely abandoned in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s , being widely considered no better than prisons for the mentally ill .
In the wake of this movement , many such building complexes were simply left to decay over time .
Of course , breaking into these and taking photographs often yields interesting stories .
(4) Bangkok , Thailand :
This former Russian Embassy , including the century - old Luang Sathorn Mansion , is remarkably preserved despite being long abandoned .
Sound - proofed and metal - lined walls tell the story of what was once a Russian intelligence stronghold during the Cold War .
Pieces of intelligence and communications equipment are strewn about , but much of the architecture and decor remain intact .
(3) Pyongyang , North Korea :
Once slated to be the largest hotel structure in the world , the Ryugyung Hotel building remains incomplete , a towering but hollow concrete shell .
At over 1,000 feet high , this building represents a political response to the South Korean company ’s equivalent .
It is unclear whether the structure will ever be finished .
For now , it remains an empty giant on the skyline .
(2) Detroit , Michigan :
The population of detroit has decreased by half over the past fifty years .
Vast areas of land have been cleared in an effort to rid the city of its abandonments , but many structures still remain .
Even landmark buildings of historical and architectural value have been demolished .
People tend to think that all urban areas grow over time , but Detroit provides a striking counterexample .
(1) Centralia , Pennsylvania : Fourty years later , this abandoned town is still burning from below , due to a coal mine fire that never went out , bringing underworld metaphors to life .
Carbon monoxide rose to dangerous levels ( and sink holes opened up beneath unsuspecting residents ) before many left the area for good .
Today , a few people still live in or around Centralia , though smoke continues to curl up out of the ground and through gaping cracks in highways .
Some try to comprehend it through fascinating videos of the town .
Others just pass through , documenting their experience of this surreal place .
Honorable Mentions go out to three other reader - submitted recommendations : ( 1 ) Humberstone , Chile , is now a World Heritage Site .
( 2 ) Cook , Australia , is an abandoned outpost town in the Australian Outback .
( 3 ) Gary , Indiana , though not fully abandoned has some impressive deserted structures .

For years , the military has been warning that soldiers ' blogs could pose a security threat by leaking sensitive wartime information .
But a series of online audits , conducted by the Army , suggests that official Defense Department websites post material far more potentially harmful than anything found on a individual 's blog .
The audits , performed by the Army Web Risk Assessment Cell between January 2006 and January 2007 , found at least 1,813 violations of operational security policy on 878 official military websites .
In contrast , the 10 - man , Manassas , Virginia , unit discovered 28 breaches , at most , on 594 individual blogs during the same period .
The results were obtained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , after the digital rights group filed a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act .
" It 's clear that official Army websites are the real security problem , not blogs , " said EFF staff attorney Marcia Hofmann .
" Bloggers , on the whole , have been very careful and conscientious .
It 's a pretty major disparity . "
The findings stand in stark contrast to Army statements about the risks that blogs pose .
" Some soldiers continue to post sensitive information to internet websites and blogs , " then - Army Chief of Staff Peter Schoomaker wrote in a 2005 memo .
" Such OPSEC ( operational security ) violations needlessly place lives at risk . "
That same year , commanders in Iraq ordered ( . pdf ) troops to register their blogs " with the unit chain of command . "
Originally formed in 2002 to police official Defense Department websites ( .mil ) , the Army Web Risk Assessment Cell , or AWRAC , expanded its mission in 2005 .
A handful of military bloggers , including then - Spec. Colby Buzzell , were seen as providing too many details of firefights in Iraq .
Buzzell , for one , was banned from patrols and confined to base after one such incident , and AWRAC began looking for others like him on blogs and .com sites .
But AWRAC hunted for more than overly vivid battle descriptions .
It scoured pages for all kinds of information : personal data , like home addresses and Social Security numbers ; restricted and classified documents ; even pictures of weapons .
When these violations were found , AWRAC contacted the webmaster or blog editor , and asked that they change their sites .
" Big Brother is not watching you , but 10 members of a Virginia National Guard unit might be , " an official Army news story warned bloggers .
Within the Army , some worried that the blog - monitoring had compromised AWRAC 's original goal .
" My suspicion ... is that the AWRAC 's attention is being diverted by the new mission of reviewing all the Army blogs , " reads an e-mail ( .pdf ) from the office of the Army Chief Information Officer obtained in EFF 's FOIA lawsuit .
" In the past they did a good job of detecting and correcting ( website policy compliance ) violations , but that is currently not the case . "
On one blog , AWRAC found photos showing bomb damage to a Humvee ; on another , a description of a mountain near a base in Afghanistan ; on a third , a video about " morale concerning incoming mortar . "
AWRAC discovered a secret presentation on the official , unclassified Army Knowledge Online network .
It found a map of an Army training center in Texas on a second .mil site .
A " colonel 's wife 's maiden name " was caught on a third .
The documents unearthed by the EFF also show that AWRAC 's investigations may have been meant to discourage any Army blogging – not just correct security flaws .
One soldier - blogger noted that " The DoD ( Department of Defense ) is cracking down ... and I would n't be able to continue blogging . "
AWRAC 's internal response : " The word is getting out . "
" I wo n't be blogging anything cool probably while we 're here , " another soldier wrote .
" I remember really enjoying a few blogs at the beginning of the war , but they were pushing the limits a little bit on OPSEC and I do n't plan to get anywhere near those limits . "
AWRAC 's answer : " GO ARMY ! "
The AWRAC monitoring is part of an ongoing struggle in the military over digital media .
To some , these new forms of communications are security risks waiting to happen .
Others welcome soldiers posting to blogs , online video sites and social networks as information warfare , combating a wave of Islamist propaganda online .
This spring , the Army released stringent new rules ( . pdf ) telling soldiers to stop posting to blogs without first clearing the content with a superior officer .
" Personal websites of individual Soldiers ( to include web logs or ' blogs ' ) are a potentially significant vulnerability , " Army Regulation 530 - 1 noted .
The guidelines ' author , Major Ray Ceralde , cited the Pentagon 's take - out pizza orders as an example of potentially damaging information that a blog might leak .
Days later , the Army issued a " fact sheet " which seemed to back away from the rules – without officially retracting them .
The overlapping guidelines created a climate of confusion for soldier - bloggers .
Sgt. Edward Watson , a blogger currently deployed with the 82nd Airborne Division in Baghdad , was threatened by his company 's commander for perceived transgressions of the blog policies .
" They wanted to give me an Article 15 ( non-judicial punishment ) for a regulation I was clueless about , and they never brief anyone about starting or running blogs , " Sgt. Watson told Wired News in an e-mail .
He was eventually allowed to keep his website – after removing some of the more detailed entries .
Overall , the new documents reveal , AWRAC found few security breaches on soldiers ' sites – at most , 28 in more than a year .
That 's a fraction of the thousands of violations found on official sites .
( The precise number of breaches is unclear .
In AWRAC 's presentations , numbers contradict one another , or are transposed from one month to the next .
For example , AWRAC came up at different points with five separate figures for the number of .mil pages scanned in September 2006 .
The documents show that the number of breaches may have been as high as 4,052 on official military sites , and as low as 14 on blogs . )
To D.J. Elliott , a blogger and former intelligence officer , the statistics – however uneven – are proof that " the milblogs ( military blogs ) are policing their own far tighter than officialdom is . "
" Most of the milblog ( er ) s are there or have people close to them there , " he wrote in an e-mail to Wired News .
" They maintain OPSEC because it is personal to them .
Self - preservation .
It is risking them and / or theirs . "
Army spokesman Gordon Van Vleet seemed to agree with that assessment .
One " factor that contributes to fewer violations being found on blogs is that in general the blogger is conscientious about their duty to not provide information that could be considered an OPSEC violation , " he wrote .
" Often these bloggers are stationed in the combat areas and they more than anyone understand the importance of security and the potential impact any OPSEC violations could have on themselves and their fellow Soldiers , Airmen and Marines . "

THE most famous riff in rock is the 3 1/2 - chord skull buster that stalks Deep Purple ’s 1972 “ Smoke on the Water ” -- a branding moment in the infancy of heavy metal .
And as Deep Purple ’s set at last year ’s Montreux Jazz Festival ( recently documented on DVD ) climbed to its climax , the customers stood waiting for that coup de grace .
Then it came .
Sort of .
Goateed Don Airey tinkled a sprightly mutation of the “ Smoke ” melody on piano .
Slouching barfly Ian Paice swung his drumsticks into an up - tempo shuffle .
Hot - cha , y’all !
Fire in the sky !
The band jammed for more than two minutes , but there were no cheers of recognition and delight ; the crowd was clearly stunned .
So when Steve Morse truncated a blues guitar solo and smashed into the classic dut - dut - dahhh , the thunderous relief that burst from thousands of throats came off like a Pentecostal affirmation .
But Deep Purple ’s little gag should n’t have been such a shock ; heavy metal and jazz have been sipping quite a bit of lemonade on the veranda together lately .
Bopsters used to disdain metal as kid stuff ; metal dudes thought jazz was for geeks .
But both forms -- and forms ai n’t as pure as they used to be -- tend to make huge technical demands , challenging the outer limits of fingers and mind .
And musicians love a challenge , whether it ’s traversing the migraine mutations of John Coltrane ’s “ Giant Steps , ” cracking the next level of the Quake video game or sniffing out a new audience by combining styles .

In 2005 , Judith Owen , a leading light of eclectic modern balladry , essayed her own Scotch - scented lounge version of “ Smoke on the Water . ”
The previous year saw the new - generation Midwestern jazz trio the Bad Plus expanding on Black Sabbath ’s 1970 metal girder “ Iron Man . ” Dave Lombardo , drummer for thrash - metal progenitors Slayer , has made records with DJ Spooky on the New York avant - jazz scene .
One night in Los Angeles , Jeff Kollman sweats out rampaging , riff - heavy improvisational guitar at Studio City ’s longtime fusion hangout the Baked Potato ; another night he ’s smelting funk - metal at the Whisky with former Deep Purple bassist - singer Glenn Hughes .
Chris Poland spent a good hunk of the ‘ 80s ( and more recently ) ripping guitar alongside Dave Mustaine in the melodic thrash - metal outfit Megadeth ; he can also be found at the Baked Potato fronting his space - fusion trio , Ohm .
Above the Roxy at On the Rox in April , you could ’ve caught Brian Haas of the youth - friendly Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey in an ad hoc jam band with Zac Baird , the touring keyboardist for the nu-metal group Korn .
And Saturday at East Hollywood ’s Steve Allen Theater , the Sound series was scheduled to host “ Noisy Night ” : a crew of local electronic improvisers spontaneously meshing gears with members of Southern California metalers Cattle Decapitation , the Locust and the Melvins .
In our current Age of the Extreme -- extreme sports , torture movies , even unsoft soft drinks -- crazy technique and over - the - top solos are turning heads again .
And extreme jazz , heavy metal and metal fusion all attract the same kinds of musicians , a breed that ’s no longer quite so scarce thanks to video games and rapid - cut film editing : people who like things fast and get a charge from personal mastery .

The roots of fusion
THE hookup has been a long time coming .
“ I thought Eddie Van Halen was cooler than Lee Ritenour , ” says keyboardist Derek Sherinian , who plies the instrumental galaxies of what he calls “ metal fusion ” with the band Planet X and his own solo music ; he ’s also cranked straight metal with Dream Theater and the Swedish metal - classical guitar marvel Yngwie Malmsteen .
“ Some jazz players think that by putting a distortion box on their tone , all of a sudden it ’s rock , ” says Sherinian , lounging in his Valley home / studio .
“ But unless you grew up listening to Led Zeppelin , Van Halen , Black Sabbath , and you have that music in your heart , it ’s not gonna rock .
Jeff Beck was the model for me , because he was a rock player who crossed over to the jazz side . ”

In the ‘ 70s though , it was mainly African American jazz players who were crossing over to rock -- selling out , many observers whined .
But when Miles Davis heard Jimi Hendrix detonating sound bombs in the late ‘ 60s , he knew jazz needed to twist the volume knob .
And electrified Miles begat a generation of fusioneers that included Tony Williams , John McLaughlin , Herbie Hancock , Chick Corea and Joe Zawinul , and Williams begat the nonpareil six - string speedster Allan Holdsworth .
Similarly , in L.A. , Frank Zappa , who ’d always tapped jazz sources and musicians , waxed louder and heavier .
And Zappa begat the genre - defying guitar monsters Steve Vai and Mike Keneally .
( For an in - depth seminar on the practice of modern fusion , check Keneally ’s recent CD / DVD reissues . )
Jazz has also worked its voodoo on rock guitar heroes through the unlikely agency of bop piano theoretician Lennie Tristano , tutor to Joe Satriani , a key supercharger of electric - guitar technique .
And Satriani begat the eight - string guitarist - bassist Charlie Hunter and Metallica ’s Kirk Hammett , and co-begat Vai .
The common factors between metal and jazz ?
Technique : the wonderfully unnatural feats the human limbs and brain are forced to accomplish when running down riffs at quicksilver speed , or playing 11th chords in 11/8 time .
Improvisation : Always at the root of jazz , it ’s also the process through which most modern metal structures are created .
And advanced harmony : Both metal and jazz discarded folk basics long ago , and hybrid artists come up with chords that would scare Schoenberg .

Howe , the ultimate hybridist , stretches from sideman spiels with Prince to his own funk / fusion / metal explosions ; recently he guested on a Jeff Beck tribute album .
“ Back in high school , my one group of friends was into Ronnie James Dio , and my other group of friends was into disco , ” says Howe by phone from his Long Beach home .
“ And if I ever said that I liked this song by Kool and the Gang , and I also liked this song by Black Sabbath , people looked at me like I was n’t allowed to say that . ”
Zakk Wylde , now 40 years old , was too young to have posed with the first generation of rock guitar gods .
But his electric exploits in Ozzy Osbourne ’s band since age 19 and later with his own Black Label Society kept the shredding aesthetic visible during the thud - and - rap generation of nu-metal .
Sherinian has employed him frequently on his metal - fusion solo albums ; he ’s broad - minded enough to admit his admiration for Neil Young and Elton John .
Wylde will sit down with an acoustic guitar or a piano -- even a banjo .
And fusion ?
He got his chops the old - fashioned way , via his New Jersey guitar teacher , Leroy Wright .

“ If somebody shows you the way it ’s actually done , you go , ‘ You gotta be kiddin ’ me .
That ’s all he ’s doin ’ ?’
“ A bunch of Leroy ’s buddies were just amazing , amazing musicians .
They ’d come over and they ’d be shredding like nobody ’s business , playing John McLaughlin , Al DiMeola , Chick Corea , Allan Holdsworth , Dixie Dregs -- all this fusion stuff .
It was nuts .
These guys were , like , bricklayers during the day . ”
Getting technical
THERE are many ways to wail .
Kevin Fetus is a member of the Fetus Eaters and Watch Me Burn , two L.A. modern - metal groups that fragment and reassemble musical forms .
( Both play the Knitting Factory next Sunday . )
Feeding his cannibalistic mini-lobsters in his Atwater Village apartment , the dreadlocked and tattooed guitarist vibrates with enthusiasm for John Zorn ’s Naked City , whose noisy guitar - sax interplay and conglomerated structures drew equal reactions of pain and praise in the 1990s .
He thinks the group had a lot to do with fusing metal and jazz .

“ These guys knew everything about music , and they were saying , ‘ Screw it . ’ ”
Jazz has made a particular gift to some heavy music -- one that Joe Lester , bassist of the local prog-metal band Intronaut , draws on .
“ It ’s the use of ‘ tall ’ harmony , ” he notes , “ and of chord progressions beyond those that are common in pop . ”
A metal - jazz connection is rarely articulated , says Lester , who studied music at UC Santa Cruz ; at 24 , he ’s been a practicing musician for 10 years .
“ Guys that are into technical music , death metal and extreme metal love amazing drumming , amazing guitar playing , and they know that jazz is amazing technical music , ” says Lester .
“ But they might not know any names beyond Miles Davis and Louis Armstrong . ”

Who are these supertechnicians ?
Early bloomer
Wylde made an easy connection with Sherinian , who copped a scholarship to the prestigious Berklee School of Music in Boston at age 16 .
But these gents are prodigies -- as rare as honest politicians .
Right ?
Not necessarily .
Bizarre as it seems , kids may actually build requisite dexterity for the speed thrills of extreme jazz and metal through gaming .
The relationship is clearest in the Guitar Hero game , where a player pokes color - coded buttons on a miniature plastic guitar to match famous songs .
On June 23 in Newport Beach , David Briers of Richmond , Ind. , was crowned Play N Trade ’s national Guitar Hero II champion for his synchronization with Lynyrd Skynyrd ’s ‘ 70s staple “ Free Bird . ”
But that ’s not the only game that links music , skills and reaction time .
“ I am a game fanatic , ” says Howe , who ’s 43 .
“ Playing online , I was in a lot of the Quake tournaments .
And I was into Unreal Tournament , Half - Life , even the newer versions of Doom .
I got to the point where I ’d walk into my studio at 9 o’clock in the morning and go , ‘ One game , and that ’s it . ’
And next thing you know it was 4:30 in the afternoon , and my guitar was giving me dirty looks . ”
Fetus thinks the zinging pace of video games helped make his thinking quicker , and their cartoony music left its own imprint .
A decade or two ago , he loved going to the arcade .
Control buttons in hands , he ’d flash through the on - screen obstacles , which were accompanied by hooky , dramatic computer music .

“ You got that music stuck in your head , ” says Fetus , “ and you ’d try to figure it out on guitar : ‘ Now I ’m gonna play that heavy . ’ ”
“ It seems like lots of people my age , and lots of people that are into metal , love video - game music , ” says Lester .
“ And I do too -- all those weekend mornings playing Mario Brothers .
A lot of bands , like Minibosses , play video - game music in a metal style .
“ There ’s definitely a fair amount of hand - eye coordination and rhythm that goes into gaming .
And I think the Guitar Hero game has lent itself to the current rise in popularity for heavy music .
What ’s funny is kids play Guitar Hero so much that they can copy a tear - it - up Zakk Wylde solo .
But then you want to say , ‘ Dude , do you realize if you had spent all that time playing a real guitar , you ’d be onstage and not in your apartment ? ’ ”
Technique is just a tool ; the big thing is what the music expresses .
Case in point : Miles Davis ’ ‘ 60s acoustic quintet , which attracted Lester with its originality and virtuosity .
But then , he says , “ It was so visceral and emotional .
It was about some real , raw feelings . ”

Lester sees that combination growing in metal .
“ There ’s been a real change in the climate for heavy music , both how big of an audience it appeals to and possibly even what aspects about it are appealing to those people .
When I was growing up , metal was a real loner ’s choice -- like , the kids with the long hair around the schoolyard .
And we did n’t care that other people could n’t get it . ”
Asked what qualities unite the kinds of sounds he digs , Fetus names intensity , passion and mood .
Though he does n’t think of himself as a virtuoso , he can play fast and weird .
And that does something for him .
“ We ’re in practice playing , and riffs come in , and our drummer ’s playing faster than he ever has , and we ’re trying to keep up , and we ’re sounding good , ” says Fetus .
“ And you start laughing , because you ’re like , ‘ This is fun .
This is great .
This is the moment .
This is why I play .
Because I ’m ecstatic .
I ’m on top of the world .
Nothing can kill me .
Nothing can crush me now ! ”

無限は君が思ってハック第二版
You never know what 's going to land in your mailbox .
Last night , I found a weapon that shoots an invisible wall - penetrating beam that makes people so dizzy they fall over .
( It can make them puke , too , but I 'll get to that in a moment . )
Okay , okay ... it was only a description of the device that
I came across , going through my ( mostly junk ) mail .
The less - lethal weapon was one of many novelties described in an invitation to the " Navy 's 07 ' Opportunity Forum " for small businesses .
Invocon , Inc. , one of dozens of companies expected to showcase their wares at the forum , says it 'll be there to display its " non-lethal , stand - off weapon for military and law enforcement personnel that could ultimately work through walls and other non-metallic structures . "
They 've even got a Navy contract to develop the thing .
I looked up Invocon 's contract in the Navy 's Small Business Innovative Research database and found this slightly more detailed description of the work :
IVC proposes to investigate the use of beamed RF [ radio frequency ] energy to excite and interrupt the normal process of human hearing and equilibrium .
The focus will be in two areas .
( 1 ) Interruption of the mechanical transduction process by which sound and position ( relative to gravity ) are converted to messages that are processed by the brain .
( 2 ) Interruption of the chemical engine which sustains the proper operation of the nerve cells that respond to the mechanical transduction mechanisms referenced in item ( 1 ) .
Interruption of either or both of these processes has been clinically shown to produce complete disorientation and confusion .
Wow !
Through the walls ?
That even beats the Active Denial System – the pain ray that Noah wrote about the other day .
Invocon even touts its device as a " Star Trek hand - held Phaser Weapon set on ' Stun ' . "
However , rather than causing intense pain , like the Active Denial System , Invocon is advertising a weapon that boasts the ability to go through walls and incapacitate everyone in a room by making them lose their balance .
" Second order effects would be extreme motion sickness , " the company notes .
Basically , you 're safely in your house , an invisible beam hits you , you feel dizzy , and fall over ( or puke ) .
Or so goes the promotion :
The benefits of such a weapon would be that in areas of extreme risk to Marine Corps personnel , hostiles could be controlled without loss of life .
The weapon effect would be helpful in urban combat where rooms could be subjected to the EPIC stimulus and then subdued without further risk to friendlies or hostiles .
Similar technology could be applied to law enforcement operations especially in hostage situations where all the people in a room could be incapacitated without damage and subsequently sorted out as to which are the bad guys and which are the good guys .
Invocon claims they have already held the " first known demonstration " of this technology .
You gotta wonder who that lucky employee was .
[ For those of you interested in learning more about the very weird effects of radio - frequency weapons , check out David Hambling 's excellent – and often terrifying – writing on the subject ]
\– Sharon Weinberger
UPDATE : A funny take from our pals at Boing Boing .
UPDATE 2 : Even more weapons " intended to make you puke , pee , or otherwise lose control of bodily functions . "
UPDATE 3 : The gang at Blackfive has been coming up with names for the vomit beam .
The best so far :
Reporting on Iraqi benchmarks in mid-September , Bush and his team of Gen. Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker sought to pin some of the blame on Iran .
Eschewing diplomatic language during his testimony , Crocker boldly said , " Iran plays a harmful role in Iraq . "
Gen. David Petraeus added that Iran is fighting a " proxy war " in Iraq by aiding Shi’ite extremists and providing weapons that are killing American troops .
Anyone doubting that Bush is not serious about taking on Tehran should note his words from last month : " We will confront this danger before it is too late . "
On September 17 the Telegraph reported that the Pentagon has already drawn up plans for massive airstrikes against 2,000 targets across Iran .
The great irony is that while these accusations towards Tehran are supported by thin evidence , plenty of evidence does exist that another of Iraq ’s neighbors , U.S. - ally Saudi Arabia , is supporting resistance groups in Iraq , and intends to continue to do so .
A Neighborly Mess : Iraq , Iran and Saudi Arabia
" Saudi Arabia has both the means and the religious responsibility to intervene [ in Iraq ] , " wrote Nawaf Obaid , neoconservative ally and a former security advisor to the Saudi government , in a shockingly frank editorial for the Washington Post last November .
He warned the Bush administration , sinking ever deeper into the quagmire of Iraq : " America must not ignore the counsel of Prince Turki al - Faisal , Saudi Arabia ’s ambassador to the United States .
If it does , one of the first consequences will be massive Saudi intervention to stop Iranian - backed Shi’ite militias from butchering Iraqi Sunnis . "
Obaid ’s warning , in response to talk of a possible U.S. withdrawal from Iraq , noted the current Saudi political stance " I am my brothers ’ keeper " towards fellow Sunni Arabs in Iraq .
Clearly the Saudis do not consider all Iraqis their brothers , particularly the Shi’ites .
The editorial said , " As the economic powerhouse of the Middle East , the birthplace of Islam and the de facto leader of the world ’s Sunni community , constituting 85 percent of all Muslims , Saudi options are to provide Sunni military leaders ( primarily members of the former Iraqi officer corps , who make up the backbone of the insurgency ) with the same types of assistance  funding , arms and logistical support  that Iran has been giving to Shi’ite armed groups for years or to help establish new Sunni brigades to combat the Iranian - backed militias . "
Obaid admitted that Saudi involvement in Iraq carried great risk and " … could spark a regional war but the consequences of inaction are far worse " and that his country " had pressed other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council … Qatar , the United Arab Emirates , Kuwait , Bahrain and Oman  to give financial support to Sunnis in Iraq . "
Arming the Neighborhood
In August , the Bush administration announced new arms packages for Israel and seven Arab nations comprising military equipment worth $ 20 billion to Saudi Arabia , over $ 30 billion in military assistance to Israel , and $ 13 billion to Egypt . "
To some extent , the arms packages are an extension of the same policies that have been in place for years in the Middle East .
For example since 1998 , Saudi Arabia alone has received over $ 15 billion in U.S. weapons .
But these sales have had little impact in the region other than arming everyone to the teeth .
In her article , " The Saudi Arms Deal : Congressional Opposition Grows , " Rachel Stohl points out that " The United States has had little success in the past using arms sales to buy leverage in the region . "
From Washington ’s viewpoint the sale has two objectives : bucking up the Saudi - dominated six - member Gulf Cooperation Council and countering Iran ’s influence .
But the sales will likely cause Iran to respond by boosting its arms caches .
A dangerous side effect of the sales is the addition of more arms into a region where each country has distinct objectives in the region and inside Iraq .
The sales set the stage for Iraq to be the flashpoint for a potential proxy and / or regional war .
But most dangerously for Iraqis and U.S. troops , the sales reward a country that is providing an estimated 45 % of all foreigners fighting U.S. troops and Iraqi government forces .
Destabilizing Iraq : The Saudi Role
A “ clear ” view of Iraq is now visible only through a blood - soaked kaleidoscope of contradictory and conflicting U.S. policies .
While the Bush administration regularly lashes out at Syria and Iran for aiding militias and foreign fighters in Iraq , according to official U.S. military figures reported in the Los Angeles Times on July 15 , about 45 % of all foreign militants targeting U.S. troops and Iraqi civilians and security forces are from Saudi Arabia .
Fighters from the kingdom are believed to have carried out the majority of suicide bombings in Iraq .
Who is to blame for the influx of fighters though ?
Gen. Mansour Turki , a spokesman for the Saudi Interior Ministry , however , blames forces inside of Iraq for the flow of Saudi human bombs into Iraq .
If he is to be believed , " Saudis are actually being misused .
Someone is helping them come to Iraq .
Someone is helping them inside Iraq .
Someone is recruiting them to be suicide bombers .
We have no idea who these people are .
We are n’t getting any formal information from the Iraqi government . "
But Iraqis are quick to point the finger across the border .
Lawmaker Sami Askari , an advisor to Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki , accuses Saudi officials of following a deliberate policy of sowing chaos in Baghdad : " The fact is that Saudi Arabia has strong intelligence resources , and it would be hard to think that they are not aware of what is going on . "
Askari claims that imams at Saudi mosques regularly call for jihad against Iraq ’s Shi’ites and that the Saudi government had funded groups to cause chaos and bloodshed in Iraq ’s predominantly Shi’ite south .
But in large part this continues to be conveniently overlooked by the Bush administration so that massive arms packages can be sold to Saudi Arabia , access to the vast oil reserves continues unabated , and the Saudi royal family ’s long - standing connections to the Bush family remain unmentioned in mainstream circles .
There are the odd rare days , however , when the boat does get rocked .
Just days before the $ 20 billion arms package was handed to the Saudi monarchy , Bush administration officials voiced their anger at the " counterproductive " role of Saudi Arabia in Iraq .
They accused Saudi Arabia of regarding Maliki as an Iranian agent and actively working to undermine his government and for offering financial backing to various Sunni groups inside Iraq .
Zalmay Khalilzad , former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq and presently the U.S. ambassador to the UN , wrote in the New York Times recently , " Several of Iraq ’s neighbors , not only Syria and Iran but also some friends of the United States , are pursuing destabilizing policies there . "
But this is the exception rather than the rule .
The cozy relationship between Washington and Riyadh continues , largely unscathed .
And Destabilizing They Are …
" Mosul is where the Saudis are the most active today because it is already primarily Sunni and there are a few Kurds , " says Sureya Sayadi , a 46 - year - old Kurdish - American woman who lives in the Bay Area of California .
Sayadi , from Kirkuk , Iraq fled to the United States with her family when the U.S. left Kurds in the lurch after encouraging them to rebel against Saddam Hussein in the aftermath of the 1991 war against Iraq .
A teacher and a medical doctor , Sayadi fills the rest of her time facilitating the work of an international NGO that assists Kurdish orphans and victims of honor killings .
She is busier than ever as the number of both has escalated dramatically in Kurdish - controlled northern Iraq .
She believes Bush administration policies " have empowered Islamist political parties whose clerics promote honor killings " and have " destroyed Iraq ’s judicial system and altered its laws to justify the killings . "
She adds , " One of our Kurdish employees has heard from the community that the Saudis are taking over parts of Kurdistan by promising people education . "
In recent conversations with her NGO colleagues , Sayadi has found that within the last two years , the Saudi government has financed the construction of at least 50 mosques in Erbil and Suleimaniya alone .
They are also very active on the Turkish / Iraq border and in Kirkuk and Halabja .
She explains , " They go to areas where there is the most poverty and suffering , stepping in to offer services that people are not getting from the government  health care , education , and sometimes employment  and in the process implant[ing ] their fundamentalist ideology . "
Sayadi believes the Saudi monarchy is directly involved in funding " at least four new Islamic groups in Kurdistan .
They are exploiting the fact that Kurds are mostly Sunni . "
During the summer of 2005 , members of al - Qaeda and Ansar al - Sunna cells were among several extremists arrested in Erbil , and most of them were Kurds .
Prior to this , Saudi mosque - building in the area during the 1990 ’s combined with the return of Kurdish militants who had fought against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan is believed to have led to the emergence of groups like Ansar al - Sunna .
The general perception was that these men aspired to radicalize the general population by replicating the Afghan model in Kurdistan .
Reinforcing this trend around that time , Saudi Arabia established links with these Kurds to counter the power of Saddam Hussein .
In 1992 - 93 Islamist Kurdish groups worked under the Saudi based International Islamic Relief Organization and other " charities , " which pumped $ 22 million a month into Kurdish areas .
Today the Saudi names have been replaced with Kurdish names .
In the decade following the 1991 war , when Saudi " charities " constructed 1,832 new mosques , alarmed Kurdish officials instituted restrictions .
Wahabi teachings followed in Saudi had been translated into Kurdish and imported into the region , accompanied by the Salafi strain , a puritanical , strict interpretation of the Koran adhered to by al - Qaeda .
In 2003 , U.S. air - strikes had targeted bases of Ansar al - Islam on Iraq ’s northeastern border with Iran .
These same radical groups , thanks in large part to Saudi backing , are now alive and flourishing in Kurdish controlled northern Iraq .
" Islamists , from Saudi Arabia , are offering money to young Kurds , visiting their schools , marrying Kurdish girls and taking them back to the kingdom . "
Sayadi tells me , " Kurds have always been quite secular , none of us practiced the hijab but now Kurdish women are being forced to do this .
There is segregation of men and women .
People in sheer desperation and hope for aid are turning more fundamentalist .
The environment is ripe for fundamentalism , and Saudi influence is increasing rapidly .
They are creating a hope - filled impression amongst the people that Islamic assertion is the way to resist the West .
Kurdish girls assisted by Sayadi ’s NGO have revealed that Saudi Islamists are pressuring Kurdish women to adopt a fundamentalist ideology in exchange for free religious studies in Kurdish universities .
From her experience with Kurdish refugees in southeastern
Turkey she sees that , " In both Iraq and Turkey Islamists are operating in a similar fashion , leaving no stones unturned to convert people to fundamental Islam .
They are buying poor Kurds desperate for survival and feeding them ideology . "
Sayadi ’s 35 - year - old unemployed nephew Mushtaq , with a Kurdish mother and a Shi’ite Arab father , used to drive a taxi between Beji and Baghdad .
" A man with a Saudi dialect called his mother , my step - sister Gailas , and ordered her to raise $ 2,500 to free Mushtaq .
They called from his cell phone and had him appeal to his mother to give them the money .
She raised the money and brought it to a suburb in Baghdad where they had instructed her to go only to find her son ’s burned taxi and his hacked body wrapped in his prayer rug .
The men said they did it because he was Shi’ite . "
Another disturbing incident in northern Iraq this April was the stoning to death of a 17 - year - old Yazidi girl , Du’a Khalil Aswad , by men from the Saudi - funded mosques .
Amnesty International condemned the killing , calling it " a so - called honor crime " in which the girl " was killed by a group of eight or nine men and in the presence of a large crowd in the town of Bashika , near Mosul because she had engaged in a relationship with a Sunni Muslim boy and had been absent from her home for one night . "
Solutions ?
The Middle East is floating in the violence and chaos bred by failed Bush administration policies .
Generations are now being raised in occupations and / or war zones , which were caused and / or supported by Washington .
Needless to say , anti-American sentiment in the region is quite likely higher than it has ever been in history .
The primary sword in the belly of the Middle East  that of the U.S. occupation of Iraq  must be immediately and unconditionally removed .
The United States must simultaneously pay full compensation to every Iraqi who has lost a loved one or suffered damages as a result of the U.S. - led invasion and occupation .
Second to this , the massive weapons packages should be immediately canceled ; there is no need to attempt to douse the raging fires in the Middle East with yet more sophisticated weaponry .
In addition , if Iran is to be sanctioned , is it not inherently hypocritical not to be sanctioning Saudi Arabia in the same way , since there is more than ample evidence indicating that fighters , funding , and most likely weapons , are pouring across its borders into Iraq ?
The solution must , finally , include diplomacy and even - handed dealings amongst all of the countries in the Middle East , as opposed to the current model where countries like Israel and Saudi Arabia effectively have carte blanche to do what they may .
Otherwise it is sure to fail .

We published Liz Cheney 's piece based on her qualifications as a former high - ranking State Dept. official with oversight of Near Eastern Affairs .
I do n't believe qualified professional women need to be identified by their husbands or fathers , even when well - known .
When we publish a letter to the editor , we formally ask writers whether they have any conflict of interest that should be disclosed .
By that we mean any relationship -- financial , family , employment or otherwise -- that a reasonable reader might consider relevant .
We try to ascertain the same from op - ed writers , though the question has not been part of our official acceptance process .
From now on it will be .
In response to an earlier post , reader Bryce pointed out in comments that thefailed to identify Liz Cheney as the daughter of the vice president in her op - ed .
After agreeing that her bylines were unsatisfactory , went on a Google search to see if the WaPo even took it upon themselves to report on what exactly Liz Cheney has done in her capacity at the State Department .
I have n't found much at all .
While I 've been on my quest , I see that Greg Sargent has taken an interest in this topic as well .
He got Fred Hiatt to answer for the lack of full disclosure on her relationship to her father : Pathetic .
But what about the news division ?
If Liz Cheney is so qualified , why are n't there more reports about what she 's been up to ?
As I 've noted before , the Iran Syria Operations Group 's existence was denied by the White House initially .
Liz Cheney has had a budget of $ 80 million dollars to spend on influencing politics ( one way or another ) in Iran .
What has her group been up to ?
Should n't the WaPo be reporting on that ?
Is n't it incumbent upon a newspaper that gives prime real estate to an individual based solely on her " qualifications " and not relationship to a certain world leader to actually report once in a while what exactly she has been doing ?
Can anybody out there find some examples of the ( or anyone else for that matter ) reporting on what exactly Liz Cheney was up to while working at State ? : I 'd add ...
What qualifications can anybody working in the Cheney operations claim to have with regards to Syria ?
Is there even a policy other than do nothing and hope for something to trigger a war ? :
As far as Hiatt 's response goes ... what is he talking about ?
It 's got nothing to do with respect for a professional woman .
She did n't work her way up in the world of advertising or construction or something , writing about something unrelated to her father and his work .
She got a choice position in her father 's administration .
She no longer works in that administration , but she 's writing an attack on her father 's primary political opposition and the only other thing she 's written in thewas a similar attack mirroring her father 's arguments .
All that on top of the point of this post ...
If she 's so qualified to attack the Speaker of the House , what has theever written about her excellent deeds ? : Leaching off Sargent 's blog ...
One of his commenters found this Hiatt column , dated Jan. 29 , 2005 : Ouch .
But , again , what has theever written about Liz Cheney 's work involving Syria ?
What has she done that makes her a credible critic of Nancy Pelosi ?
And more important ,

It 's Possible in Shell 's Unique Student Competition Shell Eco-Marathon Americas inspires top young engineers from 24 schools in the U.S. and Canada in a challenge to take place April 13 - 14 at the California Speedway in Fontana , California .
The goal of the event is to build a vehicle which will achieve the farthest distance using the least amount of fuel .
After more than 20 successful years in Europe and the United Kingdom , the world - renowned Shell Eco-marathon is coming to the United States .
The Shell Eco-marathon Americas will showcase a lineup of futuristic , eco-friendly vehicles competing to travel the farthest distance on the least amount of fuel .
The student project , which invites student teams from across the Americas to design and build the most energy - efficient vehicle , concludes this weekend , April 13 - 14 , 2007 , with a two - day mileage challenge at the California Speedway in Fontana , California .
Last year , a student team from Europe achieved the equivalent of 6,792 miles to the gallon .
" As a leading provider of fuels today , we believe it 's important to encourage education and awareness about sustainable mobility , " said David Sexton , president of Shell Oil Products U.S.
" We 've made it a priority to support today 's top young scientists and technicians as they develop creative ideas that could help solve real energy problems and influence the transportation of tomorrow . "
Teams are comprised of about eight student engineers working together to build prototype vehicles with three or four wheels using conventional fuels or alternative fuels or energy sources such as liquid petroleum gas , biofuels , compressed natural gas , hydrogen or solar .
A grand prize of $ 10,000 , worldwide bragging rights , and the chance to make history will be awarded to the educational institution or university whose student - driven vehicle travels the farthest distance using the least amount of fuel .
There are also first , second and third prizes awarded in three vehicle categories .
Thirty teams from across the U.S. and Canada are are vying for the title of the most fuel - efficient vehicle in North America .
Throughout the entire process , the Shell Eco-marathon offers students - who are interested in the world of technology , energy and transport - a unique opportunity to work hands - on to identify possible solutions for meeting future energy needs .
" Shell has one of the broadest fuel portfolios , and vast experience in developing innovative and new fuels to meet society needs , " added Sexton .
" Educating our young people about sustainable mobility is critical to achieving energy security for the future .
Shell is proud to provide students with an educational platform to explore and experiment with technology and fuels , and to develop creative and inventive mobility solutions through the Shell Eco- marathon project . "
From vehicle design to financing , student participants gain hands - on experience managing their project and applying skills in science , technology , mathematics , business and design .
Along the way , they demonstrate hard work , creativity and ingenuity , while addressing one of the most pressing issues in today 's society : sustainable mobility .
Currently , the 2007 European Shell Eco-marathon is set to be the biggest ever , with more than 250 teams from educational institutions in 20 different countries .
The key challenge for each team is not only to create the most fuel - efficient vehicle , but also to beat the European Shell Eco- marathon fuel - efficiency records .
For combustion engine entries , the record was set in 2004 by the team from Lycee La Joliverie , France , who reached 3,410 kilometers ( 2,118 miles ) on just one liter of fuel .
For proto - type vehicles using fuel cells , the record is even more impressive with a hydrogen - powered vehicle built by Swiss team ETH Zurich in 2005 achieving a projected 3,836 kilometers ( 2,383 miles ) on the equivalent of a single liter of fuel .
The 2007 European Shell Eco-marathon event will be held at the Nogaro Racing Circuit in the South of France on May 11 - 13 , 2007 .
The Shell Eco-marathon is just one example of the initiatives Shell is pursuing in the area of innovation and technology related to sustainable mobility .
Shell has invested more than $ 1 billion in alternative energies over the past five years , making it one of the world 's leading companies in the sector .
In addition to the thousands of scientists that Shell employs around the world , Shell has appointed a Chief Technology Officer , seven Chief Scientists and established a high - level forum to ensure that Shell continues to innovate at the forefront of the industry .
Shell is also proud to be working in partnership with vehicle manufacturers , governments , academic institutions and non-governmental organizations to develop innovative ideas and attainable solutions to meet the growing demands of energy for transportation .

In my post “ Multicellular Logic Circuits , Part I : Evolution , ” I discussed evolution and genetic algorithms ; I want to continue that discussion here .
There are two salient facts of biology that are completely inescapable .
The first is that all organisms are shaped by the process of evolution .
The second is that all organisms are constructed from cells .
Furthermore , all complex multicellular organisms begin life as a single cell , and undergo a process of development through cell division to mature into an adult .
And no matter how different any two organisms may be on the gross macroscopic level that we are used to , inside their cells the chemical processes of life are fundamentally very similar .
Thus it is no accident that the titles of the two leading textbooks in molecular biology are The Molecular Biology of the Gene by Watson , et. al. and The Molecular Biology of the Cell by Alberts et. al .
[ These are both great books .
This link to the first chapter of MBOC is an excellent entry point into modern biology .
And if you are serious about learning biology , I also strongly recommend the companion Molecular Biology of the Cell : A Problems Approach , by Wilson and Hunt , which will force you to think more actively about the material . ]
It therefore seems reasonable that if we want to construct artificial systems that achieve the performance of natural ones , we should consider artificially evolving a system constructed from cells .
Although there are typically many different cell types in a mature multi-cellular organism , all the different cells of the organism , with the exception of sperm and egg cells , share an identical genetic specification in their DNA .
The different behavior of cells with identical genetic specifications is the result of the cells having different histories and being subjected to different environments .
More specifically , the behavior of a biological cell is controlled by complex genetic regulatory mechanisms that determine which genes are transcribed into messenger RNA and then translated into proteins .
One very important regulatory mechanism is provided by the proteins called “ transcription factors ” that bind to DNA regulatory regions upstream of the protein coding regions of genes , and participate in the promotion or inhibition of the transcription of DNA into RNA .
The different histories of two cells might lead to one having a large concentration of a particular transcription factor , and the other having a low concentration , and thus the two cells would express different genes , even though they had identical DNA .
Another important mechanism that controls the differential development of different types of cells in a multi-cellular organism is the biochemical signaling sent between cells .
Signals such as hormones have the effect of directing a cell down a particular developmental pathway .
In general , the transcription factors , hormones , and multitude of other control mechanisms used in biological cells are organized into a network which can be represented as a “ circuit ” where the state of the system is characterized by the concentrations of the different biochemical ingredients .
In fact , biologists are now using wiring diagrams to help summarize biological circuits ; see for example , the “ Biotapestry editor ” developed by Eric Davidson ’s lab at Caltech .
[ I strongly recommend Davidson ’s recent book The Regulatory Genome : Gene Regulatory Networks in Development and Evolution for an exciting introduction to the burgeoning “ evo - devo ” field ; if you do n’t have any background in biology , you may prefer The Coiled Spring , by Ethan Bier for a somewhat more popular account . ]
Turning to the problem of designing artifical systems , a natural question is what theoretical advantages exist , from the point of view of designing with evolution , to using an identical genetic specification for all the cells in a multi-cellular organism .
One potential advantage is that relatively small changes to the genetic specification of the organism can concurrently alter the behavior of many different kinds of cells at many different times during the development of the organism .
Therefore , if there is the possibility of an advantageous change to the circuitry controlling a cell , then it can be found once and used many times instead of needing to find the same advantageous mutation repeatedly for each of the cells in the organism .
Another related potential advantage is that a highly complicated organism can be specified in a relatively compact way .
If each of the trillions of cells in a complex organism like a human had to be separately specified , then the overall amount of information required to describe the human genome would be multiplied more than a trillion - fold .
Clearly , it is much more efficient to re-use the identical circuitry in many different types of cells .
In other words , biology uses a strategy of specifying a complex multi-cellular organism by just specifying a single cell–all the other cells in the mature organism are grown organically out of the developmental process .
This seems like a strategy worth imitating .
On the other hand , the constraint that each cell in an organism should share an identical genetic specification clearly causes complications from the point of view of design .
For example , it is important that genes that are designed to function in one type of cell at one point in development not cause problems for different type of cell at a different point in development .
Clearly , good design of the control logic that turns genes on and off is essential to the proper functioning of a multi-cellular organism .
In the next post in this series , I will turn to the construction of a concrete model for multi-cellular circuits that tries to capture , as simply as possible , the essence of what is happening in biology .

How to breathe deeply when you 're nervous .
This morning I went to a studio and recorded some writing for eventual radio broadcast .
During my readings , I could not get my breath .
I sucked in as much air as I could between takes , took off my sweater , wiped my brow , pushed away the chair and knelt on the floor , took a break , and sipped water — but no matter what I tried , I would find myself gasping by the end of every second sentence .
Because of this , I could n't get back to the calm , measured reading I 'd rehearsed .
The producer was understanding , and I was able to go over many parts of the piece several times , and everything ended up okay .
But it was n't my best work , and I never want that to happen again .
My girlfriend is an opera singer and performance studies expert who has spent years working on breathing , so I asked her what to do next time .
“ [ Breathlessness ] is very normal and brought on by nerves , ” she said .
“ And there 's a simple exercise that fixes it . ”
For you , and for all those who might search Google for “ running out of breath , ” “ breathing control , ” and “ reading for the radio , ” I offer her opera - tested 4 - step routine :
1. Exhale completely , as if you 're blowing out the candles on a very big birthday cake .
. . . . .
2. Bend over .
This expels the last bits of air from your lungs .
When you 're totally out of air , do n't let any air come into your throat .
. . . . .
3. Stand up .
This increases lung volume , so air will want to flow into your lungs , but do n't breathe .
Wait until your body needs a breath — 10 seconds or so .
. . . . .
4 . Then , when you can't take much more , breathe .
Your body will have moved over from your normal , everyday breathing to unregulated , autonomic “ response breathing . ”
. . . . .
That 's it .
Once you let your body take that unregulated breath in step 4 , it sort of “ reboots your lungs , ” and the nervous , “ holding - pattern ” breathing becomes a thing of memory .
Phew .
Back in 2004 , federal health officials figured that an advertising campaign could help increase rates of breast - feeding in the United States .
Breast milk , as doctors universally recognize and the FDA makes very clear , is healthier than formula .
It 's full of ingredients developed by a few million years of evolution to do a baby 's body good .
Breast - fed kids are less likely to get sick as they grow up , the milk is always sterile , and there 's probably a psychological benefit , too .
But the baby formula industry – a subdivision of the high - powered pharmaceutical industry – did n't like this , reports the Washington Post , so they put pressure on the Department of Health and Human Services to tone down the ads .
The industry roped in ex-Republican National Committee chairman Clayton
Yeutter and ex-FDA official Joseph Levitt to meet with HHS officials .
They told then - surgeon general Richard Carmona to stay out of the process , which he did .
In a Feb. 17 , 2004 , letter to [ then - HHS secretary Tommy Thompson ] ,
Yeutter began " Dear Tommy " and explained that the council wished to meet with him because the draft ad campaign was inappropriately
" implying that mothers who use infant formula are placing their babies at risk , " and could give rise to class - action lawsuits .
Yeutter acknowledged that the ad agency " may well be correct " in asserting that a softer approach would garner less attention , but he said many women cannot breast - feed or choose not to for legitimate reasons , which may give them " guilty feelings . "
He asked , " Does the
U.S. government really want to engage in an ad campaign that will magnify that guilt ? "
Rather than starkly laying out the risks of not breast feeding – as focus group testing showed would be most effective – the resulting ads instead made awkward visual references ( dandelions ! ice cream scoops ! )
to breasts and soft - peddle the benefits of breast - feeding .
As predicted by the Ad Council , this had no impact on breast feeding rates .
And if this was n't bad enough , an Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality study released two months later April found that breast - feeding
... was associated with fewer ear and gastrointestinal infections , as well as lower rates of diabetes , leukemia , obesity , asthma and sudden infant death syndrome . [...]
A top HHS official said that at the time , Suzanne Haynes , an epidemiologist and senior science adviser for the department 's Office on Women 's Health , argued strongly in favor of promoting the new conclusions in the media and among medical professionals .
But her office , which commissioned the report , was specifically instructed by political appointees not to disseminate a news release .
At this point I ought to make some sort of editorial comment .
But really , what the hell else is there to say ?

BBC News , Afghanistan
Thousands have been returned from Iran since April
The queues of refugees start to pour over the border from first thing in the morning - as they have been doing for the last month .
Ninety thousand people have so far been forcibly returned to Afghanistan from Iran since 21 April , according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees .
Every hour or so another bus arrives on the Iranian side , the people are unloaded , carrying the few possessions they had when they were arrested .
A policeman meets them on the Afghanistan side , and they join a long line of people waiting to pick up the few pieces of charity an aid agency has gathered for them .
They get water , biscuits and a bundle of clothes .
They can also make a free phone call to relatives to let them know where they are .
Then they get a free 120 km ( 75 mile ) bus trip from the border post to the city of Herat where they are left to start all over again in a country where they used to live .
' Cruelty '
In the gathered crowd waiting to tell their stories I see a young man , a tear rolling down his cheek .
Iran has never deported so many people in such a short space of time " My wife and children are left there , even though I asked the authorities to let us go together , " he said , a reference number scrawled on his hand in thick black ink .
" I did n't even have time to get my wages from my employer .
Now that they deported me who will look after my children ?
If someone throws them on the street who will give them shelter ?
This is cruelty . "
Among the lines of men was a 12 - year - old boy who said he had been deported on his own .
And passions are high .
An older man , emphasising his point by striking his fist into his hand , says he has lived in Iran for 28 years and now he is back in Afghanistan , he cannot even afford the bus fare to Kabul , and doubts there is any work there anyway .
" We are Muslims and they are Muslims as well , so why have they done this to us ?
We do n't have any one to look after us . "
Human rights Iran received millions of refugees during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the later civil war .
It has been deporting refugees for some time , but never on this scale - never so many in such a short space of time .
Josep Zapater is from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , which under its remit can do little to help most of the returnees - only the vulnerable such as the old , the young and families .
While many of the single men were living in Iran illegally , almost 22,000 of those deported have been families .
" This was n't happening last year , " Mr Zapater explained .
" Also there are the human rights concerns that we have seen at the border like separated families , some cases of maltreatment .
" The process definitely needs to be sorted out in a more humane manner . "
An Afghan delegation visited Iran earlier this month and they returned saying the Iranian government had promised to suspend forced expulsions , but as they delivered their report hundreds more refugees continued to be deported .
Development
And the Iranian director general of the Bureau for Aliens and Foreign Immigrant Affairs , Ahmad Hosseini , defended their decision .
Iran is doing a great deal to help development in Herat " We are determined once and for all to resolve the problem of illegal immigrants in Iran and this does n't mean only Afghans but any other nationalities who have illegal immigrants here , " he said .
" The money we were supposed to spend on reconstruction for our own country has been spent on refugees .
Today when we count the cost , it is $ 7bn a year , or $ 6 per Afghan every day . "
In Herat the arrival of tens of thousands of unemployed men is starting to have a real impact on the city and the whole region .
Each morning they queue up for daily work , but there is little around .
" I had my passport but they just tore it up " one man said .
" What kind of law is that ? "
Iran is doing a great deal to help development in Afghanistan , particularly in Herat , but there are complaints so many desperate people arriving in a short time maybe undoing efforts to stabilise and assist the people .

What are these ?
Are we headed towards a world dominated by amateurish art , truthiness , photos of cute animals , and video clips of people being hit in the nuts ?
That ’s the fear expressed in The Cult of the Amateur : How today ’s Internet is killing our culture ( review ) , a new book by Andrew Keen .
The book examines what Keen sees as the dark side of information democratization .
The book grew out of this essay published last year by The Weekly Standard .
In that piece , he argues personalization is just another word for narcissism .
The consequences of Web 2.0 are inherently dangerous for the vitality of culture and the arts .
Its empowering promises play upon that legacy of the ‘ 60s — the creeping narcissism that Christopher Lasch described so presciently , with its obsessive focus on the realization of the self .
Another word for narcissism is “ personalization . ”
Web 2.0 technology personalizes culture so that it reflects ourselves rather than the world around us .
Blogs personalize media content so that all we read are our own thoughts .
Online stores personalize our preferences , thus feeding back to us our own taste .
Google personalizes searches so that all we see are advertisements for products and services we already use .
Instead of Mozart , Van Gogh , or Hitchcock , all we get with the Web 2.0 revolution is more of ourselves .
He says not writing may be the new rebellion …
Orwell ’s fear was the disappearance of the individual right to self - expression .
Thus Winston Smith ’s great act of rebellion in Nineteen Eight - Four was his decision to pick up a rusty pen and express his own thoughts …
In the Web 2.0 world , however , the nightmare is not the scarcity , but the over - abundance of authors .
Since everyone will use digital media to express themselves , the only decisive act will be to not mark the paper .
Not writing as rebellion sounds bizarre — like a piece of fiction authored by Franz Kafka .
But one of the unintended consequences of the Web 2.0 future may well be that everyone is an author , while there is no longer any audience .
Keen ’s got a point in some areas but it all seems rather elitist .
One man ’s “ mob rule ” is another ’s democracy .
If individuals ca n’t decide for themselves what to like , who should do it ?
Is he proposing we all obey a Committee of Good Taste or something ?
Besides , culture was suffering before the internet too .
As far as I ’m concerned , the death of the crappy sitcom , bad Hollywoood movie , overproduced major label schlock , etc. is just fine .
And viva enthusiastic amateurs creating amazing stuff like this handmade Modest Mouse video .
That said , one area where I share his concerns : newspapers .
Newspapers employ the people who actually cultivate leads and grind out stories .
TV news blows and hardly any bloggers do any real reporting ( commenting on the news is a lot different than discovering it ) .
We all suffer when reporting disappears .
And right now the future of the newspaper business ai n’t looking too rosy .

Consumer advocate Ralph Nader , who mounted failed bids for the White House in 2000 and 2004 , excoriated the Bush administration for its post - 9/11 policies that critics say trample on civil liberties and for its pursuit of war in Iraq , which he said distracts from fighting Osama bin Laden .
The onetime Green Party candidate appeared at an anti-war rally in Washington Saturday , where he chastised “ spineless , gutless ” Democrats in Congress for failing to boot Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney from office .
“ The impeachable offenses of Bush outnumber any other list of impeachable offenses of any US president , ” Nader said .
“ Not only did he and Cheney violate their oath of office to uphold the constitution and the laws of the land , but they proceeded to impose a practice of torture , to arrest thousands of Americans without charges and throw them in prisons without lawyers … .
They spied on millions of Americans randomly without judicial approval .
How many more impeachable offenses do those spineless , gutless , hapless Democrats need in the Congress . ”

ナポレオンのロシア遠征が失敗したのは冬将軍のせいだ、と誰もが思っているだろう。だがそれは、どんな死も心臓の疾患のせいにしてしまうのと同じで、本当に適切な分析とは言えない。確かに冬将軍はナポレオンの野望を砕く最後の一撃にはなったかもしれないが、決定的な要因ではなかった。遠征失敗の真の原因は、遠征軍の規模の問題とナポレオン自身の管理能力の欠如にあったのだ。ナポレオンの失敗は、大規模プロジェクトを計画するにあたって陥りがちな過ちを知る事例であり、現代の企業社会にとっての教訓でもある。
大きな組織が常に良い結果を生むとは限らない
1812年、ナポレオンはロシア遠征のために70万の兵士を集めた。当時としては史上空前の大軍勢だったはずだ。いくつかの精鋭部隊も含まれてはいたが、全体としては決して優秀な遠征軍ではなかった。その理由の1つは、兵士たちの話す言語があまりにも多岐にわたっていて情報伝達が十分に行えなかったことだ。しかも、遠征軍の大部分は、古くから敵対関係にあったか、最近互いに戦った兵士たちで占められていた。そのため、遠征軍は全体としてのまとまりを欠いていた。
また、その規模の大きさゆえに、食糧の調達は困難を極めた。それほどの大軍勢に十分な食糧を供給できる地域は遠征先のどこにもなかったため、ナポレオン麾下のフランス軍部隊が通過した後では食糧を調達することも叶わなかった。それでも進軍の速度を落とすわけにはいかないので、補給部隊の荷馬車が追いつかず、兵士たちを飢餓で苦めることもしばしばあった。
適切な資源と準備を整えたか自問する
世間一般の認識とは裏腹に、ナポレオンのロシア遠征はまったく盲目的に行われたわけではない。彼は数々の地図を揃え、食糧、資源、軍馬の確保には相当な労力を割いていたのだ。そうした本能的な勘は働いたものの、現地でどんなことが起こりそうかについての直接的な情報が彼の手元にはなかった。
地図の上では、進軍に使うべき道路が自ずと明らかになっていた。だが、ロシアにおけるそうした道路の多くの状況がナポレオンにはわかっていなかった。大軍が迅速に移動するにはあまりに狭く、砲兵隊や補給部隊が通るにはぬかるみ過ぎていたのだ。また、ロシアのようなやせた土地では採取や狩猟による食糧調達が不可能に近いことも彼は知らずにいた。
また、せっかく先を見越して物資を集めても、状況に合った適切な物資でなければ意味がない。ナポレオンが集めた無数の小口径砲は、進軍の邪魔になったばかりか、スモレンスクのような城砦都市への包囲攻撃や、ボロディノの戦いのような大規模な砲撃戦では役に立たなかった。さらに、ナポレオンは雪道での行軍に適した先の尖った蹄鉄や防寒具の準備も考えていなかった。
しかし、仮に適切な物資が集まっていたとしても、その苦労の大半は水泡に帰すことになっただろう。というのも、必要なところに物資を供給するという計画の一切を、ナポレオンは頑なに拒否していたからだ。物資の輸送に関する彼の工夫が実を結んだものの1つに、自らの個人用郵便サービスがあった。これにより、彼はパリからモスクワへの手紙を2週間で受け取ることができたが、作戦上はあまり意味のない贅沢だった。
目標と注力対象を定める
あらゆる準備をして大規模な軍勢を集めたにもかかわらず、ナポレオンがその生涯において自身の狙いを明確に定めなかったのは、このロシア遠征のときだけだった。彼はモスクワとサンクトペテルブルクを手に入れたかったのだろうか。それとも、ロシア領土を分割してスウェーデン、トルコ、そして再興したポーランドに分け与えようとしたのだろうか。あるいは、ロシア皇帝アレクサンドル1世に休戦協定を結ばせ、大英帝国からインドを奪おうとしたのだろうか。ロシア遠征の最初の数か月間で、ナポレオンの頭の中ではこれらの目標すべての検討が行われた。心を決めかねていた彼は、いつもの断固たる決意で行動することができず、初期の勝利を活かせないまま主導権を失ってしまった。
こうした迷いはロシア遠征に終始つきまとった。ナポレオンは、退却を始める直前まで（数時間前とは言わないまでも数日前までは）モスクワを去るかそこで越冬するかの決断を渋っていたし、モスクワから撤退するときでさえ、最初はあたかもロシアの主力軍との決戦を考えているかのように南方へ移動してから急遽西に針路を変え、長く辛い帰還への一歩を踏み出したのだった。何がしたいのかをはっきりさせなかったばかりに、大きな成果を1つも挙げられず、成し遂げたことにしても効率良くは遂行できなかったのだが、これは当然の結果と言えるだろう。
部下との距離を縮め る
ナポレオンが発揮した統率力は、配下にある部隊との信頼関係に支えられていた。部隊のなかを歩き回ることで、彼は常に兵士たちの士気と戦闘力を肌で感じ、どんなときに懸念の素振りを見せたり処罰を行ったりすれば部隊を鼓舞できるかを知ることができたのだ。彼が姿を見せるだけで部隊の士気が高まることも、しばしばあった。
しかし、ロシア戦役においてこうした陣頭指揮の方法をとることは、ほとんど不可能だった。ナポレオン自身がひどく体調を崩していたせいもあった。また、たとえ体調に問題がなくても、兵の数の多さとその展開規模の広さから、彼が直接的に接触できた部隊は全体のごく一部に過ぎなかった。多くの場合、視察を受けたのは皇帝親衛隊だけだった。この部隊は、ナポレオンの近辺にいたことから忠誠心と士気が最も高く、食糧や備品の供給という面でも一番優遇された。こうした親衛隊の様子から全体の状況を判断していたために、遠征軍の残りの部隊では着実に嫌悪感が増して兵士の脱走が相次いでいたというのに、彼はすべてが順調だと思い込んでいたのだ。
保身のために事実を隠す部下の報告を信用してはならない ― またそうした状況に部下を追い込んでもいけない
遠征初期の頃、ナポレオンは、将軍や元帥たちに各自の部隊について正確に報告するように求めていた。ところが、物資の欠乏や脱走兵の問題について報告を受けると、ナポレオンは彼らに侮蔑の言葉を投げかけることが多く、人々の前で罵倒することもあった。ときには、そういった痛烈な非難に加え、降格や困難な任務への配置転換が言い渡されることさえあった。
こうした状況を目の当たりにした司令官たちは、自分の立場を守りたいなら決してナポレオンに真実を伝えるべきではない、と悟った。遠征当初から、彼らは自らの指揮する部隊の兵力と士気を過大に報告するようになった。こうした誇張された報告によって、適切な計画の立案は妨げられ、ナポレオンはロシア領内奥深くに進軍するまで遠征の難しさを過少評価し続けることになった。
対外発信や積極的思考よりも本質の見極めを重視する
ナポレオンは生涯を通じて自らの運命を信じ、自らの可能性を疑うことなく、困難な時期を乗り越えて偉大なる未来へと邁進していった。こうした信念は彼にとって人生の多くの場面で良い方向に作用したが、それはおそらく、その信念から生じる虚勢が周囲の敵をたじろがせたからだろう。
しかし、地理、天候、広大な土地が敵の軍勢に匹敵するほど大きな障壁として立ちはだかるロシアの状況は、前向きな態度だけでは克服できないほど厳しいものだった。ナポレオンは自らの意志を貫くことを主張するために最善を尽くし、万事が順調またはそうなる見込みだと思わせる声明を繰り返し出した。しかし、いよいよ鮮明に浮かび上がってきた真実に目を向け、それらが否定しようのないものであることを知るについれ、彼がそうした態度を維持することはますます困難になっていった。それでも彼は長い間、強い意志があれば困難を克服できる、と固く信じ続けた。しかし残念ながら、彼が実状を認めた頃には、すでに遠征軍は崩壊しつつあり、補給を絶たれた状態で攻撃の危険にさらされていた。この時点で、彼のとるべき道は撤退しかなかった。
専門家や部下の意見に耳を傾ける
ナポレオンの側近のなかには、先に挙げた困難の多くに対処できる知識を持った人々もいた。例えば、以前ロシア大使を務めていたコランクールは、ロシアの道路事情、採集や狩猟ができない土地の貧弱さ、たとえロシア軍が第一線には優秀な指揮官が少なく退却を重ねてばかりいても、彼らによる徹底抗戦の可能性を高めている政治的な情勢について、ナポレオンに警告していた。しかし、ナポレオンは自らに都合の悪いこうした意見を無視し続け、状況はもはや手遅れというところまで悪化した。彼は撤退する段になってようやく、遠征軍よりも先に帰国するようにとのコランクールの助言を聞き入れたのだった。ナポレオンがその助言を受け入れたのは、おそらく自らに都合の良い内容だったからだろう。
予備の計画を用意しておく
撤退の数週間前から、ナポレオンには撤退に至る可能性の高さがわかっていた。でなければ、不毛な敵地で冬を越すしかなかったのだ。にもかかわらず、敗北を認めたくなかった彼は、撤退の準備を一切行おうとしなかった。依然として、ロシアを除くヨーロッパ中で徴集された兵力が、フランスから最も遠い占拠地であるモスクワを目指し、考えられる安全なルートを外れて強行軍を続けていた。また、途中の補給物資の蓄えもまったくなかった。さらに、退路に沿って偵察隊が出されることもなかった。唐突に退却の決断を下したとき、ナポレオンは何の準備もしていなかった。そのことが撤退をさらに悲惨なものにしたことは間違いない。
ときには不要な資源を手放さなければならない
ロシアへの侵攻時、フランス軍は、ロシアの道路事情にそぐわない何百もの軽野戦砲や荷馬車など、無用の装備の数々を運搬してきていた。しかし、ナポレオンはこうした装備の破壊や放棄を認めず、一緒に運ぶように主張した。こうした彼の頭の固さは侵攻を遅らせただけだった。
撤退時はさらにひどいことに、遠征軍は可能な限りの戦利品をモスクワから運んでいた。ポケット一杯に詰められベルトに吊り下げられた戦利品は、兵士たちの動作を鈍らせたばかりか、それらを積んださまざまな運搬手段の移動も困難にした。やがて退路のあちこちに高価な品物が散乱することになるのだが、戦利品を持ち帰ろうとした判断のせいで何千という兵士が倒れた。そうした財宝を狙うコサックの襲撃から逃れられなかったり、次の前哨基地への到着が遅れて食事にありつけなかったりしたのだ。
何かを失って得られるものもある
ボロディノの戦いのように勝敗の判断が難しいものも多いが、ロシアでナポレオンが戦闘に破れたことは一度もなかった。むしろ、従来の基準に従えば勝利を収めたとも言える。ナポレオンの遠征軍は、かつての都とはいえ最大にして最も重要な都市モスクワ（当時のロシアの首都はサンクトペテルブルク）を占領し、莫大な財産を持ち帰ろうとしたのだ。だが、兵士や軍馬の数は疾病、脱落、飢餓、置き去りによって着実に減り、補給物資も少なくなる一方だった。モスクワでの略奪を終えた後、ナポレオンは撤退に追い込まれた。敵からの執拗な襲撃に悩まされていたが、応戦できるだけの騎兵がいなかったのだ。自軍の中にいながら戦闘を十分に掌握することも用兵を変えることもできなくなった彼は、遠征軍を見捨てて急ぎフランスに帰国した。結局、フランスに戻れた兵士は、元の兵力のわずか3％強にあたる22,000名に過ぎなかった。
まとめ
ナポレオンは聡明な指揮官であり、歴史上最も著名な人物の1人だ。しかし、彼ほどの才能を持つ人でさえこうした過ちを犯し得ることからも明らかなように、失敗は誰にでもある。準備の不足や重点目標の不十分な絞り込み、絶対に自分が正しいという思い込み、客観的な状況判断の拒否、かつて成功した手法でのリーダーシップ発揮の失敗、これらすべてがナポレオンの生涯最大の失敗につながったのだ。
3年後、彼は皇帝を退位して国外追放となるが、最期を迎える前に一度は復位する。しかし、ロシア遠征によってフランスの軍事力はすっかり衰えており、不敗を誇った彼の名声も地に堕ちてしまう。ロシア戦役の後、フランス統治下にあった地域は、増え続ける敵対勢力に立ち向かうために絶えず戦火に見舞われた。最後にベルギーのワーテルローで英国のウェリントン公爵（頭脳の明晰さと実直さで知られている）と対戦して破れたナポレオンは、永遠に皇帝の地位を失うことになる。結局、ナポレオンの終焉の始まりは、ロシア侵攻時に適切な計画を欠いていたことにあったのだ。

As you may know — unless you rely on the corporate media for your news , of course — yesterday the U.S. Senate unanimously declared that Iran was committing acts of war against the United States : a 97- 0 vote to give George W. Bush a clear and unmistakable casus belli for attacking Iran whenever Dick Cheney tells him to .
The bipartisan Senate resolution — the brainchild ( or rather the bilechild ) of Fightin ’ Joe Lieberman — affirmed as official fact all of the specious , unproven , ever - changing allegations of direct Iranian involvement in attacks on the American forces now occupying Iraq .
The Senators appear to have relied heavily on the recent New York Times story by Michael Gordon that stovepiped unchallenged Pentagon spin directly onto the paper ’s front page .
As Firedoglake points out , John McCain cited the heavily criticized story on the Senate floor as he cast his vote .
It goes without saying that all of this is a nightmarish replay of the run-up to the war of aggression against Iraq :
The NYT funneling false flag stories from Bush insiders .
Warmongers citing the NYT stories as " proof " justifying any and all action to " defend the Homeland . "
Credulous and craven Democratic politicians swallowing the Bush line hook and sinker .
To be sure , stout - hearted Dem tribunes like Dick Durbin insisted that their support for declaring that Iran is " committing acts of war " against the United States should not be taken as an " authorization of military action . "
This is shaky - knees mendacity at its finest .
Having officially affirmed that Iran is waging war on American forces , how , pray tell , can you then deny the president when he asks ( if he asks ) for authorization to " defend our troops " ?
Answer : you can ’t .
And you know it .
This vote is the clearest signal yet that there will be no real opposition to a Bush Administration attack on Iran .
This is yet another blank check from these slavish , ignorant goons ; Bush can cash it anytime .
This is , in fact , the post - surge " Plan B " that ’s been mooted lately in the Beltway .
As you recall , there was much throwing about of brains on the subject of reviving the " Iraq Study Group " plan when the " surge " ( or to call it by its right name , the " punitive escalation " ) inevitably fails .
Bush put the kibosh on that this week ( " Him not gonna do nothin ’ that Daddy ’s friends tell him to do !
Him a big boy , him the decider ! " ) , but that does n’t mean there is n’t a fall - back position — or rather , a spring - forward position : an attack on Iran , to rally the nation behind the " war leader " and reshuffle the deck in Iraq .
Of course , the United States is already at war with Iran .
We are directing covert ops and terrorist attacks inside Iran , with the help of groups that our own government has declared terrorist renegades .
We are kidnapping Iranian officials in Iraq and holding them hostage .
We have a bristling naval armada on Iran ’s doorstep , put there for the express purpose of threatening Tehran with military action .
The U.S. Congress has overwhelmingly passed measures calling for the overthrow of the Iranian government .
And now the U.S. Senate has unanimously declared that Iran is waging war on America , and has given official notice that this will not be tolerated .
It is only a very small step to move from this war in all but name to the full monty of an overt military assault .
We ’ve said it before and we ’ll say it again : there is madness at work here .
There is no other word for it .
As I noted a few years ago :
Homo sapiens is the only species that dreams of its own total demise .
Our brief history of conscious thought is replete with vivid scenarios of the end of life on earth … .
Religion has produced most of these — giddy , voluptuous nightmares of universal extinction , usually by fire , at divine order .
A favored remnant is always saved in such tales , of course , but only after being transformed into some different , higher order of being .
The gross human body — that bleeding , fouling , endlessly replicating sack of earth — is gleefully consigned to eternal oblivion .
It seems that some ineradicable nihilism pervades us , like a virus , now dormant , now flaring : something in us that wants to die , to be done with the long , overhanging doom of mortality — and to take the world with us .
Our grandiose visions of the future seem to hide , at their core , a secret , desperate anxiety about the profound meaninglessness of existence — an anxiety that often disguises itself in elaborate fantasies of the afterlife , in dreams of " dominance " for one ’s " own kind " ( nation , tribe , faith , race , ideology , etc. ) , or in the eroticizing of death , war and destruction .
Instincts for preservation , sentiments of affection , the drive for pleasure — from the most basic bodily urges to the most sublime creations and apprehensions of the intellect — act as counterweights to this dark virus , of course .
They provide for most of us , most of the time , enough fragments of meaning — or at least sufficient distraction — to get on with things , without too much resort to world - engulfing visions or the extremes of nihilistic anxiety .
On the individual level , the calibration of these competing impulses can be intricate , subtle , ever - shifting , because the individual mind is so complex and all - encompassing , yet also so enclosed , so unlockably private as well : an infinitely supple tool for managing the conflicts and contradictions of reality .
But on the broader level — species , nation , group — human consciousness is , of necessity , a far more blunt and brutal instrument .
There , our brain - fevers and anxieties rage more virulently , lacking the counterweights of individual feeling and the quick , intimate responsiveness of the private mind .
In the group - mind , the fantasies that root in the muddy fear of meaninglessness can emerge full - blown .
Thought and discourse are reduced to broad strokes , slogans , codes and incantations , with little correspondence to reality .
Awareness of this tendency can mitigate some of its effects ; but the group - mind ’s fundamental falsity and irreality almost invariably infects the thoughts and actions of group leaders — and eventually many of the group members as well .
Thus we can sometimes say , not entirely metaphorically , that nations " go mad , " hurtling themselves toward ruin , embracing self - destruction , lusting for violence and death , sick with nihilism — although this sickness is always painted in the colors of patriotic fervor or religious zeal , or both
Now draw these dangerous streams together , and you have a portrait of the blunt and brutal group - mind at work in the leadership of the world ’s most powerful nation .
The folly , fantasy and death - fetish of the Bush Regime — long evident to anyone who cared to see — were finally " revealed " in the mainstream media recently by the quasi-official Establishment oracle , Bob Woodward .
His latest insider portrait , Plan of Attack , offers — in the usual , easily - gummed pabulum form — a few tastes of the bitter truth behind the Regime ’s mad , ruinous war crime in Iraq .
The corrosive nihilism at the heart of the enterprise ate through the gaudily - painted surface most tellingly in a single anecdote .
Woodward asks George W. Bush how he thinks history will regard his adventure in Iraq .
Bush , gazing out the window , shrugs and waves the question away .
" History , we do n’t know , " he says .
" We ’ll all be dead . "
No fine , faith - filled talk here about God and Jesus and the immortal soul responsible for its actions throughout all eternity — the kind of zealous patter Bush favors in public statements .
This was just the cold , rotten , meaningless core of his grand vision : " We ’ll all be dead . "
So who cares ?
Après moi , le deluge .
Who would have thought the floodwaters of this death vision would have risen so high again so soon ?
Yet here they are again , beating against the gates .
UPDATE : Jonathan Schwarz points out that all of the Senate ’s Democratic candidates for president voted for Lieberman ’s Iran War amendment : Hillary Clinton , Barak Obama , and Joe Biden .
Just in case you were expecting a saner foreign policy after the 2008 election .
UPDATE II : Meanwhile , George Milhouse Bush wants to make one thing perfectly clear : even in the highly unlikely ( if not totally impossible ) event that the Senate grows a rudimentary spine and tries to place the slightest obstacle in the way of a military attack on Iran , the Commander Guy will peremptorily veto it and instigate the mass murder anyway .
Spencer Ackerman at TPM
Cafe found this gem of arrogant defiance in " a little - noticed letter from the White House to Carl Levin ( D - MI ) , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee . "
The main subject of the letter was a similar vow to veto any restrictions on Bush ’s ability to continue his war crime in Iraq .
The passage concerning Iran might seem redundant now , after the Senate ’s vote on Lieberman ’s " Persia delenda est ! " measure , which puts a gun in Bush ’s hand and screams for him to pull the trigger , but the President is obviously taking no chances .
The Best of Chris Floyd
A group of researchers has cracked the security features in what are supposed to be some of the world ’s most secure locks — locks that are used at the White House , the Pentagon , embassies and other critical locations .
The researchers presented their findings for the first time at the DefCon hacker conference this weekend and showed how they could easily bump and pick the newest high - security M3 locks made by Medeco , a company that owns an estimated 70 percent of the lock market .
In addition to bumping and picking Medeco ’s M3 cylinder locks , the researchers also succeeded in the last few weeks to crack a Medeco M3 deadbolt lock — considered to be one of the highest security locks in the world .
They showed Wired News how to open the deadbolt in less than a minute using nothing more than a modified $ 2 screwdriver and a wire shim .
They asked , however , that we not publish the details .
" Medeco invented the pin tumbler lock that lifts and twists the pins , " says Marc Weber Tobias , one of the researchers and an investigative lawyer and author .
" It ’s a brilliant idea and basically these are unpickable locks .
But we can pick them .
Everybody in my profession has been trying to break these for 30 - 35 years .
And frankly , I ca n’t believe that we ’ve come up with this and nobody else has . "
He says the deadbolt crack is especially concerning .
" The deadbolt is really a serious security problem , " he says .
" I do n’t want to create a panic , but this needs to get fixed . "
The M3 is a new high - security lock that Medeco launched in 2005 to improve upon its previous Biaxial locks .
The key for unlocking Medeco ’s M3 lock has a patented bar on the side of it that has to make contact with a slider inside the lock .
The feature is intended to heighten the lock ’s security .
But Tobias and his group found a way to simply bypass the slider with a paper clip and proceed to open the lock as if it were a previous - generation Biaxial lock .
" We wanted to ( take ) a picture of a sign outside the White House or the Pentagon that says ‘ Security Warning :
No cameras , no cell phones , no paper clips , " Tobias says .
" This is so ludicrous . "
Tobias and his two colleagues , among them computer security researcher Matt Fiddler and a professional locksmith who asked not to be named , made headlines last year when they published techniques for bumping Kwikset locks — the standard brand of lock that is used in most homes .
After a small media storm ensued , Medeco responded to the news that Kwikset ’s locks could be bumped by saying that its own locks were bump - proof .
So Tobias and his colleagues decided to test this claim last April .
They conducted extensive analysis of Medeco ’s published key codes and within three months had made their first breakthrough toward cracking the security of the locks .
They then spent the next 12 months perfecting their techniques and creating and testing a special set of keys derived from the published key codes for non-master key locks .
They ’ve since filed several provisional patents for their cracking techniques .
To demonstrate their crack of Medeco ’s M3 lock for Wired News , Tobias took a lock and inserted one of the keys that he and his researchers designed from Medeco ’s codes .
Then he hit it several times with a bump hammer and turned the key .
The deadbolt was opened just as quickly with an even simpler technique using the wire shim and screwdriver .
Tobias pointed out , however , that this cracking technique works only on deadbolts that have a single - sided key entry with a flip switch on one side , not on deadbolts that require a key on both sides of the lock .
Tobias says that his group provided Medeco with full documentation of their techniques as well as video showing them cracking the locks .
He says that rather than comment on whether their techniques were plausible , Medeco said the researchers did n’t know what they were talking about and insisted its locks were still bump - and pick - proof .
Tobias says he told Medeco that he was willing to sponsor a worldwide validity test to demonstrate his group ’s ability to crack the locks , but Medeco has n’t responded to his offer .
Tobias thinks there are a couple of possible reasons why Medeco has n’t commented on the techniques they used to crack the locks .
" Either Medeco has known about this ( problem ) for a long time and just wo n’t comment on it , or the government has known about it for a long time and has n’t told Medeco .
Or ( Medeco testers ) just ca n’t replicate this ( cracking technique ) and do n’t understand what we ’re talking about .
But the bottom line is that we ’re opening the locks . "
Medeco was unavailable for comment , but a call to the company ’s main number produced a voicemail message addressing the bumping controversy and directing callers to this page on the company ’s web site .
Tobias says he initially did n’t intend to release this information about the M3 locks at DefCon .
He planned to simply write about it in the next edition of his book .
But Medeco ’s continued insistence that the locks are secure has prompted him to discuss the issue more publicly .
He posted information about the lock cracking techniques on his blog and , three days ago , posted a security alert specifically about the M3 deadbolts to a restricted industry site for professional locksmiths .
He also met with a representative of the Underwriters Laboratory and intends to speak in September at a meeting of the lab ’s standards technical panel for UL 437 to discuss improving the standard for such locks .
Currently the standards do n’t test for bumping , Tobias says .

[ This weekend at DefCon Tobias ran into Jennalynn , a 12 - year - old girl who appeared in a YouTube video last year bumping a Kwikset lock .
( Jennalynn ’s mother declined to give her daughter ’s last name because she preferred not to have it published . )
Tobias asked her to try bumping Medeco ’s Biaxial lock , a more secure lock .
She did it three times .
Below is a video showing her bumping the lock , with Tobias next to her .
As a bonus , we ’ve tried to work out how each game is going , and to make things even more difficult for ourselves , we ’ve limited our search to ballgames only .
10 .
First let ’s look at the 2nd of the 18 - hole Las Vegas Country Club Golf Course , where we see the pin lying on the grass and the person closest playing their putt .
Everyone else is standing around , probably telling him to hurry up .
9 . As the world ’s most popular sport , there must be hundreds of games of football being played at any one second .
Here we see students playing “ the beautiful game ” at the University of Tokyo .
However , this looks like it ’s just a practise session as there ’s no goalie at either end .
8 . There ’s people playing tennis all over the globe but for the top 10 we ’ve chosen these two games of doubles being played on clay in Germany .
The eastern game is in full swing , and on the western court the players are standing in their service positions , and judging from the shadows it looks as if the southern team are about to serve !
7 . There ’s a good turnout for Lawn Bowls at Bell Vue Park Bowling Green in Newport , Wales .
Sadly the bowls are just too small to be seen so we ca n’t tell how the games are going .
6 . The stands are filling up at Yankee stadium , and there ’s a couple of people on the field , but we ’re a little too early for the game .
Hmm , we ’ll need another baseball game in progress … here ’s four !
In the thumbnail we see a batter up at the plate , and I think the bases are loaded .
5 . The Shay in Halifax , England is also used for football games , but today it ’s a home game for local rugby league team Halifax RLFC .
The ball is probably somewhere in the west of the pitch and the team to the north are on the offensive .
4 . They ’re playing lacrosse in Salamanca , New York .
You can tell that it ’s a men ’s game as there are 20 players on the pitch ( women ’s lacrosse would have 24 players ) .
3 . Here is a cricket match being played in the village of Hoylandswaine , north of Sheffield .
It looks like they ’re between plays , as the batsman has stepped back from the wicket to the west and we can see the other batsman and the bowler at the eastern end .
2 . Here we see a packed gameday at Seahawks Stadium ( now Qwest field ) with 63,588 people watching the Nevada Wolf Pack at Washington State Cougars on August 31 , 2002 .
Google Earth Community member GEChump managed to identify the exact play seen in the photo , making this 11:37 remaining in the second quarter with the game tied at 7 .
The Cougars eventually went on to win 31 - 7 .
1 . Finally , we find a tense one - on - one street - Basketball game being played in Rolde , Netherlands .
Due to the left - hand player ’s poor defence the right - hand player has just taken a shot at the basket , however they ’ve missed and the ball is rebounding back .
Have you found a ball game on Google Earth not mentioned here ?
Let us know !

DUMMERSTON , Vt. â € ”
In his new book , " The Age of Turbulence , " former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan departed from the Bush administration 's script and wrote that " the Iraq war is largely about oil . "
Of course , Greenspan immediately had to backpedal from that statement .
Despite the fact that nearly everyone in the world knows that control of Iraq 's oil reserves was one of the main reasons for the U.S. invasion , public officials still have to feign shock and outrage when someone says it .
President Bush certainly wants us to keep pretending that oil has nothing to do with the U.S. occupation of Iraq .
Last week , Bush said that Iraqi leaders " have asked for an enduring relationship with America .
And we are ready to begin building that relationship in a way that protects our interests in the region and requires many fewer American troops . "
" Our interests " in the region can be summed up in one single three letter word : oil .
When you hear the president and his staff talk about " our assets in the region , " the ones that need to be protected , they are talking about dozens of military bases built to protect our access to the region 's oil , including the permanent bases that have been built in Iraq .
The U.S. military has served as the security force to ensure the flow of crude oil from the Persian Gulf for decades .
It is the stated policy of the United States that nothing is to interfere with the flow of oil from the region and that any interference is to be treated as a direct threat to our national security .
The invasion of Iraq was part of that policy .
As investigative journalist Greg Palast ably outlined in his recent book , " Armed Madhouse , " the neocons at the Project for a New American Century â€ ” the think tank that created much of the Bush administration 's foreign policy â€ ” prepared a 101 - page plan for transforming Iraq into a free market paradise after the invasion .
Hyperbole ?
The plan called for the sale of Iraq 's infrastructure and its state - run companies to foreign corporations , complete deregulation of Iraq 's industries and a rewrite of the tax laws to make Iraq a more business - friendly place .
In other words , privatization at gunpoint .
Remember how we were told that the war would finance itself ?
The oil revenues that Iraq would generate would pay for the invasion and reconstruction , the war planners told us .
That turned out to be as much of a lie as our bringing freedom and democracy to Iraq .
Remember how quickly Gen. Jay Garner was sacked from his position as the U.S. viceroy in Iraq in April 2003 ?
That was because he was more interested in helping set up a new government that represented the will of the Iraqi people .
Doing that , however , would have meant the end of the grand privatization plan .
So Garner was fired .
Garner was replaced by Paul Bremer , who agreed to follow the PNAC script .
The problem was that the script called for denying Iraqis a say in the rebuilding of their country .
It helped fuel the insurgency that has killed thousands of Americans and more than a million Iraqis over the past four years .
And the kicker to all this is that Iraq 's oil industry still has n't been privatized and is producing less oil than before the war .
That 's why the United States has been so adamant about the Iraqi government , such as it is , approving an agreement that would not only equitably split oil revenues between the Sunnis , Shiites and Kurds , but give the big oil companies a much larger cut of the profits .
That agreement has not been reached .
There are no signs it will be reached .
If you were sitting on a commodity that the whole world wants and will pay dearly for , would you give it away ?
The story of how the Bush administration and its allies in the oil industry sought to control Iraq 's oil is a long and convoluted one .
It 's certainly a story that Bush does n't want to talk about , but it is one has to be acknowledged .
As long as America is totally dependent on oil for its economic survival , our soldiers are going to be in the Middle East .
As oil becomes a more scarce and expensive commodity , there will be more wars fought over it .
It is disingenuous for the people running this nation to deny this .
Unfortunately , they still do .

MANCHESTER , England , May 14 — As Oscar Pistorius of South Africa crouched in the starting blocks for the 200 meters on Sunday , the small crowd turned its attention to the sprinter who calls himself the fastest man on no legs .
Pistorius wants to be the first amputee runner to compete in the Olympics .
But despite his ascendance , he is facing resistance from track and field ’s world governing body , which is seeking to bar him on the grounds that the technology of his prosthetics may give him an unfair advantage over sprinters using their natural legs .
His first strides were choppy Sunday , a necessary accommodation to sprinting on a pair of j - shaped blades made of carbon fiber and known as Cheetahs .
Pistorius was born without the fibula in his lower legs and with other defects in his feet .
He had both legs amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old .
At 20 , his coach says , he is like a five - speed engine with no second gear .
Yet Pistorius is also a searing talent who has begun erasing the lines between abled and disabled , raising philosophical questions :
What should an athlete look like ?
Where should limits be placed on technology to balance fair play with the right to compete ?
Would the nature of sport be altered if athletes using artificial limbs could run faster or jump higher than the best athletes using their natural limbs ?
Are you stuck on the freeway and willing to pay almost anything to get moving again ?
Some cities may give you the opportunity to reach into your wallet as part of an idea now reaching American shores .
The concept is simple : to cut down on bumper - to - bumper traffic and improve air quality , charge a fee to use the roads – or even enter the city – during rush hour .
Known as congestion pricing , the concept is favored by the US Department of Transportation , which is planning to help fund some of these efforts this summer .
Nine cities – including such car - oriented cities as San Diego , Miami , and Dallas – are proposing a charge to use roads during rush hour .
New York 's is the most wide - sweeping – tacking on an $ 8 fee for cars and $ 21 for trucks to enter much of Manhattan .
Opponents call the proposal a regressive tax that hurts working people .
And they worry about small businesses that count on commuters losing business .
Proponents of the system say it is a way to get more riders on mass - transit systems or at least in van or car pools .
The model is London , which claims that such fees are now allowing traffic to flow more smoothly .
" The concept is certainly starting to spread , " says Allison Hannon , a researcher at the Climate Group in New York , a nonprofit that tries to connect business and government to solve climate issues .
" What happened is that London 's Mayor Ken Livingstone and Oslo 's mayor went out on a ledge and tried it , and it actually worked . "
As almost anyone who drives in an urban area can attest , traffic jams do n't seem to go away .
In May 2005 , the Texas Transportation Institute ( TTI ) at Texas A&M University found that congestion continued to grow in 85 regions it studied .
Overall , traffic delays amounted to 3.7 billion hours in 2003 , up from 700 million hours in 1982 , the study found .
From an environmental standpoint , gridlocked traffic is also costly .
Stalled cars have higher emissions than moving traffic , says Timothy Lomax of the TTI , who has been involved in urban - congestion studies for the past 20 years .
" You can improve the emissions if you reduce the stop - and - go and move into a range of flow - and - go – say 30 to 40 miles per hour , " says Mr. Lomax .
San Diego , in fact , has been charging commuters a congestion toll since 1997 to use special lanes of the I - 15 , the main inland north - south expressway .
The toll itself changes , depending on the traffic , from 50 cents to as much as $ 8 if there is an emergency or a car breakdown .
The users save an average of 10 to 15 minutes , but surveys show they think they save 30 minutes .
" The toll is dynamic .
It has the ability to change every six minutes depending on the conditions , " says Garry Bonelli , a spokesman for the San Diego Association of Governments ( SANDAG ) , which develops long - term transportation plans for the region .
Now , SANDAG , at a cost of $ 1.7 billion , is expanding the toll road from two to four lanes .
And it will be 24 miles long , up from eight .
Two years ago , San Francisco discussed adding a fee to enter the city , but it quickly ran into political opposition .
City agencies are still discussing the issue , says Howard Strassner of the San Francisco Sierra Club in an e-mail .
But the city , he says , may have something better than congestion pricing : a 20 percent tax on top of very high parking fees .
New York 's proposal may run into stiff political winds as well .
The state legislature must approve any new taxes or fees , and Sheldon Silver , speaker of the House , has been ambivalent about the concept .
However , he has said he might call a special session of the Assembly this summer .
" My sense is the speaker will tend to his members , " says Kathryn Wylde , president of the Partnership for New York City , which is largely made up of large businesses .
" And if his members ' concerns are fairly addressed , he will support it . "
Some of those concerns were on display last week at a rally of an ad hoc group called the Committee to Keep NYC Congestion Tax Free.
State Sen. Carl Kruger of Brooklyn complained the tax was unfair , " basically putting a tax on those who can't afford it . "
He called for more spending to alleviate traffic in the outer boroughs .
Queens Village resident Gabriella Krill thought the proposed tax would be unfair on seniors who already pay heavy taxes to live in the city .
" Subways are hard – to go up and down stairs .
Buses are hard to get out of , " she said .
However , Ms. Wylde says the issue is too important to be sidetracked .
Her office has put together briefing papers that show billions of dollars of lost business and thousands of lost jobs if nothing is done .
" If we do n't do this now , it will never happen , " she says .
" And then New York will lose its leadership position . "
Alison Snyder contributed to this report in New York .
BAGHDAD , Sept. 20  The first cases of cholera appeared in Baghdad on Thursday , in a sign the epidemic that has already sickened thousands in northern Iraq is now spreading more widely in a population made vulnerable by war to a normally preventable disease .
The World Health Organization and Iraqi Red Crescent Society reported two cases here and Iraqi television reported another case , in a 7 - month - old baby , in Basra , far to the south .
People contract cholera by ingesting water or food contaminated with the feces of an infected person .
Roughly one in 20 infected people become severely ill , with profuse diarrhea , vomiting and leg cramps , while others have mild or no symptoms but carry the disease .
While cholera can kill its victims in a matter or hours , it is easily controlled through basic water treatment and sanitation measures .
But in a sign of how difficult that may be in Iraq , the director of the Basra health ministry , Dr. Ryadh Abdul Ameer , said Thursday that some waterworks in his city were now entirely without chlorine , which is used to purify , because imports of chlorine dried up this year after insurgents used the chemical in bomb attacks .
Last night Jon Stewart did what the media fails to do : namely , take General Petraeus ' long record of rosey predictions into account when judging the accuracy and objectivity of his report on Iraq .

John Amato : Bush and the Republicans all hid behind the General 's skirt to buy themselves more time so they could continue a sustained presence in Iraq until he leaves office .
Meanwhile , CentCom Chief Fallon had this to say about him :
“ an ass - kissing little chickensh *t ” and added , “ I hate people like that ” , the sources say .
That remark reportedly came after Petraeus began the meeting by making remarks that Fallon interpreted as trying to ingratiate himself with a superior .
Sen .
Webb will be asking Carl Levin to call Fallon in to testify .
Smells like Armageddon to me .
Mr Greenspan was Fed chairman under four US presidents
In a book to be published next week , Mr Greenspan says Mr Bush ignored his advice to veto " out - of - control " bills that sent the US deeper into deficit .
And Mr Bush 's Republicans deserved to lose control of Congress in last year 's elections , he charges .
Mr Greenspan , 81 , stepped down last year after nearly 19 years in the post .
In The Age of Turbulence : Adventures in a New World , Mr Greenspan - who has described himself as a " lifelong libertarian Republican " - spares no criticism of the Republican party .
He writes that he advised the White House to veto some bills to curb " out - of - control " spending at the time Republicans controlled Congress .
President Bush 's failure to do so " was a major mistake " , he said .
" Little value was placed on rigorous economic policy debate or the weighing of long - term consequences , " he says of the Bush administration .
And he charges that Republicans in Congress " swapped principle for power " and " ended up with neither " .
" They deserved to lose . "
Mr Greenspan retired in early 2006 after serving under six US presidents - either as Federal Reserve chairman or chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors .
He now runs a private consulting company - and is an honorary adviser to the UK government .
The problems , however , are not that we are running out of oil , rather it is that we are running out of cheap oil .
When oil fields are abandoned there may be 60 % of the original oil ( OOIP ) that is left in the rock .
At present this is just too expensive to extract , but it leaves us with a problem since most transportation requires a liquid fuel .
To work effectively the vehicle must have a small , relatively light engine , together with a storage reservoir full of fuel , that must in turn , be as light , yet energy dense , as possible .
The Internal Combustion Engine ( ICE ) has filled that need for the past century or so .
The fuels that power it are among the most energy dense of those commonly available .
That alone , however , is not the problem .
The morning began with a Keynote address by Lord Oxburgh former non-executive chairman of Shell , who spoke on “ Out of Oil , into Hot Water . ”
He began by noting the economic difficulties that are coming as demand continues to exceed supply .
We are not , after all , making oil any more .
( Ed comment – well let ’s not forget biofuels – and it turned out he did not ) .
Because these problems will arise around the time of peaking they will likely be precursors to it , and these economic consequences will come sooner than expected .
The problem arises as populations grow , and expect to achieve the standards of more developed countries , with free access to cars and transportation .
This has led to a growing fleet of vehicles to meet that need , and in contrast to the Hirsch Report ( pdf ) he felt that it would likely take over 40 years to change to an alternate method of propulsion .
In this change oil prices above $ 70 / bbl changes the paradigm .
We have reached the end of an era , and need to start to change Now !
The challenge is so urgent that all potential alternates should be explored , including those that will not be considered appropriate for the long term .
We need the breathing space , and thus should establish more nuclear and coal - fired power stations .
But while this may solve some issues it does not really address vehicles and their need for liquids .
To meet this need there should be two strategies , the first to find alternate sources of liquid fuel , and the second to find an alternative to the ICE .
There is , however , no substitute for ICE on a plane , and for now that will remain a problem .
By gasifying coal , processing natural gas , or gasifying biomass we can sequentially process these into a liquid fuel to meet the need .
However if this were done on a global scale the Greehouse gasses ( GHG ) produced by the first two would be at a disastrous level .
Biomass , however , provides three routes to a fuel , gasification , crushing the seeds , and fermentation .
However , if food sources are used , then this will lead to issues and conflict .
It is better to use land that is not currently used for food .
He showed a chart that broke land use down so that there are 42 million sq km of forest ; 45 mill of deserts , crops occupy 16 million km and savannah 23 million sq km .
To meet needs we would have to take a third of the cropland for ethanol , and a third for biodiesel , and this is not acceptable .
We must , therefore look to crops that are not a threat to food production .
He mentioned corn residue , elephant grass and Jatropha curcus as potential fuel stock , noting the benefits of cellulosic ethanol ( Shell is partnered with Iogen in Canada to exploit this opportunity ) .
Jatropha yields a seed that can be processed to yield oil , and again Lord Oxburgh is associated with D1 Oils in establishing plantations for the jatropha as a collaborative venture with BP .
However he felt that the largest untapped source was in urban waste noting that the waste in the US if tapped ( by burning largely ) could generate equivalent power to that needed to power the US fleet of vehicles .
( Ed note Cork has a waste processing plant in town that produces energy that the town uses ) .
Changing the ICE has many potential benefits .
Electric cars do not have to cost $ 100,000 .
He showed a slide of the UK version , it is a mere $ 300,000 but has the advantage that the battery can be recharged in 10 minutes and so , with an initial range of 200 miles , it has some advantages over its American cousin .
He did not think much of the economics of using hydrogen as a fuel source for a car .
However he did think that making vehicles much lighter , such as the Loremo diesel that is being introduced in Europe in 2009 , may be the way to go .
Fueled by biodiesel which , if produced responsibly , can cost $ 90 - $ 100 / bbl it provides , an apparent alternative that gets high mileage .
In regard to existing fossil fuels , they will be used , since we need that breathing space , and for China and India it is the only large fuel stock that they currently have .
However this will include carbon capture and sequestration ( CCS ) with costs going up 30 % for the capture , and 10 % for transportation .
With such costs the process will only be used under government pressure .
Closing with the reminder that we will need every source that we can get , and that while it will take decades to reach optimal solutions we do n’t have that time , but must make do expeditiously with what we have .
The first panel then begain to assemble , but the delegate from Cuba Dr Alfredo Curbelo could not make it , so the session chair Jeremy Leggett took the time to discourse on Climate Change .
He pointed out the magazines that had put it on their front cover , including Vanity Fair , and noted that Peak Oil had not been so successful in getting the public attention .
Nor perhaps the private support , since the IEA target of producing 116 mbdoe by 2030 requires an investment of $ 4 trillion , and that is not a done deal .
And in the meantime it remains a controversial subject , given , for example the Exxon Mobil messages about there being no problem .
Accepting that the world does not need to see a temperature rise of more than 2deg C , since this would exacerbate current droughts and floods , we need to consider the implications for fossil fuel use – how much can we burn ?
But the current concentrations will take us over a 1deg C rise and there are other gases that contribute , so that the CO2 limit is going to be 400 ppm .
Yet , if we are to run out of oil so quickly , will this be the problem that it is made out to be ?
If we are to address both issues we need to bring them together , and if we are to get the message out then we have to do this through local contacts and pro-active organizations .
Michael Dittmar then talked about Nuclear Energy and some of the issues that face that industry .
There are currently some 439 plants , producing 371 GWe and in 2005 this was 15 % of the world electric power generation .
There are currently 30 reactors under construction .
The age of the reactors , however , means that soon some of this fleet must be closed down which will lead for the need for some form of action .
Breeder reactors , that were once held to be very promising , have not proven as successful as hoped .
He had tried but was unable to find how long it took to double the fuel elements concerned , and there Is only one breeder operating , with two under construction .
Ho noted documentation that said that the ( current ) world uranium reserve will be gone in the time range between 2030 and 2040 , meaning that we must anticipate developing “ speculative ” resources .
A 7 GWe reactor needs 180 tons of uranium / year .
And the 371 GWe production from 439 reactors adds up to a need for 67,000 ton / year .
With a 1 – 2 % growth for 20 years , this will lead to a need for between 51 and 130,000 tons of uranium .
The reserve is thus going to run out in less than 50 years .
In egard to those who say that uranium can be recovered from seawater , he noted that :
A reactor uses 6 gm / sec which , at seawater concentrations will require processing 10,000 cu m/sec of water .
To put that in context the Rhine river flows at 2,000 cu m/sec .
He noted the flooding of the Cigar Lake mine and subsequent setbacks which was supposed to re-open in 2008 has led to the mine being set back to possibly 2011 , with the likelihood that this will lead to international shortages of fuel .
In looking at fusion , the current goal is to get to a prototype reactor by 2060 , however this requires 56 kg of tritium / year .
However , at best , the world supply of tritium in 2027 is expected to be 30 kg .
This , and similar problems , leads him to state that “ commercial nuclear fusion energy will always be 50 years away . ”
We then took a break and came back to hear TOD ’s own Nate Hagens discuss how we got to where we are , through brina development , survival of the fittest , and , with the use of audiovisual examples , showed the primitive that still resides in us all .
It was one of those talks that are better experienced than read ( and ASPO will have the DVD out in about two weeks ) .
His theme was sufficiently well expressed that it was quoted extensively by speakers through the rest of the conference .
He noted , however that breeding for select attributes does not necessarily guarantee survival – using the example of the Irish Elk .
Now extinct , the antlers were used in sexual selection , with the largest racks getting to mate .
This did not select for other survival skills , particularly those of changing conditions .
Thus it is not always the evident conditions that can be assumed to be optimum .
Providing solar power for buildings is an example .
The current trend is to retrofit solar to existing buildings , but , by adjusting the power density of new construction and the solar panel space available , a more conformable balance can be achieved , and Germany is moving toward this model .
Yet in fuel source selection it must be remembered that there are not only direct costs ( fuel costs to run the tractor for eg ) but also indirect costs ( say the power cost to build the tractor , or the refinery ) and also the environmental costs that must also be factored in .
And as time goes on the Energy return on investment ( EROI ) will decline .
For example in oil production an original return of 100:1 may move to 30:1 and then 10:1 , and in biofuel generation the energy costs of the water , which may flow at 1,000 times the volume of biofuel finally generated , can not only pose costs but also show stoppers , should the plant be located in a drought zone .
In selection of the best option there is a term called the discount rate of values and Nate illustrated this , and how choices can be modified by external stimuli .
This relates to the degree of foresight involved in making a selection or choice .
The historic trend has been for us to select for immediate solution / gratification .
One of the problems is that this leads to what ( and here he quoted Dr Schlesinger ) are the two prevailing stages of attitudes toward Peak Oil – complacency and panic .
The first three speakers were then joined by Matt Dempsey of the Irish Farmers Journal , Mary Graham who works in the reality of helping communities in Africa ( after the celebrities go home ) , Philip Walton who spoke to nuclear issues , ( and had some significant disagreement with Michael Dittmar , to the point that Chairman Leggett stopped taking questions ( or comments ) on the subject after some heated words with audience participation ) , and Gerard O’Neill .
The discussion had by now begun to focus more on Ireland , and it was clear that the speakers thought that Ireland was in trouble .
At the end of a long gas line from Russia , they must import almost all their fuel , 70 % of it along this pipe , And so they have set a goal of 33 % from renewable energy .
Because of the problems with the intermittent nature of wind , it was suggested that the turbines would only yield 25 % of faceplate power .
This led into the debate about nuclear power , with emotional and rational points being brought forward .
There is a sense that folk are becoming divorced from the dirty reality of life .
That jobs , such as pig farming can be exported so that no - one need get dirty .
But this departure takes with it an understanding of the reality of production , and without that understanding sound judgments become more difficult .
Further culture must be considered , the outsider coming in and making recommendations , or installing systems , may do so with disregard for the culture and mores of those who need to be helped .
That may lead to many problems and ineffective efforts .
Further solutions may need to be at a greater level than just that for Ireland , yet the people aspects are an equivalent part of this equation , whether in Mali or Mayo .
The session then broke for a lunch of Irish stew .
To be continued . . . .( And Chris Skrebowski noted in the afternoon that for those of us who write these things after midnight – we get to blame Colin Campbell ( grin ) – hoping the links work ‘ cos they do at this end .
Hamas were boycotted by Western countries
US consul - general in Jerusalem Jacob Walles said there were no obstacles to re-engaging with the new government , which would have full US support .
Palestinian President and Fatah leader Mahmoud Abbas is expected to swear in a new prime minister on Sunday .
He sacked the Hamas - led government after clashes left more than 100 dead .
On Saturday , violence between the rival factions spread from Gaza to the West Bank , as Fatah gunmen stormed the Hamas - controlled Palestinian parliament building in Ramallah .
Quartet backing
Mr Welles met President Abbas on Saturday and said afterwards that he expected announcements in Washington about " our assistance and about the financial regulations " early next week .
Residents of Ramallah worried over future

" There wo n't be any obstacles , economically and politically , in terms of re-engaging with this [ emergency ] government , " he told Reuters news agency .
The quartet of Middle East peace mediators - the US , Russia , the United Nations and the European Union - has also said it backs the decision to dissolve the Hamas led - administration .
Western nations imposed sanctions on the Palestinians after Hamas , considered a terrorist organisation by the US and EU , won elections in January 2006 .
Hamas has denounced the move to form an emergency administration as illegal .
Last week , it ousted Fatah from Gaza after a week of fierce fighting .
On Saturday , Fatah gunmen seized the parliament building in Ramallah in the West Bank .
Second deputy speaker Hassan Khuraishah , an independent , told the BBC he had been beaten up as he tried to prevent Fatah gunmen from raising their flag .
In a show of strength , Fatah supporters paraded around Ramallah , firing weapons into the air and chanting " Hamas out " .
Almost all Hamas politicians and prominent supporters in Ramallah have either fled or gone into hiding .
Fatah supporters also took over the Hamas - controlled legislative council in Nablus .
Fleeing Gaza
Meanwhile , hundreds of Fatah supporters are reported to have been fleeing Hamas - controlled Gaza by land and sea .
SALAM FAYYAD
Born in 1952 near West Bank city of Tulkarm Holds a PhD in economics from the University of Texas Worked at the World Bank in Washington from 1987 - 1995 IMF representative to Palestine until 2001 Finance minister under the Fatah - controlled administration from 2002 - 2005 Credited with cracking down on official corruption
Profile : Salam Fayyad Gazans tell of fears
Gaza , and the much larger West Bank , are just 45 km ( 30 miles ) apart , but correspondents say they now look poised to function as two separate territories .
President Abbas declared a state of emergency when he sacked the government of Ismail Haniya on Thursday .
Mr Abbas has said he will rule by presidential decree until conditions are right for early elections .
His nominee for prime minister , Salam Fayyad , is a former World Bank economist , whose impending appointment Israel has welcomed .
Following the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , the judge who is now President Bush 's nominee for attorney general , Michael Mukasey , allowed prosecutors to keep a man behind bars for 10 months without any criminal charges being filed against him .
The man , Hussein al - Attas , a roommate of the so - called " 20th hijacker , " Zacarias Moussaoui , is the third person whose detention Judge Mukasey is known to have supervised during the investigation into the terrorist attacks .
Attas was one of at least 70 men jailed on the basis of material witness warrants during the investigation .
Such warrants permit the jailing of crime witnesses to ensure they do n't flee before testifying .
Civil rights lawyers have criticized their use as an end run around the prohibition against jailing suspects without charges or sufficient probable cause .
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , however , found the use of the warrants after the September 11 attacks to be lawful .
On Capitol Hill , Judge Mukasey 's handling of the material witness cases are seen as a window on his views on executive power .
Because the cases are sealed , the precise number of material witness cases Judge Mukasey oversaw as a federal judge in Manhattan is unknown .
Attas 's case differs from the other two material witness cases that have so far been publicly linked to Judge Mukasey because of the length of the detention .
The other two detainees  Jose Padilla and Osama Awadallah  were held as material witnesses for about a month before being declared an enemy combatant in Padilla 's case or indicted in Mr. Awadallah 's case .
After 10 months of detention , much of it in solitary confinement , Attas pleaded guilty in July 2002 for lying to FBI agents .
During those 10 months , Attas or his lawyers appeared before Judge Mukasey on at least four occasions to discuss Attas 's status , a source with knowledge of the case said .
The first conference was on September 20 , 2001 , the day Judge Mukasey signed the material witness warrant for Attas , the source , who asked not to be identified , said .
Records on Attas 's detention remain under seal .
One defense lawyer said that at no point did the defense ask Judge Mukasey to release Attas .
The reason for not doing so was the expectation that prosecutors would seek an indictment if they were faced with having to release Attas .
" I never raised the issue before the judge , " the lawyer , Alexander Eisemann , said .
" I did n't think it was in my clients interest to pick a fight with the government over my client 's continued detention .
The risk was that I was afraid that he would be put on trial next to Moussaoui . "
Attas , a Yemeni national who lived with Moussaoui in Norman Okla . , in the summer of 2001 , had driven his roommate to Eagen , Minn. , where Moussaoui tried to enroll in flight school .
The two shared a hotel room when Mr. Moussaoui was arrested in August , 2001 .
In conversations with FBI agents , Attas concealed Moussaoui 's identity .
The government has never claimed that Attas knew anything of the plot .
Mr. Eisemann described Mr. Mukasey 's handling of the case as " very principled and fair . "
Legal scholars disagree over whether Judge Mukasey should have intervened to prevent an uncharged person from being jailed for so long .
" That an individual was being held for 10 months without charges or evidence that detention was necessary to secure his testimony suggests the need for greater scrutiny of executive action by Judge Mukasey , " an expert on habeas corpus law and an attorney at the Brennan Center for Justice , Jonathan Hafetz , said .
Noting that the defense did not seek Attas 's release , a former federal prosecutor who is a law professor at Columbia University , Daniel Richman , said : " This was a time of grave national threat and uncertainty and the defendant , for his own reasons , was not pushing this , making it very hard to find any fault with the way the judge handled it . "
The government never compelled Attas to testify to a grand jury while he was detained only the basis of the warrant , two sources said .
Attas did later give a taped deposition , after his guilty plea , that was played at the death penalty phase of Moussoui 's trial .
The defense did request that Judge Mukasey ensure that Attas received more regular changes of clothing and a heavier blanket than the single sheet he slept under during winter , according to a letter from April 2002 described by one source who saw it .
It is unclear what action , if any , Judge Mukasey took in response .
When Judge Mukasey sentenced Attas in October , 2002 , he mentioned only indirectly the fact that Attas was jailed for so long as a material witness .
" Attas will be sentenced to time served , " Judge Mukasey said , according to a transcript .

Professor Fryer said that under his program , fourth graders and seventh graders who take the new round of mandatory standardized tests that the city is introducing in the fall would be rewarded with at least $ 5 .
They would get more money for high scores , with a cap of $ 25 for fourth graders and $ 50 for seventh graders .
In addition , each participating school would receive $ 5,000 .
Money for the payments will come from private backers , Professor Fryer said , because there would be no public money available for them .
The prospect of cash introduced into the classroom has made some local educators uneasy .
“ It makes me really nervous , ” said Maggie Siena , the principal of Public School 150 in TriBeCa .
“ I suspect paying kids for achievement in any way tends not to work . ”
Ernest Logan , the president of the principals ’ union , also expressed concerns .
“ We are troubled by additional pressure being placed on children to achieve perfection , ” he said .
“ What really matters in education is continued student progress , not perfect test scores . ”
Professor Fryer and other educational scholars have argued that some children , especially those from impoverished backgrounds , lack the foresight and role models to be self - motivated .
“ The fundamental problem with education and motivating kids to learn what they need to learn is that the payoffs are so distant , ” said Tom Loveless , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution , a left - leaning research organization .
“ So it ’s very hard to motivate students to do well .
Good students get that motivation from somewhere — from peers , their parents , how they ’re raised — but the kids who are unmotivated have a very hard time understanding that what they do today pays off decades from now . ”
Eric Nadelstern , the chief executive of the school system ’s empowerment initiative — which gives principals more autonomy to run their schools — lauded Professor Fryer in a recent e-mail message to principals .
“ He has my enthusiastic support , ” Mr. Nadelstern said .
“ I encourage you to give the program serious consideration . ”
It 's hard – often impossible – to prove that secret government wiretapping in the name of national security is violating one 's privacy rights .
The evidence itself usually is top secret .
But one rather obscure case could pull back the veil on a surveillance program that 's at the heart of the US fight against terror .
In the federal appeals court in San Francisco Wednesday , lawyers for a Saudi charity accused of helping Al Qaeda will argue that their clients , including two American attorneys , were illegally spied on without the required court warrant .
How do they know ?
Treasury Department officials inadvertently provided them with National Security Agency ( NSA ) call logs stamped " top secret . "
By the time federal agents had retrieved the logs of recorded calls six weeks later , the information had been shared with five other lawyers , two officials of the Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation 's US branch in southern Oregon , and a reporter with The Washington Post .
Because the government took back copies of the call logs , federal judges at the district - court level agreed to let those who saw them rely on their memory of what they saw as evidence .
The judges also said that they have " standing " in federal courts – that they have enough of a case to sue the federal government .
If the appeals court agrees with the lower court , the US Supreme Court is likely to become involved .
The case could have broader significance as well since it deals with presidential power during wartime .
" The difficulty in challenging any secret program is in proving that you were a victim of it , " says Jon Eisenberg , a lawyer in Oakland , Calif. , who represents the now - defunct US arm of the Islamic charitable foundation .
" We have that proof , and that makes us unique . "
In recent days , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) and the Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) have issued new challenges to the federal government 's domestic spying program .
In another case at federal district court in San Francisco last week , the CCR , which represents hundreds of " enemy combatants " at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , argued that the NSA 's program of warrantless surveillance is unconstitutional .
" It is virtually certain that the NSA spied on our confidential communications with our clients as well as conversations with other American attorneys outside of the US , " says Vincent Warren , CCR executive director .
Meanwhile , the ACLU last week filed legal papers with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ( FISC ) – the special court set up to decide whether such wiretaps are lawful and can be implemented – seeking the legal opinions upon which that court bases its decisions .
ACLU attorneys argue that the only thing known about those opinions has come from administration officials , and that those officials are not disinterested parties in a debate about the appropriate reach of executive branch surveillance .
" The public has a right to firsthand information about what the court permitted and what it disallowed , " says Jameel Jaffer , director of the ACLU 's national security project .
( Over the years , the secretive FISC has rarely denied wiretap requests . )
Just before they scattered for their August break , members of Congress made it easier for government agencies to eavesdrop on Americans in the name of fighting terrorism , raising once again the issue of domestic surveillance without a court warrant .
The administration characterized the just - passed change to the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) as a way of keeping up with modern technology that did n't exist when the act was passed nearly 30 years ago : e-mail , the Internet , cellphones , and fiber - optic cables .
Without the new law , President Bush said in signing it last week , US intelligence agencies would be " missing a significant amount of foreign intelligence that we should be collecting to protect our country . "
The law is meant to allow the interception of suspicious foreign communications routed through the US .
But it also allows intelligence agencies to intercept and record – without a court order – electronic communications involving Americans so long as the intelligence gathering is " directed at a person reasonably believed to be located outside the United States . "
And it gives the US attorney general and the director of national intelligence , rather than the special intelligence court , power to approve the international surveillance .
That 's raised concerns among civil libertarians , who view it as a weakening of judicial oversight of wiretapping .
They see it as echoing the Central Intelligence Agency abuses of the 1970s , which prompted Congress to pass FISA .
Since the new law has a six - month sunset provision , civil liberties advocates will be pushing Congress to enact greater safeguards – including judicial oversight – when lawmakers return to Washington next month .
In a letter to House Judiciary Committee chairman John Conyers ( D ) of Michigan , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D ) wrote : " Many provisions of this legislation are unacceptable , and , although the bill has a six - month sunset clause , I do not believe the American people will want to wait that long before corrective action is taken . "
Meanwhile , the Oregon wiretapping case to be heard before the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals this week may well reveal details directly related to the legality of domestic surveillance .
The government alleges that the Oregon - based chapter of the Saudi charity laundered $ 150,000 in donations to help Islamic fighters in Chechnya with ties to Al Qaeda .
Attorneys for the group vigorously deny that charge .
And they claim they were illegally spied upon , saying they 've seen the government 's own proof of that in the form of NSA phone logs .
Treasury and Justice Department officials refuse to comment on the case .
But in court documents urging dismissal , administration officials wrote : " Whether plaintiffs were subjected to surveillance is a state secret , and information tending to confirm or deny that fact is privileged . "
A rapper 's wife gave birth Thursday , but the scene quickly turned to tragedy after their newborn girl was pronounced dead .
Rev. Run , a .k.a.
Joseph Simmons , shocked fans last year when he announced that his wife Justine was pregnant on his MTV reality show " Run 's House . "
Justine 's pregnancy was the cliffhanger on the MTV show last season .
It generated intense interest among viewers who have been anxiously following the pregnancy and awaiting the birth .
Simmons , a member of the legendary rap group Run-DMC , was at Valley Hospital in Ridgewood , NJ Tuesday for the birth of his child .
Doctors delivered the baby via c-section , revealing a cruel twist of fate -- the baby girl was born with organs outside the body .
The newborn died a short time later .
Washington ( TGW ) - John Marburger , one of U.S. President George Bush 's scientific advisers , said climate change is real and is likely caused by humanity .
He said he is 90 % certain that greenhouse gas emissions are causing global warming .
" I think there is widespread agreement on certain basics , and one of the most important is that we are producing far more CO2 from fossil fuels than we ought to be .
And it 's going to lead to trouble unless we can begin to reduce the amount of fossil fuels we are burning and using in our economies , ” he told the BBC in an interview .
" The CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere and there 's no end point , it just gets hotter and hotter , and so at some point it becomes unlivable , " he said .
" You only have two choices ; you either have advanced technologies and get them into the marketplace , or you shut down your economies and put people out of work , " he said .
The Bush administration has been resistant to joining the fight against climate change .

The Bush administration 's attempt to change laws governing wiretapping by US spies was prompted by a defeat in the FISA secret star - chamber court , it has emerged .
Newsweek reporters Michael Isikoff and Mark Hosenball , quoting an unnamed legal source " who has been briefed on the order " , revealed yesterday that a FISA ( Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ) judge has refused to renew a warrant for at least part of the National Security Agency ( NSA ) mass surveillance programme .
Originally , in the aftermath of 9/11 , the President 's men claimed that the executive branch needed no judicial or legislative approval for its actions .
Even the compliant dial - a- judges of the star - chamber were n't consulted , and no provision for mass domestic surveillance was requested in the already draconian post - 9/11 Patriot Act .
Since the matter became public knowledge , however , parts of the NSA campaign have been placed under FISA review : and this has led to some activities being blocked .
Hints of the spooks ' clash with the star - chamber beaks emerged this week in a Fox News interview with Congressional Republican leader John Boehner .
" There 's been a ruling , over the last four or five months , that prohibits the ability of our intelligence services and our counterintelligence people from listening in to two terrorists in other parts of the world where the communication could come through the United States , " Boehner told the Fox anchor .
Now there 's confirmation that it was , in fact , an FISA judge who issued that ruling , and that it was this judicial decision which had led the Bush administration to push for changes in the law .
Bush and the NSA contend they only want to spy on people outside the US ; but in order to do so they want to tap communications in America .
It is true that a lot of foreign phone calls , emails , IMs , and whatever are routed via the States .
Not many Americans would have a problem with their spies listening in on foreigners - that 's what spies are supposed to do .
But there is at least one obvious grey area , that of communications between people in America and those overseas - which are widely thought to have been subject to NSA mass surveillance in recent years .
In many cases , then , ordinary Americans are being spied on by their government - even if only to the extent of having their details shunted into big databases for mining .
That 's not what people pay their taxes for .
But the spectre of another 9/11 is a powerful political force , and the spook community has effectively said to Capitol Hill that if they are n't given free rein to eavesdrop they are n't taking the blame for the next atrocity .
Even many Democrats in Washington , despite their dislike of the Bush administration - and of the increasingly hardline American internal - security climate - have yielded to this , and there is apparently a good chance of yet - greater federal spookery powers being approved soon , before the summer recess .
Reportedly , the main question to be settled is that of oversight , with the White House proposing that the Attorney General exercise control over the spies .
However , the Democrats do n't trust the current AG , Alberto Gonzales , and this is said to be a sticking point in negotiations .
Almost regardless of all this , a further continental - US bombing , hijacking , or other outrage is probably inevitable at some point .
Even if the tiny jihadi minority among Muslims can somehow be suppressed , or anyway flagged up by supercomputer whenever they try anything , another homegrown - in - the - US - of - A Timothy McVeigh is bound to come along sooner or later .
Based on the measures which have come in since 9/11 , and those now in the works , it seems safe to say that a sufficently murderous McVeigh imitator - whose attack would of itself be an insignificant pinprick on the mighty USA - could turn America into a total police state . ®
Researchers have produced new DNA evidence that almost certainly confirms the theory that all modern humans have a common ancestry .
The genetic survey , produced by a collaborative team led by scholars at Cambridge and Anglia Ruskin Universities , shows that Australia 's aboriginal population sprang from the same tiny group of colonists , along with their New Guinean neighbours .
The research confirms the “ Out Of Africa ” hypothesis that all modern humans stem from a single group of Homo sapiens who emigrated from Africa 2,000 generations ago and spread throughout Eurasia over thousands of years .
These settlers replaced other early humans ( such as Neanderthals ) , rather than interbreeding with them .
Academics analysed the mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) and Y chromosome DNA of Aboriginal Australians and Melanesians from New Guinea .
This data was compared with the various DNA patterns associated with early humans .
The research was an international effort , with researchers from Tartu in Estonia , Oxford , and Stanford in California all contributing key data and expertise .
The results showed that both the Aborigines and Melanesians share the genetic features that have been linked to the exodus of modern humans from Africa 50,000 years ago .
Until now , one of the main reasons for doubting the “ Out Of Africa ” theory was the existence of inconsistent evidence in Australia .
The skeletal and tool remains that have been found there are strikingly different from those elsewhere on the “ coastal expressway ” – the route through South Asia taken by the early settlers .
Some scholars argue that these discrepancies exist either because the early colonists interbred with the local Homo erectus population , or because there was a subsequent , secondary migration from Africa .
Both explanations would undermine the theory of a single , common origin for modern - day humans .
advertisement
But in the latest research there was no evidence of a genetic inheritance from Homo erectus , indicating that the settlers did not mix and that these people therefore share the same direct ancestry as the other Eurasian peoples .
Geneticist Dr Peter Forster , who led the research , said : “ Although it has been speculated that the populations of Australia and New Guinea came from the same ancestors , the fossil record differs so significantly it has been difficult to prove .
For the first time , this evidence gives us a genetic link showing that the Australian Aboriginal and New Guinean populations are descended directly from the same specific group of people who emerged from the African migration . ”
At the time of the migration , 50,000 years ago , Australia and New Guinea were joined by a land bridge and the region was also only separated from the main Eurasian land mass by narrow straits such as Wallace 's Line in Indonesia .
The land bridge was submerged about 8,000 years ago .
The new study also explains why the fossil and archaeological record in Australia is so different to that found elsewhere even though the genetic record shows no evidence of interbreeding with Homo erectus , and indicates a single Palaeolithic colonisation event .
The DNA patterns of the Australian and Melanesian populations show that the population evolved in relative isolation .
The two groups also share certain genetic characteristics that are not found beyond Melanesia .
This would suggest that there was very little gene flow into Australia after the original migration .
advertisement
Dr Toomas Kivisild , from the Cambridge University Department of Biological Anthropology , who co-authored the report , said : “ The evidence points to relative isolation after the initial arrival , which would mean any significant developments in skeletal form and tool use were not influenced by outside sources .
“ There was probably a minor secondary gene flow into Australia while the land bridge from New Guinea was still open , but once it was submerged the population was apparently isolated for thousands of years .
The differences in the archaeological record are probably the result of this , rather than any secondary migration or interbreeding . ”
The study is reported in the new issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

Australia 's archaeological record provides several apparent inconsistencies with the “ Out Of Africa ” theory .
In particular , the earliest known Australian skeletons , from Lake Mungo , are relatively slender and gracile in form , whereas younger skeletal finds are much more robust .
This robustness , which remains , for example , in the brow ridge structure of modern Aborigines , would suggest either interbreeding between homo sapiens and homo erectus or multiple migrations into Australia , followed by interbreeding .
The archaeological data also indicates an intensification of the density and complexity of different stone tools in Australia during the Holocene period ( beginning around 10,000 years BP ) , in particular the emergence of backed - blade stone technology .
The first dingos arrived at around the same time , and it is thought both were brought to the continent by new human arrivals – leading to theories of a secondary migration that has resulted in disputes regarding the single point of origin theory .
Birds can travel the world without any of the gizmos that humans depend on , and a new study suggests how :
Our feathered friends might " see " Earth 's magnetic field .
While other mechanisms are thought to help birds navigate , including magnetically sensitive cells within their beaks , their brain regions responsible for vision are in full gear during magnetic navigation , researchers said .
" If you look into the brain of a bird during magnetic compass orientation , only the visual system is highly active , " said study co-author Henrik Mouritsen , a biologist at the University of Oldenburg in Germany , noting that most migratory birds do so at night .
" Other regions of the brain are not , so birds could use vision to ' see ' Earth 's magnetism and orient themselves . "
Mouritsen and his colleagues ' findings are detailed online in a recent issue of the journal PLoS ONE .
Magnetic chemistry
The researchers previously discovered molecules called cryptochromes , which change their chemistry in the presence of a magnetic field , in the retinas of migratory birds ' eyes .
" When light hits these molecules , their chemistry changes and magnetism can influence them , " Mouritsen said .
The molecules might then affect light - sensing cells in the retina to create images , which would help the brain navigate during flight , he added .
A direct connection between the specialized cells and the region of the bird 's brain active during magnetic orientation , however , had never been shown before .
Mouritsen and his team recently found such connections between the cryptochrome - holding retinal cells and the " cluster N " region of migratory birds ' brains , located in part of the brain responsible for vision .
" Cluster N is highly active during magnetic field orientation at night , when migratory birds fly , " he said , explaining that non-migratory birds do n't seem to use it during night flight .
" We can't see what birds see , obviously , but they may pick up some sort of shading in their vision at night to act as a compass . "
No smoking gun
Mouritsen noted that while the work is exciting , it is n't direct proof that they can actually " see " Earth 's magnetism during migratory flights at night .
" If we could listen in on the neural connections between the retinal cells and cluster N , and show they actually send magnetically - influenced signals to the brain , " Mouritsen said , " then that would be really compelling evidence that they can see it . "
Even if migratory birds can see Earth 's magnetic field , he noted , plenty of mysteries remain to explain their uncanny navigation .
" Birds also use the sun and stars to navigate , but we 're not certain how , " Mouritsen said .
" How do they compute all of this information and end up with a direction to fly in ?
There are so many steps in this process we simply do n't know about . "
“ We can see no just ground for the enormous military and naval establishment now being built up and maintained by our government . ” ~ Southern Baptist Convention , 1936
“ We express pride and strong support for our American military . ” ~ Southern Baptist Convention , 2004
What happened to the Southern Baptists ?
The Southern Baptist Convention ( SBC ) is the largest Protestant denomination in the United States .
The annual meeting of the SBC was held this year in San Antonio , Texas , on June 12 and 13 .
President Bush addressed the crowd of thousands of messengers via satellite with a nine - minute speech on the closing day “ to multiple lengthy applauses and standing ovations , ” according to Baptist Press , the official news agency of the SBC .
Although he is not a Southern Baptist , Bush has addressed the SBC annual meeting , either by satellite or videotape , every year since 2002 .
The only exception was last year , when Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who is also not a Southern Baptist , spoke to the SBC messengers in person in Greensboro , North Carolina , because Bush made a secret trip to Iraq during the time of the SBC annual meeting in 2006 .
Like he did in 2004 and 2005 , the president mentioned Southern Baptist support for the military in his recent comments to the SBC messengers : I also appreciate the fact that Southern Baptists are supporting our brave men and women in uniform , and their families .
I know you pray for their safety as they defend our people and extend the hope of freedom to the oppressed across the globe .
I appreciate the fact you ’ve sent care packages , and tend to the spiritual needs as military chaplains or kneel in prayer .
I thank you as you support those who volunteer to serve our nation .
If the president were honest , he would have thanked the pastors at the annual meeting for supplying cannon fodder for the state in the form of their young men that they encouraged to join the military .
Southern Baptists have been some of the greatest supporters of Bush and his war .
Richard Land , head of the SBC ’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission , “ the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention , ” is the author of the infamous “ Land Letter ” to President Bush in October of 2002 which agreed that Bush ’s “ policies concerning the ongoing international terrorist campaign against America are both right and just , ” and that Bush ’s “ stated policy concerning using military force if necessary to disarm Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass destruction is a just cause . ”
The letter was also signed by other warvangelical , Republican Party operatives like Chuck Colson , Bill Bright , and D. James Kennedy .
And just recently , LifeWay Christian Resources ( Southern Baptist ) and Holman Bible Outreach International ( an entity of LifeWay ) joined with Task Force Patriot USA to sponsor a Memorial Day weekend tribute to active duty U.S. troops , veterans , and their families at Georgia ’s Stone Mountain Park .
The tribute was called “ Task Force Patriot Salute to the Troops . ”
One of the many “ military and civilian motivational speakers ” was Bobby Welch , a former president of the SBC and a decorated Vietnam War veteran .
What was different about the SBC annual meeting this year is that there was no resolution passed expressing an opinion or concern about the president , the military , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , or the war on terrorism .
However , this does not mean that the messengers to the SBC annual meeting are now anti-war activists .
None of the pro-war / pro-military resolutions issued from 2002 to 2006 were repudiated in a resolution like the 1996 resolution that apologized to Blacks for “ condoning and / or perpetuating individual and systemic racism in our lifetime . ”
In 2006 a resolution was passed “ On Prayer for The President and The Military , ” which states in part that whereas :
Our nation is currently engaged in a global war on terrorism , and our military is fighting against a determined and fanatical enemy that is threatening the liberty and security of our nation and of the world ; and
The determined efforts of President George W. Bush and the sacrificial actions of our military personnel have resulted in Afghanistan , formerly under an oppressive regime , and Iraq , formerly under a brutal dictatorship , holding free and democratic elections and developing their own constitutional governments ;
It is resolved :
That we also express our appreciation for the military chaplains , who encourage service personnel to seek God in prayer ;
That we encourage all Southern Baptists to pray without ceasing for the president and all of our military personnel , especially those who are serving in areas of great danger ( 1 Thessalonians 5:17 ) ;
That we not only continue praying for all our military families , but that we also continue ministering to them in the name of Jesus , especially those grieving families of military personnel who have paid the ultimate price for our national freedom , remembering that Jesus laid down
His life for us and paid the ultimate price for our spiritual freedom ( John 15:13 ) .
In 2005 a resolution was passed “ On Appreciation of Our Troops and President , ” which states in part that whereas :
Members of the United States military and allied forces continue to be aggressively engaged in the ongoing global war on terror ;
Our troops play a vital role in preserving and protecting freedom in the United States and throughout the world ;
The sacrificial efforts of our military personnel have made it possible for some nations formerly ruled by dictators to hold democratic elections , ushering in a new era of freedom for the people of those nations ;
It is resolved :
That the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in Nashville , Tennessee , June 21 — 22 , 2005 , express appreciation to our servicemen and servicewomen in all branches of the military who are serving faithfully and honorably , both at home and abroad ;
That we encourage Southern Baptists to pray for the safety and well - being of our military personnel at all times ;
That we express pride and strong support for our American military and eagerly anticipate the day our troops return home upon successful completion of their missions ;
That we express deepest gratitude and respect for our president in light of the gravity of the decisions he must make and the leadership role he fills ;
That we encourage all Southern Baptists to pray regularly for our president and to stand with him in opposing global terrorism as he makes decisions that potentially impact the entire earth .
In 2004 a resolution was passed “ On Appreciation of Our American Military , ” which states in part that whereas :
Members of the United States military serve our country faithfully , both at home and abroad , maintaining peace throughout the world , and are aggressively engaged in the global war on terror ;
Each of our service personnel plays a vital role in preserving freedom in the United States and throughout the world ;
Each American service man and woman is called upon to protect and preserve the freedom we hold dear ;
It is resolved :
That the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in Indianapolis , Indiana , June 15 — 16 , 2004 , express appreciation to our service men and women in all branches of the military who are serving faithfully and honorably , both at home and abroad ;
That we encourage Southern Baptists to pray for the safety and well - being of our military personnel at all times , with particular attention to those who are in harm ’s way ;
That we express pride and strong support for our American military .
In 2003 a resolution was passed “ On the Liberation of Iraq , ” which states in part that whereas :
The Iraqi people have suffered for decades under the oppressive and autocratic regime of Saddam Hussein ;
The Iraqi regime was marked by repression , intimidation , mass murder , and extreme hostility to the most basic human rights of its people ;
Saddam Hussein repeatedly defied the demands of the international community to verify Iraqi compliance with United Nations resolutions against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ;
We believe Operation Iraqi Freedom was a warranted action based upon historic principles of just war ;
It is resolved :
That the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in Phoenix , Arizona , June 17 — 18 , 2003 , affirm President George W. Bush , the United States Congress , and our armed forces for their leadership in the successful execution of Operation Iraqi Freedom ;
That we commend the valiant and sacrificial service of the men and women of our armed forces and the ministry of our chaplains ;
That we call on Southern Baptists to pray for our troops and our diplomatic leaders as they aid in the rebuilding of the nation of Iraq ;
In 2002 a resolution was passed “ On the War on Terrorism , ” which states in part that whereas :
Following the ruthless and wicked attack on America on September 11 , 2001 , our nation was forced to respond in self - defense with a war on international terrorism ;
It has become increasingly clear that a vast , international terrorist network exists , which is allied with regimes that sponsor and support its evil goals ;
Terrorist groups and their state sponsors threaten to continue their assault on innocent people and to escalate this terror through the use of instruments of mass destruction — including chemical , biological , and nuclear weapons ;
It is resolved :
That the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in St. Louis , Missouri , June 11 — 12 , 2002 , declare our abhorrence of these horrific acts of international terrorism ;
That we applaud the moral clarity of the President of the United States in his denunciation of terrorist groups as “ evildoers ” who must be resisted ;
That we wholeheartedly support the actions of the United States government , its intelligence agencies , and its military , in the just war against the terrorist networks and their state sponsors ;
That we urge our President , our congressional leaders , and our military authorities , in a renewed spirit of American unity , to address the growing threat of terrorist - supportive nations and the vicious quest to attain weapons of mass destruction ;
What happened to the Southern Baptists ?
None of the resolutions having anything to do with war or the military issued by the Southern Baptists at their annual meeting since they began the practice in 1845 read anything like the resolutions on those subjects passed since 2002 .
Even when the United States was fighting “ real wars , ” the SBC was a voice for peace and against militarism .
During the midst of the so - called Civil War , although a resolution was passed in 1863 which expressed support for the Confederacy and the “ just and necessary war , ” the Southern Baptists also stated that they deplored “ the dreadful evils of the war ” and that they earnestly desired peace .
They further acknowledged that their “ sins have deserved the terrible calamities that God has sent upon us . ”
The Southern Baptists passed no resolutions related to the president , the war , or the military during the Spanish - American War or its aftermath .
In 1907 a resolution on world peace was passed which resolved :
That we look with devout gratitude to Almighty God upon the advance throughout the wide world of the cause of peace , for “ Peace hath her victories no less renowned than war ” ; and we desire and will pray for the day to hasten when all nations will settle their difficulties by arbitration rather than the resort to arms ; and the song of the angels at the advent of Christ be fully realized —
“ Peace on earth , good will to men . ”
In 1911 another resolution on peace was issued which not only stated that “ no good nor satisfactory reasons can be found for war between civilized and Christian nations , ” but also that “ war is a scourge , is wrong in principle and morally corrupting . ”
It was resolved that “ as Southern Baptists we will talk up peace and talk down war ; that we will pray God for universal peace . ”
After the United States entered World War I in 1917 , although the Southern Baptists passed a resolution which resolved that they “ pledge to our President and government , our prayers , our loyal and sacrificial support in the war in which we are engaged , ” the same resolution also stated that “ there has come upon earth a spirit which has plunged the nations that have been considered foremost in the lines of advancing civilization into a war more ruthless and more destructive of human life and human happiness than the world has ever before known . ”
Three things were then resolved :
That we deeply deplore this awful and sorrowful calamity which has caused these leading nations to drench the earth in the precious blood of their own loyal citizens .
That we reaffirm our faith in the righteousness of the Sermon on the Mount , and our confidence and infallible wisdom of him who has taught us to love our enemies , to bless them that curse us , and to do good to them that despitefully use and persecute us .
That we desire a stronger faith in the God who maketh wars to cease even unto the ends of the earth , and we shall rejoice if our own people , and all of every name who love the Lord Jesus Christ , in sincerity , shall find it in their hearts to pray for kings and for all that are in authority that we may live quiet and peaceable lives in all godliness and honesty .
After the Great War , a resolution on peace and disarmament was issued in 1921 which , after recognizing that “ the matter of the reconstruction of the world upon a permanent peace basis , is the supreme question of the present , ” resolved “ that , as a Convention of Christians , we are glad to join other bodies in an endorsement of this seemingly , practical movement toward disarmament with the hope and prayer that our torn and bleeding world may be restored to peace under the guidance and benediction of the Prince of Peace . ”
In 1929 a Social Service Committee Recommendation was adopted which resolved : That we approve and commend the action of the United States Senate in ratifying the multilateral Briand - Kellogg Peace Treaty ; that we rejoice in the outlawry of war embodied in this treaty ; that we condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies and we pledge our support to the government in this renouncement of war and in seeking by every worthy and legitimate means to promote and maintain permanent international peace .
In 1932 another Social Service Committee Recommendation was adopted which resolved :
That we oppose the continued large expenditure by the Government for military and naval equipment ; that we oppose military training in the schools and colleges , whether denominational or state ; and that we favor full and complete disarmament as rapidly as it can possibly be accomplished , except such armament as may be absolutely necessary for police duty within our own territory and on our borders .
Moreover , we reaffirm our hearty approval of the international agreement to renounce war as a national policy and our gratitude at the growing conviction among Christians of the incompatibility of war with the ethical principles of our Lord Jesus Christ .
In 1933 the first of several major peace resolutions was issued .
Among other things , it resolved :
That we pledge anew our devotion to the cause of International Good Will and World Peace and that we urge upon our pastors and people the obligations of their stewardship , both as the advocates and as the exemplars of the spirit of peace and good will toward all men .
That we again declare our unwavering belief that the United States Senate ought to ratify without further delay the protocol of the International Court of Justice , commonly known as the World Court , so that our government may have official representation on that Court and may contribute directly and officially to the maintenance and promotion of World Peace .
This has been recommended repeatedly by several Presidents , has been concurred in by each of the major political parties , and is demanded we believe by a great majority of the American people .
We can see no sound reason for continued delay by the Senate and we urge prompt action .
Another was issued in 1935 , which resolved :
That we hereby declare our unalterable opposition to war and our devotion to the maintenance of peace among the nations of the world .
That we approve of the investigation of the operations and methods of armament and munition manufacturers , conducted by a committee of the United States Senate headed by Senator Nye , with a view to formulating legislation which shall end the military racket and take the profit out of war ; we desire to see this investigation carried to completion and to see it result in appropriate and effective legislation .
A major statement on war , peace , and the military was published in 1936 .
Its five points were :
That we reaffirm our belief in and devotion to international peace and to the spirit of peace both for individuals and nations as embodied in the teachings and exemplified by the spirit of Christ our Lord .
That we reaffirm also our utter opposition to and hatred of war as the most inexcusable and insane policy that could be pursued by the nations of the earth in their dealings with one another , destructive not only of human life and treasure but of all that is high and worthy in human ideals and objectives .
That we pledge ourselves as citizens and Christians that we will not support our government in any war except such as might be necessary to repel invasion of our land or to preserve fundamental human rights and liberties .
That we can see no just ground for the enormous military and naval establishment now being built up and maintained by our government at the expense of approximately one billion dollars a year , and that we look with disfavor both upon this establishment as being in the nature of a challenge to other countries and contributing to the war spirit and upon the huge and unnecessary tax burden laid upon the shoulders of people already overburdened with taxation .
That we again express our belief that the Protocol of the Court of International Justice , commonly known as the World Court , with the reservations already made by the United States Senate , should be ratified by the Senate and that we all give our influence to that end .
In a 1937 resolution on war and peace , it was first stated :
That we believe that the great world powers having outlawed war by treaty and having committed themselves to the policy of the peaceful settlement of all international disagreements can and ought to find solution of all their problems without the arbitrament of arms .
As citizens of the United States we will do everything possible to keep our nation out of war , and we reaffirm our opposition to all aggressive war at home or aboard .
And then it was resolved , regarding international relationships :
We recognize that a warless world is the Christian ideal and that we Christians should throw all our weight and power into the balance for peace .
That we petition the President of the United States to consider the advisability of calling a conference of world powers to consider the possibility of disarmament , believing that this would do much to relieve strained international relationships which are endangering world peace at the present time .
A resolution was issued in 1939 that expressed a “ deep sense of regret and dissatisfaction with the large part American manufacturers and merchants are having in the revolting , inhuman and barbaric invasion and spoliation of China by Japan . ”
The messengers to the 1939 SBC annual meeting were “ especially concerned over the fact that Americans are sharing so largely in this unholy work and without interference by the American Government . ”
The members of the SBC churches were enjoined to “ write to their representatives in both Houses of Congress , earnestly urging action to stop American participation in this war of conquest . ”
And regarding international relations , the messengers pledged themselves “ anew to the spirit of peace and to the cultivation of that spirit among our people and in our relation to all other peoples . ”
It was even suggested that SBC churches set up and maintain peace committees “ for the dissemination of information and the cultivation of the spirit of peace . ”
After World War II had begun in Europe , a strong anti-war statement was issued in June of 1940 which , among other things , resolved :
That we hereby express our utter abhorrence of war as an instrument of International policy and our profound conviction and belief that all International differences could and of a right ought to be composed by peaceful diplomatic exchanges , and , when these fail , by arbitration .
That the continued sacrifice of human treasure and human blood in International war is a wanton and wicked waste for which nations , and particularly their rulers who declare and prosecute war , must give an account to the All Wise and All Just Judge of all the earth .
That the extremes of human slaughter to which the present mechanized war has gone staggers human belief and is a sad illustration of how all scientific knowledge and development , which should contribute only to human welfare , can be debased and devoted to human destruction .
That while we acknowledge the right of national self - defense , our utter abhorrence of war and its attendant evils compels us to voice the conviction that even a defensive war should be waged only as a last resort after every effort has been made to reach a settlement of international problems in fairness to all the nations involved .
Also included was a lengthy statement about supporting conscientious objectors : Baptists have always believed in liberty of conscience and have honored men who were willing to brave adverse public opinion for the sake of conscientious scruples .
A considerable number of members of churches of our Convention , through their interpretation of the moral teachings of Christ , have reached the position of a conscientious objection to war that prohibits them from bearing arms .
The Convention ought to accord to them the right of their convictions as it accords to others the right to differ from them , and ought to protect them in that right to the extent of its ability .
Therefore ,
Be it RESOLVED , That the Convention go on record as recognizing such right of a conscientious objection , and that the Convention instruct the Executive Committee to provide facilities for their registration with the denomination , in order that the Executive Committee may be able to make accurate certification to the government concerning them at any time it should be called for .
Included in this 1940 resolution was also this notable closing statement : Because war is contrary to the mind and spirit of Christ , we believe that no war should be identified with the will of Christ .
Our churches should not be made agents of war propaganda or recruiting stations .
War thrives on and is perpetuated by hysteria , falsehood , and hate and the church has a solemn responsibility to make sure there is no black out of love in time of war .
When men and nations are going mad with hate it is the duty of Christ ’s ministers and His churches to declare by spirit , word , and conduct the love of God in all men .
In time of war it is our Christian responsibility to prepare for peace .
We would , therefore , urge our churches to think and work toward a Christian social order in which a just and lasting peace can be realized .
On the eve of U.S. involvement in World War II , the longest peace resolution the Southern Baptists ever published was issued in 1941 .
At this meeting in Birmingham , Alabama , it was resolved :
That we declare our abhorrence of war and all its insanity and brutality .
We are a peace - loving people and we know of no issues , national or international , which could not be settled in fairness and equity by the orderly processes of civilized society if only the leaders of the nations were willing to practice the principles of justice , truth , and righteousness .
We sincerely believe that the rank and file of our denomination , even as the rank and file of our nation and the other nations as well , much prefer that all international disputes and conflicting interests be composed by the processes of peace rather than by the arbitrament of war .
That with one accord we turn to Almighty God , through Christ his Son , in humble petition for the forgiveness of whatever measure of corporate guilt may be ours with regard to the present international conflict , and , that our nation , through repentance and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ may be so yielded to the Divine Plan , that we may be effectively used in helping to bring to the nations of the world a just and righteous peace .
That we invite the membership of our churches and all Christian believers throughout the world , to pray daily at a given hour , both in public and in private places , to the end that such a “ just and righteous peace ” may be speedily achieved .
The messengers to this SBC annual meeting made a pledge as Christian patriots to pray earnestly unto our God and Saviour that a righteous peace may soon be granted unto all the warring nations : that our own nation may be spared the horrors of war , if that be the divine will , and that our nation may be used as a mighty instrument of peace and truth and righteousness and brotherhood ; that Almighty God will , in the power of his might , take charge of the nations and overrule their folly and sin to the praise of his great and holy name .
It was also recognized that “ there may be honest differences of opinion about the issue in the present conflict , but we are deeply resolved that any difference shall not cause any breach in our fellowship . ”
Contrast this attitude with that of the modern Christian Right .
In some circles , if one opposes Bush and his war then he is said to part of the “ blame - America - first crowd , ” and ridiculed with epithets like traitor , defeatist , defeatocrat , appeaser , communist , liberal , Quaker , pacifist , and peacenik .
Because this resolution mentioned the evils that were then occurring in the world , desired the U.S. government “ to work out the wisest and most effective means to aid England , our national ally , in this titanic struggle , ” and urged the government “ to quicken rather than slacken all measures needed to strengthen the defenses of the Western Hemisphere against all kinds of aggression from any and all powers which seek to undermine and to overthrow our peaceful and democratic ways of life , ” a clarifying statement was added disavowing militarism :
“ The aforesaid resolution may be misinterpreted by some as a committal to the principle of militarism , Therefore , be it resolved that the aforesaid resolution , in no way commits the Southern Baptist Convention to an approval of war , as a recognized principle in settling international differences . ”
Although the United States entered World War II at the end of 1941 , the Southern Baptists throughout the war issued no resolutions expressing support for the president or the troops .
Surprisingly , there was no resolution having anything to do with the war that was published in 1942 and 1945 .
In 1943 , although it was acknowledged that “ Southern Baptists as loyal citizens of the United States are cooperating and participating in all branches of the present war , including the Army , the Navy and the Air Corps , ” it was also stated that “ the prosecution of the war for the maintenance , perpetuation and extension of the four freedoms , well known and enjoyed by American citizens in our Constitutional Democracy , may not accomplish the purposes for which it is fought , unless a just and righteous peace follows the termination of the war . ”
In 1944 , instead of expressing support for the troops , the Convention resolved to support conscientious objectors working in civilian camps under the supervision of the National Service Board .
Between World War II and the Vietnam War , the Southern Baptists issued numerous resolutions that advocated world peace , reaffirmed the basic incompatibility of war with the moral principles and purposes of Christianity , denounced the moral conditions in American military camps abroad , condemned militarism , expressed support for conscientious objectors and exempting religious teachers from conscription , and expressed opposition to peacetime conscription , not only in the United States , but worldwide .
After the escalation of U.S. involvement in Vietnam , peace resolutions were issued during the years from 1966 to 1973 .
And instead of putting out resolutions during the Vietnam years in appreciation of the president and the troops , support for conscientious objectors was reaffirmed .
In 1969 a resolution was issued which stated that “ those who for reasons of religious conviction are opposed to military service should be exempted from forced military conscription . ”
In 1972 the Southern Baptists acknowledged support for “ both our youth who , as a matter of conscience , choose to participate in war and those who , as a matter of conscience , object to participation in war , extending them assistance in exercising their rights and privileges as permitted under law . ”
The Southern Baptists issued another peace resolution in 1974 .
In 1977 an anti-torture resolution was issued that condemned “ any use of torture as a sin against God and a crime against humanity . ”
It was further affirmed that “ torture demonstrates the very opposite of love and violates the will of God revealed in Jesus Christ . ”
It is too bad that no such resolution was produced after the Abu Ghraib scandal .
Various resolutions supporting arms control were issued by the Southern Baptists from 1978 to 1983 .
Things began to change in 1991 .
You will recall that that was the year in which the United States invaded Iraq the first time .
Although the war had ended long before the SBC annual meeting in June , a resolution was still issued which resolved :
That we the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in Atlanta , Georgia , June 4 - 6 , 1991 , commend and salute the President of the United States as Commander - in - Chief of the Armed Forces , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , the commanders in the field , and the men and women of every military rank for their preparedness and resolve , their commitment to duty and to country , their fortitude in the face of danger , and their overwhelming victory in Operation Desert Storm ;
That we especially honor those who died in the conflict for their ultimate sacrifice in the cause of freedom and that we offer our heartfelt sympathy and gratitude to their families ;
That we express reverent thanksgiving to Almighty God , the Judge of all nations , who is mightier than all armies and who alone is able to save , for His guidance , His mercy , and His blessing on our nation in Operation Desert Storm .
What happened to the Southern Baptists ?
Their overwhelming support for the U.S. - initiated Persian Gulf
War shows that they fully accepted the government ’s new enemy after the end of the Cold War : Saddam Hussein .
Thus began their descent down the slippery slope of militarism , presidential aggrandizement , and statolatry .
The transformation was made complete in 2001 .
What happened to the Southern Baptists ?
The events of September 11 , 2001 , apparently “ changed everything . ”
Yet , after the fiasco that is the war in Iraq has been scrupulously exposed many times over , no change in opinion has been forthcoming from the SBC .
Instead , the man most responsible for the war is welcomed with applause and ovation .
But there is one thing that the events of September 11th did n’t change — the reckless , belligerent , and meddling U.S. foreign policy responsible for the blowback we suffered on that date , and will inevitably experience again since our militaristic , interventionist foreign policy likewise shows no sign of changing .

Lieberman blames Iran for Iraq attacks , asks if invasion should be authorized Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday September 11 , 2007
Print This Email This Update : Lieberman asks if Iraq war should be expanded ' in Iranian territory ' Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman ( I - CT ) , among the Senate 's fiercest hawks , blamed Iran for the deaths of " hundreds of American troops , " and claimed the US has evidence that Iran is training insurgents outside Tehran before sending them to Iraq .
He asked whether the US should expand its invasion into Iran .
" Is it time to give you authority , in pursuit of your mission in Iraq , to pursue those Iranian Quds Force operations in Iranian territory , in order to protect Americas troops in Iraq , " Lieberman ( I - CT ) asked at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee .
Gen. David Petraeus , the commander of US troops in Iraq , demurred , but did not shoot down the idea of an expansion into Iran .
" I think that really the Multinational Force Iraq should just focus on Iraq and that any kinds of operations outside the borders of Iraq would rightly be overseen by the Central Command , " Petraeus said .
Obama Criticizes Bush ' kicking ass ' assessment of Iraq , says hearings should n't be on 9/11 Sen .
Barack Obama , who has been trying to bolster his national security credentials as he runs for president , demanded clarification from the top US military and diplomatic officials overseeing Iraq as to when troops could begin returning home , and he criticized the decision to have them testify on the sixth anniversary of the nation 's worst terror attack .
" I think that we should not have had this discussion on 9/11 , or 9/10 or 9/12 , because I think it perpetuates this notion that somehow the original decision to go into Iraq was directly related to the attacks on 9/11 , " the Illinois Democrat said .
" It is to suggest that if the American people and the Congress had understood then that after devoting $ 1 trillion -- which is what this thing optimistically will end up having cost -- thousands of American lives , the creation of an environment in which al Qaeda in Iraq could operate because it did n't exist prior to our invasion ...
I think most people would have said , ' That 's a bad deal . ' "
Obama said the administration has " set the bar so low that modest improvement in what was a completely chaotic situation ... is considered success , and it's not , " and the United States has found itself in a situation where " there are no good options . "
" There has been no acknowledgment of that on the part of this administration , " Obama said .
" So that we have the president in Australia suggesting somehow that we are , as was stated before , kicking A - S - S. "
( Obama spelled out the offending word rather than repeat the president 's overheard profanity to be broadcast live on C - SPAN . )
The first - term senator said he did not believe that decreases in violence in Anbar Province , which Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker cited ad nauseam , " has anything to do with the surge , " and he accused the pair of asking " limitless patience " from the Iraqi people .
He asked the two witnesses , who were appearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , what conditions in Iraq would be necessary to begin withdrawing troops , but he acknowledged that his own comments consumed much of his alloted seven minutes for questioning .
Crocker did not offer many specifics beyond his previous answers , but he said war planners would be looking for maintained reductions in violence and local political responses such as those in Anbar , where Sunni leaders who had been insurgents were joining US troops in fighting al Qaeda in Iraq .

I ’ve been watching the CouchDB database project since it has started .
It ’s the pet project of programmer Damien Katz .
I was excited to read an update today announcing that it will be accessible via a RESTful JSON API and the query language for CouchDB will be JavaScript .
How cool is that ?!
CouchDB is not a relational database but rather a distributed document database .
Instead of inserting a row of column values into a table , you save a document , with any number of named fields and values ( now represented as JSON objects ) into the database where it exists in a kind of addressable pool .
Documents can be created , retrieved , updated and deleted without having to worry about schema - design as there is none .
If you do require a little structure you can create views .
A view is a dynamic structure that acts like a search query , providing a virtual table of documents matching the query .
The query , previously expressed in a proprietary language , is now a JavaScript function which is used to determine which documents to include in the view .
Because the views are completely virtual you can have as many as you like and you can add or remove them at any time without touching any of your data .
Views are indexed and regularly updated to keep tabs with the state of the documents in the database .
CouchDB has some other impressive attributes ; it ’s fully ACID compliant , has a security model built in , bi-directional incremental replication and conflict resolution .
But what is it good for ?
Well the documentation is quick to point out this is not a replacement for relational databases but it is well suited to document style applications like blogs , document management , bug tracking , forums and so on .
The CouchDB wiki says :
With very little database work , it is possible to build a distributed document management application with granular security and full revision histories .
CouchDB is still only in Alpha , but there are already demos available and client libraries written in PHP , Ruby and others .
You can also download the source code under the GPL license .
I think CouchDB will be one to watch !
When you ’re managing a team of programmers , one of the first things you have to learn to get right is task allocation .
That ’s just a five - dollar word for giving people things to do .
It ’s known colloquially as “ file dumping ” in Hebrew ( because you dump files in peoples ’ laps ) .
And how you decide which files to dump in which laps is one of the areas where you can get incredible productivity benefits if you do it right .
Do it wrong , and you can create one of those gnarly situations where nobody gets anything accomplished and everybody complains that “ nothing ever gets done around here . ”
Since this site is for programmers , I ’m going to warm up your brains a little bit with a programming problem .
Suppose you have two separate computations to perform , A and B. Each computation requires 10 seconds of CPU time .
You have one CPU which , for the sake of this problem , does n’t have anything else in the queue .
On our CPU , multitasking is optional .
So you can either do these computations one after the other …
Sequential Processing
Computation A Computation B 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
… or , you can multitask .
If you multitask , on this particular CPU , tasks run for 1 second at a time , and a task switch takes no time at all .
Multitasking
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
Which would you rather do ?
Most people ’s gut reaction is that multitasking is better .
In both cases , you have to wait 20 seconds to get both of your answers .
But think about how long it takes to get the results to each computation .
In both cases , the results of Computation B ( shown in blue ) take 20 seconds to arrive .
But look at Computation A . With multitasking , its results take 19 seconds to arrive … yet with sequential processing they are ready in only 10 seconds .
In other words , in this nice contrived example , the average time per computation is lower ( 15 seconds rather than 19.5 seconds ) when you do sequential processing rather than multitasking .
( Actually , it ’s not such a contrived example — it ’s based on a real problem Jared had to solve at work ) .
Method Computation
A takes Computation B takes Average Sequential 10 seconds 20 seconds 15 Multitasking 19 seconds 20 seconds 19.5
Earlier I said that “ a task switch takes no time at all . ”
Actually , on real CPUs , a task switch takes a little bit of time … basically enough time to save out the state of the CPU registers and load the CPU registers for the other task .
Realistically , this is as close to negligible as possible .
But to make life interesting , let ’s imagine that task switches take half a second .
Now things look even worse :
Method Computation
A takes Computation B takes Average Sequential 10 seconds 20 + 1 task switch =
20.5 seconds 15.25 Multitasking 19 + 18 task switches =
28 seconds 20 + 19 task switches = 29.5 seconds 28.75
Now … just humor me , I know this is silly … what if task switches take a whole minute ?
Method Computation
A takes Computation B takes Average Sequential 10 seconds 20 + 1 task switch =
80 seconds 45 seconds Multitasking 19 + 18 task switches =
1099 seconds 20 + 19 task switches = 1160 seconds almost 19 minutes !
The longer a task switch takes , the worse the multitasking penalty .
That , in and of itself , is not so earth shaking , is it ?
Pretty soon I ’m going to be getting irate email from morons accusing me of being “ against ” multitasking .
“ Do you want to go back to the days of DOS when you had to exit WordPerfect to run 1 - 2 - 3 ? ” they will ask me .
But that ’s not my point .
I just want you to agree with me that in this kind of example :
a ) sequential processing gets you results faster on average , and b ) the longer it takes to task switch , the bigger the penalty you pay for multitasking .
OK , back to the more interesting topic of managing humans , not CPUs .
The trick here is that when you manage programmers , specifically , task switches take a really , really , really long time .
That ’s because programming is the kind of task where you have to keep a lot of things in your head at once .
The more things you remember at once , the more productive you are at programming .
A programmer coding at full throttle is keeping zillions of things in their head at once : everything from names of variables , data structures , important APIs , the names of utility functions that they wrote and call a lot , even the name of the subdirectory where they store their source code .
If you send that programmer to Crete for a three week vacation , they will forget it all .
The human brain seems to move it out of short - term RAM and swaps it out onto a backup tape where it takes forever to retrieve .
How long ?
Well , my software company recently dropped what we were doing ( developing a software product codenamed CityDesk ) to help a client with a bit of an emergency situation for three weeks .
When we got back to the office , it seemed to take another three weeks to get back to full speed on CityDesk .
On the individual level — have you ever noticed that you can assign one job to one person , and they ’ll do a great job , but if you assign two jobs to that person , they wo n’t really get anything done ?
They ’ll either do one job well and neglect the other , or they ’ll do both jobs so slowly you feel like slugs have more zip .
That ’s because programming tasks take so long to task switch .
I feel like when I have two programming projects on my plate at once , the task switch time is something like 6 hours .
In an 8 - hour day , that means multitasking reduces my productivity to 2 hours per day .
Pretty dismal .
As it turns out , if you give somebody two things to work on , you should be grateful if they “ starve ” one task and only work on one , because they ’re going to get more stuff done and finish the average task sooner .
In fact , the real lesson from all this is that you should never let people work on more than one thing at once .
Make sure they know what it is .
Good managers see their responsibility as removing obstacles so that people can focus on one thing and really get it done .
When emergencies come up , think about whether you can handle it yourself before you delegate it to a programmer who is deeply submersed in a project .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Sen. Barack Obama announced on Sunday he had raised $ 32.5 million for his presidential campaign in the past three months , the biggest quarterly fund - raising for any Democrat ever in a pre-election year .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
The Illinois senator said more than 154,000 donors had contributed to his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in the April - June period , bringing his total donor list to more than 258,000 .
Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York led all Democrats in the first quarter of the year with the former first lady edging out Obama , $ 26 million to $ 25 million .
Only Republican President George W. Bush has raised more in the year before a presidential election .
Clinton , who leads Obama in national opinion polls , had not immediately released her figures but her campaign last week said she expected to raise $ 27 million to $ 28 million in the second quarter .
Candidates for president must report their fund - raising activity every three months .
The second quarter ended at midnight on Saturday .
Donors can give up to $ 2,300 to finance a candidate ’s primary race and another $ 2,300 for the general election if the candidate gets the party nomination .
Obama said of his $ 32.5 million he raised this period , $ 31 million was for the primary race against Clinton and six other Democrats .
“ We now have hundreds of thousands of Americans who are ready to demand health care for all , energy independence and an end to this war in Iraq , ” Obama said in a statement .
“ That ’s the kind of movement that can change the special interest - driven politics in Washington and transform our country . ”
With the November 2008 elections still 16 months away and the first primary votes more than six months from now , fund - raising has become a political barometer of how candidates are faring .
A strong performance can provide a spark for the campaign and bring in more support and donors .
A less successful effort can raise questions about a candidate ’s staying power and whether his or her campaign can last .
The other Democratic and Republican candidates will come forward with their totals over the next couple of weeks .
Former Sen. John Edwards , the Democratic vice presidential candidate in 2004 , said he had reached his goal of $ 9 million in the second quarter .
But that would fall short of the $ 14 million he reported the last time .
While not exactly related to parallel programming , I am so sick of hearing this : Moore ’s Law no longer holds !
Clock speeds are no longer increasing , therefore the world is going parallel !
I have shortly commented on this a couple of weeks ago .
You can sometimes read it in blogs or hear it in conversations .
And while the second sentence is actually true , the first one is not and comes from a severe misunderstanding of what Moore actually said and meant .
This article comes to the rescue of all the poor victims to this misunderstanding :-) .
So let ’s approach this the wrong way around and see what many people think Moore ’s Law says :
The clock speed of chips doubles every 24 month .
This misunderstanding is so common , because that ’s how the chips actually did behave for quite some time in the past .
Those times are gone now , as heat problems have forced the chip makers to abandon the MHz - race .
The sentence in itself builds on a severe misunderstanding – the one that clock speed equals computing power .
As could be observed for the Pentium 4 architecture , this is not the case .
Computing power is of course not merely dependent on how many clock cycles you manage to do each second , but also on how much work can be done in each clock cycle .
Which heavily depends on your architecture – but since GHz are so much easier to work with for the marketing department , this part of the equation used to be dropped .
Anyways , this is the past and history .
Many people know this by now .
Another commonly heard version of Moore ’s Law is this :
The computing power of chips doubles every 24 month .
Seems logical , right ?
Computing power is what counts and Mister Moore must have been talking about that .
While this version is better than the first ( for the reasons stated above ) , it is still not accurate .
Does the computing power double when you have two cores on a chip ?
Depends on your problem , right ?
And for most problems the answer is unfortunately : no ( read up on Amdahl ’s Law if you do n’t know from the top of your head why that ’s the case ) .
Therefore this interpretation of Moore ’s Law does not hold up in court anymore as well .
Which needs not concern us , really , because it is not what Moore said , either :-) .
I am not going to hold you off ( or bore you 🙂 ) any longer , but instead tell you what Moore ’s Law really is about :
The density of transistors on chips doubles every 24 month .
Actually , thats the short version and easy to comprehend version , if you want to know what he has really said , you need to look here :
Reduced cost is one of the big attractions of integrated electronics , and the cost advantage continues to increase as the technology evolves toward the production of larger and larger circuit functions on a single semiconductor substrate .
For simple circuits , the cost per component is nearly inversely proportional to the number of components , the result of the equivalent piece of semiconductor in the equivalent package containing more components .
But as components are added , decreased yields more than compensate for the increased complexity , tending to raise the cost per component .
Thus there is a minimum cost at any given time in the evolution of the technology .
At present , it is reached when 50 components are used per circuit .
But the minimum is rising rapidly while the entire cost curve is falling ( see graph below ) .
If we look ahead five years , a plot of costs suggests that the minimum cost per component might be expected in circuits with about 1,000 components per circuit ( providing such circuit functions can be produced in moderate quantities . )
In 1970 , the manufacturing cost per component can be expected to be only a tenth of the present cost .
The complexity for minimum component costs has increased at a rate of roughly a factor of two per year ( see graph on next page ) .
Certainly over the short term this rate can be expected to continue , if not to increase .
Over the longer term , the rate of increase is a bit more uncertain , although there is no reason to believe it will not remain nearly constant for at least 10 years .
That means by 1975 , the number of components per integrated circuit for minimum cost will be 65,000 .
But since this is more difficult to work with , I am going to stick to the easy version above , which basically means the same thing .
And it is still true today .
All that has changed is the way these massive amounts of transistors are used .
Now they are being invested into more cores on a single chip .
I have been told by people working for the chip makers that they do n’t believe this law will last forever , but that they expect it to be true for a couple more years .
And who knows what kinds of chips we will be having in a couple of years – think quantum computing or stuff like that .
In the end I am going to ask a little favor from you : the next time you hear or read somewhere that Moore ’s Law is dying , please leave a comment with a link to this article .
Or to the Wikipedia one .
Or this FAQ on news.com .
Or just kindly explain what I have just told you here , so we can finally get rid of this misconception .
Thank You !
I play with open - source OCR ( Optical Character Recognition ) packages periodically .
My last foray was a few years ago when I bought a tablet PC and wanted to scan in some of my course books so I could carry just one thing to school .
I tried every package I could find , and none of them worked well enough even to consider using .
I ended up using the commercial version of Adobe Acrobat , which allows you to use the scanned page as the visual ( preserving things like equations in math books ) , but it applies OCR to the text so you can search .
It ended up being quite handy , and I was a little sad that I was incapable of getting any kind of result with open - source offerings .
Admittedly , the problem is very hard .
Font variations , image noise and alignment problems make it extremely difficult to design an algorithm that can translate the image of text into actual text reliably .
Recently , I was looking again and found a project called Tesseract .
Tesseract is the product of HP research efforts that occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s .
HP and UNLV placed it on SourceForge in 2005 , and it is in the process of migrating to Google Code ( see Resources ) .
It currently is lacking features , such as layout recognition and multicolumn support ; however , the most difficult part , the actual character recognition , is superb .
How to Install Version 1.03 was the latest version at the time of this writing , and the build and install process still needed a little work .
Also , integration with libtiff ( which would allow you to use compressed TIFF as input ) was configured by default , but it was not working properly .
You might try configuring it with libtiff , as that would allow compressed TIFF image input : # ./configure
If you later find that it does n't recognize text , reconfigure it without libtiff : # ./configure --without-libtiff
The build is done as expected : # make Configure for version 1.03 also indicated that make install was broken .
I managed to figure out the basics of installation by trial and error .
First , copy the executable from ccmain / tesseract to a directory on your path ( for example , / usr / local / bin ) : # cp ccmain / tesseract /usr / local / bin
Then , copy the tessdata directory and all of its contents to the same place as the executable ( for example , /usr / local / bin/tessdata / ... ) : # cp -r tessdata /usr/ local/bin/tessdata
Finally , make sure your shell PATH includes the former ( /usr/local / bin ) .
How to Use First , you need access to a scanner or scanned pages .
Sane is available with most Linux distributions and has a nice GUI interface called xsane .
( I discuss more on scanning near the end of this article . )
Tesseract has no layout analysis , so it cannot detect multicolumn formats or figures .
Also , the broken libtiff support means it can read only uncompressed TIFF .
This means you must do a little work on your scanned document to get the best results .
Fortunately , the steps are very simple ; the most common ones can be automated , and the results are well worth it .
This is what you need to do :
Use a threshold function to drop lighting variations and convert the image to black and white .
Erase any figures or graphics ( optional , but if you skip this step the recognizer will give a bunch of garbled text in those areas ) .
Break any multicolumn text into smaller , single - column images .
I recommend using a graphics program , such as The GIMP , to get a feel for what needs to be done .
The most important step is the first one , as it drastically will improve the accuracy of the OCR .
The GIMP has a great function that easily can remove lighting variations in all but the worst cases .
First , go to the Image → Mode menu and make sure the image is in RGB or Grayscale mode .
Thresholding will not work on indexed images .
Next , select the menu Tools →Color Tools →Threshold .
This tool allows you to drop pixels that are lighter than a specified cutoff value , and it converts all others to black .
A pop-up ( Figure 1 ) lets you select the threshold .
Make sure image preview is turned on in order to get an idea of how it affects the image .
Slide the threshold thumb left and right to choose the cutoff between white and black .
You may not be able to get rid of all of the uneven lighting without corrupting the text .
Find a good - looking result for the text , then erase the rest of the noise with a paint tool .
The transition from the first part to the second part in Figure 2 shows a typical result of this step .
Figure 1 . Threshold dialog in The GIMP .
Slide the triangle left and right to choose what pixels should be white and what pixels should be black .
You should experiment and zoom in over a portion of the image while you play with thresholding , so you can see things closer to the pixel level .
This lets you see more of what Tesseract will see and gives you a better feeling for how to get the best results .
If you can't recognize the characters , Tesseract surely wo n't .
This page had handwritten notes , underlining and a section of lighting that threshold could not get rid of without compromising the rest of the image .
Use a brush to paint over any easy - to - fix areas .
I would not recommend spending much time on cases where the extraneous information ( figure , noise and so on ) has some distance from the text ;
Tesseract might insert a few garbled characters , but those are usually quicker to fix in a text editor .
The resulting image should look something like the third part of Figure 2 . Figure 2 .
Zoomed view of image preparation , from left to right : the original scanned image , the image after applying threshold , and the image after applying threshold and some manual cleanup .
Now , switch the image to indexed mode ( using the menu selection Image → Mode →Indexed ) , and choose black and white ( one - bit palette ) .
Also , make sure dithering is off .
Save the image as an uncompressed TIFF image , and you are ready to do recognition .
The recognition part is easy : $ tesseract image .
tif result
The third argument is the base name of the output file .
Tesseract adds a txt extension automatically , so in this example , the recognized text would be in result .
txt .
The underlining in this example ended up significantly affecting the OCR .
A few of the lines were recognized moderately well , but two of them were completely unintelligible after processing .
This underscores the importance of using a clean source if possible .
Manually removing the underlining drastically improved recognition , but it took more time than simply entering the text manually .
How Well Does Tesseract Work ?
I certainly wanted to do some experiments that would give me an idea of the power of Tesseract .
I also wanted to compare those results to another open - source OCR system : ocrad .
I started off by running some tests to see how well Tesseract would do .
My initial test took a 200d pi screen capture of text that included bold and italic fonts .
Obviously , the screen capture was completely free from any kind of noise or error introduced by a physical scanner .
Tesseract performed flawlessly , recognizing 100 % of the characters .
It even got the spacing right .
Unfortunately , ocrad did not fare as well .
It missed several spaces ( causing words to join erroneously ) , and it missed several letters .
The overall recognition rate for ocrad on a perfect input was 95 % .
Next , I decided to try some torture tests to see how well Tesseract would do under more adverse conditions .
I have used Adobe Acrobat to do OCR on scanned documents , and it requires 150 DPI .
It manages to fix things like varying lighting ( as we did in GIMP earlier ) and linear distortion ( for example , due to book bindings pulling the edge of the paper away from the scanner ) .
It also handled skewed pages where the page was not aligned well on the scanner bed .
So , I found a 72dpi scanned image that contained most of these glitches .
Note that 72dpi is half the resolution that Acrobat will even try .
The left margin was dark gray and bled into the letters , and the left edges of the lines were bent .
The original image was not skewed .
I tried the unaltered image and the results were poor .
I then used GIMP thresholding to remove the lighting variance and saved it as described above .
I did nothing to correct the bent lines , nor did I increase the dpi in any way .
To my surprise , Tesseract managed a 97 % recognition rate !
Many of the errors were mistaking e as c ( which were difficult for me to distinguish in the original image ) , and many of the errors were around the areas where the worst linear distortion occurred .
Next , I used The GIMP to rotate the image as far as I could without clipping the text .
This corresponds to someone slapping pages on a scanner with little regard for alignment .
Surprisingly , Tesseract still managed a 96 % recognition rate .
In fact , the rotation inadvertently helped with the linear distortion , and the recognition errors were less clustered than before .
Now I was curious as to how ocrad would fare .
It did not fare well .
In fact , it failed miserably .
ocrad did more poorly on the best quality input than Tesseract did on the worst .
The results and comparison are shown in Table 1 .
Table 1 . Tesseract vs. ocrad Results
Test conditions ocrad Tesseract 200dpi , very clean , includes italics / bold 95 % 100 % 72dpi , black and white , clean 0 % 97 % 72dpi with minor linear distortion 0 % 97 % 72dpi , minor linear distortion , and skewed 2 degrees 0 % 96 %
Getting the Best Results
The tests above indicate that the recommended inputs I have seen for Acrobat are quite sane .
I recommend scanning your documents at 150d pi or higher .
You also might try putting your scanner in black - and - white mode ; the threshold routines in your scanner actually may give better results than the manual thresholding described in this article .
Perfect alignment does not seem to affect recognition rates drastically , but distortion due to book bindings did seem to cause some minor problems .
Many professional scanning companies remove the pages from the binding if possible .
Automating the Process
The GIMP gives you very fine control over image editing , but if you have a consistent scanning environment and a lot of pages , you really will want to automate the image cleanup as much as possible .
I recommend using Netpbm for this purpose , preferably version 10.34 or later , as those versions come with a more powerful threshold filter .
Unfortunately , this is not considered a super - stable version , so many systems will have an older version .
If you are using an older version , you might get acceptable results with a pipeline of commands like this : $ tifftopnm < scanned_image .tif | \ pamditherbw - threshold - value 0.8 | \ pamtopnm | pnmtotiff > result .tif
This chain of four commands reduces the color palette to black and white and saves the result as an uncompressed TIFF image .
The number passed to the - value parameter of pamditherbw defaults to 0.5 , and can range from 0 to 1 , and it corresponds to the slider used earlier in The GIMP .
In this case , higher numbers make the image darker .
Netpbm 10.34 and higher includes a more - advanced threshold utility , pamthreshold , which can do a better job on images where the lighting varies over the page .
In this case , the command chain would be : $ tifftopnm < scanned_image .tif | \ pamthreshold - local=20x20 | \ pamtopnm | pnmtotiff > result .tif
There are several alternatives for options of pamthreshold .
The - local option allows you to specify a rectangular area that is used around each pixel to determine local lighting conditions in an attempt to adapt to changing lighting conditions in the image .
You also may want to try : $ tifftopnm < scanned_image.tif | \ pamthreshold - threshold=0.8 | pamtopnm | pnmtotiff > result.tif
to get results similar to the older dither utility .
See the Netpbm documentation for more details .
If your input images are in a format other than TIFF , you can , of course , substitute the appropriate Netpbm tool ( such as jpegtopnm ) in the pipeline : $ jpegtopnm < scanned_image.jpg | \ pamthreshold - threshold =0.8 | pamtopnm | pnmtotiff > result .
tif
Netpbm also includes utilities that allow you to clip out portions of an image .
Note that most multicolumn formats are very consistent in positioning the columns , which means you can automate the translation of multicolumn text pretty easily as well .
For example , if you have a two - column article scanned at 200dpi , you can use The GIMP to locate the x coordinates of the column boundaries .
Say the first column starts at about 200 and ends at 700 , and the second column starts at 800 and ends at 1200 .
You could add the following to your processing pipeline : $ tifftopnm < input.tif | \ pamcut - left 150 - right 750 | ... pnmtotiff > output_left.tif $ tifftopnm < input.tif | \ pamcut - left 750 - right 1250 | ... pnmtotiff > output_right.tif
and automate the extraction of the columns .
Place the combination in a shell script with some looping , and you can process a lot of pages very quickly .
FORTUNE EXCLUSIVE : Editor - at - large Carol Loomis speaks with Buffett on why he sped up his plan to give away his money and why he chose the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .
NEW YORK ( FORTUNE Magazine ) --
Coming from you , this plan is pretty startling .
Up to now you have n't been famous for giving away money .
In fact , you 've been roundly criticized now and then for not giving it away .
So let 's cut to the obvious question :
Are you ill ?
No , absolutely not .
I feel terrific , and when I had my last physical , in October , my doctor gave me a clean bill of health .
Then what 's going on here ?
Does your change in plans have something to do with Susie 's death ?
Yes , it does .
Susie was two years younger than I , and women usually live longer than men .
She and I always assumed that she would inherit my Berkshire stock and be the one who oversaw the distribution of our wealth to society , where both of us had always said it would go .
And Susie would have enjoyed overseeing the process .
She was a little afraid of it , in terms of scaling up .
But she would have liked doing it , and would have been very good at it .
And she would really have stepped on the gas .
By that you mean that she always wanted to give away more money , faster , than you did ?
Yes , she said that many times .
As for me , I always had the idea that philanthropy was important today , but would be equally important in one year , ten years , 20 years , and the future generally .
And someone who was compounding money at a high rate , I thought , was the better party to be taking care of the philanthropy that was to be done 20 years out , while the people compounding at a lower rate should logically take care of the current philanthropy .
But that theory also happened to fit what you wanted to do , right ?
( He laughs , hard . )
And how !
No question about that .
I was having fun - and still am having fun - doing what I do .
And for a while I also thought in terms of control of Berkshire .
I had bought effective control of Berkshire in the early 1970s , using $ 15 million I got when I disbanded Buffett Partnership .
And I had very little money - considerably less than $ 1 million - outside of Berkshire .
My salary was $ 50,000 a year .
So if I had engaged in significant philanthropy back then , I would have had to give away shares of Berkshire .
I had n't bought those to immediately give them away .
Even so , you and Susie set up the Buffett Foundation way back in the 1960s , which means you obviously expected to be giving away money sometime .
What was your thinking back then ?
Well , when we got married in 1952 , I told Susie I was going to be rich .
That was n't going to be because of any special virtues of mine or even because of hard work , but simply because I was born with the right skills in the right place at the right time .
I was wired at birth to allocate capital and was lucky enough to have people around me early on - my parents and teachers and Susie - who helped me to make the most of that .
In any case , Susie did n't get very excited when I told her we were going to get rich .
She either did n't care or did n't believe me - probably both , in fact .
But to the extent we did amass wealth , we were totally in sync about what to do with it - and that was to give it back to society .
In that , we agreed with Andrew Carnegie , who said that huge fortunes that flow in large part from society should in large part be returned to society .
In my case , the ability to allocate capital would have had little utility unless I lived in a rich , populous country in which enormous quantities of marketable securities were traded and were sometimes ridiculously mispriced .
And fortunately for me , that describes the U.S. in the second half of the last century .
Certainly neither Susie nor I ever thought we should pass huge amounts of money along to our children .
Our kids are great .
But I would argue that when your kids have all the advantages anyway , in terms of how they grow up and the opportunities they have for education , including what they learn at home - I would say it 's neither right nor rational to be flooding them with money .
In effect , they 've had a gigantic headstart in a society that aspires to be a meritocracy .
Dynastic mega - wealth would further tilt the playing field that we ought to be trying instead to level .
From the fact that you 've given your kids money before to set up foundations and are planning to give them more now , I gather you do n't think that kind of flooding them with money is wrong .
No , I do n't .
What they 're doing with their foundations is giving money back to society - just where Susie and I thought it should go .
And they are n't just writing checks :
They 've put enormous thought and effort into the process .
I 'm very proud of them for the way they 've handled it all , and I have no doubt they 're going to keep on the right track .
So what about the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation and what all this means for it ?
As you know , because as a director you 've seen it close up , Allen Greenberg , the foundation 's president , has done an excellent and thoughtful job of running it .
His results - to - cost ratio is as good as I 've ever seen .
And he 'll keep on that same path now , not just with Susie 's money , but with mine too .
Actually , if I had died before Susie and she had begun to distribute our wealth , this is the foundation that would have scaled up to a much bigger size - right now it has only five employees - and become her main vehicle for giving .
And the foundation anchored my plans too .
Until I changed my thoughts about when to give , this was to be where my fortune would go also .
And what changed your mind ?
The short answer is that I came to realize that there was a terrific foundation that was already scaled - up - that would n't have to go through the real grind of getting to a megasize like the Buffett Foundation would - and that could productively use my money now .
The longer answer is that over the years I had gotten to know Bill and Melinda Gates well , spent a lot of time with them having fun and , way beyond that , had grown to admire what they were doing with their foundation .
I 've seen them give presentations about its programs , and I 'm always amazed at the enthusiasm and passion and energy they 're pouring into their work .
They 've gone at it , you might say , with both head and heart .
Bill reads many thousands of pages annually keeping up with medical advances and means of delivering help .
Melinda , often with Bill along , travels the world looking at how well good intentions are being converted into good results .
Life has dealt a terrible hand to literally billions of people around the world , and Bill and Melinda are bent on reducing that inequity to the extent they possibly can .
If you think about it - if your goal is to return the money to society by attacking truly major problems that do n't have a commensurate funding base - what could you find that 's better than turning to a couple of people who are young , who are ungodly bright , whose ideas have been proven , who already have shown an ability to scale it up and do it right ?
You do n't get an opportunity like that ordinarily .
I 'm getting two people enormously successful at something , where I 've had a chance to see what they 've done , where I know they will keep doing it - where they 've done it with their own money , so they 're not living in some fantasy world - and where in general I agree with their reasoning .
If I 've found the right vehicle for my goal , there 's no reason to wait .
Compare what I 'm doing with them to my situation at Berkshire , where I have talented and proven people in charge of our businesses .
They do a much better job than I could in running their operations .
What can be more logical , in whatever you want done , than finding someone better equipped than you are to do it ?
Who would n't select Tiger Woods to take his place in a high - stakes golf game ?
That 's how I feel about this decision about my money .
People will be very curious , I think , as to how much your decision - and its announcement at this particular time - is connected to Bill Gates ' announcement in mid-June that he would phase out of his operating responsibilities at Microsoft and begin to devote most of his time to the foundation .
What 's the story here ?
I realize that the close timing of the two announcements will suggest they 're related .
But they are n't in the least .
The timing is just happenstance .
I would be disclosing my plans right now whether or not he had announced his move - and even , in fact , if he were indefinitely keeping on with all of his work at Microsoft .
On the other hand , I 'm pleased that he 's going to be devoting more time to the foundation .
And I think he and Melinda are pleased to know they 're going to be working with more resources .
Does it occur to you that it 's somewhat ironic for the second - richest man in the world to be giving untold billions to the first - richest man ?
When you put it that way , it sounds pretty funny .
But in truth , I 'm giving it through him - and , importantly , Melinda as well - not to him .
Some people say the Gates foundation is bureaucratic , and bureaucracy is just about your No. 1 dislike .
So how do you react to that charge ?
I would say that most large organizations - though Berkshire is a shining exception - are bureaucratic to some degree .
Anyway , what some people really mean when they claim that the Gates foundation is bureaucratic is that big decisions do n't get made by anybody except Bill and Melinda .
That suits me fine .
I want the two of them to make the big calls .
What is the significance of your going on the board of the Gates foundation ?
Not much .
The biggest reason for my doing that is if they were ever to go down on an airplane together .
Beyond that , I hope to have a constructive thought now and then .
But I do n't think I 'm as well cut out to be a philanthropist as Bill and Melinda are .
The feedback on philanthropy is very slow , and that would bother me .
I 'd have to be too involved with a lot of people I would n't want to be involved with and have to listen to more opinions than I would enjoy .
In philanthropy also , you have to make some big mistakes .
I know that .
But it would bother me more to make the mistakes myself , rather than having someone else make them whom I trust overall to do a good job .
In general , Bill and Melinda will have a better batting average than I would .
Did you talk this huge decision over with other people before deciding to go ahead with the plan ?
Yes , I talked to my children and Allen Greenberg , and to four Berkshire directors , including my son Howard and Charlie Munger .
I got lots of questions , and some people had qualms about the plan initially because it was such an abrupt change from what they had been anticipating .
But I 'd say everybody , and that certainly includes Allen - who knows what a bear it would have been to scale up the Buffett Foundation - came around to seeing the logic of what I was proposing to do .
Now all concerned can't wait to get started - particularly me .
And frankly , I have some small hopes that what I 'm doing might encourage other very rich people thinking about philanthropy to decide they did n't necessarily have to set up their own foundations but could look around for the best of those that were up and running and available to handle their money .
People do that all the time with their investments .
They put their money with people they think are going to do a better job than they could .
There 's some real merit to extending that thought to your wealth , rather than setting up something to be run after your death by a bunch of old business cronies or a staff that eventually comes to dictate the agenda .
Some version of this plan I 've got is not a crazy thing for some of the next 20 people who are going to die with $ 1 billion or more to adopt themselves .
One problem most rich people have is that they 're old , with contemporaries who are not at their peak years and who do n't have much time ahead of them .
I 'm lucky in that respect in that I can turn to younger people .
Okay , now what does that mean for Berkshire ?
I 'd say virtually nothing .
Anybody who knows me also knows how I feel about making Berkshire as good as it can be , and that goal is still going to be there .
I wo n't do anything differently , because I 'm not capable of doing things differently .
The name on the stock certificates will change , but nothing else will .
I 've always made it clear to Berkshire 's shareholders that my wealth from the company would go to philanthropy , so the fact that I 'm starting the process is basically a nonevent for them .
And , you know , though this may surprise some people , it 's a nonevent for me too in some ways .
Ted Turner , whose philanthropic activities I admire enormously , once told me that his hands shook when he signed a $ 1 billion pledge .
Well , I have zero of that .
To me , there 's just no emotional downside to this at all .
Wo n't the foundations that are getting your stock need to sell it ?
Yes , in some cases .
The Buffett Foundation and the kids ' foundations will have to sell their stock relatively soon after they get it , because it will be their only asset - and they 'll need to raise cash to give away .
The Gates foundation will have more options because it has lots of other assets , so it will have some flexibility to choose which it should turn into cash .
Bill and Melinda will make the decisions about that .
I 'm going to totally insulate myself from any investment decisions their foundation makes , which leaves them free to do whatever they think makes sense .
Perhaps they will decide to sell bigger portions of other assets and hang on to some Berkshire .
It 's a great mix of businesses and would n't be an inappropriate asset for a foundation to own .
But I wo n't tie the foundation up in any shape or form .
So it could be that all the shares you give annually will be sold in the market ?
Yes , that may well happen .
And naturally people are going to be interested in whether that selling could weigh down Berkshire 's price .
I do n't think so in the least - and that 's true even though the annual turnover ratio for Berkshire has been running only about 15 % a year , which is extremely low for large - cap stocks .
Let 's say the five foundations sell all the stock they get this year .
If trading volume continues as it has , their selling will raise turnover to less than 17 % .
It would be ridiculous to think that much new selling could affect the price of the stock .
In fact , the added supply could even be beneficial in increasing the stock 's liquidity and should make it more likely that Berkshire would eventually be included in the S&P 500 .
I 'd say this : I would not be making the gifts if they would in any way harm Berkshire 's shareholders .
And they wo n't .
This plan seems to settle the fate , over the long term , of all your Berkshire shares .
Does that mean you 're giving nothing to your family in straight - out gifts ?
No , what I 've always said is that my family wo n't receive huge amounts of my net worth .
That does n't mean they 'll get nothing .
My children have already received some money from me and Susie and will receive more .
I still believe in the philosophy - FORTUNE quoted me saying this 20 years ago - that a very rich person should leave his kids enough to do anything but not enough to do nothing .
[ The FORTUNE article was " Should You Leave It All to the Children ? " Sept. 29 , 1986 . ]
Remember I said that way back when I was buying Berkshire , I had less than $ 1 million in outside cash ?
Well , I 've made a few decent investments with that money in the years since - taking positions that were too small for Berkshire , doing some fixed - income arbitrage , and selling my interest in a bank that was split off from Berkshire .
So I 'm glad to say I 've got quite a bit of cash now .
Overall I can - and will - use all my Berkshire shares for philanthropic purposes and will have plenty left over to provide well for all those close to me .
One Of Them
In effect , the Romney campaign provides a near - perfect test of who really wields power in the GOP .
On the one hand , conservative elites look at Romney and see a tall , good - looking , well - spoken , highly successful capitalist who , on top of all that -- dayanu !-- is willing to pretend he opposes gay marriage , abortion , and illegal immigration .
In addition to Sekulow , Romney wowed the likes of Jerry Falwell and Gary Bauer at last October 's meet - and - greet with evangelical heavies .
He performed a similar feat two weeks earlier in a meeting with the Baptist leadership of South Carolina .
Romney won positive reviews this January at a conclave of influential conservatives sometimes called the GOP 's Renaissance Weekend .
And he has thus far gained the admiration of anti-tax jihadist Grover Norquist , disgraced evangelical huckster Ralph Reed , Focus on the Family honcho James Dobson , and much of the staff of National Review .
On the other hand , the typical conservative evangelical looks at Romney and sees a dangerous cult member .
As Amy Sullivan has noted in The Washington Monthly , there is a geyser of anti-Mormon sentiment just waiting to be tapped among heartland evangelicals .
Sullivan cites , for example , the firestorm a Baptist leader recently ignited simply for apologizing to Mormons after a coreligionist called Utah " a stronghold of Satan . "
Similarly , a prominent conservative activist recently related the following exchange to my colleague Michelle Cottle : " I asked a friend of mine who 's a pastor in Middle America , ' You have a choice between two candidates : Hillary Clinton versus someone who is good on social issues and who is a Mormon . '
And my friend said , ' I do n't think I could vote for a Mormon . ' "
And on it goes .
Suffice it to say , if Romney comes up short , it will amount to a repudiation of the party elite by the grassroots .
I , for one , will have no choice but to concede that the GOP establishment is n't quite the decisive force most Democrats ( and more than a few Republicans ) assume it to be .
If , on the other hand , Romney clinches the nomination despite the intense suspicion he arouses , we will have unassailable proof that the GOP is dominated by its establishment .
If there 's one knock on Romney , then , it 's not that he 's a Mormon , but that he has n't sufficiently paid his dues to unite the GOP hierarchy behind him .
The combination of a fractured establishment and deep hostility from a key part of the GOP base could be a potential deal - breaker .
That 's why you see John McCain , the onetime frontrunner , attacking Romney as a fraud even as he largely gives Giuliani a pass .
But , in a way , McCain is missing the point .
The people he has to convince are n't the people who watch debates on TV .
It 's the people who pal around with the candidates backstage .
And they already know Romney 's a fraud .
They just happen to think , in the words of a certain Focus on the Family patriarch , that " he 's very presidential . "

How Do You Know When to Invest in a Down Market ?
As you watch your investment holdings quickly diminish over the course of a few days it is easy to panic .
You might give some thought to trying to cut your losses and sell but if you ’re a long term investor this is likely not in your best interest .
In fact , when the market is down is the best time to buy .
… it always feels a lot better to buy when the market is going up .
But you make more money buying when the market is going down
[ The Long and the Short of Down - Market Investing ]
… if you invest regularly and have some time before retirement , bear markets can be a beautiful thing .
[ Down Markets Good for Many Investors ]
Here is my question .
How do we gauge when the market slide has finished ?
The chart below is pretty obvious in hindsight but in the heat of the moment of the market decline you never really know where the bottom is .
Dollar cost averaging is how I currently put money into my investments but am considering buying more when they ’re on sale .
So how do I know when to buy into a down market ?
The chart above shows the price of an S&P 500 Index , Vanguard 500 Index ( VFINX ) , since the Fall of 2002 , with 14 occasions where the market had a noticeable drop .
It ’s not very scientific ; I just eyeballed some low points .
Thanks to Google Finance I was able to look at the price before the drop and the price after the market decline .
The table to the side shows the percentage change in the price of the index after each occasion .
One rule I could use to decide when to buy into a down market is to only buy after the index has dropped by a certain percentage .
I would have bought at almost each one of these dips if I set my benchmark to any decline over 3 % but would have only invested in 6 of them if I decided to wait for drops of 4 % or more and only 2 of them if I required at least a 5 % downturn .
I ’m not sure which percentage I should settle on but I do know the latest drop in prices looks to be the second largest in 5 years .
Of course , another thing to consider is that the market has been on an overall upward trend over the last 5 years .
I ’ll have to also take a look at buying in the dips over a 10 or 20 year period to see what that turns up .
What are some other ways you use or know of to help determine when to buy in a down market ?
A decade after the Pentagon declared a zero - tolerance policy for racist hate groups , recruiting shortfalls caused by the war in Iraq have allowed " large numbers of neo - Nazis and skinhead extremists " to infiltrate the military , according to a watchdog organization .
There is a kind of interlocking directorate between white nationalists , gun culture , right - wing politicians , mercenary culture ( like Soldier of Fortune ) , vigilante and militia movements , and elements within both Special Forces and — now — the privatized mercenary forces .
It is hyper - masculine , racialist , militaristic and networked .
If one simply pays attention to cultural production in the United States , especially film and video games , it is fairly easy to see that the very memes that are the cells within the body of white nationalist militarism are ubiquitous within our general cultural norms .
The film genre that most closely corresponds to a fascist mind - set is the male revenge fantasy , wherein after some offense is given that signifies the breakdown of order ( usually resulting in the death or mortal imperilment of idealized wives or children ) in which Enlightenment social conventions prove inadequate , and the release of irrational male violence is required to set the world straight again .
Any reader can list these fantasies without a cue .
It is one of the most common film genres in American society .
R. W. Connell wrote in “ Masculinities ” ( University of California Press , 1995 ) :
In gender terms , fascism was the naked reassertion of male supremacy in societies that had been moving toward equality for women .
To accomplish this , fascism promoted new images of hegemonic masculinity , glorifying irrationality ( " the triumph of the will " , thinking with " the blood " ) and the unrestrained violence of the frontline soldier .
Racial attitudes are constructed around existing material advantage .
This is not nearly as newsworthy as a Klan rally .
It is far more important , though , as a causative agent for our social antagonisms .
And there is an element of white supremacy in the mainstream discourse about the Iraq war , for example .
Both liberals and conservatives articulate the notion that the U.S. has to " stay in Iraq to prevent a catastrophe . "
There is no recognition here of the orientalism ( a white supremacist meme ) that assumes the superiority of Western tutelage and the deviance ( violent irrationality ) of Arabs and - or Muslims .
Privilege naturalizes itself .
It portrays itself as an outcome of nature ; and we all know that the laws of nature remain out of critical reach .
Alas , that ’s just how it is ... what a pity .
We already have whole sections of America — in the former enclaves of a now deracinated working class — where hopelessness exists alongside police forces that function very like a military occupation force .
Before the war , these occupation zones — filled with idled , angry , dark - skinned youths — were our middle - class nightmare , the Dark Chaos that inevitably leads us back to the patriarchal default , to militarized masculinity , and to the cultural celebration of bounty hunting and sexual revenge in feudal prisons .
Alas , the place - marker of a war on drugs — that created the largest national prison population on the planet — could n’t create the pretext for bases in Southwest Asia , so the war on terror will have to do .
The recruitment crisis that has opened the door to neo - Nazi youths entering military service was anything but a plan .
The term before the war that proponents used to describe its outcome was " cakewalk . "
Now even putative liberals have copped to their own version of " white man ’s burden , " saying ( the rhetorical ) we cannot " abandon Iraq , " lest " we " leave behind a terrible state of disorder .
And so " we " continue down that hoary , blood - drenched path of " civilizing missions . "
Western civilization , more particularly the United States , constitutes the highest point of possible human development .
It is only " freedom " and " democracy " as practiced in the West that can guarantee a future of peace .
( Never mind the West 's uninterrupted history of warfare within its own ranks , and never mind the West 's unending , centuries - long interference with the rest of the world . )
The West has the answer to successful human life .
Since it does , and because certain elements in the rest of the world have now chosen to attack us on our own ground ( and never mind that we have invaded and ruled over vast portions of the rest of the world since time immemorial ) , we must enlighten those benighted portions of the globe in our defense .
Our chosen method of enlightenment is brute military force , to be deployed even against countries that did not threaten us .
The lack of a genuine threat is no argument against spreading our version of " civilization , " for our mission is grounded not only in self - defense : it is also a moral mission .
Our success and our " peace " directly correlates to our virtue .
Those countries and those civilizations that do not enjoy the same success and peace are without virtue .
In the most extreme ( and , one could argue , most consistent ) version of this tale , non-Western parts of the world are less than human -- and they are subhuman by choice .
They are immoral , and sometimes even evil .
Since we represent the good and they represent the evil , we are surely entitled to improve them , by invasion and bombing if necessary .
If they do not threaten us today , they might at some indeterminate time in the future .
And while we might kill many innocent civilians in our campaign of civilization , those who survive will be infinitely better off than they would have been otherwise .
Besides , how " innocent " can any of them be -- since they are members of inferior , less than fully human civilizations , and since they are so by choice ?
I hate the word fascist .
It has been bandied about so much and brings up images of Storm troopers in grainy newsreels that it seems devoid of meaning .
Furthermore , classical fascism was possible only in a mass society , organized along industrial lines , with one - to - many communications .
Classical fascism is a reactionary modernism , a response to class struggle .
Both German and Italian variants came to power after the defeat of revolutionary upsurges .
I think our own situation is very different , and a better term needs to be found that captures the unique qualities of our reactionary postmodernism .
" Military police state " does n’t quite cut it .
Fascism implies policing of thought as well as bodies , today ’s reaction is selective , policing bodies but allowing private speech and the empty illusions of parliamentary democracy to stand .
I respectfully tip my hat to Stan Goff , and offer him my thanks .
In a fascinating article that I urge you to read , " Sowing the Seeds of Fascism in America , " Goff pulls together a number of underlying elements and demonstrates how they add up to a sum that ought to cause grave concern for all those who experience great anxiety when contemplating our country 's future .
As he also shows , our most influential elites , across the political spectrum , all reinforce different parts of this particularly American version of incipient fascism .
One of the specific developments that grounds Goff 's analysis was reported by thethis past July : But as Goff shows , this particular story hardly occurred in a vacuum , and it feeds into immensely destructive wider political - economic factors .
Here is how he summarizes some key elements in the general mechanism toward the end of his article :
One of the most fascinating parts of Goff 's discussion is his focus on the sexual and gender part of this equation : how surpassingly and bloodily violent " masculinity " is glorified and romanticized , in stark and negative contrast to a " weak , " " vacillating , " and ultimately useless " femininity . "
To see the popularized version of the " general cultural norms " that Goff mentions , you need only watch the hugely popular television series .
Courtesy of a friend , I recently watched all of season four .
It would be difficult , if not impossible , to imagine a more repellent embodiment of vicious , revenge - driven , murderous male fantasies , replete with innumerable bloody deaths and even the noxious idea that torture " works . "
That last idea is indisputably false , but even Hillary Clinton now repeats the lies that inflict monstrous pain , and that ultimately kill .
So much for " opposition " to the rising tide of barbarism .
And series likeare the manure out of which grows our fascist future .
Much of the outrage directed at ( such that can be found ) focuses on the regular use of torture , and on the savage notion that torture is " effective " ( and that " they deserve it , " too , of course ) .
But keeping Goff 's broader analysis in mind , it is crucial to appreciate the more complexthatand similar propaganda glorifies , including most especially the system of myths upon which such " entertainment " relies .
Tens of millions of Americans are being conditioned every day to view an incomprehensibly violent , utterly arbitrary militarizedstate as representing " virtue , " and indeed a necessary virtue : supposedly necessary to protect us from the enemy , who is now to be found everywhere .
Perhaps it 's your next - door neighbor .
That day , too , may not be all that far away .
Goff discusses how conservatives , neoconservatives and even many liberals retreat in the face of mounting horrors to the notion that the West , and the United States specifically , represent the " highest form " of civilization , which alleged fact therefore entitles us to embark on violent , " civilizing " missions .
The general target of such missions is invariably the same .
Goff served in the U.S. Army Special Forces for more than two decades , and he notes that This is a long and abhorrent tradition in American history , dating ( in its international version ) back to the Spanish - American War and the following deadly episode in the Philippines , a campaign of murderous rage that was driven by the most virulent racism .
( For the domestic version of this vicious myth , see my essay , " Myths of New Orleans . " )
In the middle of his article , Goff states : Toward the conclusion of his analysis , Goff writes :
This is why almost no one in our governing class , Republican or Democrat , can acknowledge the profound immorality embodied by the invasion and occupation of Iraq -- and why no one will seriously suggest the onlyandsolution : Get Out Now Goff analyzes many of the ideas and mechanisms that have been the focus of a number of my essays .
Because it connects at several points to Goff 's themes , I want to repeat here my own brief retelling of the central myth that underlies this worldview , and that serves as the justification for our foreign policy , one embraced by virtually the entire political establishment .
I offered that myth once again in my discussion of the foreign policy framework that explains both Vietnam and Iraq , " Battling the Ghosts of Vietnam " : Until this myth is blasted at the foundation and rejected in its entirety , we will continue on our current path -- one that destroys ever broader swaths of the world , even as it destroys us .
Goff 's article has many further points of great interest , and I commend it to you .
For the moment , I will leave you with these words from Goff 's friend , Steve McClure , who I think very accurately captures a large part of the perilous moment at which we find ourselves :
McClure 's reference to " empty illusions " calls to mind the same kind of charade -- the identical drama of lies concealing forms that are now drained of all meaning and significance -- that I recently discussed from a different vantage point I will return to these themes , and to other parts of Goff 's discussion , soon .
UPDATE : Much more about torture , and about the series
Burning Issues With Vista
~ by Richard Rasker Having heard that Vista 's CD / DVD burn utility by default uses a nonstandard format , possibly as a result of yet another one of Microsoft 's lock - in schemes , I decided to check things out for myself .
That would also give me a nice chance to see what Vista was all about .
The plan was simple : 1 . Locate a Vista box , 2 .
Bring empty CD 's plus some arbitrary files on a USB stick , and 3 .
Burn CD 's in several ways while making screenshots .
As it turned out , the planning was the simplest part by far .
The rest is best described as a tale of frustration .
Step 1 : Locating a Vista computer Locating a working Vista box proved harder than I expected .
First I went over to a local computer shop , the owner of which I know personally , and asked if I might have a go on any Vista demo box they might have standing around .
They said they'd be happy to oblige , but that they had no Vista computers on offer at all , because  Vista does n't work well enough yet . 
It turned out that they 'd tested a Vista installation on several machines and concluded that it was n't yet something they wanted to sell to their customers .
The exact same thing happened at another computer shop .
The third vendor , a large retail chain , did actually have some preinstalled Vista machines running but would n't let me touch them , because , they said , then :  We ca n't sell them as new any more . 
After a week of calling around , I finally located someone with a preinstalled Vista box that I could try out -- he was n't using it , as it turned out that the owner ( an experienced Windows XP user ) could n't get the hang of Vista at all and considered buying the machine a mistake .
Not a good sign .
So I had the machine all to myself : a dual - core 2.8GHz Pentium D with one GB of RAM , and an NVIDIA GeForce 7300 SE featuring 128MB graphics RAM , preloaded with Vista Home Premium .
This is a vastly more powerful machine than any of my Linux boxes ( which run smoothly and snappily nonetheless ) , yet it seemed to me to be underpowered to run all the Vista eye - candy , in particular the 3D effects .
Ah well .
For starters , I decided to check the boot time .
And lo and behold , the Vista desktop shows up in a minute and a half .
But alas , not in a functional state .
It takes over two more minutes before the hard disk stops rattling and the machine becomes fully responsive .
So nearly four minutes in all .
This is a pretty sad figure , especially when compared to the 55 seconds Mandriva Linux 2007 takes on my Toshiba laptop .
And I can't really see the  Wow factor either .
In fact , I find the transparency effects both ugly and annoying .
Especially window title bars are no longer well - defined , and appear to be infected with some sort of mold .
But OK , there 's no accounting for taste , and no doubt it can be switched off -- and I 'm actually thankful for the absence of any 3D special effects , which I find even more distracting and annoying .
An OS and user interface should behave like the perfect butler : make your life as easy as possible while remaining as unobtrusive as possible .
Vista behaves more like a very stupid servant in a flashy outfit .
It makes its presence felt throughout , raises the alarm every so often without any real need , gets confused easily , drops the dishes on a regular basis , and while appearing to be easygoing and helpful , drives its employer insane with its unpredictable whims and intrusive behavior .
( Note that this is my personal opinion , based on my own , rather limited experience with Vista . )
Then there 's the main menu button , formerly the Start button , in the lower left corner .
As the contradiction of clicking a button labeled  Start in order to shut down Windows seemed to confuse users and was often ridiculed , Microsoft replaced it with a neutral button featuring the Vista logo .
But guess which Tool Tip appears when hovering the mouse over this button .
Yup :  Start .
Quite funny , actually , although I very much doubt that this was the result of a healthy sense of humor on the part of the interface designers .
Next up : how to take screen shots .
Now in Mandriva , it 's simply a matter of pressing the Prt Scr key , after which KSnapshot , an application for taking , naming and saving screen shots , automatically pops up .
It even features automatic image file numbering , to make taking several successive screen shots easier .
Not so in Vista .
After pressing Prt Scr , or any combination of this key with any other key , nothing seems to happen .
How , then , to take a Windows screenshot ?
I decided to give the new and much praised Search function a whirl .
But no matter what I enter in the text box , nothing relevant is found , even when I select Search All .
Apparently , help information is n't included in the search process .
And pressing the good old F1 button for Help does n't do anything either .
A few more minutes of searching with Google finally turns up an answer : it is the Prt Scr key after all , but the image is saved in the Clipboard , to be pasted into Paint or another suitable application .
Not very handy , in my opinion , but then again , I never liked the Windows Way .
So I open Paint , and Ctrl +V the images in there , and save them manually .
A bit of a drag , but nothing serious .
Later , I found out that I also had to crop the images manually , because Paint did n't resize the saved image automatically to the pasted image size .
My mistake .
And oh , right from the start , popups started , well , popping up from the System Tray .
Something about Blocked Programs or the like .
And this minor annoyance quickly grew into frustration as it turned out that these popups would reappear with ten minute intervals .
According to the owner , this had something to do with security settings , and he said he'd spent hours trying to fix it , but the only thing that would work was to disable User Access Control ( UAC ) completely -- at which point the System Tray would start popping up nag messages that security features were disabled .
I was beginning to understand why he did n't like Vista .
I decide not to change anything and ignore the messages .
Steps 2 and 3 : Transfer USB files to CD , and try to burn a CD So , back to the burning issue .
I plug in my USB stick and have Vista open an Explorer window with its contents .
Then I click the  Computer icon on the desktop and drag a file from USB stick to the burner icon .
Right away , a window pops up , prompting me to load a CD or DVD in the burner ( note that the images are all in Dutch , my language , but I 'll translate for English speakers ) :
Figure 1 : Vista asks for a writable disk (  Put a writable disk in the F : drive  )
That I do , after which a terse burn dialog turns up :
Figure 2 : Vista 's burn dialog is very concise (  Prepare this blank disk  )
This seems simple enough .
Now if I had clicked Next ( Volgende ) , the CD would have been burned with Microsoft 's Live File System format without informing or warning the user .
This is Not Good , in my view , and smells a bit of sneaky lock - in .
Instead , then , I click Show Formatting Options (  Opties voor formatteren weergeven ) .
Figure 3 : Vista 's burn tool formatting options
The options are clear : the Mastered format is readable on any computer , the Live File System format only on Windows computers -- and even then , it depends on the chosen version ( via  Versie wijzigen ) of Live File System , as the following screen shots show :
Figure 4 : Live File System version selection -- or UDF version selection ?
(  Annuleren =  Cancel )
All of a sudden , Live File System is called UDF , which is rather confusing .
Is the resulting disk a UDF disk or not ?
Anyway , I stick with the default option ( UDF 2.01 ) , which should be compatible with Vista and XP .
After I click OK , Vista says it needs to format the disk :
Figure 5 : Vista is formatting the disk , calculating the remaining time -- forever , as it turned out And this is the moment where mere annoyance turns into frustration , as nothing seems to be happening .
After waiting for over five minutes , I decide to try and cancel the whole operation , but that 's not so easy .
There 's no way to close the Formatting window , as the Close button , Alt +F4 and other Close options are greyed out .
After a bit of searching I locate the Task Manager and forcibly kill the task .
But the associated window wo n't go away , no matter what I try :
Figure 6 : Vista 's burn tool crashed and burned -- or rather crashed and failed to burn .
It seems that the only way to get rid of this non-responding zombie window is a complete reboot .
Yes , indeed , another five minutes down the drain .
Giving up is not an option .
So I reboot and try once more .
Weird enough , this time when dragging the file from the USB stick to the burner icon and popping in a blank CD at Vista 's request , a new dialog comes up :
Figure 7 : Yet another burn dialog ?
If I thought things were confusing already , with the mysterious Live File System available in no less than four versions called UDF , this really takes the biscuit .
And to top it all , this dialog 's title bar says  Automatic Playing , while offering a large amount of burning applications ( most of which were installed by the user ) .
Why ?
The only real difference is that the first time , I used a CD - RW , and now I just put in an ordinary , blank CD - R .
I close this window and continue with the now familiar Vista burn dialog ( which has popped up as well ) .
Again , I do n't choose anything at all , in effect choosing 
Live File System .
Again , the formatting dialog shows up , but this time , it does n't hang -- it produces an error message :  Ca n't complete formatting . 
Nothing else , no reason , no help , just nothing .
No error details whatsoever .
Figure 8 : Formatting a blank CD failed - again :  Ca n't Finish Formatting 
Fed up with this , I decide to ask the owner of the machine for help .
He says that I could try to turn off some security options , which should also stop the endless stream of System Tray popup warnings .
He can't tell me how to do this , though .
I told him I was logged in with admin rights already , but he says that 's not enough .
After another fifteen minutes of rummaging around in the Control Center and checking out literally everything under  Security  , I finally find what I 'm looking for -- buried deep somewhere under  User Accounts  .
I turn off User Access Control ( UAC ) , and now Vista says it must reboot for this to take effect !
And I thought Vista needed far less reboots ?
This is already the second reboot in less than an hour , without any result yet .
OK , so reboot it is ... and this time , the formatting of the CD - R seems to work -- although it takes over two minutes .
Burning starts .... and then ends in failure once again ...
Figure 9 : Now the burning process failed ...
And again , the error message ( well , error wizard , actually ) is the stupidest you can get :  A problem has occurred while burning this disk .
The disk may no longer be usable .
No further explanation whatsoever , no help .
It just failed .
OK , the user is offered three options :  Try again with another disk ,  Remove temporary files which were n't burned to disk , and  Save temporary files and try to burn these at a later time .
Try , try , try .
As it turns out , no matter what I choose , it keeps failing .
And now I 'm getting System Tray popups again -- this time it 's warnings that the machine is not properly secured .
Wonderful .
I 'm about to give up , but I decide to give it one more shot , this time with the Mastered format .
For good measure , I reboot the machine once more , put in a new , blank CD-R , and go through the whole procedure again , taking care to choose the Mastered format this time :
Figure 10 : Burning with the Mastered format option A large window appears , to which I can drag and drop files .
So in goes the file again , and I click  Burn to disk .
Now the burner actually shows some activity , but after a while , the previous error message pops up again .
Checking the disk visually shows that something was burned but only the Vista machine seems to be able to read these files .
Even an XP machine shows nothing at all .
Also , I can't find any way of specifying this Mastered format as the default format -- which was one of the main reasons to embark on this burning adventure .
I try once more with yet another blank disk ; but surprise surprise , when I click the burner icon , Vista says that the file I burned is on the disk already !
And when I try to force Vista to burn the disk nonetheless , it keeps insisting that the files are there already ...
Figure 11 : Vista says that files have been burned -- with a blank disk in the tray ...
The above dialog says that  Files have been written to the disk , and  Would you like to copy the same files to another disk ? 
Well , nothing readable was burned to any disk in the first place , and choosing to burn the same files to another disk does n't work either .
Figure 12 : This is so confusing ...
When I drag - and - drop the file onto the burner again ( with a blank CD - R in the tray ) , I get a warning that  This location already contains a file by this name .
No it does n't !
I just put in a blank disk !
And again , regardless whether I choose  Copy and replace ,  Do n't copy  or  Copy , but keep both files , nothing readable ends up on the CD .
As a final test , I close all dialogs , and start the burn utility one more time .
And as expected , it had n't saved any previous settings and offered to burn the CD with Live File System once more .
And failed once more .
This was the point at which I finally gave up , after more than two hours of frustration and confusion and returned the box to its owner .
And there was nothing wrong with the burner device itself -- Nero had no problems burning files to CD .
Preliminary conclusion I set out to check whether Vista tries to trick users into burning media in a format that is incompatible with non-Windows machines .
Judging from the various dialogs , I 'd say that this could indeed be the case , but in all honesty , I simply failed to burn even one disk , readable or not , and I could n't get Vista to reliably do the same thing twice .
Perhaps this was caused by the other installed burning tools , or perhaps I did things wrong ( I hardly ever use Windows , so I guess there 's a bit of a learning curve ) , but in the end , I got stuck with no results .
And drawing conclusions from no results whatsoever may be in the finest tradition of politics and marketing -- it 's a no - no in journalism .
Or at least it should be .
Yet this turned out not to be the end of the saga ...
If at first you do n't succeed ...
The very next day , I received an email message from the owner ( er , correction : licensee ) .
He had already resigned himself to upgrading ( sic ) the box to XP , but he powered it up one more time .
To his surprise , a message appeared saying that  There were files in a burn queue , and would he like to have these burned to CD ?
So he chose  Yes , dropped a blank CD in the burner tray , and to his amazement , Vista burned the CD without a hitch .
If he was surprised , I was speechless .
I went over to his place , and sure enough , the machine now does what it 's supposed to do .
So once more , I 'll try and find out all about Vista 's burn tool .
And so here I am again , with the machine purring away .
Taking a systematic approach , I first check to see what happens when I load a blank DVD - RW in the burner tray as a first course of action .
And incredible as it may seem , yet another burn selection dialog pops up !
Figure 13 : And here 's the third burn dialog .
It resembles the one from Figure 7 , but with all the options for the user installed burn software magically absent .
The only difference here is that I put in a DVD instead of a CD .
Ah well , so much for consistency .
And where 's Vista 's familiar , austere burn dialog from Figure 2 or 3 ?
The one that never failed to pop up so far ?
OK , I remain calm , and select the second option ( Burn files to disk -- with Windows  ) .
Ah , there it is -- and it's the one in Figure 2 , with the formatting options hidden ; when clicking the latter , the format is set to Live File System .
So just clicking Next would have resulted in a Live File System disk , incompatible with anything but Windows Vista and Windows XP .
One mark on the lock - in side of the tally .
I change the format to  Mastered , and the dialog from figure 10 appears .
I drag - and - drop some files in there , and right away , a System Tray popup appears , informing me that there are files in the disk queue .
Yeah , I know .
It was me who put 'em there not a second ago .
And I can  Click this balloon to display the files .
Talking about useless messages ...
Figure 14 : Vista has noticed that I put files in a burning queue , and tells me about it Undaunted , I proceed to click  Burn to disk  (  Op schijf branden ) .
A dialog appears , with options to change the name and the burning speed .
OK , fine .
Figure 15 : The disk is prepared ( Note that the word  Mastered  is the name I gave the disk . )
After clicking Next and expecting the actual burning to begin , Vista comes up with a warning dialog ( and accompanied by a sound , at that ) :
Figure 16 : Vista apparently tries to dissuade users from using the Mastered format
This is what it says :  If you use the Mastered format , you can only write once on this type of disk .
If you wish to add files to this disk more often , you should use the Live File System format .
Do you wish to continue to use the Mastered format ? 
Yes , of course I do !
That 's why I selected it in the first place .
Also note how cunningly the No (  Nee ) option is selected by default , causing a switch to LFS when the user presses the Enter key without thinking .
This appears to me to be another attempt to steer users away from a universally readable format .
Add one mark for lock - in .
After clicking
Yes , the disk is finally burned , and yes , it 's readable in my Linux machines .
After the burning finishes , Vista offers to burn the files to another disk , with the dialog from Figure 11 .
I decide to see what happens when I accept , and drop in yet another blank DVD - RW .
And yes , once again , the warning message of Figure 16 pops up .
Vista ( or rather : Microsoft ) really does n't want you to use a universally compatible format , I do n't think .
I confirm the Mastered option once again , and let the burning tool run its course .
This time , the burn tool crashes once more :
Figure 17 : An all too familiar sight by now : ... does n't respond 
Nope , the Cancel button ( Annuleren ) does n't work .
When I click the close button , I get a message that  Windows Explorer does not respond  ( Huh ? Windows Explorer ?
So that is the burn tool ? ) :
Figure 18 : Yeah , I know it does n't respond .
Do something about it !
Ah well , let 's simply kill it , then ... that should be the easiest option by far .
But alas , choosing the second option  Terminate the program results in another , yet almost identically phrased error message :
Figure 19 : Grrrrrrrr ... Again ,  Windows Explorer does n't respond  --
But this time ,  More information is being gathered about the problem .
This may take several minutes .
So I wait .
After a dozen more seconds , and without a warning , all of the desktop goes blank !
I can't do anything any more .
No , not even take a screenshot , so you have to take me at my word this time ...
After waiting for a dozen or so minutes and contemplating a hard reset , I try pressing the DVD burner button .
Out comes the DVD -- and lo and behold , the desktop pops up again !
With the same System Tray message as in Figure 14 ,  There are files in the disk queue .
How thoughtful .
Bizarre but thoughtful .
So I take a deep breath , and proceed to put a blank DVD - RW in the burner once again .
For good measure , I click the DVD burner icon ( the F : drive ) in  Computer , to check whether it 's blank indeed .
To my utter surprise , Vista once again tells me that there is a file on the disk nonetheless :
Figure 20 : Vista's F : drive shows what is n't there
But wait a minute ... now I see ... this line at the top ,  Files ready to be written to disk , is the only clue .
So this is what happens : Clicking the F : drive icon does n't necessarily show the contents of the disk -- it may instead show the contents of Vista 's burn queue .
Congratulations , Microsoft !
By overly dumbing down the user interface and trying to predict what the user might want to do ( i.e. , burn stuff to a disk ) , no doubt to make things easier , you actually created a major point of confusion .
Let me tell you : clicking a drive icon should always tell you the contents of this drive , nothing else , and most certainly not what you may wish to write to that drive or not .
Ah well , after putting in the blank DVD , at least I now get the fully expanded burn dialog from way back in Figure 3 .
No , not the one from Figure 7 , not the one from Figure 13 , and not the one from Figure 10 .
And , surprisingly , the Mastered format option is preselected this time round .
Who knows , perhaps the tool has a memory after all , and stores its latest settings ...
But alas , as soon as I empty the burn queue and start the whole procedure again , up comes the terse dialog from Figure 2 , and a quick check confirms that , yes , the Live File System is selected by default once again .
Final Conclusion
In my view , the final conclusion is quite clear .
In several ways , users are pushed towards the Live File System ( LFS ) format , which is only compatible with Vista and XP .
LFS is the format which is selected by default , and there appears to be no way to change this that I could find .
In many cases , the user does n't even get to see this selection , and following the easiest way to burn a CD or DVD will almost certainly result in an LFS format disk .
Contrarily , in order to use the universally readable Mastered format , users have to select it consciously every single time , and still confirm this choice every single time .
As far as I could see , LFS is some kind of unfinalized type of UDF -- with UDF standing for Universal Disk Format .
Even if UDF is a universal format , LFS most certainly is not .
I tried reading LFS format media on my Linux systems but failed , even though I installed udftools .
Yes , K3 b ( a great Linux burning tool ) could tell me that there was data on the disks , but it was unable to show the actual data itself .
All other tools failed with the error message that the disk could n't be mounted .
As for why Microsoft pushes LFS , I can't think of any good reasons .
The only advantage of LFS over the Mastered format is the option to add files to an already burned disk later on .
But there is already such a thing as multi-session , so this argument is largely moot , and besides , people actually expect to burn a CD or DVD in one go .
For all the rest , LFS has only drawbacks .
First , it 's confusing to the user , with no less than four versions , aimed at distinct Windows and Mac versions .
Second , and most importantly , it will create compatibility problems in the world of creating CD's and DVD 's  a world that at the moment features a near universal support and compatibility of available formats .
The only true reason I can think of for pushing LFS is that Microsoft attempts to lock its users once more into its products .
Innocent users who use Vista 's tool to save their photos , MP3 collection or back - ups in general may find that all of a sudden , they have no access to their own data any more , especially when abandoning Microsoft products .
So far , I have n't been able to find any technical specifications with regard to LFS ; and it is to be expected that Microsoft will consider it their Intellectual Property , the use and support of which is licensed under its terms to users .
I think this is Not Good at all .
And as for the general quality of Vista and my personal  Vista experience ?
I think the story speaks for itself .
* * * Postscript :
After reading some feedback to the article , I fired up the Vista box once more , testing some things posted .
What I find is that the two oldest UDF versions ( 1.50 and 2.00 ) indeed can be read by Linux -- but only if udftools are installed on the Linux system , which is n't the case by default .
This option also suffers from a similar problem as the Mastered format , i.e. , it can't be set as the default choice and must thus be selected consciously every single time .
Update : Burning Issues in Vista -- the Aftermath
In the article , I attempted to find out more about the way Vista burns CD's and DVD's , and in particular about the format Vista uses by default , something which Microsoft calls Live File System , or LFS in short .
From what I gathered on the Internet and experienced hands - on with a Vista machine , I drew the conclusion that LFS was likely a deliberate attempt by Microsoft to lock users into a new , proprietary format for storing data on CD 's and DVD's .
Well , as the reactions from lots of Groklaw readers started pouring in , it became clear that LFS was n't a new , proprietary format after all .
Rather quickly , evidence mounted that Live File System is n't ( as I thought ) just based on a ISO standard called Universal Disk Format , ( UDF ) , but that LFS is UDF .
So how did I get the idea that LFS was a new , incompatible Microsoft format ?
Well , Microsoft itself is partly to blame .
In its own words :
The latest version of Windows offers a new format , called Live File System .
Discs formatted with the Live File System option : ...
Are only compatible with Windows XP and later versions of Windows .
Nowhere does Microsoft say that Live File System is actually the same as UDF , which I find rather misleading  if you use a well - defined and open standard , why not call it by its proper name ?
Add to this the facts that a )
Vista clearly steers users away from the universally readable  Mastered format , both by means of default settings that can't be changed and a warning message , and b ) the resulting LFS disks initially could n't be read on my Linux systems at all , and c ) it would by no means be the first time for Microsoft to convert an open standard into their own incompatible one , and a foul play theory is quickly born .
But if LFS is in fact UDF , why could n't my Linux boxes read the disks ?
Well , this was due to sloppiness on my part , a lack of proper UDF support in Linux , and my hardware setup .
Initially , I tried all four LFS / UDF versions , but could n't read anything , although Linux was said to offer UDF support .
Some time later , I gave it another try  but this time only with the 2.01 version , with the same negative result .
As reactions on my article came in , it became clear that at least the two oldest UDF versions ( 1.50 and 2.00 ) could be read on Linux after all  which resulted in a bit of an ahum feeling , let me tell you .
One of Groklaw 's readers pointed me to a Linux kernel patch for improved UDF support , and also provided the following general information on UDF support in Linux : Linux 2.6. X supports the following UDF versions : Read & Write : 1.02 , 1.50 , 2.0x ( Kernel 2.6.10 up ) ,
Read Only : 2.50 ( with patch ) Windows Vista supports the following UDF versions : Read & Write : 1.02 , 1.50 , 2.0x , 2.50
Read Only : 2.60 Still , this does n't explain why I had trouble reading UDF disks formatted with the older ( older than 2.50 ) versions , but that turned out to be a hardware issue .
My ( older ) CD - ROM players seemed to be incompatible with UDF , most probably because they did n't support the 2048 bytes per sector UDF uses .
When I put the UDF formatted CD - RW 's in my DVD burner , they could be read properly ( with the exception of version 2.50 ) .
The problem with the kernel patch , of course , is that it requires quite a bit of hands - on work in the department of kernel - compiling and the like , so the average user may have to wait a little longer for a simple kernel update for his or her distribution of choice .
I found this lagging UDF support in Linux a bit surprising , especially as it seems that UDF 2.50 has been around for four years .
Apparently , there was n't any reason to support it because it was very rarely used .
But with the arrival of Vista , and also new DVD formats , this will no doubt change .
Summary : Microsoft's Live File System is in fact Universal Disk Format (* ) .
Linux does support the older versions of Universal Disk Format , but may require a kernel patch to support Vista 's currently used versions .
 Out - of - the box  Linux support of the latest UDF version ( 2.50 ) is not yet realized .
Not all CD - ROM players are capable of handling UDF disks .
*
Let 's hope that Microsoft does n't get any weird ideas and decide to extend its Live File System beyond the UDF specification after all ...
So in this case , it 's actually Linux that 's lagging in development ; Microsoft is n't really to blame , at least as far as lock - in is concerned  although more accurate information on the nature of  Live File System could have prevented quite a bit of trouble and confusion .
Also , it depends on the CD or DVD device whether a UDF formatted disk can be used or not .
Especially older CD - ROM players may not be UDF - compatible .
I hope this information is useful for others as well , and I would like to thank Groklaw 's readership for their feedback , which was a valuable help to get a clearer picture .

Rattus norvegicus is now a globally distributed pest ( Image : NPL / Susan McMillan )
The rodent had been radio tagged and its movements tracked by researchers to learn more about pest species and how they invade small islands .
The rat was released on the uninhabited island of Motuhoropapa but refused to be captured at the project 's end .
The NZ team tells Nature magazine the animal finally turned up on the nearby Otata Island - a mighty swim of 400m .
James Russell , from the University of Auckland , and colleagues think this may be the longest distance recorded for a rat swimming across open sea .
" Norway rats can supposedly swim up to 600 m but , to our knowledge , this is the first record of a rat swimming hundreds of metres across open water , " they write .
In total , the rat was free for 18 weeks .
It was eventually killed in a trap baited with penguin meat .
Invasive species are second only to habitat loss as the major driver of extinctions .
Islands in the New Zealand 's Hauraki Gulf are close to each other
Eradicating them once they have established themselves has proved extremely difficult .
This particular rat evaded a diverse arsenal of traps , baits and even sniffer dogs .
The team says that rodent pests are even harder to eliminate when they occur in small numbers , perhaps because of the lack of competition for food .
Keeping on top of the invading aliens is a constant battle for the New Zealand authorities .
The uninhabited and forested Noises Islands ( Motuhoropapa and Otata ) off northeast New Zealand were reinvaded by Norway rats at least six times between 1981 and 2002 .
A former paramilitary soldier told a congressional panel Thursday that several U.S. companies provided financial support to illegal militias accused of killing Colombian civilians .
Edwin Guzman , a former Colombian army sergeant who later became a paramilitary member , testified that his military units were responsible for guarding the property of the Birmingham , Ala . - based Drummond coal company , which has extensive operations in Colombia .
Guzman said that the Colombian military also worked closely with right - wing paramilitary units housed on Drummond premises in a joint effort to protect the company and its coal shipments from leftist guerrillas .
Drummond provided company vehicles , gasoline and other supplies to the paramilitary group United Self - Defense Forces of Colombia , or AUC , Guzman said .

It has been illegal for U.S. companies to provide financial assistance to the AUC since September 2001 , when the U.S. government designated it as a terrorist organization .
But Guzman told members of three House Foreign Affairs Committee panels that protection agreements between the outlawed groups and corporations were commonplace .
“ Drummond is not the only company paying for the services of the paramilitaries .
There are many other companies that are paying , ” Guzman said through an interpreter .
“ I hope the members of the Congress investigate these things further because every time we raise these things in Colombia , they try to erase our testimony any way they can . ”

Allegations denied

Drummond has denied the allegations and told lawmakers Thursday that it could not comment on Guzman ’s allegations due to a pending civil court case that alleges the company was behind the slayings of three union leaders in 2001 .
The chairmen of two of the subcommittees , Reps. Eliot L. Engel ( D - N.Y. ) and William D. Delahunt ( D - Mass. ) , said the four - hour hearing was only the first step in what they hope to be an aggressive investigation of whether U.S. corporations were underwriting violence in Colombia by paying protection money to paramilitary groups .
Both lawmakers cited the case of Chiquita Brands International Inc. , which recently acknowledged paying nearly $ 2 million to the AUC and the left - wing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC , to protect the company ’s banana - growing operations and employees in Colombia .
Chiquita agreed to pay $ 25 million in fines to settle a Justice Department investigation , admitting to doing business with U.S. - designated terrorist organizations .
The FARC also is listed as a terrorist group .
The Democratic leadership in Congress , citing such concerns , has begun reexamining Plan Colombia , the billiondollar anti-drug and anti-terrorism program that has been in place since 2000 .

Two of the union leaders , Victor Orcasita and Valmore Locarno were pulled off a company bus and killed .
Gustavo Soler , who replaced Locarno as union president , was killed in a similar fashion seven months later .
Guzman testified Thursday that Colombian army training “ tells us that we have to attack the leftists in any way we can , and that unions are guerrilla groups and we have to attack them by legal and illegal means . ”
But he stopped short of telling the lawmakers that the military conspired with paramilitary groups to kill the union workers , or other civilians .
And he said he had “ no evidence on how Drummond gave money to the paramilitaries . ”

Union seen as a threat
In his prepared remarks , Guzman went further , however , saying that an AUC commander , whom he identified as “ Cebolla , ” told him that paramilitaries were responsible for the slayings of Locarno and Orcasita .
He said paramilitaries and the Colombian army shared the opinion that the Drummond miners union “ represented a subversive organization and consequently a legitimate military target . ”
“ I must confess that we in the military viewed the murders of Valmore Locarno and Victor Orcasitos in early 2001 as military victories , ” Guzman said .
“ I do not have that opinion today , but I did back then as a consequence of my military training . ”
Guzman also said in the statement that the AUC killed many civilians on and around the Drummond property , and that he was ordered while in the military to help cover up any links between their deaths and the coal company .

Engel said the allegations against Drummond , if true , “ would be an extremely serious violation of our laws ....
It appears that we have only scratched the surface of U.S. corporate malfeasance in Colombia . ”
Maria McFarland , a Colombia specialist for the New York - based Human Rights Watch , testified Thursday that 2,515 Colombian trade unionists have been killed since 1986 , nearly two - thirds of them by paramilitary groups .
In March , Colombian Atty .
Gen. Mario Iguaran said in an interview that his office was investigating claims by a government witness now in jail that Drummond paid paramilitaries to kill the three union leaders .
The witness is believed to be Rafael Garcia , a former official of the Department of Administrative Security , Colombia ’s equivalent of the FBI , who previously accused former department director Jorge Noguera of providing paramilitaries with information on union leaders who later were killed .

On Leading a Balanced Life
Only one who can learn the process of nescience and that of transcendental knowledge side by side can transcend the influence of repeated birth and death and enjoy the full blessing of immortality .
~ Sri Ishopanishad , Mantra Eleven
Some neophytes on the spiritual path may fall into the illusion that taking care of the body is somehow evil , or a sign of spiritual backwardness .
Not only may they neglect the needs of the body , but they may go out of their way to actually damage the body .
Such people actually hate the body .
They see it as a source of misery , and thus they take out their anger on it .
This is certainly a mistake .
Masochism can never lead to spiritual perfection .
The body is actually a most precious property of the self ; it enables the self to engage in various devotional activities that can bring about a change in consciousness .
A person 's external activities affect his consciousness , and his consciousness affects his external activities .
Knowing this , a bhakti yogi consciously chooses to engage in particular external activities in order to bring about the desired spiritual happiness and wisdom .
However , neither the Sri Ishopanishad nor any other Vedic literature recommends that we neglect bodily needs .
The Bhagavad - gita states :
There is no possibility of one 's becoming a yogi , O Arjuna , if one eats too much , or eats too little , sleeps too much or does not sleep enough .

But a cautiousness has begun to creep in , brought on by recent turmoil in the markets , uproar over a lavish birthday party for the private equity executive Stephen A. Schwarzman , and calls from Capitol Hill to increase taxes on hedge funds and private equity billionaires .
In August , leading hedge funds showed a loss of 2.5 percent , according to the HFRX index compiled by Hedge Fund Research .
On the surface , it does not seem like a lot , given the billions of dollars that hedge funds have accumulated .
Yet it was the largest monthly reversal since a 3.8 percent decline in April 2000 .
Taken together with larger downturns at several prominent funds , the number represents a stark reminder that the fast and easy returns of recent years are on the wane .
“ People just do n’t feel euphoric , and they do n’t want to be high profile any more , ” said Dolly Lenz , a high - end real estate broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman , who said she began to see this reserve from her hedge fund clients in July .
“ They are no longer seeing new highs every month .
They may have the same net worth , but it ’s all about euphoria and confidence .
These are trade - up purchases ; no one really needs them . ”
It is not just Old Trees .
Ms. Lenz cited a growing number of luxury properties that have not found a buyer , most prominently a $ 70 million penthouse at the Pierre Hotel .
An early sign of this modesty came in the spring , when Lloyd C. Blankfein , the chief executive of Goldman Sachs , rescinded an offer to buy Old Trees after a small news item about the deal appeared in The New York Post .
After his $ 54 million bonus last year , such an outlay might have seemed ostentatious .
Mr. Blankfein declined to comment .

Flat - screen
TVs are more energy intensive than older models
UK consumers spend £ 12bn a year on electronics , much of which is less efficient than older technology , a study by the Energy Saving Trust found .
By 2020 , the gadgets will account for about 45 % of electricity used in UK households , the organisation projected .
It said flat - screen TVs and digital radios were among the worst offenders .
Paula Owen , author of the report called The Ampere Strikes Back , said household appliances currently consumed about a third of an average home 's electricity .
But she warned this was likely to increase as a result of people buying more energy - intensive devices .
The simple message to people is switch things off when you have finished using them
Dr Paula Owen ,
Report author
" Your old - fashioned , bulky cathode ray tube TV on average consumed about 100 watts of electricity when it was switched on , " Dr Owen explained .
" What we are seeing now is a trend for much bigger flat - screened TVs .
On average , we are seeing a three - fold increase in the energy needed to power these TVs .
" Pretty much in every other sector [ such as fridges and washing machines ] , we find that as the technology moves on , the products get more and more efficient .
" Consumer electronics does not work like that . "
' Radio ga -ga '
The equivalent of 14 power stations will be needed just to power consumer electronic devices by 2020 , the report warned .
By that time televisions on standby will consume 1.4 % of all domestic electricity , it predicted .
Digital radios were also singled out by the report as being energy intensive .
" Traditional analogue radios consume about two watts when they are switched on , " Dr Owen said .
" We 've looked at digital radios and the average consumption of these is eight watts . "
She added that listening to the radio via digital TVs or set - top boxes had an average consumption of more than 100 watts .
Recent research by the communications watchdog Ofcom said that more than 80 % of UK homes now had digital TV .
More people are buying digital TVs or set - top boxes because by the end of 2012 the analogue TV signal will no longer be available in the UK .
But not all new technology was criticised by the report .
" Mobile phones and their chargers are one area where we have seen an improvement , " Dr Owen said .
A few years ago , she said , the current being drawn by chargers that were plugged in but not actually attached to a phone was about three to five watts .
" We have done some testing on the newest mobile phones and chargers you can buy today and reassuringly we could see that ' no - load ' consumption had fallen below one watt . "
But she added that the sheer volume of mobiles being used , about 63 million in the UK , meant that a huge amount of energy was still being wasted if people were not unplugging their chargers when they were not being used .
The report called for governments , manufacturers and retailers to do more to promote energy efficient devices , but also said consumers had a role to play .
" The simple message to people is switch things off when you have finished using them , " urged Dr Owen .

28 newfound planets in Milky Way spur hunt for Earth look - alikes
An artist 's concept of the Neptune - sized planet GJ436 b ( right ) orbiting an M dwarf star , Gliese 436 , at a distance of only 3 million miles .
With a density similar to that of Neptune , the exoplanet is an ice giant and probably has a rocky core and lots of water that forms ice in the interior under high pressure and temperature .
GJ436 b was discovered in 2004 by the California and Carnegie Planet Search team , and found by Belgian astronomer Micha�l Gillon in May 2007 to transit its star .

All of a sudden the Milky Way is filling up with far - off solar systems never seen before -- more and more planets of all shapes and sizes , wheeling in orbits around their own sunlike stars .
Astronomers on teams from UC Berkeley and Australia reported the discovery of 28 new planets all at once on Monday , and their leader -- working through the night all this week at the world 's biggest telescope in Hawaii -- is now on the hunt for rocky planets that might resemble Earth .
" An overarching question now is whether our own solar system is really alone , " said Geoffrey Marcy , the Berkeley astronomer whose team has led in the discovery of what are now widely known as " exoplanets . "
Marcy and many of his colleagues are in Honolulu for a meeting of the American Astronomical Society , and in telephone interviews and e-mails he said he and Katie Peek , 26 , a Berkeley graduate student , are scanning 70 more stars right now to seek still more of the increasingly common objects .
" It 's all most amazing and fascinating , " Jason Wright , a Berkeley postdoctoral fellow , said in a telephone conversation .
He and colleague John Asher Johnson described the group 's findings in detail at the astronomy meeting .
The 28 planets they and their Anglo - Australian colleagues reported bring the total number of exoplanets discovered to 236 since the first one was detected barely a dozen years ago , and now the rush is on .
The two teams reporting Monday said that besides the 28 planets they discovered during the past year , they also found seven brown dwarfs -- huge and strange objects much larger than Jupiter that are called " failed stars " because they never grew to a size and mass big enough to turn on their nuclear fires and blaze forth as true stars .
But among the confirmed solar systems detected during the past year , four of the stars hold at least two planets in orbit and maybe more that are as yet undetected , the astronomers said .
Two other stars hold objects that are even more puzzling :
They could be either giant gas planets or brown dwarfs , and only more investigations with more sensitive instruments will be able to identify them for certain .
Some of the new - found exoplanets , Marcy said , are " massive super - Jupiters , " orbiting far from their suns , while others are " hot Jupiters " orbiting less than 3 million miles out -- only a fraction of the distance Earth is from our own sun , about 93 million miles .
Marcy and Wright singled out one extraordinary planet that orbits a star called Gliese 436 that is much like our own sun and only 30 light - years away .
The Berkeley team found the planet two years ago , and only two weeks ago Michael Gillon of the University of Liege in Belgium detected it crossing the face of its sun and was able to determine its diameter for the first time .
Although Gliese 436's planet is the size of Neptune , the Berkeley team 's measurements show its mass is 17 times greater .
Most of the exoplanets are detected by the wobble their gravity causes in the suns they orbit , but the one around Gliese 436 is known as a " transiting " planet because its orbital path crosses directly in front of its sun as viewed from Earth .
Among the three Neptune - like exoplanets around other stars , Marcy said , " This one is the Rosetta stone .
It must be composed of a rocky core surrounded by large amounts of water compressed into a solid by the planet 's gravity " -- very much like Neptune and Uranus in our own solar system .
" The overarching theme is that many of the properties of our solar system are suddenly noticeably common among planetary systems in general , " Marcy said .
" Apparently , our solar system is structurally common ( with others elsewhere in the galaxy ) and its planetary inhabitants must have a common composition . "
And as Wright put it : " They 're starting to look more and more like real solar systems -- like our own . "
Whether the giant exoplanets fly in orbit close - in or far - out from their stars , both Marcy and Wright agree that smaller rocky planets like Earth and Mars could well be orbiting there , too -- some at " habitable distances " from their suns , where temperatures are benign and liquid water and the properties necessary for life could exist .
As the technology for detection improves -- and perhaps even now -- the chances of finding such distant exoplanets will improve , too , they agreed .
Marcy is hunting more exoplanets every night this week at the W. M. Keck Observatory atop Mauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawaii , where the twin telescopes are the world 's largest .
His team includes Debra Fischer of San Francisco State University , Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution in Washington , and Steven Vogt of UC Santa Cruz .
The Anglo - Australian group 's leaders include Chris Tinney of the University of New South Wales and Hugh Jones of Britain 's University of Hertfordshire .

I found myself at Home Depot on Friday .
I needed several pieces of wood , cut to size .
When I noticed this sign on the big saw , I took a picture , intending to write about how important it was to have key customer service features up and running .
Then , a few minutes later , a guy in an orange smock walked over , took the sign down and asked what he could cut for us .
It turns out ( at this Home Depot , anyway ) , that whenever they do n’t feel like using the saw , they pretend it ’s broken .
( Yes , technically , they did n’t say ‘ broken , ’ they said ‘ not working , ’ which is sort of true .
Except it was the saw operator who was n’t working . )
Sort of like the gas station that wo n’t let you watch them in the garage because of " insurance regulations " .
It might be a great shortcut , but it ca n’t possibly help in the long run .
PS notice the tag line on the sign .
" No one beats our prices , guaranteed … "
When was the last time you heard someone complain about the prices at Home Depot ?
Would you pay 50 cents extra to save half an hour at the checkout ?
Or a dollar extra to have a trained person help you find something ?

Almost half of children in some parts of Britain think that not having a mobile phone means a child is poor , according to a poll commissioned by Dare to Care , a new volunteering campaign aimed at tackling child poverty .
Not being able to afford to go on a school trip is the next most telling indicator of poverty for 44 % of children across Britain , and a similar proportion think that not having the correct school uniform makes you poor .
The survey , based on interviews with more than 700 children aged from seven to 16 , suggests they are acutely conscious of everyday indications that they or their peers do not have enough money .
They are also generally more aware of obvious signs of wealth such as a new uniform and school trips , or owning a mobile , than of the more hidden trappings of poverty , such as going to school without breakfast and not having a safe place to play nearby - both cited by just under a quarter of respondents .
Hilary Fisher of the Campaign to End Child Poverty , a coalition of 90 organisations which sponsored the research with the volunteering charity CSV , said it seemed the visible indicators of poverty were the ones children were most sensitive about .
" Not being able to afford school trips or the correct uniform leads to uncomfortable questions from their peers and in some cases can lead to bullying . "
The poll follows research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation indicating that missing out on trips and after - school activities can hold back poorer children despite a government focus on improving their education .
Documentation of an IBM / 360 assembly language program for online graphical - input character recognition using the RAND Tablet .
The program is written as a reentrant process and requires about 3700 32 - bit words of storage .
The user must provide his own programs for communicating with the Tablet and CRT display of symbols .
The program recognizes handprinted letters , numbers , punctuation marks , and geometric figures ; it separates characters written in quick succession and in close proximity .
As the user writes on the Tablet , the program tests the positional data for directions , corners , position , maxima and minima , and relationship to previous strokes .
When a set of strokes is recognized as a character , its stylus track is replaced on the CRT by a neat standard version .
About ninety percent of the characters are recognized correctly by the program ; correction by the user is easy .
The Memorandum consists mainly of the program printout , with extensive internal commentary .
Directions are appended for using the program with the standard IBM OS / 360 operating system and 2250 CRT display unit .

Highlights of the new series include a gay couple moving into Wisteria Lane , as well as the ongoing trials and tribulations of the original Housewives .
Teri Hatcher 's unlucky in love character Susan will try to settle down to domestic bliss with her new husband Mike , while Eva Longoria 's Gabrielle is set to begin an steamy affair with her tempestuous former husband Carlos

Weld - began drinking at a young age and attempted suicide at the tender age of 12 by ingesting aspirin , sleeping pills , and a bottle of gin .
" I had fallen in love with a homosexual and , when it did n't work out , I felt hurt . "

What has changed — and what seems to be the most likely explanation for the happiness trends — is that women now have a much longer to - do list than they once did ( including helping their aging parents ) .
They ca n’t possibly get it all done , and many end up feeling as if they are somehow falling short .
Mr. Krueger ’s data , for instance , shows that the average time devoted to dusting has fallen significantly in recent decades .
There have n’t been any dust - related technological breakthroughs , so houses are probably just dirtier than they used to be .
I imagine that the new American dustiness affects women ’s happiness more than men’s .
Ms. Stevenson was recently having drinks with a business school graduate who came up with a nice way of summarizing the problem .
Her mother ’s goals in life , the student said , were to have a beautiful garden , a well - kept house and well - adjusted children who did well in school .
“ I sort of want all those things , too , ” the student said , as Ms. Stevenson recalled , “ but I also want to have a great career and have an impact on the broader world . ”
It ’s telling that there is also a happiness gap between boys and girls in high school .
As life has generally gotten better over the last generation — less crime , longer - living grandparents and much cooler gadgets — male high school seniors have gotten happier .
About 25 percent say they are very satisfied with their lives , up from 16 percent in 1976 .
Roughly 22 percent of senior girls now give that answer , unchanged from the 1970s .
When Ms. Stevenson and I were talking last week about possible explanations , she mentioned her “ hottie theory . ”
It ’s based on an April article in this newspaper by Sara Rimer , about a group of incredibly impressive teenage girls in Newton , Mass .
The girls were getting better grades than the boys , playing varsity sports , helping to run the student government and doing community service .
Yet one girl who had gotten a perfect 2,400 on her college entrance exams noted that she and her friends still felt pressure to be “ effortlessly hot . ”
As Ms. Stevenson , who ’s 36 , said : “ When I was in high school , it was clear being a hottie was the most important thing , and it ’s not that it ’s any less important today .
It ’s that other things have become more important .
And , frankly , people spent a lot of time trying to be a hottie when I was in high school .
So I do n’t know where they find the time today . ”
The two new papers — Mr. Krueger ’s will be published in the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity and the Stevenson - Wolfers one is still in draft form — are part of a burst of happiness research in recent years .
There is no question that the research has its limitations .
Happiness , of course , is highly subjective .

" Eye of Sauron " Rotating long breakout point 2007
This uses a motorized 6 foot aluminium tube connected to the top of the TC .
The sparks will come mostly from the end of the tube and will trace out a circle slowly ( about 10 seconds per rotation ) .
The effect is dramatic on a long time exposure where a complete ring of sparks will be seen .
Motor is a 24 V aircraft control motor with solid reduction gears and a cast alloy casing run from a 12 V SLA battery after I toasted a 9.6 V NiCad .
( click to enlarge )
Above shows my 4 inch coil with the rotating breakout point in action and when stopped .
( click to enlarge )
A top view is even more dramatic in a 2 rotation 22 second exposure .
The " Eye of Sauron " .
Yes , I did stand dead still in the 22 seconds .
6 Megapixel version is available for print media for a token charge for this and most of the photos here .
Lots of comments on Digg , Overclockers and Hackaday about this .
( click to enlarge )
Above left is the much larger " Expanding Eye of Sauron " using an 11 foot ( 3.3 m ) extension .
Note the sparks to the tree on the right .
On the right is " Seen in the Eye of Sauron " with me in the spark free zone .
The yellowish ring is some masking tape catching fire on the tubing join .
( click to enlarge )
Above is the setup shown stationary with power off then on .
My wooden counterweight is on fire here .
" Aura of Sauron "
( click to enlarge )
And now the Aura of Sauron and the Sparks of Sauron .
These are some of my best effect photos and are not " photoshopped " although they are long exposures .
For these the Tesla coil is mounted 11 foot ( 3.3 m ) in the air and the rotating rod is attached to a long beam extended out above me .
( click to enlarge )
Perhaps the aura of Sauron 's ladder ?
( I have to climb up this to turn the rotation motor on and off )
( click to enlarge )
Above shows setup and testing .
I wonder if I should have taught my kids CPR ?
In the 4th photo , note the elevated Tesla coil with the rotating connection above the ladder about 11 ft ( 3.3 m ) off the ground .
In the last 3 photos , my chain mail butchers glove is grounded both to the plate I am standing on ( wet to improve conductivity ) , and to an earthed point nearby .
Next just add the Driza - Bone stockman 's riding coat , a hired dreadlocks wig , army surplus boots and you have the effect at the top .
I am also wearing the chain mail glove and some cycling gloves over that so the sparks can jump onto my outstretched hand .
Tesladownunders Car Theft Protection 2007
How about a " Sauron 's Eye " for your car ?
( click to enlarge )
My wooden counterweight is on fire here at the top of the coil .
It 's quite safe to be in the car although my son was apprehensive .
This was a Hyundai Getz hire car ( as I do n't own one ) and it still works .
I did get extra insurance " in case " .
Of course a Tesla Roadster from Tesla Motors would be the ideal car for this or a De Lorean .
( click to enlarge )
Construction photos .
There is a rod projecting out the top of the TC and the sparks will come from the tip of the rod .
If that rod is bent so that it nearly touches the ground it will spark to ground .
If you rotate the rod around the car it will form sparks as it traces out a circle .
If you take a long exposure then the sparks will all be on one photo giving a ring of sparks .
Again , lots of comments and links on hundreds of blogs and sites including Digg , humorous caption comments on Autoblog , Russian ( with 377 comments ) , and Japanese sites .
In total 200,000 website hits and perhaps 1,000,000 people have seen this on other sites since Feb 2007 .
Tesladownunders Car Theft Protection ( red car version ) 2007
( click to enlarge )
Above shows more of the same ( but a different hire car ) , experimenting with lighting and clearer sparks which are better centered .
The right photo is a shot of only 3 /4 of a revolution .
Well , you need a space to walk out do n't you !
Tesla Car Theft Protection ( video ) 2007
At last the video .
Had to hire the car on 3 different days to get lighting OK .
The video is much less tolerant of low light unless the frame rate is slowed a lot .
Budget was $ 300 for the car hire ( plus pizza ) .
Windows media video above ( 3.3 MB ) .
Slower start but higher resolution than the YouTube one below .
YouTube video .
Lower resolution , faster start .
Playback speed was increased to 300 % for the action scenes both to give a Charlie Chaplin , silent slapstick movie feel and to speed up the rather dull sparks in that light .
I did try to randomly interpolate 100 frames ( manually ! ) to give the effect of a uniform field but it was n't convincing .
Actual rotation speed is about 10 seconds per revolution which is easy for thieves to avoid I guess .
I did night time shots with great looking sparks but there was severe motion blur with the reduced frame rate and you could n't see the bad guy .
The brightest sparks are to the dummy thief ( stuffed with old blankets ) who had a grounded wire in his torso .
Smoke was from a smoke generator controlled by Chris in the car and timed to smoke at the time of the sparks .
It is the blue thing under the front bumper .
I wet the ground to intensify the sparks but did n't turn off the tap properly so there is a bit of a river through the scene .

Some behind the scenes shots during production .
Swimming Pool Sparks 2007
Taken in our backyard pool .
The salt water pool is very conductive like a big ground so there is absolutely no sensation .
People associate water and electricity with danger .
Like dropping the hairdryer in the bathtub .
But the danger only occurs if the water forms a path to you then ground ie if you touch the taps , bath drain or wet grounded floor .
( click to enlarge )
The chain mail glove has a copper braid attached otherwise it would be a problem if I had my hand right out of the water .
Only small sparks here as I do n't want wild sparks onto my nose .
Photo technique for the left photo was a flash PLUS a 0.5 second exposure to catch more sparks but still freeze the water ripples .
The smaller point and shoot camera was a better shot from the end of the pool as it shows the TC .
Water was 17 C and not pleasant .
I used a 12 inch loudspeaker magnet as a divers weight to allow me to sit on the bottom .
The right photo has a sort of Matrix feel about it .
( click to enlarge )
The photo above shows 100,000 volt sparks onto me in the pool wearing a " tin-foil hat " .
It is made of aluminum foil and tape on a aluminum rod support .
The back of the foil goes down into the water and is a low inductance path to the water .
I also have two solid wires into the pool .
There is no sensation at all when sparks hit me .
Not shown well are the fine protective steel wires that protect my face .
" Tin foil hats " originate from those rather alternative people who believe that it protects aliens from reading their minds .
Some guys at MIT even did a scientific study to show it does not protect from all radiation .
18 inch coil 2007
( click to enlarge )
Above top shows some shots of the 18 inch coil at higher power with a 3 foot rotating breakout point .
Still not really firing well with strong 6 foot arcs and only occasional 7 and 8 foot weaker arcs .
I did n't try retuning or altering coupling and I suspect the quenching is still not right .
It should be capable of better .
Bottom right photo shows an 11 ft radius rotating point with sparks extending over about 27 feet .
This was a step towards a shoot in a dome shaped building later in the year .
( click to enlarge )
Above shows the coil in 2005 under development , with a primary of magnet wire taped onto cardboard .
If you look closely you can see Mars about ' 2 feet ' above the coil on the left .
The above photos were from a night shoot at the Gravity Discovery Center .
Details here .
The left photo shows the " Eye of Sauron " effect with the arc going directly to ground in a heavy power arc .
But the spinning electrode is moving horizontally at 7 ft/sec .
The ground arc is well formed it pulls an arc out from the top until it is nearly the same length again before it extinguishes and starts the process again .
The power arcs are only 2 - 3 feet but the TC is running at 5 - 6 feet power .
The middle photo shows the " triple 7 " effect .
So why is the angle of the 7 so sharp ?
There are three competing forces .
The main one is to stay in the hot ionized channel .
Second is for the magnetic field effect to enlarge the angle outwards ( think rail gun forces to push the arc out ) .
This is counteracted by the electric fields encouraging the spark to take the shortest path .
It really is quite dramatic in action zap - stretch , zap - stretch .
The right photo again shows a full rotation which takes place in 7 seconds , perhaps 12 foot radius .
It gives a whole march of about 40 " sevens " .
Longest sparks 2007
This is a run with everything maxed out .
The spark gap was running at its optimum of 400 BPS and the series blower gap was on full .
I had a total of 0.11 uF of tank capacitance .
I tuned things by hand and with the tuner to 36 kHz .
The variac was on full and no ballast .
No idea what the current draw was .
I imagine 30 A plus .
I have a tape measure on the ground which was only really countable in the high res photos but was set at 11 feet .
The secondary winding length is 52 inches which gives a ratio of spark to secondary length of 2.3 which is fair enough .
( click to enlarge )
This is an 11 foot spark from my big coil .
They only happen occasionally though .
( something about the 3 longest sparks looks like a T. rex ) .
Tree of sparks 2009
This is meant to show the most sparks on a page .
It is a 63 second exposure of sparks from a rotating breakout point that is progressively raised in a spiral so sparks extend from ground level up to a high of about 18 feet .
( click to enlarge )
Hoping my umbrella will protect me here .
Note that this is the only double exposure with me next to the coil with it turned off on this page .
The rest are all real time .
I could have done it either way but did n't have enough help at the time .
Dalek cage 2007
This is a snug single person Faraday cage to enable the lucky person inside to get up close and personal with 6 foot sparks .
It 's shape is reminiscent of a Dalek from Dr Who .
Remember " We will ex- term - in - ate " .
It is a simple walk in and walk out affair , open at the back .
( click to enlarge )
It is constructed from fencing wire and a hanging basket planter .
It is earthed and should be safe as long as you do n't stick your fingers out .
I am standing on the earthed section .
Somehow the 3 foot sparks in the left photo look better than the 6 foot sparks on the right .
The sparkles are from some steel wool on the cage .
It is not really as impressive as you might think as the sparks are largely end on .
I have high efficiency earmuffs on and my glasses have a UV filter .
The brim of the " pork pie " hat lets me know when my head is getting too close to the cage and also keeps the iron sparkles out of my eyes .
There is a slight tickle of high voltage if you touch the cage lightly due to the voltage drop over the full height of the cage which is part resistive at the high currents and part inductive .
There is only minimal sensation when using the glove which has two separate earths to the cage .
I also lean on the cage as well with the glove .
I can also use it with my chain mail glove and I also have a little neon light a pink light saber ( but knife sized ) .
This was made for a video which has been shot for a BMW ad , more later .
( click to enlarge )
This is the view from inside the Dalek cage .
Difficult to get a good shot even with a wide angle lens .
Spark length is about 4 feet coming to about 4 inches .

Left photo is titled " Honey ... there 's some electrical interference ... "
The mobile phone actually works fine , just very hard to hear .
The right photo shows that you do n't need the cage - sort of .
The chain mail butchers glove has dual earth wires and I am holding a small neon light .
Multi-colored sparks 2007
These are some preliminary sparks taken on my ignition coil setup to demonstrate multi color effects .
( click to enlarge )
These are simply done by taking a long exposure ( 6 seconds ) and manually placing different colored filters in front of the lens at different times during that exposure .
The next step was to make a motorized system for some special effects coming up to simulate a famous fictitious Tesla coil .
I have now made a color wheel to allow rapid rotation of the colors or manual rotation .
This simply gets placed in front of the camera .
( click to enlarge )
The results with a Tesla coil are to give sparks that are different colors .
I am hoping to get green and other colors as well .
Each quadrant is held by one screw and slides out .
( click to enlarge )
Left photo with a 1 second exposure , shows the some shots at dusk .
Right photo with a 2 second exposure shows the various colors seen when the sparks are firing .
Now the good ones .
( click to enlarge )
This shows red sparks .
This effect is created by taking a normal white flash shot first to give the correct white background , then switching to the red filter and running the sparks for 10 seconds or so while the camera is recording .
It is all one single exposure and is what the camera sees , not a photoshopped effect added later .
( click to enlarge )
This shows multicolored sparks .
This effect is also created by taking a white flash shot first to give the correct white background then spinning the color wheel to get different effects .
6 inch coil ( the best ones )
( click to enlarge )
The 6 inch coil has performed better than expected with sparks reaching 8 feet ( 0.5 million volts ) .
The left photo above shows 8 foot sparks to the closest point of the ladder .
This is with a large topload and a tank capacitance of 92 nF ( 0.092 uF ) at a power in excess of 5 kVA .
A lot of smoke comes from my spark gap at runs of over 5 - 10 seconds at the highest powers .
I suspect it is metal oxide from the tungsten stationary electrodes and the brass dome nuts and steel bolt heads that form the rotary electrodes .
There was no sign of any polycarbonate frame or Tufnol wheel overheating .
Despite the leaf blower cooling , the tungsten rods become hot enough to have a visible glow though the yellow polypropylene box after turn off .
The 8 foot ( 96 inch ) spark is exactly 3 times as long as the 32 inch secondary coil that generates it .
Predicted maximum spark length by John Freau 's formula for 3 kW is 1.7 x sqrt 3000 = 96 inches .
For 5 kW it is 120 inches .
These seem to be most accurate for large ( 24 inch diameter ) coils .
A recently proposed correction by Dr Resonance gives spark length for a 6 inch coil = 0.85 x { 1.7 x sqrt ( power ) } .
This would suggest spark lengths of 79 inches at 3 kW and 100 inches at 5 kW .
( click to enlarge )
Earlier photos reaching up to 6 feet with a capacitor of 48 nF and a smaller topload at a power of about 5 kVA .
They are 10 second exposures showing a variety of types of sparks and streamers .
Lots of ground rail strikes resulting in arc -overs from the primary ( the bright spot in the right photo ) .
These improved with a smaller toroid under the larger one .
In these early photos , It is all supported by a stylish barstool and is precarious , particularly as the toroid is supported by a heavy 12 inch loudspeaker frame including magnet .
( click to enlarge )
This 10 second exposure demonstrates the shaping of the high electromagnetic fields around the main coil that directs away them from the axis of the coil .
The strong wind at the time shows the multiple sparks going down the initial ionized path of each main strike ( banjo effect ) .
This is best seen on the enlarged view .
4 inch coil 2003
( click to enlarge )
A shot outside the shed with the smaller coil ( above ) .
( click to enlarge )
These are from a demo at a Fete at our local high school in March 2003 .
This is my first public display and used an 8 ft square faraday cage constructed out of angle iron and chicken wire .
The Fete had a medieval theme so the theatrics involved Merlin the magician giving a magic class demonstration .
Then , using a butchers chain mail gauntlet earthed to the cage , I put my hand into the cage and turn on , giving the effect of lightning bolts coming from my hand which is close enough not to show any other streamers .
The ' lightning ' finger had a high intensity blue LED pulsating inside the gauntlet .
I then disappeared and changed into a scientist lab coat and gave a more contemporary explanation and a more conventional display with sparks to the cage 3 ft from the edge of the toroid .
Definitely a hands over the ears display .

I need a bigger shed as I am running out of safe standing room ! ( above )
( click to enlarge )
Above are shots of the Physics Dept Tesla coil .
The left photo shows 15 inch sparks from a 12 kV 30 mA coil .
The coupling and tuning was wrong and there were some potentially destructive racing arcs along the secondary .
The right photo shows a 36 inch spark from the 16 inch secondary using a 12 kV 110 mA transformer .
It is a daytime shot hence the sparks are low contrast .
There was an extra toroid to give extra capacitance as it had been tuned for use with a Faraday cage .
Mini coil
( click to enlarge )
Two inch sparks onto my hand .
There is some motion artifact with my hand but not the equipment or sparks .
This is done with a clear knowledge of earth paths and at very low power levels on a small coil with no toroid capacitance .
Wetting my hand beforehand reduces the sensation to a mild prickle .
This is potentially dangerous and should not be attempted on a large coil regardless of power input .
TC driving fluoro tubes 2009
( click to enlarge )
I have hooked up a string of six fluoro tubes to my rope between two trees 20 feet in the air .
I grounded one end and they ran well above the TC with no direct connection .
So how many can I do ?
( click to enlarge )
I then hooked up a string of a dozen fluoro tubes to my TC .
Worked fine but I wonder how much longer is possible ?
I have about 100 fluoro tubes ( the hospital saved their dead tubes for me ) and a long driveway .
( click to enlarge )
I have now hooked up 30 fluoro's in a 120 ft string and they work fine .
Can you see 3 of me in the middle photo ?
( click to enlarge )
A rearrangement of the string using about 19 of the tubes .
Sort of dwarfs me and the TC .
Note the rounding of the picture at the corners with the limit of my wide angle lens .
I had separate lead in wires from each side of the fluoro string to a block of wood that the spark in the right photo is striking .
( click to enlarge )
Here is a direct strike to the glass envelope of a fluoro which punctures it and over the next minute or so it stops working as air enters the tiny hole .
Michelangelo Creation of Adam 2009

The concept and hands for the above photos were provided by Graeme Minchin from Michaelangelo 's Creation of Adam .
Graeme is one of the organizers of Photo Night 2 .
Still not entirely happy with them re angle of Adam 's hand and exposure .
The blue lens flare was a problem but does n't detract too much .
It is a problem with sparks which are high intensity on a jet black background .
I had to light the hands without allowing any light onto the trees in the background .

Sparks here jump directly onto the camera cage .
The camera is in a protective cage and the wide angle lens captures most of the 7 foot spark on the right .
The left spark jumps to an aluminum tube just a foot or two in front of the camera .

Sure , umbrellas protect you from lightning ...
*****
My real tip for all coilers *****
Everyone wants the biggest sparks - right ?
My opinion : Do n't think of a TC as just an exercise in getting the longest sparks .
My longest spark photo on my index page is about the 43rd photo / video down because it does n't matter .
Spend money on a better camera / video / flash / tripod .
Do something different , take some fabulous photos .
Google " Tesla coil " images .
I currently have 20 of the top 100 photos there .
As it happens my longest sparks picture is about number 100 .
Many are of sparks or streamers are only 1 - 3 feet long but in the context of an Xmas tree or car thief protection or sparks in a pool that is fine .
All of my techniques are easily reproducible and were trivial compared with the original construction of the coil .
After years , I have still not seen a decent rotating breakout picture done by anyone else .
The Saga of the ARC Algorithm and Patent Discussions on Development 6 - Feb -2005 PostgreSQL development continues to research and implement leading edge technologies .
Recently an algorithm , ARC , was introduced , discussed .
Problems ensued regarding the patent of ARC fermenting other discussions .
This is an overview of those discussions .
ARC PostgreSQL uses a cache to save pages in it local memory for easy access of repetitive queries .
The basic idea is that once you read a page in , you hold onto it in case someone else needs it later on .
Many algorithms have been written and published over the years in an effort to select the algorithm which is the " most efficient . "
The algorithms determine the basis for keeping elements in the cache and the timing for freeing them .
" Most Efficient " is an elusive qualifier because the activity on different systems is , well , different .
Highly repetitive actions such as are TCP - C - like transactions tend to have a better performance with an LRU ( Least Recently Used ) algorithm that frees up the pages as necessary based on the recent usage count .
Database systems often use LRU algorithms but many are switching to other algorithms to better handle a variety of behaviors not handled well by LRU .
For example , one one - time very large sequential scan might flood the cache with pages that are not expected to be used again any time soon .
The cache then is not helpful until it is re-populated with more commonly used pages .
The PostgreSQL caching algorithm was LRU-K implemented by Tom Lane a few years ago .
The ARC algorithm tries to balance how frequently the pages are used as well as how recently the pages are used .
Theoretically , this keeps in the cache pages that are used more often in balance with those pages that are used more frequently .
It does this by tracking in two lists frequent pages and recent pages and determining dynamically the best balance of the two .
The details of any caching algorithm can be quite interesting and those who are interested are referred to the papers mentioned or linked as well as the detailed interesting discussion of the ARC implementation in the HACKERS archive .
PostgreSQL and ARC
In November 2003 , Jan Wieck proposed using implementation of an ARC ( Adaptive Replacement Cache ) algorithm for the PostgreSQL caching system .
This was based on what was described in the following paper and article and pointed out by Cuong Bui .
ARC : A Self - Tuning , Low Overhead Replacement Cache
USENIX File & Storage Technologies Conference ( FAST )
March 31 , 2003
August 2003 ; login One Up on LRU
The proposition was discussed on hackers .
Related and some unrelated issues were discussed , including vacuum changes , free space mapping , fsync calls and the factors or variables involved in the algorithm .
Jan then committed the ARC implementation into the ( then ) 7.5 code branch .
And Simon Riggs , Tom Lane and others began detailed testing which included reporting tool patches and bug fixes .
In the meanwhile discussion continued about the fine tuning the details and the relative impact on the planned background writer and vacuum changes .
Simon Riggs then brought up an update on the ARC idea : Sorav Bansal and Dharmendra S. Modha ,
CAR : Clock with Adaptive Replacement ,
in Proceedings of the USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies ( FAST ) , pages 187-- 200 , March 2004 .
This modified the the size of the two lists , adaptively , so that a " temporal locality window " was introduced .
These ideas were became part of the discussion concerning the list size limits primarily based on the shared buffers and the maximum number of backends .
Some of the discussion centered around the use of the effective_cache_size GUC parameter to configure the sizes of the cache lists .
Currently it is only used to inform the planner and to make index vs. table scan and join order decisions .
It was documented incorrectly and the correction for that was also proposed and applied .
The Patent Issue A special note here is important .
I am not a lawyer and probably all of the engineers involved in the discussions are also not lawyers .
For strict legal interpretations we will have to rely on the lawyers and the court system .
For better or worse .
Around January 17 , 2005 , it was discovered by Neil Conway that IBM had applied for a patent on the ARC algorithm on November , 2003 .
Thus the discussion turned to the implications of the patent application and removing the ARC code .
The code containing the ARC algorithm was targeted for the 8.0 release of PostgreSQL .
Because the patent was pending and not yet issued , Tom Lane suggested that we go ahead with the code as is and look into the issue as soon as possible after the release .
Discussion ensued regarding the effects of patented software on an open source implementation released under a BSD license .
Andrew Sullivan pointed out that it would be possible for the PostgreSQL Global Development Group to receive a cease and desist order requesting all code be eradicated from the net - - a big problem .
It was pointed out by Joshua Drake that the commercial distributors of PostgreSQL would not like a cease and desist order against them either .
This would be a particular problem for any company taking PostgreSQL and reselling it as closed source .
( This is perfectly legal under the BSD license . )
One of the greater fears was that the corporate users will get billed by IBM .
IBM does have a policy enabling open source projects to use its patents approved by the Open Source Initiative .
However , our BSD license says people can take PostgreSQL code and do * anything * with it .
Including any patents would preclude any third party from packaging and re-selling PostgreSQL .
It would require that they pay license fees or remove the patented code .
This changes the essence of the BSD license and so is not desirable .
The source code containing ARC is already out on the net in Beta and RC releases ( and now also as 8.0 ) .
And we know that people are not likely to upgrade quickly if they have moved PostgreSQL into a production system .
But there may be liability for those people who have ARC code on their system .
The eradication of the code on the net is a task for sisyphus .
It is pertinent that 1 ) we now knew about the possible patent and 2 ) this issue arose before a major release of possibly infringing code .
However , IBM has just applied for the patent -- it has not yet received the patent .
The algorithm was publicly published and therefore we assumed ( incorrectly ) it was available for use .
Of course incorrect assumptions have no legal bearing .
Nor does lack of due diligence in making an effort to find patents .
A side thread reviewed the general implications for handling patent issues and patent threats .
Josh Berkus and Bruce Momjian argued for a general policy for handling releases to rectify possible patent infringements .
Tom Lane argued that it is unlikely that IBM would sue us in the near future , destroying the good will they have established with the open source community .
And that we should not rely on that indefinitely .
We could never retroactively bring back all of the people who are running 8.0 beta and RC releases , but a change forward would be the right thing to do .
He still favored a replacement plan .
Jeff Trout suggested that perhaps we should talk to IBM .
Andrew Dunstan found a very recent paper on an on an alternative to ARC which claims superior performance .
Neil Conway suggested a more recent LRU algorithm , the LRU - 2Q system .
Replacing the algorithm in the PostgreSQL code is a non-trivial change .
This would require a major release of , say 8.1 because it would have a major impact on both performance and reliability .
It would be reducing our standards by dedicating anything other than a major release cycle of testing and beta .
While pointing this out , Tom Lane also suggested another possible route which would be changing the use of the current ARC algorithm to avoid the exact pattern specified by the patent .
At this point the two main lines of discussion clarified a bit .
It was understood that a change would be required pre-emptively in case IBM was granted the patent .
And discussion of both the release of the change and the nature of the change was required .
The change possibilities were changing the code to defeat the patent or replacing the algorithm altogether .
Which change chosen would factor into the timing of implementing it in a release .
Tom Lane brought up the idea of a release 8.1 which would not require an initdb from 8.0 .
This would facilitate the upgrade from 8.0 and signify a major version change if the decision were reached to change the algorithm rather than altering it .
On the other hand , having such a restriction on 8.1 would severely limit other development in progress that was counting on system catalog changes , requiring an initdb .
Some of these projects included shared dependencies and shared row locking .
It would also affect the plans of other long term projects not yet started .
Another angle on the issue of initdb for 8.1 is to resurrect pg_upgrade , an automatic way to upgrade major releases without an initdb .
Conjecture about release cycles was folded into the fact that we were still unsure about the nature of change required .
Without an immediate small change to the ARC algorithm the argument was to have a full development cycle , however theoretically shortened , to test and beta a full algorithm change .
However , some people , with faith in finding a smaller change or prior art that would by pass the patent , felt more strongly about a minor release , 8.0 .x .
It was also argued we could provide both an ARC and an LRU algorithm chosen at start up time given enough testing time .
Proposals about bringing back the LRU algorithm got some time , however most of them wanted additional modification that helped with the sequential scan flooding issue .
The discussion turned back on the patent 's affect on PostgreSQL and its potential effects .
It is clear that we based our algorithm on the ARC paper and did not come up with it entirely on our own .
Prior art was unknown .
It was repeated by some that IBM wo n't sue over this issue as long as we change it , but SCO 's name was thrown about as a counter argument .
The colorful phrase , " flying roosters butt " was also used .
Examining the patent application , at least the first bullet of using two lists to manage the caches has many cases in prior art including code in PostgreSQL dating back to the UC Berkeley days .
But we cannot guess which elements of the patent will be approved .
Therefore , Tom Lane argues , that it is reasonable to find out whether we do actually violate the patent while at the same time making a plan to remove or change the algorithm .
Heavy digging went on and turned up a number of additional papers that may or may not be prior art with regards to the ARC algorithm .
A couple of other people further pushed the previously unanswered question about contacting IBM directly .
Tom Lane pointed out , " People seem to be assuming that asking IBM is a zero - risk thing .
It 's not .
If they are forced to deal with the issue , they might well feel that they have to take action that we'd not like . "
And IBM might be pushed to acknowledge PostgreSQL as a competitor , something they 'd not like to do publicly .
In the meanwhile , PostgreSQL 8.0 was released and release 8.0.1 for a security issue was prepared and then also released .
The patent was neither rejected nor approved by the US Patent Office .
Neil Conway submitted a patch to revert to an LRU algorithm but there was not enough testing planned for it to go into a minor release .
It was pointed out that a US Patent would not hold the same weight in other countries and that PostgreSQL is an international group .
Software patents in Europe are growing out of favor .
This , however , does not deflect from the fact that the US Patent , if approved , would have enormous effect in the States as well as commercial PostgreSQL distributors .
In early February Tom Lane proposed an altered version of the ARC algorithm which more closely tied to the 2Q Paper published Johnson and Shasha .
Their 1994 paper had something very similar to ARC , but was not " adaptive " and the differences seemed to meet our needs of avoiding cache flooding .
The change would require more removal of code in the current PostgreSQL than adding code and seems a more conservative approach .
On February 3 , 2005 Tom Lane committed the small change to revise the ARC algorithm to eliminate possible patent infringements .
It was committed and to be released in the next versions of 8.0 and in 8.1 .

Like Greek philosophers and Brazilian soccer players , we routinely go by single names nowadays .
Just as asking for someone 's first name in years past seemed presumptuous , so does inquiring about their last name today .
( " Do n't get personal ! " )
When a waiter introduces himself by saying " I'm Jason .
I 'll be your server tonight , " responding , " What 's your last name , Jason ? " would be a serious breach of protocol .
In the first - name society , asking to be addressed by your surname sounds stuffy and old - fashioned .
Sticking to given names suggests breezy informality ; the verbal equivalent of wearing shorts to restaurants .
But other factors are involved here , ones that have little to do with informality .
" First - naming " someone you do n't know is an effective way to get the upper hand .
One way Southern blacks were kept in their place was by being called only by given names .
The reason police officers say little to drivers they 've pulled over before examining their license is so they can address them by their first name .
( " Do you realize how fast you were going , Edna ? " )
" It 's cop psychology to use first names when talking to a suspect , " says a policeman in Lawrence Sanders 's " The Second Deadly Sin . "
" It diminishes them , robs them of dignity .
Like stripping a man naked before you question him . "
Addressing those we 've just met by surname and honorific is a sign of respect .
( " Good to meet you , Mr. Jones . " )
Asking permission to address them by given name is an act of courtesy .
So is granting that permission .
This is why so many who grew up in a more mannerly time find it jarring to be first - named by someone who does n't know them .
They sense intuitively the disrespect involved .
A business consultant who asked readers of an Ohio newspaper how they felt about being addressed by their given names was inundated with responses .
Most did n't like the practice .
Older readers were particularly annoyed about being first - named by younger nurses , waiters , bank tellers , service personnel , and sales clerks .
One 81 - year - old woman left her dentist because his young hygienist would n't use her surname .
Another woman asked a salesman where he 'd learned to address customers by their first name .
" In business school , " the salesman responded .
Blame Dale Carnegie .
America 's original self - helper touted the " subtle flattery " of addressing new acquaintances by name .
Carnegie suggested we follow the lead of James Farley , Franklin Roosevelt 's postmaster general , who claimed to be on a first - name basis with 50,000 Americans .
Millions of Carnegie readers and course graduates followed Farley 's lead .
" Swingers " – who shared sex but not surnames – were another harbinger of the first - name society .
So were Summer - of - Lovers who routinely exchanged only given names or nicknames .
" A good hippie had no last name , " observed commune veteran Mark Vonnegut ( Kurt 's son ) .
The same thing is true of support - group members , especially ones in Twelve - Step gatherings that forbid use of surnames .
The more popular such groups have grown , the more comfortable it has become to address strangers by their first names .
Doing so feels casual , cordial , even intimate .
It is nothing of the kind .
Far from being intimate , sharing first names alone is impersonal .
Dispensing with surnames reflects wariness more than informality .
In a guarded time like ours , revealing two names to another person ratchets up one 's level of exposure .
Once someone knows both of your names , that person can guess your ethnicity , your ancestry , your country of origin .
He or she might be able to figure out who your parents are , and could have heard that your cousin Mike is in jail .
And , of course , those who possess your surname can Google you on the Internet .
In the ID free - for - all of cyberspace , chatters seldom share one genuine name , let alone two .
Cybercommunities are like an electronic Mardi Gras , a setting in which few participants are who they seem to be , and everyone can cut loose .
Central to this freedom is the careful guarding of one 's surname .
During years spent covering technology for The New York Times , reporter Michel Marriott found that using his actual name in chat rooms was a real conversation stopper .
Doing so made Mr. Marriott feel like a nudist at a costume party .
On and off the Net , not giving up our surname allows us to substitute candor for intimacy .
Like strangers on a train , those who do n't identify themselves fully are free to share secrets because they know their relationship has no traction .
No matter how friendly it may appear to first - name those we do n't know well , doing so seldom leads to actual friendship .
The promiscuous use of given names is too faux familiar .
What it really reflects is fear of genuine engagement .
By becoming a first - name society we 've exchanged the actual familiarity of two names for the feigned familiarity of one .

Kabir Joshi-Vijayan and Matthew Skogstad - Stubbs : A friend , returning from Caracas , described a bus attempting to scale a mountain , gradually making its way up the slope , frequently stalling or stopping as the engine sputtered , but eventually reaching the summit .
It reminded him of the Venezuelan revolutionary process .
Why do n’t we begin today by describing both the process and the impact that the Bolivarian revolution of today has had .
Could you lay out how the Venezuelan society , and the daily life of its people , has changed since Chavez ’s inauguration in 1999 .
Noam Chomsky :
There have been some changes .
I do n’t think they ’re dramatic .
This is probably the first time in Venezuelan history that there ’s a government that ’s making more than gestures towards using its huge resources to help the poorer parts of the population .
This is mostly towards health , education , cooperatives and so on .
Just how great the impact is it ’s pretty hard to say .
But certainly we know the popular reaction to them , which is after all the most important question .
What ’s important is not what we think about it , but what Venezuelans think about it .
And that ’s pretty well known .
There are pretty good polling agencies in Latin America , the main one is Latinobarometro , which is in Chile .
Very respected organization .
There are similar polls in the United States in less detail .
They monitor attitudes throughout Latin America on all sorts of crucial issues .
The most recent one in Chile , in December , found - as earlier ones have - support for democracy and support for the government have been rising very sharply in Venezuela since 1998 .
Venezuela is now essentially tied with Uruguay at the top in support for the government and support for democracy .
It ’s well ahead of the other Latin American countries in support for the economic policies of the government and also well ahead in the belief that the policies help the poor , meaning the huge majority , instead of elites .
And there are similar judgments on other issues , and as I say it has been rising rather sharply ...
Despite the obstacles there has been a degree of progress that has been considered by the population as very meaningful , and that ’s the best measure .
With the announcement of the creation of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela , PSUV , and the acceleration in their attempted appropriation of various services and companies , can you predict the maturing of this revolution ?
It ’s not easy to say .
There are conflicting tendencies , and the question for Venezuela is which one will prevail .
There are democratizing tendencies , devolution of power , popular assemblies , communities taking control of their own budgets , workplace cooperatives and so on .
All of that is building towards democracy .
There are also authoritarian tendencies : centralization , charismatic figure , and so on .
These policies in themselves you can’t really judge in which direction they ’ll go .
For a country to control its own resources is certainly perfectly reasonable .
Take , say Chile , which is considered the poster - boy of democratic capitalism , the advocate of the free - market , and so on and so forth .
That ’s the standard party line .
More or less suppressed in this story is that Chile ’s major export is copper - that ’s its main source of income - and the world ’s largest copper producer , CODELCO , is in Chile , and it happens to be nationalized .
It was nationalized by Allende , and it ’s still nationalized .
There are also private producers .
CODELCO , the government producer , provides probably ten times as much revenue to the state as the private ones , which send the revenue abroad .
And that funds what there is of Chilean social programs , and so on .
And many other countries control their own resources .
It ’s taken for granted .
So if Venezuela takes greater control of its own resources , that could be a very positive development .
On the other hand , it might not be .
So for example , when Saudi Arabia nationalized its oil in the 1970s , that did mean that they were controlling their own oil instead of foreign corporations - mainly ARAMCO - which is to the good .
On the other hand it ’s in the hands of a pretty harsh tyranny .
Washington ’s major and most valued ally in the region , which is a pretty brutal tyranny and the most extreme Islamist fundamentalist state in the world .
So the story depends on how the resources are used .
Mercosur , the common market of the southern cone , is a group that boasts the largest economies of South America .
It is founded on free - market style arrangements , like NAFTA , and does not seem to be leaning towards any alternative to the prevailing neoliberal doctrine .
Could you comment on the organization ?
Mercosur for the moment is more of a hope than an actuality .
It has plans , and has made some steps .
The latest Mercosur meeting was actually in Brazil , this past December , and it did lay plans along with the meeting of Latin American leaders in Cochabamba .
They ’re sort of making plans for a European Union type federation .
This is extremely important , historically the Latin American countries have been very much separated from one another , oriented towards the imperial power that happened to be dominant , most recently the United States .
Separated from one another there was no integration in Latin America , and moves towards integration are very significant , and they ’re just beginning really in a serious way .
Mercosur is part of it , Cochabamba meetings are another step , and there are other steps .
Integration is a powerful step towards maintaining sovereignty and independence .
When countries are separated from one another they can kind of be picked off , either by force or by economic strangulation .
If they integrate and cooperate , they ’re much more free from external control , meaning U.S. control in the last half - century - but it goes back much farther than that .
So that ’s an important step , but there are barriers .
One barrier is that there is also a desperate need in Latin America for internal integration .
Each of the countries has a very sharp divide between a small wealthy Europeanized , mostly white , elite , and a huge mass of deeply impoverished people , usually indian , black and mestizos .
The race correlation is n’t perfect , but it ’s a correlation .
Latin America has some of the worst inequality in the world , and those problems are also beginning to be overcome .
There ’s a long way to go , but there are steps towards them .
In Venezuela , in Bolivia , to some extent in Brazil , in Argentina , and not much elsewhere for the moment .
Maybe Ecuador , with the new government .
But both the internal integration and the external integration among the countries , these are quite important steps , and it ’s really the first time since the Spanish colonization 500 years ago , so that ’s of some significance .
Let ’s return to some of the criticisms of authoritarianism that have followed term extensions and the recent so - called enabling law .
Well those laws were passed by the parliament .
The parliament happens to be almost completely dominated by Chavez , but the reason for that is that the opposition refuses to take part .
Probably under U.S. pressure .
I do n’t like those laws myself .
How they turn out depends on popular pressures .
They could be steps towards authoritarianism .
They could be steps towards implementing constructive programs .
It ’s not for us to say , it ’s for the Venezuelan people to say , and we know their opinion very well .
Oil wealth in Venezuela has given the country the opportunity to extend aid to poor communities in the West , including New York and London , and it has allowed it to buy up the debt of Argentina , Bolivia and Ecuador .
Could you speak to the uses that Venezuela has put its oil wealth .
Let ’s begin with its aid to the West , which is a little ironic .
But there ’s a little bit of background to that .
It began with a program right here in Boston , where I am .
What happened is that a group of Senators approached the 8 major energy corporations and asked if they could provide short - term assistance to poor people in the United States , to get through the harsh winter , when they were unable to pay their oil bills because of the high oil prices .
They got one response , from Citgo , the Venezuelan owned company , and that one company did indeed provide temporary low - cost oil in Boston , then the Bronx in New York and elsewhere , to survive the harsh winter .
That ’s the Western aid .
So there ’s more to it than just Chavez giving aid .
As for the rest , yes Chavez did buy up a quarter , or a third of the debt of Argentina .
That was an effort to help Argentina rid themselves of the IMF , as the President of Argentina put it .
The IMF , which is sort of an off - shoot of the US Treasury Department , has had a shattering effect in Latin America .
Its programs have been followed more rigorously in Latin America than any other part of the world outside of Sub - Saharan Africa , and they ’ve been a disaster .
So take say Bolivia .
They ’ve been following IMF policies for 25 years , and at the end per-capita income is lower than it was in the beginning .
Argentina was the poster - child of the IMF .
It was marvelous , it was doing all the things right , they were urging everyone else to follow the same policies , same for the World Bank and the US Treasury Department .
Well what happened is it led to a total economic catastrophe .
Argentina did manage to get out of the catastrophe by radically violating IMF rules , and they determined to rid themselves of the IMF , as Kirchner put it , and Venezuela helped them .
Brazil was doing the same thing in its own way and now Bolivia is doing it with Venezuelan help .
The IMF is in fact in trouble because it ’s financing came largely from debt collection and if the countries refuse to accept it ’s borrowing because the policies are too harmful , well it ’s not clear what they ’re going to do .
There was also Petrocaribe .
A program to provide oil on favorable terms , with delayed payment , to many of the Caribbean countries as well to some others .
Another program was called Operation Miracle .
It uses Venezuelan funding to send Cuban doctors - Cuban doctors are very highly trained , they have a very advanced medical system , comparable to the first - world systems - to places like Jamaica , and other countries of the region .
It began by finding people who are blind , have completely lost vision , but could be surgically treated to recover vision , and they are identified by Cuban doctors , brought back to Cuba , and treated with their high - class medical facilities , and returned to their countries able to see .
That leaves an impression .
There was some effort apparently by the United States and Mexico to do something similar , but it never got anywhere .
In fact , the impact of Chavez ’s programs can be seen very clearly by George Bush ’s last trip .
The press talked about his new shift of programs towards Latin America , but what actually happened if you look , is that Bush was picking up some of Chavez ’s rhetoric .
That ’s the wonderful new programs .
Picking up some of the rhetoric of Chavez , but not implementing it .
Or barely implementing it .
The interview was conducted March 16th .
In just under two weeks , the latest instalment in the Kate Moss for Topshop story will hit the shops .
Conceived and designed in close consultation with Moss - the woman whose compelling sense of style has inspired a squillion shopping trips - it will prove very hot indeed .
And so it should .
Not just because it 's Moss - related .
But because it 's better than the launch collection ( which inspired scenes of wild - eyed consumer lust when it arrived on 1 May 2007 ) .
' It 's more confident , more original ... representing a grown - up , sexier Kate , ' according to Grazia
' It 's definitely more trend - driven this season , ' says Sara Buys , fashion features editor at Harper 's Bazaar .
' Rather than feeling like a succession of pieces that have been copied from Kate 's wardrobe , there are " feels " - punk , biker etc .
There 's a black chiffon dress with a plunging neckline , which was a real highlight for me . '
As well as Buys 's favourite frock , there are other attention - grabbing pieces .
There 's a cropped biker jacket designed with reference to Moss 's own vintage biker jacket , ' which was actually , ' a Topshop insider says , 'a child 's jacket , so she wanted to keep the feel of that - shrunken , cute , playful . '
There 's another dress , flapper - styled and bead - encrusted , that references the dress Moss wore to her 30th birthday bash at Claridges ; and yet another in black chiffon with a diamante collar - a piece which , according to industry whispers , Anna Wintour of American Vogue has expressed interest in .
There 's a roomy tan leather day bag ; a tweedy three - piece suit which features wide - leg trousers and a well - cut waistcoat .
But there are also some well - executed , more anonymous and understated offerings which will Kate - up your look nicely , without overwhelming it .
KM for TS Mark II is also interesting precisely because it is a second collection .
Historically , high street / celebrity collaborations barely make it through one scant outing , which ultimately proves to be little more than a promotional exercise for all concerned .
Topshop and Kate , however , is a convincing alliance .
Moss 's celebrity brand and Topshop 's consumer one are as accessible as they are credible , as high street as they are hip .
Philip Green , Topshop 's overlord , has done much to ally the store to Kate - they socialise together , get pap snapped together , and one of the select editors invited to look at previews observed ( somewhat nervously ) that Green had been very evident at the viewings .
Finally , it 's interesting because it 's testimony to the substance of Kate 's cachet .
Her first collection inspired record sales in the first two hours and performed consistently well over ensuing months .
' I bought stuff at the press launch and I 'm still wearing it , ' says Melanie Rickey , fashion features editor at Grazia .
' We [ fashion editors ] all are .
We were all there , scrabbling over it . '
Moss 's glamour quotient is vast and weirdly transferable .
And she 's uniquely good at infusing it into the things she wants to flog .
' Kate 's building the next level of her brand here , and it 's working , ' says Rickey .
' Her perfume launches next year and that 's predicted to shift £ 25 million in the first 12 months . '
Will Kate Moss end up being the biggest lifestyle brand on the planet ?
You bet .
· Kate Moss at Topshop is in store and online from 7 September
· The article above was amended on Sunday August 26 2007 .
The article above previews the autumn range by Kate Moss for Topshop , saying the collection will be available from 6 September .
Do n't rush : that should be 7 September .
This has been changed .
One of the most important rules of happiness in life is to do what you love .
You ’ve probably heard that advice a lot of times already .
Unfortunately , discovering that dream job and what you are meant to do in life is n’t always so easy .
Take a look at the happiest , most successful people on this planet .
They are all doing something they love , creating something they believe in , and living a life of purpose and passion .
Do that and it does n’t matter how much money you make .
But what do you do if you do n’t know what you want to do ?
If you do n’t know what your dream is ?
This is a common problem and many people wander through much of their lives without discovering their passion .
They go from one job to another , unfulfilled and miserable .
If that ’s you , do n’t give up .
What follows is a list of suggestions that will help you discover your dream and start on the road to living that dream .
They ’re things that have worked for me and many others I ’ve studied , talked to , interviewed and admired .
While you do n’t need to do every step below , they are all ways for you to spend time thinking about your passion in life , your dreams , and how to accomplish them .
Assess yourself
The first step is to ask yourself these questions :
What are your hobbies ?
This does n’t just mean stamp collecting .
It means anything you do with your spare time .
That could be collecting comic books , reading about history , programming Linux utilities , writing on your blog , writing poetry , cooking or anything that interests you .
As it ’s clear that this is how you like to spend your time and that you ’re willing to do those things without pay , it ’s very possible that these are your passions .
Give each of your hobbies some thought .
Think about whether they ’re things you love to do , and that you ’d love to do for a living .
What are your talents ?
It ’s been said that we each have at least one gift we ’ve been given and that the true purpose of our lives is discovering that gift and sharing it with the world .
There is much truth in that statement and an important part of this process is discovering your gift .
What are you good at ?
What talents do you have ?
And what have you shown an aptitude for in your current and previous jobs , in school , in your personal life ?
Anything goes here .
Who do you like to work with ?
A dream job includes not only what you want to do , but who you are doing it with .
You should truly enjoy working with these people .
In this step , you can name specific people you love working with or types of people ( creative types , programmers , entrepreneurs , blue collar , etc. ) .
Use your ideas to help you envision your dream job ( more on that below ) .
What do you like to work with ?
The tools of the job are very important .
If you love working with computers , that ’s a clue to your dream job .
If you love working with clay , paper , people or clothes , that ’s a clue .
Or if you like working with a hammer or a piano , consider that you ’re off to a great start in discovering your dream .
What environment do you enjoy working in ?
An office , a classroom , a construction site , the ocean , the forest ?
Where you work is also an important factor in your dream job .
When have you been happiest ?
Think back throughout all the previous times of your life , from childhood through adolescence , school , jobs , and hobbies .
Think about the happiest times of your life and what you were doing , who you were doing it with , and where you were doing it .
You may have dismissed some of these things for various reasons , but remembering that you were extremely happy during those times can make you realize why you were happy .
Try online tools
There are some great tools online for helping you find your purpose .
Here are just a few of my favorites :
43 Things :
This is a great way to see what goals others have , to list your own goals , to talk to others about common goals , and to get ideas and inspiration .
Also , see their article , How to Choose Achievable Goals .
One Question :
Take a test with questions to figure out your one purpose in life .
With articles to help as well .
List your top 5 passions
Now that you ’ve given various factors some thought and tried some online tools , make a short list of your top 5 passions .
If you do n’t have 5 , list as many as you have .
Then , compare your top 5 passions and rank them from top to bottom .
This will be your guide to making your dream a reality .
How can you turn your passions into your work ?
Of the top 2 to 3 passions on your short list , can any of them be turned into your life ’s work ?
What professions use those passions as a mainstay of their work ?
How would you get into those professions and do you think you would love what you do if you did them ?
Create a clear vision
Clarity of vision is the key to achieving your dream once you ’ve discovered it .
Take some time to think about the following :
What your dream is
What your dream job would be
How you see yourself doing it
Where you are
What you ’re surrounded by
Who you ’re working with
What tools you ’re using
The benefits to you and others .
Write your answers down and try to make it as clear as possible .
You should be able to visualize your dream in your head .
The more real it seems in your mind , the more likely it is that it will become reality .
Create a road map
Once you ’ve clearly pictured your destination , what ’s left is creating a map for getting to that destination .
Try backwards planning : what ’s the last step you ’d have to do before attaining your goal ?
What would the last step be before that step ?
Keep going backwards until you get to the first step .
Then focus all your efforts on that first step .
Brainstorm
Sometimes , there are more than one road to get to a destination .
Brainstorm a bunch of ideas for getting there as well as actions you can take to move yourself closer to your destination .
Then , put them together into your road map .
Even if you do n’t have a complete road map , having a clearly defined destination and taking the first step are enough to get you started .
Do research
Learn as much as you can about your dream .
Check out some books from the library , do some web surfing , and talk to others who are knowledgeable .

Find out what steps they took to get there , what ’s required , and how they did it .
Then , use that information for your road map .
Practice , practice
While you ’re taking your steps to realizing your dream , practice your passion as much as possible .
Practice , of course , makes perfect .
You want to be as good at what you want to do as humanly possible .
This is n’t an easy step , but it ’s worth it .
Get inspired
Find others who are trying to achieve the same dream , see what obstacles they ’ve faced , and how they ’ve overcome them .
Put up photos from magazines to inspire you .
Read motivational quotes .
If you ’re inspired , you will have the energy needed to get there .
Get motivated
Along those lines , find motivation to keep you on your path .
Motivation and focus are the keys to achieving any goal .
What are your motivations ?
Making a public commitment , setting up rewards , inspiring yourself , tracking your progress , and joining a support group or finding a partner are great ways to motivate yourself .
Simplify : one purpose
Once you ’ve defined your dream , focus on it completely .
That means you need to put any other goals on the back burner for now .
Have only one purpose in your life .
Later , you can focus on other goals .
However , if you have multiple goals , you will become distracted and you ’ll lose purpose .
Focus .
Simplify your life so that you are keeping your focus on that one thing .
Use a mantra
A great way to keep yourself focused is to use Guy Kawasaki ’s idea of creating a mantra instead of a mission statement .
Boil your goal down to a few words .
Guys ’ mantra : empower entrepreneurs .
What ’s yours ?
Once you ’ve defined your mantra , print it out , post it up , and say it several times a day .
Set aside time each day
You will not go anywhere if you do n’t devote time to your dream .
Set aside an hour ( or at least 30 minutes ) each day for working towards your dream .
If you can do more , do it .
However , one step at a time can also work .
Set aside time either in the morning or in the evening .
Make it a habit and you will succeed .
Pretend you ca n’t fail
Imagine that you cannot fail , that you may slip up and fall , but that you will get up and learn from that fall .
Take away all fear of risk and loss and believe in your success .
Now , act as if you cannot fail .
And by acting so , you will make it happen .
Live as you want to be remembered
How do you want to be remembered when you die ?
This is a common method for deciding how to live your life .
If you want to remembered for realizing your dream , then do n’t start on it when it ’s too late .
Start on it now .
Live your life so that your dream actually comes true .

BitLet is a cute web - based Java applet that allows you to download . torrent files on a computer that does n't have a BitTorrent client installed .
Very useful if you want to share a torrent with your BitTorrent illiterate friends , or if you 're on a computer that does n't have a BitTorrent client installed .
BitLet is still in an early stage of development , but it is already fully functional .
More features , such as uploading local . torrent files , will be added to the site and the Java Applet in the near future .
I ’ve tried it with a couple of torrents and it seems to be working quite well , just enter the url of the .torrent file and you ’re good to go .
The download speeds are decent and does n’t require any configuration , so it ’s pretty much idiot - proof .
BitLet also has a very useful code generator so you can offer BitTorrent downloads on your blog or website so that people can easily download , even when they do n’t have a BitTorrent client installed .
If people click on the link a popup window will appear , and the download starts immediately .
Here ’s an example download link :
Steal This Film !
If everything works like it should you ’ll get a popup window similar to the screenshot below , it currently shows the download speed , percentage completed , and even a status led that signals potential problems ( green is good ) .
BitLet uses the Sun Java platform , if you encounter any problems , try installing the latest Java Virtual Machine plugin from Sun .
Personally I think that BitLet is a great way to make BitTorrent available to the occasional downloader who is not familiar with it at all .
It could also be very helpful if you want to download a torrent on a PC that does n’t have a BitTorrent client installed , like work or school for some people .
It ’s not a replacement for the regular BitTorrent client , but it sure is a great addition .
BY IRAQ'S recent bloody standards , the violence this week in Basra , the country 's second city and its southern capital , was small potatoes .
A few protesters were shot dead and a police barracks stormed by British troops after Iraqi police arrested , and then refused to release , two of their comrades .
Yet it revealed , once again , the alarming potential for chaos in one of the country 's most peaceable areas — which , all the more worryingly , happens to be a heartland of the country 's Shia rulers and the repository of most of Iraq 's oil .
For America 's more embattled troops , under fire in the Sunni areas farther north , it will be little consolation to know that if , as is often said , the British are better - loved by the locals , the love is quickly lost .
Tensions started boiling on September 18th , when British soldiers arrested the Basra boss of the Mahdi Army , a militia loyal to Muqtada al - Sadr , a fiery Shia nationalist , who twice last year set southern Iraq ablaze .
They accused him of organising roadside bombs that have killed nine people , including two British soldiers , in the past two months : a sign perhaps , that Mr Sadr 's people are rethinking their always - weak support for the democratic process .
This was also signalled by a day of violent clashes across the south after the unveiling of a new draft constitution last month , between Mr Sadr 's lot and members of another Shia militia , the Badr brigade , which is backed by Iran and loyal to the dominant party in Iraq 's government , the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq ( SCIRI ) .
After the arrest in Basra , several hundred Sadr supporters took to the streets , spoiling for a fight .
To their undoubted delight , the next day , Iraqi traffic policemen arrested two British special - forces soldiers in disguise , suspecting that they were spies .
Having spread the rumour across the city — and saying they were spying for Israel — the Sadrists persuaded the police to hand the soldiers over to them .
British troops then drove an armoured vehicle through the perimeter wall of the police station where the hapless pair had been held , and later sprung them from the private house where they had been taken .
A handful of Sadrists were killed in protests , which went on through the week ; the British consulate in Basra came under rocket attack for the first time in several months .
According to a Basra teacher : “ Whether the prisoners were Israeli terrorists or just a bad version of Lawrence of Arabia , the British have shown their disdain for justice . ”
Given last year 's violence , the altercation was not surprising .
Nor was the British willingness to use muscle : as Britain 's death toll in Iraq rises towards 100 , its troops are much less likely to assume the “ soft posture ” , doffing helmets and donning berets , that won them praise in the occupation 's early days .
Not that this is likely to intimidate their foes : with only 8,500 troops , plus a few hundred Italians , Australians and other allies under their command , the British are too few to secure southern Iraq .
Nor are the Iraqi Security Forces ( ISF ) they have trained , mostly several thousand police , up to the task .
Peace prevails in the south , as this latest episode suggests , at the Islamist militias ' decree .
According to Basra 's previous police chief , barely a quarter of the city 's police are dependable .
Most are probably moderate — and they do a reasonable and improved job of combating petty crime .
But they will not stand against the militiamen in their ranks , who are a very bad lot indeed .
At least two journalists , one American and one Iraqi , have been murdered in Basra in recent weeks : both were investigating the militias ' activities , which include running protection rackets and assassinating rivals , before their bodies are dumped in a rubbish tip on the edge of the city known as “ the lot ” .
When not thus engaged , the militias rigorously enforce Islamist strictures , beating up women who show an ankle or attacking students enjoying an innocent picnic .
A British officer struggled to sound upbeat this week .
“ There 's an unstable sort of stability in Basra , ” he said .
The city 's governor , Muhammad al - Waili , does not paint a much happier picture .
He condemned Britain 's actions as “ savage , barbaric and irresponsible . ”
Mr Waili is a member of Fadhila , an Islamist party that fell out with Mr Sadr and has close ties with the ayatollahs in Iran 's holy city of Qom .
Badrists v Sadrists
Yet Basra may be the most tightly controlled of the four southern “ British ” provinces .
Of the rest , Muthanna , home to a small Australian garrison , is fairly tranquil , but dominated by the local officials of SCIRI .
Farther east , much of Maysan , bordering Iran , including the city of Amara , near where six British military policemen were killed in 2003 , is out - of - bounds to British troops ; SCIRI 's Badr Brigades and the Sadrists vie for control of Maysan as well as neighbouring Dhi Qar province , especially its main town of Nasiriya , where a small garrison of Italian troops is loth to leave its base .
America 's government , and many in Iraq 's also , like to see Iran 's hand in all this .
Donald Rumsfeld , the defence secretary , this week warned Iran not to meddle in Basra .
And it does seem likely that individuals in all of Basra 's main factions are taking the Iranian rial .
Though they spend a lot of time squabbling , Basra 's four main parties are all dominated by conservative Shias who would like an Islamist state modelled on Iran .
To some extent , each party also sees the British as rivals for power , and wants to see them go .
They may get their wish fairly soon .
Britain hopes to quit Muthanna , and perhaps Maysan , this year , and Dhi Qar and Basra next year .
As this week 's violence shows , it will not be a glorious exit : nowhere in southern Iraq is the central government in firm control .
Yet with so few forces to control so vast and vexed a region , the British have never pretended to be doing much more than paper over the cracks .
For their American allies , more is at stake .
They are increasingly pushing the better units of the 180,000 - odd , mostly American - trained , Iraqi forces to the fore in the counter - insurgency , and with some success .
Iraqi troops involved in the attack on the northern town of Tal Afar this month , combining 8,500 Americans and Iraqis , fought much better than those given a rearguard role in the assault on Fallujah last November .
But top - class ISF units are still few .
“ It 's certainly our goal that in 2006 the Iraqis are out in front in counter - insurgency operations , ” says General John Abizaid , chief of America 's central command .
“ However , I can't tell you that we will achieve that goal . ”
Dalian , China
In the last few weeks , I happened to visit Doha and Dalian , and I must say : I was stunned .
Before explaining why , let me acknowledge that chances are you ’ve not visited Doha or Dalian recently .
Indeed , it may be — I presume nothing — that you have never heard of either city .
Doha is the capital of Qatar , a tiny state east of Saudi Arabia .
Dalian is in northeast China and is one of China ’s Silicon Valleys because of its proliferation of software parks and its dynamic , techie mayor , Xia Deren .
What was stunning is that I had n’t been to either city for more than three years , and I barely recognized either one .
In Doha , since I was last there , a skyline that looks like a mini-Manhattan has sprouted from the desert .
Whatever construction cranes are not in China must be in Doha today .
This once sleepy harbor now has a profile of skyscrapers , thanks to a huge injection of oil and gas revenues .
Dalian , with six million people , already had a mini-Manhattan when I was last here .
It seems to have grown two more since — including a gleaming new convention complex built on a man-made peninsula .
But this , alas , is not a travel column .
It ’s an energy column .
If you want to know why I remain a climate skeptic — not a skeptic about climate change , but a skeptic that we ’re going to be able to mitigate it — it ’s partly because of Doha and Dalian .
Can you imagine how much energy all these new skyscrapers in just two cities you ’ve never heard of are going to consume and how much CO2 they are going to emit ?
From National Geographic News : Brown anole lizards on tiny islands in the Bahamas were enjoying the good life , untroubled by a lizard predator found on larger islands nearby .
But all that changed when biologist Jonathan Losos of Harvard University in Cambridge , Massachusetts , appeared on the scene .
Losos 's team experimentally introduced predatory curly - tail lizards onto six islands where the ground - dwelling anoles had been living free of predators , sparking a see - saw year of natural selection .
For the smaller anole lizards , a trait that was advantageous in November - six months after the introduction - had become a liability by May .
... The evolutionary experiment , reported in tomorrow 's issue of the journal Science , reveals that , even though evolution can seem like a slow process , its driving force - natural selection - can shift like the wind .
... The study also supports a somewhat controversial idea in biology : Animals ' behavior in response to environmental change can spur evolutionary adaptations .
" In most cases in evolutionary biology , you have to look back and speculate what might have happened , " Cameron Ghalambor said .
" [ Losos 's study ] captures the changes as they occur .
We 're getting a window into what is actually happening in the very early stages of evolutionary change . "
The new perspective may help biologists better understand evolution in the lizard genus Anolis , which contains about 400 species including the brown anole .
A number of Anolis species are tree - dwellers with small hind limbs .
Losos says that at least some of this diversity may be the result of a process similar to the one his team observed .

Rapid Temporal Reversal in Predator - Driven Natural Selection

As the environment changes , will species be able to adapt ?
By conducting experiments in natural environments , biologists can study how evolutionary processes such as natural selection operate through time .
We predicted that the introduction of a terrestrial predator would first select for longer - legged lizards , which are faster , but as the lizards shifted onto high twigs to avoid the predator , selection would reverse toward favoring the shorter - legged individuals better able to locomote there .
Our experimental studies on 12 islets confirmed these predictions within a single generation , thus demonstrating the rapidity with which evolutionary forces can change during times of environmental flux .
Read Jonathan Losos ' paper " Adaptation and speciation in Greater Antillean anoles " ( Open Access / Free )
Opening paragraph
This section first reviews the evidence that both speciation and adaptation played important roles in anole diversification , focusing primarily on the anoles of the Greater Antilles ( Cuba , Hispaniola , Jamaica , and Puerto Rico ) .
It then addresses the extent to which the two processes are intimately linked .
The theory of adaptive speciation presents one mechanism by which the two processes might occur in an integrated fashion , but there are other possibilities .
In part this requires a discussion of what constitutes a species of Anolis , so that it is possible to recognize when two lineages have diverged to the level of different species .
Finally , this section addresses some exciting new developments that affect our understanding of the processes important in anole adaptive radiation .

“ There ’s not a whole lot of story — it ’s basically right to the sex , but we ’re consistent with the quality , ” he said , noting that the company is also careful to pick interesting backdrops .
“ We use different locations , rooms and couches . ”
Red Light ’s sales have dropped more than 30 percent in the last two years .
To counter the trend , Mr. Joseph says the company plans to start giving film buyers an extra promotional DVD with more scenes from its movies , which typically cost $ 20 .
He also plans to improve the packaging of his DVDs .
A similar tactic is planned by Sean Logan , chief of Nectar Entertainment , which has made movies like “ Exxxtasy Island . ”
Business is down 25 percent in the last year , Mr. Logan said , and , because his movies cost $ 50,000 to $ 80,000 to make , he cannot afford to compete with some DVD competitors who are dropping their prices as low as a few dollars a film to maintain their volume of sales .
But Mr. Logan said he could improve his packaging for retail shelves .
He has begun adding a sleeve around his box covers that includes a foil logo and metallic sheen to bring out the images , as was done on “ Brazilian Island Trilogy . ”
He said he was sticking to his plan to shoot his movies in exotic locations like Brazil or simulating them with elaborate sets .
For the movie “ Mystified , ” Nectar built an elaborate set that included a waterfall in a warehouse in Canoga Park , Calif .
It is not your everyday backdrop for hard - core sex , Mr. Logan noted : “ It looks like ‘ Lord of the Rings . ’ ”
Nectar , like Red Light , recently introduced a redesigned Web site to compete better online .
Nectar charges $ 29.95 a month for access , which allows members to look at thousands of still photos and stream 35 movies from its library .
But this is a far cry from the price and the volume of free X - rated content available on some sites .
One site operated by Adult Entertainment Broadcast Network has 200,000 videos , many of them submitted by amateur videographers , said Scott Coffman , the company ’s president .
A critical stage in human evolution that turned our early ancestors into fast and fearsome hunters has been identified by British scientists .
The dramatic shift came with the birth of the spring - like Achilles tendon at the back of the heel , which allowed early humans to break into a powerful run for the first time in history .
The shift saw humans move away from a slow - paced life of scavenging , as their newly - found speed and agility gave them the ability to chase and capture prey .
Evidence from the fossil record suggests humans first developed Achilles tendons more than 2 m years ago , before the rise of Homo erectus , the first human ancestor to become a true hunter - gatherer .
Scientists led by Bill Sellers , a biomechanics specialist at Manchester University , made the discovery after modelling the gaits of early humans on computers .
The researchers took information on bone and muscle structure from fossil records and used it to reconstruct the likely walking style of Lucy , the famous 3.2 m - year - old human ancestor called Australopithecus afarensis , whose remains were discovered in Ethiopia in the 1970s .
The models showed that while Lucy was able to walk upright , she was slower than modern humans because her limbs were shorter .
But the researchers also found that Lucy was unable to run until they adjusted the model to include an Achilles tendon .
" If Lucy had no Achille 's tendon , she'd be far too ineffcient to be any sort of pursuit runner , though she could still scavenge already dead prey , " Dr Sellers told the British Association festival of science in York yesterday .
" Running is very odd without the Achilles tendon .
You do n't have the power and you need a lot of power to get off the ground .
The tendon lets you store a lot of power so you can spring from step to step , " he said .
The researchers found that an Achilles tendon would have allowed early humans to move nearly twice as fast as before .
Energy stored in the tendon acts like a spring , and improved the efficiency of their gait by more than 100 % .
While most fast land animals have evolved strong heel tendons , the Achilles tendon has a more complex history along the human evolutionary path .
Gibbons , which split with human ancestors 20 m years ago have Achilles tendons , but modern chimps and gorillas lack them , probably because they are of little help for animals that walk on all fours or spend time in the trees .
Dr Sellers said fossil experts should now be able to pinpoint the moment humans gained the ability to run by re-examining the remains of our ancient ancestors .
" How we evolved from our common ancestor with chimpanzees six million years ago is a fundamental question .
Walking upright seems to be the very first thing that distinguishes our ancestors from other apes , so finding out about this should help us map the evolutionary pathway to modern humans .

Save time and code with XPath 2.0 and XSLT 2.0
Create easy - to - maintain stylesheets with the to operator , the item data type , and sequences
One of the major new concepts in XPath 2.0 and XSLT 2.0 is that everything is a sequence .
In XPath 1.0 and XSLT 1.0 , you typically worked with trees of nodes .
The parsed XML document was a tree that contained the document node and its descendants .
Using that tree of nodes , you could find the node for the root element , along with all of the root element 's descendants , attributes , and siblings .
( Any comments or processing instructions outside the root element of the XML file are considered siblings of the root element . )
When you work with an XML document in XPath 2.0 and XSLT 2.0 , you use the sequence in the same way as the tree structure in XPath 1.0 and XSLT 1.0 .
The sequence contains a single item ( the document node ) , and you use it the same way you always have .
However , you can create sequences of atomic values .
Listing 1 , taken from the upcoming sample application in which you 'll manage the data for a 16 - team single - elimination tournament , shows an example of a sequence of atomic values .
Listing 1 . A sequence of atomic values
< xsl:variable name = " seeds " as = " xs:integer * " > < xsl:sequence select= " ( 1 , 16 , 8 , 9 , 5 , 12 , 4 , 13 , 6 , 11 , 3 , 14 , 7 , 10 , 2 , 15 ) " /> </xsl:variable >
This code defines the variable $ seeds .
The new < xsl: sequence > element defines , as you might expect , a sequence of items .
In this case , the items are XML Schema xs:integer s.
The new as attribute defines the data type of the variable , and the asterisk ( xs:integer * ) means that the sequence contains zero or more integers .
In XPath 1.0 and XSLT 1.0 , you would create 16 different text nodes and then group those nodes into a variable .
In XPath 2.0 and XSLT 2.0 , the sequence acts as a one - dimensional array of numbers , which is exactly what you want for the sample application .
Sequences follow a couple of rules .
First , they can't contain other sequences .
If you create a new sequence from a sequence of three items , followed by another sequence of three items , the result will be a new sequence of six items .
Second , sequences allow you to mix nodes and items .
You can create a sequence that contains the atomic values shown in Listing 1 , plus all of the < contestant > elements , as shown in Listing 2 .
Listing 2 . A sequence of nodes and atomic values
< xsl:variable name = " seeds " as = " item ( ) * " > < xsl : for - each select= " / bracket/contestants /contestant " > < xsl : copy - of select= " . " /> </xsl:for-each > < xsl:sequence select= " ( 1 , 16 , 8 , 9 , 5 , 12 , 4 , 13 , 6 , 11 , 3 , 14 , 7 , 10 , 2 , 15 ) " /> </xsl:variable >
The variable $ seeds contains all of the contestant nodes and the 16 atomic values you used earlier .
Notice that the data type of the variable is item ( ) * .
An item is a node or an atomic value , so this variable can contain anything .
Now that you know the basics of sequences and items , let 's look at the to operator , which is new in XPath 2.0 and XSLT 2.0 .
It allows you to select a range of integers .
For example , you might create a sequence as shown in Listing 3 .
Listing 3 . A sequence of integers created with the to operator
< xsl:variable name = " range " as = " item ( ) * " >
< xsl:sequence select= " 1 to 16 " /> </xsl:variable >
This code creates a variable named $ range that contains the integers 1 through 16 .
In the sample application , you can use the to operator as a looping mechanism , as shown in Listing 4 .
Listing 4 .
Using the to operator for looping
< xsl : for - each select= " 1 to 32 " > <!--
Do something useful here --> </xsl:for-each >
Before you build the stylesheet , look at the sample application in more detail .
Understanding the sample application
In sample application for this article , you 'll manage the data for a 16 - team single - elimination tournament .
As you 'd expect , the tournament data is represented in XML .
You 'll create an XSLT 2.0 stylesheet that transforms the XML data into an HTML table that demonstrates the results of the tournament .
Listing 5 shows the XML document format .
Listing 5 . XML document with tournament data
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?>

In the < title > element , you can see the name of the tournament , RSDC Smackdown .
This document represents the actual results from a session at this year 's IBM Rational Software Developer Conference .
A bracket contains 16 < contestant > elements , each of which has a name ( its text ) , a seed , and an image .
A 16 - team tournament consists of 15 matchups .
Each matchup is represented by a < result > element .
Four pieces of data are associated with each matchup : the round of the tournament in which the matchup occurred ( the round attribute ) , the seeds of the two contestants ( stored in the firstSeed and secondSeed attributes ) , and the seed of the winner ( the winnerSeed attribute ) .
Your task is to take this XML document and transform it into an HTML table that illustrates the results , as shown in Figure 1 .
Figure 1 .
The tournament results in an HTML table
The table has 32 rows and five columns .
Using an XSLT 1.0 approach , you might build the HTML table one row at a time , as shown in Listing 6 .
Listing 6 . Building the HTML table one row at a time
<!-- Row 1 --> < tr> < td style= " border : none ; border - top : solid ; border - right : solid ; " > < xsl:text > [ 1 ] </xsl:text > < xsl:value - of select= " $contestants [@seed = ' 1 ' ] /> </td > < td style= " border : none ; > </td > < td style= " border : none ; > </td > < td style= " border : none ; > </td > < td style= " border : none ; > </td > </tr> <!-- Row 2 --> . . .
That would work , but the stylesheet would be difficult to maintain .
The code for each row and column is repeated throughout the stylesheet .
The main problem here is that you need 32 rows in the output table .
Each of the 32 rows contains data from an element in the XML document ( either a < contestant > or a < result > ) .
Unfortunately , you do n't have 32 elements you can iterate through .
You might use < xsl : for - each select=" contestants/contestant|results/result " > , but those elements do n't appear in the order in which you need them in the table .
XSLT 1.0 does n't have many tools to help you with this .
You can refactor the code to make the stylesheet much simpler .
There are patterns in the style and content of the cells , and you can use the new features of XPath 2.0 and XSLT 2.0 to iterate through those patterns .
The final stylesheet is roughly 70 % smaller than the ( admittedly clumsy ) original version .
Before you build that stylesheet , let 's look at how to refactor the code .
Refactoring the code - Calculating table cell styles
To refactor the code , start moving the style information to a CSS stylesheet .
As you can see in Figure 2 , the HTML bracket table has five different cell styles : None , MatchupStart , MatchupMiddle , MatchupEnd , and Solid .
Figure 2 . Cell border styles in the HTML table
Listing 7 shows what the CSS code looks like .

. None { width : 20 % ; } . MatchupStart { width : 20 % ; border : none ; border - top : solid ; border - right : solid ; } .
MatchupMiddle { width : 20 % ; border : none ; border - right : solid ; } .
MatchupEnd { width : 20 % ; border : none ; border - bottom : solid ; border - right : solid ; } . Solid { width : 20 % ; border : solid ; }
The border styles make it easy to see the results of the tournament .
The horizontal lines joining two cells indicate that those two competitors faced each other ; the cell with the solid border in the following column indicates the winner of the matchup .
Looking at the border styles , you can see a definite pattern :
For each pair of competitors , the cells before the first competitor have no border ( style None ) , the cells for the two competitors have a solid border ( style Solid ) , the cells between the two competitors have a border on the right ( style MatchupMiddle ) , and the cells after the last competitor have no border ( style None ) .
This is slightly different for the first column .
Because the pairs of competitors in the first column are so close together , the cell for the first competitor has a border on the top and right ( style MatchupStart ) , and the cell for the second competitor has a border on the bottom and right ( style MatchupEnd ) .
Notice that the pairs of competitors are farther apart in each column .
A one - cell gap is between the competitors in column 1 , a three - cell gap in column 2 , a seven - cell gap in column 3 , and a 15 - cell gap in column 4 .
The size of each gap is one less than a power of two , so there 's a definite pattern here .
The generalized pattern across the table is that each column contains a repeating group of cells .
The sizes of the repeating groups ( which I 'll call the period of the column , for lack of a better term ) are 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , and 64 for the five columns .
Each repeating group contains two competitors , the cells between the two competitors and the cells before and after the two competitors .
Within each column , use two values in your calculations : $ period , which represents the size of the repeating group , and $ oneQuarter , which is one quarter of the period size .
( Storing $ period div 4 in a variable makes the code cleaner . )
Table 1 shows the generalized rules for the cell border styles .
Table 1 .
Cell border styles in the HTML table
Formula Column 1 ( period 4 ) Column 2 ( period 8 ) Column 3 ( period 16 ) Column 4 ( period 32 ) Column 5 ( period 64 ) $ row < $ oneQuarter or $ row > $ period - $ oneQuarter N/ A Row 1 , style None Rows 1 - 3 , style None Rows 1 - 7 , style None Rows 1 - 15 , style None $row = $ oneQuarter Row 1 , style MatchupStart Row 2 , style Solid Row 4 , style Solid Row 8 , style Solid Row 16 , style Solid $ row > $ oneQuarter and $row < $ period - $ oneQuarter Row 2 , style MatchupMiddle Rows 3 - 5 , style MatchupMiddle Rows 5 - 11 , style MatchupMiddle Rows 9 - 23 , style MatchupMiddle Rows 17 - 32 , style None $row = $ period - $ oneQuarter Row 3 , style MatchupEnd Row 6 , style Solid Row 12 , style Solid Row 24 , style Solid N/ A $row < $ oneQuarter or $ row > $ period - $ oneQuarter Row 4 , style None Rows 7 - 8 , style None Rows 13 - 16 , style None Rows 25 - 32 , style None N / A
Now you 've created an elegant way to figure out the style of any given cell in the table .
Given the column number and the row number , the formula works like a charm .
Refactoring the code - Calculating table cell content
When you create a cell in the table , of course , you also need to put the appropriate content in that cell .
That has a nice pattern as well .
Anything with a style of None or MatchupMiddle does n't have any content at all .
That means you only have to worry about finding the right content for the cells with the other three styles .
In Table 1 , you can see that the cells with content have the property $ row = $ oneQuarter or $ row = $ period - $ oneQuarter .
For the first column , you simply write the seed and the name of the appropriate contestant .
The matchups are based on the seedings and feature the pairings shown in Table 2 .
Table 2 . Matchups based on seedings
Matched pairs based on seedings [ 1 ] versus [ 16 ] [ 8 ] versus [ 9 ] [ 5 ] versus [ 12 ] [ 4 ] versus [ 13 ] [ 6 ] versus [ 11 ] [ 3 ] versus [ 14 ] [ 7 ] versus [ 10 ] [ 2 ] versus [ 15 ]
The matchups are arranged so that if the higher seed always wins , the top - seeded team will always play the lowest - seeded team remaining , the second - seeded team will always play the second - lowest - seeded team remaining , and so forth .
Looking at the seeds in this order ( 1 , 16 , 8 , 9 , 5 , 12 , 4 , 13 , 6 , 11 , 3 , 14 , 7 , 10 , 2 , 15 ) , you can seey they match the values in the sequence $ seeds .
The competitors are displayed in column 1 in this order .
A competitor appears in every other row , which means row 1 has the first seed in the sequence , row 3 has the second seed in the sequence , row 5 has the third seed in the sequence , and so on .
The pattern here is $ row + 1 div 2 = $ index .
In other words , take the row number , add 1 , and divide it by 2 to get the index of the seed within the $ seeds sequence .
The content of the table cell is the seed number followed by the name of the contestant with that seed .
That takes care of the content for column 1 .
Columns 2 through 5 , as you 'd expect , are more complicated .
Instead of looking at the < contestant > elements , you need to look at the results , which are displayed in the 15 < result > elements .
Column 2 contains the winners of round 1 .
That means you need to look at the < result > elements with the attribute round = " 1 " .
To keep things simpler , the winner of the first matchup ( the 1 versus 16 seed ) is stored in the first < result > element , the winner of the second matchup ( the 8 versus 9 seed ) is stored in the second < result > element , and so on .
The winners in column 2 are displayed in rows 2 , 6 , 10 , 14 , 18 , 22 , 26 , and 30 .
Looking for a pattern , row 2 uses the first < result > element , row 6 uses the second , and row 10 uses the third .
For this column , if you take the row number , add 2 , and divide it by 4 , you get the position of the appropriate < result round = " 1 " > element .
Columns 3 and 4 are handled similarly .
The winners in column 3 are displayed in rows 4 , 12 , 20 , and 28 ( the pattern here is to add 4 and divide by 8 ) .
The winners in column 4 are displayed in rows 8 and 24 ( add 8 and divide by 16 ) .
Column 5 displays only one contestant — the winner of the entire tournament .
If you 're in row 16 , you display the winner from the single < result round = " 4 " > element .
The refactored way to find the position of the value you seek is ( $row + $ oneQuarter ) div ( $ oneQuarter * 2 ) .
Using the increasing size of the repeating pattern makes the code simple .
For column 1 , the calculated position is the index into the sequence of seeds ; for the other columns , the calculated position is the position of the appropriate < result > element .
Now you have an elegant way to determine both the content and the style of each cell in the table .
Given the row and column number , you can figure out everything you need to know .
Harnessing the power of XPath 2.0 and XSLT 2.0
Now you can use the new techniques available in XPath 2.0 and XSLT 2.0 to streamline the stylesheet .
To start , use the to operator .
If you built the table with a procedural programming language , you might do something similar to Listing 8 .
Listing 8 . Procedural approach to the stylesheet
for ( int row=1 ; row < =32 ; row ++ ) for ( int column=1 ; column < =5 ; column ++ ) //
Build each cell in the table here
With XPath 2.0 and XSLT 2.0 , you use < xsl : for - each > to replace the for loops that you use in a procedural language .
Listing 9 shows you how .
Listing 9 .
Doing for loops with the to operator
< xsl : for - each select= " 1 to 32 " > < xsl:variable name=" outerIndex " select= " . " /> < tr> < xsl : for - each select= " 1 to 5 " >
You need to address a couple of complications here .
First , in XPath 1.0 and XSLT 1.0 , using < xsl : for - each > changed the context for each iteration .
For example , if you used < xsl : for - each select = " contestants / contestant > , the context node is the latest < contestant > during each iteration .
As you use the to operator to iterate through various integers , the context item ( it 's the context item in 2.0 ) is undefined .
As you can see in Listing 9 , you need to save the current value of the outer < xsl : for - each > because it 's not available to you in the inner < xsl : for - each > .
But it gets worse .
If the context item is undefined , you have no way to select nodes from the document .
If you know you 're in row 1 , column 1 , you can get the first item from the $ seeds sequence because $ seeds is a global variable .
That tells you that you need to find the < contestant seed = " 1 " > element .
Unfortunately , you can't get to anything in the document .
Even using an absolute XPath expression such as / bracket / contestants / contestant [ @seed = ' 1 ' ] does n't work .
For that reason , you need to store the nodes that you care about as global variables .
Listing 10 shows you how to access the global variables whenever and wherever you need to .
Listing 10 .
Global variables that store the nodes you need
< xsl:variable name = " results " select= " / bracket/results " /> < xsl:variable name= " contestants " select= " / bracket / contestants " / >
If you need to get the name of the 16th - seeded contestant , the XPath expression is $ contestants / contestant [@seed = " 16 " ] .
You access the < result > elements similarly ; if you need to get the winner of the second matchup in round 2 , the expression is $ results / result [ @round = " 2 " ][ 2]/@winnerSeed .
Listing 11 shows two more global variables you can use to generate the HTML table .
Listing 11 .
Other useful global variables
< xsl:variable name= " periods " as = " xs:integer * " > < xsl:sequence select= " ( 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 ) " /> </xsl:variable > < xsl:variable name= " backgroundColors " as = " xs:string * " > < xsl:sequence select= " ( ' background : # CCCCCC ; ' , ' background : # 9999CC ; ' , ' background : # 99CCCC ; ' , ' background : # CC99CC ; ' , ' background : # CCCC99 ; ' ) " /> </xsl:variable >
These variables store the value of the period for each column and the background color for each column .
To use each variable , you simply use the column number as the index of the single value you want .
Another nice enhancement in XPath 2.0 and XSLT 2.0 is the < xsl: function > element .
Let 's create two functions in the stylesheet : cellStyle and getResults .
The first function returns the border style for each cell , while the second function returns the results ( if any ) for a given matchup .
The parameters to both functions are the row and column numbers of the cell .
Listing 12 demonstrates the code for the cellStyle function .
Listing 12 .
The cellStyle function
< xsl:function name= " bracket:cellStyle " as = " xs:string " > < xsl : param name = " row " as = " xs:integer " /> < xsl : param name = " column " as = " xs:integer " /> < xsl:variable name= " period " as = " xs:integer " select= " subsequence ( $ periods , $ column , 1 ) " /> < xsl:variable name= " oneQuarter " as = " xs:integer " select= " $ period div 4 " /> < xsl:variable name =" lastColumn " as = " xs:boolean " select= " $ oneQuarter = count ( $ contestants / contestant ) " /> < xsl:variable name= " position " select = " $row mod $ period " /> < xsl:value - of select= " if ( $ position = $ oneQuarter ) then ( if ( $ column = 1 ) then ' MatchupStart ' else ' Solid ' ) else if ( $ position = $ period - $ oneQuarter ) then ( if ( $ column = 1 ) then ' MatchupEnd ' else ' Solid ' ) else if ( $ lastColumn ) then ' None ' else if ( $ position < $ oneQuarter or $ position > $ period - $ oneQuarter ) then ' None ' else ' MatchupMiddle ' " / > </xsl:function >
Before you determine the cell style , you use four variables .
You retrieve the value of $ period from the global variable $ periods .
As I mentioned before , $ oneQuarter is simply $ period div 4 .
The Boolean value $ lastColumn simply compares $ oneQuarter to the count of contestants in the tournament .
If those values are equal , you 're processing the last column .
Finally , the variable $ position indicates the position of the current row within the pattern .
In other words , row 9 in the table is the first row of the repeating group for columns 1 and 2 .
Use the position of the row within the pattern to figure out the cell style .
XPath 2.0 and XSLT 2.0 feature an if operator , which has an expression ( in parentheses ) , followed by a then and an else .
All of this goes into the select attribute of < xsl:value - of > .
In this example , you replace the much more verbose < xsl:choose > element with a single expression .
The code here is pretty straightforward , given the discussion of the table formulas ; if the logic were more complicated , it might be more maintainable to use < xsl: choose > , even though it requires more typing .
Some syntax notes for < xsl: function > :
First , you need to declare a new namespace for the functions .
If you invoke bracket : cellStyle ( ) in an XPath expression , the namespace will tell the XSLT 2.0 processor how to find the function .
Second , notice that you used the as = " xs:string " attribute to indicate that this function returns a string .
The < xsl : value - of > element returns one of the five style names ; that 's the output of the function .
The getResults function is a little more complicated , but not by much , as you can see in Listing 13 .
Listing 13 .
The getResults function
< xsl:function name= " bracket: getResults " as = " xs:string " > < xsl : param name = " row " as = " xs:integer " /> < xsl : param name = " column " as = " xs:integer " /> < xsl:variable name= " period " as = " xs:integer " select= " subsequence ( $ periods , $ column , 1 ) " /> < xsl:variable name= " oneQuarter " as = " xs:integer " select= " $ period div 4 " /> < xsl:variable name= " position " select = " $row mod $ period " / > < xsl:choose > < xsl : when test= " $ position = $ oneQuarter or $ position = $ period - $ oneQuarter " > < xsl:variable name = " round " select= " $ column - 1 " /> < xsl:variable name = " index " select= " ( $row + $ oneQuarter ) div ( $oneQuarter * 2 ) " /> < xsl:variable name=" currentSeed " select= " if ( $ column = 1 ) then subsequence ( $seeds , $ index , 1 ) else $ results/result[@round=$round ] [ $index ]/@winnerSeed " /> < xsl:choose > < xsl: when test=" string - length ( string ( $currentSeed ) ) " > < xsl:value - of select= " concat ('[ ' , $ currentSeed , '] ' , $ contestants/contestant[@seed=$currentSeed ] ) " />
</xsl : when > < xsl:otherwise > < xsl:text > </xsl:text > </xsl:otherwise > </xsl:choose > </xsl : when > < xsl:otherwise > < xsl:text > </xsl:text > </xsl:otherwise > </xsl:choose > </xsl:function >
You have the same parameters as before .
You have to do some special processing here for column 1 , which contains data from the < contestant > elements , while the other columns contain data from the < result > elements .
As with the cellStyle function , you calculate $ period and $ position , and you use the $ oneQuarter variable to simplify the formulas .
If the cell contains a contestant , you calculate three more variables .
The $ round variable is one less than the column ( column 2 contains results from round 1 ) , and you calculate the $ index variable according to the formula discussed earlier .
You need to follow two steps to find the appropriate data .
First , set the value of the $ currentSeed variable .
If this is round 1 , you use the new subsequence function to select a value from the $ seeds variable .
For the other rounds , you get the winnerSeed attribute from the appropriate < result > element .
Second , in addition to processing column 1 differently , you need to account for the possibility of a < result > element that does n't have a winner ( winnerSeed= " " ) .
If that happens , return a nonbreaking space ( ) .
Because of the way XSLT 2.0 handles data types ( this is a subject for a future article ) , you need to convert $ currentSeed to a string , then test the length of the string .
If the length of the string is zero , return a nonbreaking space ; otherwise , return the seed and the name of the contestant .
Finally , notice that you use < xsl:choose > here .
Although you can do everything with a single XPath if statement , the code will be unwieldy .
Even though < xsl:choose > is more verbose , the code is cleaner and easier to understand .
Now that you 've set up the global variables and functions that you need , the heart of the stylesheet is simple and elegant , as you can see in Listing 14 .
Listing 14 .
The heart of the stylesheet
< xsl : for - each select= " 1 to 32 " > < xsl:variable name=" outerIndex " select= " . " /> < tr> < xsl : for - each select= " 1 to 5 " > < td style= " {subsequence ($backgroundColors , . , 1 ) } " class= " {bracket:cellStyle($outerIndex , . ) } " > < xsl:value - of select= " bracket:getResults($outerIndex , . ) " /> </td> < /xsl:for-each > </tr > < /xsl:for-each >
You have the two loops that create the five columns for the 32 rows of the table .
For each cell , the background color is based on the current column number .
The cellStyle function determines the border style ( class= " x " ) , and the getResults function determines the value of the cell .
Using the stylesheet
As you might expect , you need an XSLT 2.0 processor to use this stylesheet .
I wo n't reprint the entire stylesheet here , but you must use < xsl:stylesheet version = " 2.0 " > so the processor will run in XSLT 2.0 mode .
I highly recommend Michael Kay 's Saxon processor ( see Related topics for more details ) .
Dr. Kay was the editor of the XSLT 2.0 spec , and Saxon was in some ways a test case as the spec was being developed .
If you use Saxon , use this command to transform the XML file tourney .xml using the stylesheet results - html.xsl and write the output to the results .
html file :
java net.sf.saxon.Transform -o results.html tourney.xml results - html.xsl
To illustrate the flexibility of the stylesheet , take out some of the results in the XML file and run the transform .
Listing 15 shows what the < result > elements look like .
Listing 15 .
XML document with incomplete tournament data
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?>
<!-- incomplete-tourney.xml --> < bracket > . . . < results > < result round= " 1 " firstSeed= " 1 " secondSeed = " 16 " winnerSeed= " 1 " /> < result round= " 1 " firstSeed= " 8 " secondSeed= " 9 " winnerSeed= " 9 " /> < result round= " 1 " firstSeed= " 5 " secondSeed = " 12 " winnerSeed= " 5 " /> < result round= " 1 " firstSeed= " 4 " secondSeed = " 13 " winnerSeed= " 4 " /> < result round= " 1 " firstSeed= " 6 " secondSeed = " 11 " winnerSeed = " 11 " /> < result round= " 1 " firstSeed= " 3 " secondSeed = " 14 " winnerSeed= " 3 " /> < result round= " 1 " firstSeed = " 7 " secondSeed = " 10 " winnerSeed = " 10 " /> < result round= " 1 " firstSeed = " 2 " secondSeed = " 15 " winnerSeed = " 2 " /> < result round= " 2 " firstSeed= " " secondSeed= " " winnerSeed= " " /> < result round= " 2 " firstSeed= " " secondSeed= " " winnerSeed= " " /> < result round= " 2 " firstSeed= " " secondSeed= " " winnerSeed= " " /> < result round= " 2 " firstSeed= " " secondSeed= " " winnerSeed= " " /> < result round= " 3 " firstSeed= " " secondSeed= " " winnerSeed= " " /> < result round= " 3 " firstSeed= " " secondSeed= " " winnerSeed= " " /> < result round= " 4 " firstSeed= " " secondSeed= " " winnerSeed= " " /> </results > </ bracket >
Listing 15 represents the state of the tournament after the first round .
All of the < result > elements for rounds 2 , 3 , and 4 have an empty winnerSeed attribute .
Despite this , the stylesheet generates the correct bracket , as you can see in Figure 3 .
Figure 3 .
The bracket for an incomplete tournament
Summary
This article demonstrated many of the new features of XPath 2.0 and XSLT 2.0 .
In the sample application , you took an unwieldy stylesheet and refactored it into a much smaller and more maintainable piece of code .
Part of your effort went into analyzing the code to find patterns , but without the to operator , < xsl: function > , and sequences of items , streamlining the stylesheet as much as you did would have been difficult .
Most significantly , you created generic functions that can handle any number of contestants .
To change the stylesheet to handle a 32 - team tournament , for example , you need to change the sequences $ seeds and $ periods .
You also need to replace select= " 1 to 5 " with select= " 1 to $ rounds " , where $rounds represents the number of rounds in the tournament .
The most elegant solution , of course , is to create XSLT 2.0 functions that calculate the values for any generic bracket , including the number of rounds , the sequence of seeds ( a 32 - team bracket features matchups between 1 and 32 , 2 and 31 , and so forth ) , and the periods for the various columns .
This challenge is left as an exercise for the reader .
The core of the problem is that you need to iterate through 32 rows of the table , but XSLT 1.0 offers you no practical way to do that .
The new features of XPath 2.0 and XSLT 2.0 help you solve this problem .

Imagine returning to your home after a long vacation .
You pick up your pets from the kennel , unload your luggage and head to bed to recover from the long drive .
But your sleep is anything but restful .
All night , you 're plagued by tiny pinpricks and incessant itching .
It does n't take you long to figure out that you 're being attacked by a seemingly infinite mob of hungry fleas .
­ What happened ?
Did your pets pick up an infestation at the kennel ?
Did the vampire - like insects hitch a ride on your luggage ?
Or did a swarm of them decide to move in while you were gone ?

It 's a creepy idea , but the most likely answer is that the fleas were waiting for you .
Fleas are parasites -- or life forms that feed on hosts -- often harming the host in some way .
Fleas use their hosts ' blood as food .
They generally prefer the blood of four - legged animals to human blood , so before you went on vacation , the fleas fed on your pets , not on you .
Although newly emerged fleas need to find food within a few days , adults can go for a couple of months without a meal .
Flea pupae can also stay in their cocoons for up to a year , waiting to sense the body heat and vibrations that signal the presence of nearby hosts .
So when you go on vacation , the fleas do n't starve to death -- they simply wait for you and your pets to come back .
When you walk into your home after being away , hungry adult fleas flock to you and to anything else that has a pulse , regardless of how many legs it has .
Pupae break out of their cocoons and search for their first blood meal .
Your home , which seemed clean and relatively flea - free when you left , is suddenly overrun .
The ability to live without food is just one of a flea's many adaptations .
These adaptations make it easier for fleas to move around on their hosts , feed on blood , reproduce and survive when food is scarce .
In this article , we 'll look at how these adaptations make it harder to kill fleas .
We 'll also explore how to keep fleas from invading your home and your pets , as well as how to get rid of an infestation .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks got battered on Tuesday after the minutes from the last Federal Reserve policy meeting failed to reassure investors worried about weak housing , consumer confidence reports and ongoing credit and mortgage market woes .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( down 280.28 to 13,041.85 , Charts ) lost 2.1 percent .
The broader S&P 500 ( down 34.43 to 1,432.36 , Charts ) index and the tech - fueled Nasdaq Composite ( down 60.61 to 2,500.64 , Charts ) both lost nearly 2.4 percent .

Treasury prices jumped , as investors sought safety in bonds .
The dollar was mixed versus other major currencies .
Oil and gold prices fell .
After the close , shares of Dillard 's ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) fell after the department store operator reported a quarterly loss , versus a profit a year ago .
Shares of PDL Biopharma ( Charts ) slumped 15 percent after the biotech company withdrew its 2007 financial guidance , said it will sell its marketed drugs and said that an experimental drug in late - stage trials failed .
Stocks - already vulnerable after last week 's big rally - had fallen through the mid afternoon , as investors eyed reports that showed a big drop in home prices , weaker consumer confidence and more problems for the financial sector .
The 2:00 p.m. ET release of the minutes from the last Fed meeting added fuel to the fire , despite offering little new information on the central bank 's outlook on the economy .
( Read the minutes ) .
The minutes from the Aug. 7 meeting showed that at the time , the bankers were not overly worried about the impact of the subprime and credit market turmoil on the economy .
Although , the Fed did state that if the economy should deteriorate , it was prepared to cut rates .
The selloff Tuesday may have reflected investor disappointment that - at least in early August - the Fed did not appear to be closer to cutting rates and was not more concerned about the financial markets , said Michael Sheldon , chief market strategist at Spencer Clarke .
However , things changed shortly after that , Sheldon said .
Just 10 days later , the Fed cut the discount rate , which affects bank loans .
The move raised hopes that the central bank may cut the federal funds rate - which impacts consumer loans - at its Sept. 18 policy meeting .
" We think the Fed will ease the fed funds rate by 25 basis points at the September meeting , " said Timothy Ghriskey , chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management .
There are 100 basis points in a percentage point .
Ghriskey said that while a cut would appease the markets , it would n't necessarily suggest a big change in fed policy .
" If the economy picks up enough steam , they could end up lifting rates again , " he said .
The next big event will be Fed chair Ben Bernanke 's comments Friday from the annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole , Wyoming .
Ahead of that , stocks could slide further .
" Most of the major markets have broken a short - term uptrend , " Sheldon said , " and with few investors likely to help support the market over the next few days , the near - term direction is more likely to be down than up . "
Stocks fell Monday on a weak July existing home sales report .
Tuesday brought more evidence of erosion in the sector after a Standard & Poor 's report showed that home prices fell 3.2 percent in the second quarter versus a year ago .
A separate report showed consumer confidence slumped in August to a 1 - year low , reflecting a brutal summer on Wall Street in which stocks slumped amid worries about the credit and mortgage markets and oil prices surged .
In addition to the week 's events , stock investors were also reacting to last week 's rally , the analysts said , in which the major gauges each jumped more than 2 percent .
" We had a strong rally off the bottom in the last week or so after the Fed cut the discount rate , " Ghriskey said .
" The pullback we 've seen this week is a little profit taking in what is an extremely slow period for the markets . "
He said that many Wall Street professionals were now taking vacations after deferring them in early August due to the market turmoil .
Stocks bottomed out in mid-August , with the S&P 500 and Dow industrials carving out the technical definition of a correction - a drop of at least 10 percent off the highs .
Also weighing on stocks Tuesday : more problems for the financial sector amid the credit market turmoil .
State Street ( down $ 2.72 to $ 61.16 , Charts , Fortune 500 ) fell on reports that the money manager has exposure to $ 22 billion of asset - backed commercial paper conduits , the kind of assets that have hurt European rivals recently , according to a report published in British paper The Times .
European bank Barclays ( down $ 2.33 to $ 46.61 , Charts ) also slipped on reports that it may have exposure to several hundred millions of dollars of failed debt , Briefing.com reported .
Yet , Barclays denied this .
In addition , Merrill Lynch downgraded Citigroup ( down $ 1.65 to $ 46.14 , Charts , Fortune 500 ) , Lehman Brothers ( down $ 3.47 to $ 54.28 , Charts , Fortune 500 ) and Bear Stearns ( down $ 3.78 to $ 108.42 , Charts , Fortune 500 ) , according to Reuters .
In other corporate news , Warren Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway has reportedly bought another 10 million shares in Burlington Northern Santa Fe ( down $ 1.67 to $ 78.66 , Charts , Fortune 500 ) .

About 200 villagers have fallen ill from mysterious gases that spewed from a crater after a meteorite crashed in southeastern Peru , but no radiation has been detected , officials and scientists say .
Scores of residents of the farming village of Carancas began vomiting and complaining of headaches and dizziness after the space object struck the area Saturday , creating an eight metre deep , 20 metre - wide crater .
" We have determined with precision instruments that there is no radiation , " engineer Renan Ramirez of the Peruvian Nuclear Energy Institute told AFP .
O’Reilly just published Beautiful Code .
I was invited to contribute , but I just could not go along with the premise .
I disagree that beauty is a guiding principle of programming .
Here is how I responded .
I am having trouble with this assignment .
Telling an inspiring story about a beautiful design feels disingenuous .
Yes , we all strive for beautiful code .
But that is not what a talented young programmer needs to hear .
I wish someone had instead warned me that programming is a desperate losing battle against the unconquerable complexity of code , and the treachery of requirements .
Of course I would n’t have believed them .
It seems that pragmatism and humility can only be learned the hard way .
I do n’t know how to explain this in a case study .
War stories do not instruct , because in retrospect the mistakes seem obvious .
It is hard to convey the extent of the minefield of mistakes laying in wait .
In essay form , I might say something like this :
I can’t teach you how to design beautiful code , because I do n’t know how myself .
I may have managed to get a few things almost right , and I have seen others do some nice work , but to be honest these successes always came from trial and error .
The first try was often a total mess .
Truly beautiful designs typically evolve from dozens of attempts , as for example with languages and libraries .
Telling you to build one and throw it away , or to study a dozen prior examples , is just to admit that there are no general principles or techniques of software design .
I hope that someday we will discover such principles .
But in the meantime software design is still a matter of wisdom , not knowledge , and is therefore largely unteachable .
A lesson I have learned the hard way is that we are n’t smart enough .
Even the most brilliant programmers routinely make stupid mistakes .
Not just typos , but basic design errors that back the code into a corner , and in retrospect should have been obvious .
The human mind can not grasp the complexity of a moderately sized program , much less the monster systems we build today .
This is a bitter pill to swallow , because programming attracts and rewards the intelligent , and its culture encourages intellectual arrogance .
I find it immensely helpful to work on the assumption that I am too stupid to get things right .
This leads me to conservatively use what has already been shown to work , to cautiously test out new ideas before committing to them , and above all to prize simplicity .
Another lesson I have learned is to distrust beauty .
It seems that infatuation with a design inevitably leads to heartbreak , as overlooked ugly realities intrude .
Love is blind , but computers are n’t .
A long term relationship , maintaining a system for years , teaches one to appreciate more domestic virtues such as straightforwardness and conventionality .
Beauty is an idealistic fantasy : what really matters is the quality of the never ending conversation between programmer and code , as each learns from and adapts to the other .
Beauty is not a sufficient basis for a happy marriage .
Military Industry Makes Up 70 Percent Of Russian Science Production
by Staff Writers
Yekaterinburg ( RIA Novosti ) Apr 20 , 2007
Russia 's military industrial complex makes up 70 % of the country 's total science intensive production , a Russian first deputy prime minister said Thursday .
Sergei Ivanov , who in mid-February was promoted from defense minister and charged with the task of supervising the country 's nuclear power and defense industries , said half of Russian scientists work in the military industrial sector .
" Russia has been gradually restoring its leading positions in the export of arms and military - oriented products and gaining new sale markets , " Ivanov said , adding that military industrial enterprises has also been increasing the production share of civilian - oriented products .
" [ Defense ] enterprises became large suppliers of equipment for oil and gas , transport and energy sectors , as well as manufacturers of durable goods , first of all of household electronic equipment , " he said .
" On top of it all , these are products that are competitive with imported goods under the ' price - quality ' parameter . "
The first deputy prime minister said that it is necessary to work out a system of measures that would stimulate the modernization of defense enterprises and inspire innovations , adding that introduction of nanotechnology in Russia is one of country 's mega projects .
" Nanotechnology could not only change our whole economy and the quality of life of Russian people , but can also drastically change all our perception about modern warfare , " Ivanov said .
The importance of nanotechnology for Russia was also stressed Wednesday by Russian President Vladimir Putin , who said the state would spare no effort to provide financial support to nanotechnology research programs .
" It is an area of activity in which the state is ready to invest on a grand scale .
The only question is that this work should be well organized and effective , yielding practical results , " Putin said .
He said nanotechnology will lay the groundwork for new weapon systems , both offensive and defensive , adding that nanotechnology is already being used in high - tech sectors of industry , medicine , transport , space research and telecommunications .
MEXICO CITY - Death just ai n't what it used to be .
A small religious group that worships the grim reaper and is fighting for government recognition unveiled a softer image of their Death Saint today : a woman with a porcelain face , brown , shoulder - length hair and long thin fingers .
Hundreds of worshippers filed into the Santa Muerte sanctuary in central Mexico City to see the statue in a flowing golden dress and veil , clutching a rose .
She offers another option to followers who have traditionally prayed to figures of a skeleton dressed in a black cloak and carrying a scythe , or in a long flowing white gown .
A neuron - there are about 10,000 separate synapses on this cell
University of Oxford scientists say that adults may find learning more difficult than children because their brains store memories differently .
The study , in the journal Neuron , looked at nerve cell activity - the basis of learning and memory - in rats .
Experts said younger brains may learn things more easily , but older brains may store information more efficiently .
' Un- silenced '
The researchers , backed by the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust looked at the nerve cell processes in young and old rats .
Nerve cells communicate by sending signals though synapses , junctions between the cells .
But some synapses are " silent " and are not activated when chemical signals are passed between cells .
The team used highly detailed laser imaging , which looked at images one micron wide - a 100th the width of a human hair , to look at how synapses behave .
They focused on electrical activity and the movement of molecules called calcium ions .
They found that silent synapses are more prevalent in young brains , and are called on when new memories are laid down .
When this happens , key receptors - which detect stimuli - are called to the surface of the cell , transforming it into an active synapse .
In older brains , there were fewer silent synapses - which the researchers believe is because they have been used up .
This means older brains have to reuse the " un-silenced " synapses , boosting their power with increased amounts of neurotransmitters , chemicals which fuel the transmission of the chemical signals .
' More verification '
Dr Nigel Emptage , who led the research , said the findings could help understand the differences between how the young and old learn .
" It might be the case that this is the reason infants are so able to store new information , such as language .
" But later in life , remembering things proves harder .
That might be because the way we have to store information is fundamentally different , using parts of the system that have been used already . "
Emrah Duzel , honorary consultant neurologist at London 's Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London , said : " It is an exciting possibility that these lifespan changes in memory capacity are linked to cellular mechanisms of connectivity .
" Different mechanisms are apparently involved in the acquisition of entirely new connections and the modification of existing connections . "
Professor Keith Kendrick , head of cognitive and behavioural neurosciences at the Babraham Institute in Cambridge , said : " Young brains do tend to be able to absorb new information better than old ones , although not necessarily to integrate it as well with what has been learned previously . "
But he added : " More extensive learning experience could perhaps also lead to more efficient representation and integration of information using existing ' active ' synapses leading to a reduced dependence upon the presence of naive ' silent ' ones .
" This study sets out an interesting idea , but it is one that still needs much more experimental verification . "
I originally found these at http://www.arouse.net/dispair-linux, but it appears that he 's having issues at the moment .
I could n't not mirror them , so here we go .
A popular video has puzzled countless viewers who have stumbled across it on the Internet , leaving them wondering about both its genuineness and its context .
What could prompt a middle - aged woman to haul off and deliver a solid punch to the face of another woman , all without causing any apparent consternation to the bystanders who witnessed the attack ?
The scene took place in 1999 outside a courtroom where a reckless driver had just been sentenced for causing an accident that left two people dead and a third severely injured .
This clip was taken from ( originally unaired ) videotape shot by a news crew from station KY3 - TV in Springfield , Missouri , and was used in a “ Newsroom Ethics ” lesson prepared by the Radio and Television News Directors Foundation , who described it thusly :
Honesty , consistency and integrity have no meaning to George Bush .
He ’ll say anything to sell his failed Iraq policy .
Today , as we ’ve noted , he invoked Vietnam .
But , as the Senate Democrats rightly point out , Bush was against that comparison before he was for it :
In 2004 , Bush Opposed Comparison Between Iraq and Vietnam :
QUESTION : Thank you , Mr. President .
Mr. President , April is turning into the deadliest month in Iraq since the fall of Baghdad , and some people are comparing Iraq to Vietnam and talking about a quagmire .
Polls show that support for your policy is declining and that fewer than half Americans now support it .
What does that say to you and how do you answer the Vietnam comparison ?
THE PRESIDENT : I think the analogy is false .
I also happen to think that analogy sends the wrong message to our troops , and sends the wrong message to the enemy .
Look , this is hard work .
It ’s hard to advance freedom in a country that has been strangled by tyranny .
And , yet , we must stay the course , because the end result is in our nation ’s interest .
[ Press Conference by the President , 4/13/04 ]
In 2007 , Bush Embraced Comparison Between Iraq and Vietnam :
“ ‘I want to remind you that after Vietnam , after we left , millions of people lost their life , ’ Bush said here when an audience member asked about comparisons between Vietnam and Iraq .
‘ The Khmer Rouge , for example , in Cambodia .
And my concern is there would be a parallel .
. . .
The same thing would happen .
There would be the slaughter of a lot of innocent life .
The difference , of course , is that this time around , the enemy would n’t just be content to stay in the Middle East ; they ’d follow us here . ’” [ Washington Post , 4/20/07 ]
Today , Bush Embraced Comparison Between Iraq and Vietnam .
“ Finally , there was Vietnam .
This is a complex and painful subject for many Americans , and the tragedy of Vietnam is too large to be contained in one speech .
So I will limit myself to one argument that has particular significance today .
Then as now , people argued that the real problem was America ’s presence and that if we would just withdraw , the killing would end . ”
[ President Bush Speech to VFW , 8/22/07 ]
Along with cashmere romper suits and baby nail clippers , here is another thing for new parents to add to the " do n't waste your money " list : those baby DVDs and videos which claim to give infants a boost in learning language .
According to scientists in the US , watching " educational " DVDs with titles such as Baby Einstein and Brainy Baby does not help a baby 's linguistic development .
What 's more , overuse may slow down infants aged eight to 16 months when it comes to acquiring vocabulary .
A study , published today in the Journal of Paediatrics , showed that for every hour per day spent watching baby DVDs and videos , infants understood an average of six to eight fewer words than infants who did not watch them .
Academics from the University of Washington and the Seattle Children 's Hospital Research Institute conducted random interviews with more than 1,000 families in Minnesota and Washington with a child born in the previous two years .
Researchers asked parents with children aged eight to 16 months how many words from a list of 90 their child understood .
Words included choo choo , mommy and nose .
Those with 17 - 24 - month - old children were asked how many words on a similar list they had heard their child use .
Typical words were truck , cookie and balloon .
All parents were asked what TV , DVD and videos their children watched , as well as how often they were read to .
Andrew Meltzoff , co-director of the University of Washington 's Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences and co-author of the study , said : " The results surprised us , but they make sense .
There are only a fixed number of hours that young babies are awake and alert .
If the ' alert time ' is spent in front of DVDs and TV instead of with people speaking in ' parentese ' - that melodic speech we use with little ones - the babies are not getting the same linguistic experience . "
The researchers believe the content of baby DVDs and videos is different from the other types of programming because it tends to have little dialogue and shows linguistically indescribable images such as a lava lamp .
By contrast , children 's educational programs are crafted to meet developmental needs of pre-school children .
Dimitri Chirstakis , a paediatrics researcher at Seattle Children 's Hospital Research Institute and co-author of the study , said : " I believe the onus is on the manufacturers to prove their claims that watching these programs can positively impact children 's cognitive development . "
Hello diggers ! :D
Great art ,
An important message and the police can't do anything to stop you !
Get out there and do it !.
I see some people are asking questions so i thought i'd go " digg up " ( get it ? ) some more info .
The guy is Alexandre Orion , He is a photographer and graffiti artist from São Paulo Brazil .
this video was shot in the Max Feffer tunnel joining Av. Europa and Cidade Jardim on July 13th 2006 .
The work totaled 160 meters and the video is set to the music INSTITUTO .

It 's not about cleaning the mess up .
It 's about the air you breathe .
That soot is being pumped out by cars constantly and we 're all breathing in that crap .

of course its about the air ...its a shame that you lash out at people calling them idiots when they 're spot on about the message of this .
The skulls represent death , death because of what is pumped into the air and breathed in by everyone .
Just imagine the inside of your lungs if thats what the walls look like .
Thats why they show him wearing the mask so as not to breath that shit in while in the tunnel .
Its not ' really ' about getting away with tagging ... its a statement ... one which obviously flew right over your head .

Are you sure he's not wearing a mask to avoid breathing in the toxic highly volatile solvent he 's using to clean the wall with ?

Please forgive anon. for his foolishness .
" great art regardless of meaning " - What ?!
I guess this guy spends most of his time getting horny to dillards bra ads .
Also , I 'm pretty sure that " highly volatile substance " is much less harmful than the crap baked onto the grill - did you see the end of the video where it 's removed with water ?
Could he be wearing it in protest of the carbon monoxide ?.. mm.possibly ?
enough exaggerating out there , mama loves you .
Posted by @ 8:27 PM
Re : " Are you sure he's not wearing a mask to avoid breathing in the toxic highly volatile solvent he 's using to clean the wall with ? "
Quick f*cking trolling , the rags he 's using are dry and clean , it 's the soot build - up on the tunnel walls that 's toxic .
Posted by @ 8:30 PM
I was n't trolling , I thought he might be using acetone or something to remove the soot .
Posted by @ 8:37 PM
he may very well be using some type of solvent , otherwise it would be quit hard to remove the soot , without leaving smears in the artwork .
but most likely he is doing it because of both .
both are very harmful .
tunnels can harbor some very nasty things you do n't want to breathe .
he is essentially rubbing off the soot , and that can leave fine particles in the air , which can cause cancers .
He could just as well be using alcohol ' soaked ' rags , not necessarily drenched , just slightly damp .
but who really gives a damn why he is wearing a mask ?
Oh and the stuff came off the wall easily with water sprayed from a high pressure hose .
how do you know that water did n't have some type of bio degradable solvent ?
infact , the high pressures alone should be enough to get the soot off .
the soot is loosely on the wall , since it gathers on it by floating through the air .
the difference is it makes it harder to remove the soot with just rags than a pressurized water hose .
really do n't speak , unless you have some understanding of common sense , otherwise there is nothing left but to assume that you are a moron who does n't deserve to breathe anything but soot .
Posted by @ 9:29 PM
I would assume he 's probably not using a volatile solvent considering he 's not wearing gloves .
Any thoughts ?
Posted by Unknown @ 9:32 PM
About the Soot :
This seems to be taking place in Europe somewhere and um , do n't they rely on they Diesel for just about everything ?
I 'm in NYC and pass through the gleaming white tiled Holland Tunnel often .
NYC is certainly not the cleanest place on earth but the tunnel walls simply do n't seem to be THAT grimy .
It could be that the metal attracts the soot better than the 100 + year old ceramic tile does .
I despise graffiti in most cases ( in a police state I accept that graffiti might be all you have so ...) but those clean skulls were artfully done and the end result was great .
All in all a nice piece of work .

To the guy that brought up Carbon Monoxide , you are an idiot , NO MASK can protect you from Carbon monoxide , only a closed system with its own air supply .
And yeah , that was cool , but the skulls got old .
It sure is a good thing he did that though .
I mean , if he didnt take the time to go rub off some soot , they city never would have came in to wash it all down the sewers .
Much better in the water supply than on a wall .
And
You know he convinced so many of those drivers to park their cars forever because " Oh how horrible : soot " .

and nice video work , the piece has real atmosphere .

And they have a self cleaning mechanism .

That was really anti-ecological .

yea blame the artist for the city ordinance allowing that shit to washed down the drain .... its not about the rags or the mask it is about the disgusting pollution coming out of the cars ... no one would even have given the black walls a second look till he showed them the death that hovers all around hidden ... then they wash it in the water where no can see it ... can they fined for dumping that shit into the water ?

louis vuitton Malletier — commonly referred to as Louis Vuitton , jeans commonly Anglicized christian louboutin as , or shortened to LV — is an international luxury alexander mcqueen French fashion house specializing in miu miu trunks , leather goods , ready - to - wear , shoes , watches , salvatore ferragamo , accessories , sunglasses , chloe and books .
Known the world over for its LV monogram gucci and logo , Louis Vuitton is stella mccartney one of the World 's most recognized brands .
A long time fendi symbol of prestige and wealth , the company commands some of the highest prices in the international fashion market for its products .
Started in 1854 , yves saint laurent and Louis Vuitton sells its products strictly manolo blahnik through its own tory burch retail stores , small giuseppe zanotti boutiques in high - end department stores , and online through its website .
Louis Vuitton competes directly with such luxury brands as Versace , Bijan , Hermès , gucci , Dolce & Gabbana , Burberry , Dior , jimmy choo , Chanel , Fendi , Armani , and Prada .
After the death of his father , Georges Vuitton began a campaign to build the company into a worldwide corporation , Moncler Jackets exhibiting the company 's products at the Chicago canada goose World 's Fair in 1893 .
In 1896 , the company launched the legendary Monogram Canvas and made the worldwide patents on it . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
Its graphic symbols , including quatrefoils and flowers ( as well as the LV monogram ) , were based on the trend of using Japanese and Oriental designs in the late Victorian era .
The patents later proved to be successful in stopping counterfeiting .
In this same year , Georges traveled to the United States , where he toured various cities ( such as New York , Philadelphia , and Chicago ) , selling Vuitton products during the visit .
In 1901 , the Louis Vuitton Company introduced the Steamer Bag , a smaller piece of luggage designed to be kept inside Vuitton luggage trunks .
By 1913 , the chanel Building opened on the d&g Champs - Elysees .
It was lv the largest travel - goods store in the world at the time .
Soon christian louboutin shoes thereafter , the Louis Vuitton Speedy bag was introduced ( both are still manufactured today ) .

Please do not get me wrong here , I am just so excited about the adorable Gucci Secret GG Satchel here .
I am going to pay a new purchase .
There are more than just a few moments when I have strolled about the lv handbag carrying my latest purchase , and the last time Louis Vuitton Damier Azur Computer Sleeve 13 ( white ) bought a Gucci Hobo bag .
I want something vintage lately .
And the louis vuitton tivoli pm won me over long ago .
It seems that it has a touch of the 90's .
Sure there are a large number of louis vuitton damier neverfull mm which are weathered to look old but this one just gives me a vintage feel while not old .

NASA announced new details yesterday about its plans for a Moon base that included a pair of small , pressurized rovers with a range of nearly 600 miles .
The space agency plans to return astronauts to the Moon around 2020 .
Agency officials first described proposals last December for a polar lunar base powered by near constant sunlight on solar panels .
Earlier proposals to carry small habitation modules to the Moon in stages might be supplanted by a proposal that would heave a single large module to the Moon on an unmanned cargo ship , Doug Cooke , the NASA official leading the lunar study group , said .
The new rover would not be much larger than the buggies the Apollo astronauts drove , but would be pressurized so that astronauts could drive in shirt sleeves and be protected from radiation  probably by a layer of water in the rover ’s body , said Geoff Yoder , an official working on the lunar plans .
To explore on foot , astronauts would put on spacesuits and leave the vehicle , Mr. Yoder said .
The cost ?
“ More than a Ferrari , ” he joked .
Biomechanical data of 70 women of varying breast sizes were studied
Dr Joanna Scurr said that her new study showed that regular bras and some sports bras were not effective .
They are designed to stop the bounce but Dr Scurr 's study shows that breasts also move side - to - side and in and out .
She is hoping to develop a " smart fabric " that can provide custom - made support for each woman .
Size does not matter
Her studies have lead to invitations to work with the military , the NHS and with lingerie manufacturers .
The challenge is to find a material and a design that would contain movement in the three directions , she said .
Sports science has always been dominated by men and for them , studying breasts is seen as slightly laughable
Dr Joanna Scurr , University of Portsmouth
During exercise , breasts bounce more - up to 21 cm ( 8in ) rather than the maximum 16 cm ( 6in ) bounce measured in past studies .
Size makes no difference - from an A cup to a double - FF cup the impact is the same whether they are doing a slow jog or a fast sprint , the study showed .
" If women wore the correct form of support , if we can get that right , the use of pain medication is reduced and women can be active and lead healthy lives , " said Dr Scurr .
" Sports science has always been dominated by men and for them , studying breasts is seen as slightly laughable .
For women , though , it 's completely credible - they can see the benefits . "
Seventy women were recruited for the two - year study through the university 's student and staff population , gyms and doctors ' surgeries .
Those chosen represent the widest range of breast sizes ever studied including women with cup sizes DD , E , F , FF , G , H , HH , J and JJ .
The glamour model Jordan has a cup size of F , six sizes smaller than Dr Scurr 's biggest breasted subject .
DIGG THIS
Days after the fateful South Carolina debate in which Ron Paul refused to flatter and patronize the American people , instead explaining to them the concept of " blowback " ( that foreign intervention can lead to unintended , undesirable consequences ) , the Texas congressman held a special press conference with Michael Scheuer , the former head of the CIA ’s bin Laden unit .
Scheuer , incidentally , is a conservative who has never voted for a non-Republican candidate .
The event should have received more attention than it did — since Scheuer was there to say that Dr. Paul had been exactly right in his exchange with Rudy Giuliani :
There are now ten Republican candidates in the field and there are eight Democrats .
Seventeen of them are not at all a worry to Osama bin Laden and what he represents … .
Dr. Paul has hit on exactly the only indispensable ally that al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , and their allies have , and that ’s U.S. foreign policy .
It is a patent absurdity on the part of the governing establishment in the United States to believe that the war we are engaged in at the moment has anything to do with our freedoms , our democracy , gender equality , or my having a Budweiser after work … .
This war has to do with our foreign policy and its impact in the Islamic world .
That has nothing to do with judging the moral or monetary or political worth of our policies .
It ’s simply to understand what motivates our enemy .
Scheuer went on to recount the Ayatollah Khomeini ’s abject failure over the course of a decade to instigate a jihad against America on account of our debauchery , our entertainment , our women in the workplace , and the like .
It was a complete flop .
No one blew himself up because of R - rated movies .
What made Osama bin Laden ’s message attractive , on the other hand , was precisely that it was defensive in nature , focusing on specific grievances that resonated with his Muslim audience .
( Scheuer discusses all six of them in his interview , which I urge people to listen to . )
That , and not a war against the West over its decadence , is what won recruits .
In other words , we may in fact be dealing not with comic - book villains but with actual human beings .
" It ’s very common for the slurs to be thrown when you say something like this , " Scheuer hastened to add .
" You ’re an appeaser , you ’re an anti-American .
I think it ’s a shame , but the governing establishment wants to protect itself .
It does not want to talk about these issues ….
I think Dr. Paul has done a tremendous service to the American people . "
It is important to debate American foreign policy for a change , he said .
" At the end of the debate , Americans may decide that the foreign policy status quo that exists at the moment is what they want .
But if they do , they will at least go into it with their eyes open , and know that they are in for an extended period of war , a tremendously bloody and costly war . "
In an interview with Antiwar Radio several days before the press conference , Scheuer said : " I thought Mr. Paul captured it the other night exactly correctly .
This war is dangerous to America because it ’s based , not on gender equality , as Mr. Giuliani suggested , or any other kind of freedom , but simply because of what we do in the Islamic world — because u2018 we ’re over there , ’ basically , as Mr. Paul said in the debate . "
To be sure , Scheuer observed , Muhammad described the end state of Islam on earth as a caliphate in which the whole world would be Muslim .
But " there ’s as much chance of that happening in any kind of foreseeable future as the application of the Golden Rule , and u2018turn the other cheek ’ and u2018 love thy neighbor ’ in the Christian world .
There ’s no chance .
Bin Laden is popular and his message resonates because it is a defensive message .
It is very much a message of u2018 get out and leave us to our own problems . ’ "
He continued :
About the only thing that can hold together the very loose coalition that Osama bin Laden has assembled is a common Muslim hatred for the impact of U.S. foreign policy … .
They all agree they hate U.S. foreign policy .
To the degree we change that policy in the interests of the United States , they become more and more focused on their local problems : attacking the Philippine government , attacking the Saudi government or the Egyptian government … .
Mr. Paul spoke not only the truth , but he spoke in the interests of the American people .
And from the right and from the left he got chopped up .
And at the end of the day you admire Mr. Paul ’s courage but what you fear for is the security of America , because the people who attacked Mr. Paul are much more concerned with staying in power than they are with protecting my family and yours .
Unfortunately , what Mr. Paul is saying …will become so clear to the American people the next time Osama bin Laden attacks inside the United States and we have a disaster bigger than 9/11 .
And then the talk of " they hate us for primary elections " and " they hate us for gender equality " — that will go out the window , and maybe we can get down to brass tacks after we have multiple tens of thousands of dead Americans .
Antiwar Radio ’s Scott Horton also interviewed former CIA counter - terrorism officer Philip Giraldi , who largely shared Scheuer ’s assessment :
I think anybody who knows anything about what ’s been going on for the last ten years would realize that cause and effect are operating here — that , essentially , al Qaeda has an agenda which very specifically says what its grievances are .
And its grievances are basically that " we ’re over there . "
So all Ron Paul was basically saying was that — even as the 9/11 commission report indicated — there were consequences for our presence in the Middle East and if we seriously want to address the terrorism problem we have to be serious about that issue .
Giuliani indicated that he was not only not serious about that issue , but seemed to be ignorant of both the 9/11 [ Commission ] report and political realities in the Middle East .
Ray McGovern , a 27 - year veteran of the CIA , said largely the same thing , telling Horton : " I ’m really edified by Ron Paul stepping up and stating what he believes to be the case .
If you believe that they hate us for our democracy or for our freedoms , well I ’ve got a bridge in Brooklyn that I ’d really like to sell you at a cut rate .
They hate us for our policies and that ’s what Ron Paul was saying ….
Giuliani…really showed his true colors there as a demagogue . "
All three interviews are well worth listening to — as is everything Scott Horton has ever put on the radio , in my opinion .
( These interviews and more are linked here . )
If you want to be talked down to and spoken to in slogans , there is no shortage of opportunities in today ’s America .
Ron Paul , on the other hand , on this as on everything else , refuses to pander to anyone , and tells the truth as he sees it .
( He once told an audience filled with NASA employees that he had consistently voted against their programs — a typical and unremarkable episode for an honest man like Paul . )
Which kind of candidate we wind up with will tell us a lot about the state of our country .

Let ’s go back , way back , to an earlier time when the Universe was a fraction of its current age .
Tiny galaxies , just a fraction of the mass of the Milky Way came together , piece by piece , building up larger and larger galaxies .
Well , we do n’t have a time machine , but we ’ve got the next best things : Hubble and Spitzer , which were called upon to look back into the distant Universe , to watch this process unfold .
The new data gathered by the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope reveal a collection of the smallest , faintest , most compact galaxies ever seen .
These are n’t the majestic spiral galaxies we know and love , but primordial building block galaxies that played an important role in the evolution of the structure of the Universe .
The two great observatories saw these galaxies when they were just a billion years after the Big Bang ; in other words , the galaxies are more than 12 billion light years away .
The images from Hubble are key .
It saw galaxies that only contained blue stars just a few million years old .
These young , hot stars have n’t had a previous generation before them .
They ’re using the pure raw material of the Big Bang – mostly hydrogen and helium – as their fuel , unpolluted by heavier elements .
Spitzer came in after and helped make accurate measurements of the galaxies ’ masses .
“ These are among the lowest mass galaxies ever directly observed in the early universe , ” says Nor Pirzkal of the Space Telescope Science Institute and the European Space Agency in Baltimore , Md .
Three of the galaxies look distorted , with the familiar tadpole shape of a galaxy in a gravitational tangle with another galaxy .
And this is how it started .
These tiny galaxies merged with one another , growing into larger and larger objects , and eventually spirals like our own Milky Way .
The earliest time of the Universe is gradually coming into focus , thanks to these observatories .

Nice to know the Bushies have now turned the World Bank into their own personal cesspool .
Paul Wolfowitz , the brainiac behind the Iraq war , has now made the World Bank his own personal love bank .
If some third world despot did this , Wolfowitz would orchestrate an invasion of his country .
But when Wolfowitz grossly abuses his office in order to pay off his lover , it 's a simple " mistake . "
The man should be run out of the bank on a rail .
What happened to all those conservative concerns about organizations like the World Bank wasting our money ?
Our TAXPAYERS ' money ?
Wolfowitz spent YOUR MONEY , folks , on his lover .
And you can take that one to the bank .
More from the Washington Post :
World Bank President Paul D. Wolfowitz publicly apologized yesterday for the " mistake " of personally orchestrating a high - paying job and guaranteed promotions for a bank employee with whom he is romantically involved , as new details of his role in the arrangement emerged and staff members angrily demanded his resignation .
Wolfowitz attempted to address about 200 staffers gathered in the bank 's central atrium but left after some began hissing , booing , and chanting " Resign . . . . Resign . "
He had approached the gathering after holding a news conference in which he said , " I made a mistake for which I am sorry . "
Bank insiders confirmed reports from the bank 's staff association that Wolfowitz directed personnel officials to give Shaha Riza , his longtime companion , an automatic " outstanding " rating and the highest possible pay raises during an indefinite posting at the State Department , as well as a promotion upon her return to the bank .
Until yesterday , Wolfowitz and his aides had insisted that " all arrangements concerning Shaha Riza were made at the direction of the bank 's board of directors . "
Bank sources said , however , that neither the board nor the ethics committee was aware of the terms of the final agreement .
Wolfowitz bemoaned that the controversy threatens to overshadow the official agenda of the bank 's annual spring meeting opening here today -- including ratification of a global anti-corruption strategy and funding to reduce poverty in Africa .
And to top it off , he lied about it :
Oh , and get this - Wolfowitz is worried that his using Bank money , YOUR money , to pay off his lover might detract from larger issues like his " anti-corruption " campaign .
Now that 's chutzpah :
All of those people who take the Bible literally need to apply the proper rules for killing people by throwing stones .
The process is quite straightforward .
The purpose is to cause the stonees ( the people being struck by the stones ) to die of broken bones and hemorrhaging of blood .
What are the Bible rules regarding stoning ?
Luckily , they have been summarized right here .
I ’ll elaborate on a few of these rules in this post .
As you can see from Deuteronomy 22:13 - 21 , believers in the inerrant Bible need to stone all non-virgins who dare to get married .
It ’s all very logical , you see .
“ Oh , you ’re a woman who is not a virgin ?
Then God requires that I must brutally kill you .
But it truly was such a beautiful wedding . . . ”
According to Deuteronomy 17:2 - 5 , Bible literalists need to kill all of those people who worship gods , other than the god of the Bible , by hitting them with stones .
I escape judgment on these first two rules because I ’m not a woman and I do n’t worship any god , but I ’m afraid that I probably am a “ stubborn and rebellious ” son .
The Bible requires that such sons need to be taken out and killed by hitting them with stones .
See Deuteronomy 21:18 - 21 .
It ’s not entirely clear by this rule whether I also need to also be a glutton and a drunkard to deserve this death - by - stoning penalty .
I might be a glutton ( since I live in a highly materialist society ) , though I ’ve never been drunk .
If I qualify for the death penalty under this rule , I would need to be stoned by all of the men of my city .
I live in Saint Louis ; I ’d therefore have to gather up about one million men for my stoning .
They have to find one million stones , unless they could share a smaller number of stones by taking turns .
The Bible does n’t say whether they could throw things other than naturally formed stones , such as bricks , balls of hardened clay or toasters .
Here ’s another important rule .
Everyone who has gathered sticks on the sabbath needs to die by stoning .
The stones need to be hurled by the entire congregation , per Numbers 15:32 - 56 .
This passage does n’t say what to do if the entire congregation is guilty of gathering sticks on the sabbath .
Maybe they need to gather everyone into one big circle , each person being obligated to throw stones at the person in front of him or her .
The last one standing , I suppose needs to try to commit suicide by hitting himself or herself in the head with a stone .
For the most part , what these stoning rules lack in civility and empathy , they make up for in clarity .
For example , compare these straightforward stoning laws with the immense amount of common law necessitated by vague Constitutional provisions such as the First Amendment .
What would be the result , I wonder , if we put it up for a nationwide vote tomorrow : Shall we throw away the U.S. Constitution and , instead , interpret the Bible literally as the highest source of U.S. law ?
Given the religious ferver that still exists in the U.S. , I suspect the vote would be about 53 % in favor of the inerrant Bible over the manmade Constitution .
Perhaps we could then rename our three branches of government : A ) Executors of Stoning Laws , B ) Makers of Stoning Laws and C ) Courts of Stoning .
Maybe we could also create a new cabinet position of Department of Stoning or maybe a more expansive Department of Sticks and Stones .
What if the Branches of this new government disagree with each other ?
No problem .
Just have them go out back and throw stones at each other .
Since 9/11 the Iranians have tried on several occasions to open a dialogue with the United States .
They , of course , had their own interests at heart , not ours .
Yet , from dialogue some common interests might have emerged .
The Bush Administration would have none of it , and branded Iran a member of the Axis of Evil .
During that period , with most of the world on our side , we had enormous diplomatic , economic and military leverage over Iran .
Now , deeply committed militarily in Iraq , more isolated diplomatically , increasingly indebted to some of Iran 's crude oil customers , only modestly successful in gaining UN sanctions against Iran , the Administration has refused to change our approach , and has instead chosen to augment the least effective element of US power in the region - air and naval .
We are already totally dominant in air and naval power over Iran .
Even with Iran 's new Russian antiaircraft equipment , no one should doubt that US forces could penetrate these defenses and strike with precision with minimal losses .
Iran 's naval countermeasures in the Gulf can be largely preempted .
The Iranians no doubt recognize this .
But the Iranians perceive American weaknesses on the ground , with an American Army too small to invade and occupy Iran , and too engaged inside Iraq even to threaten it .
They see our soldiers through sniper sights , and from behind the triggers of improvised explosive devices , while they see themselves as a nation that gained considerable strength from a war with Iraq that cost a million casualties , took eight years , and involved withstanding missile strikes on cities and the use of chemical weapons .
They no doubt believe that , whatever the current alignments of Sunni states , a US strike against Iran would bring outpourings of sympathy , public support , and waves of impassioned volunteers from throughout the Islamic world .
They would see themselves as the heroic martyrs uniting Islam .
The Iranians may believe this reaction would enforce on the United States a rapid , humiliating withdrawal from the Persian Gulf , leaving them military savaged but strategically victorious .
In this they might very likely be proven wrong .
US power is far more sustainable in the region than Iran would like to believe , and the military humiliation Iran would suffer at the outset could well deter any outside assistance .
The US does have a military option .
But this is a struggle that will be costly for all involved , will further isolate the region , and whose ultimate outcome is likely to be decided by future incumbencies .
Leaders on both sides should recognize that war is the most unpredictable of human endeavors , and that unanticipated consequences almost always follow .
I believe some in the Administration have seen this confrontation as inevitable - or have sought it - since late 2001 .
At that time a Pentagon general held up to me a Defense memorandum which he described as a five year road map to the conflict .
But surely we have learned by now that , particularly in this region , force and the threats of force should be the last , last , last resort .
Military power aside , the US has enormous economic leverage over the Iranians through our influence on world financial institutions , international commerce and capital flows .
While the latest actions against Iran 's banking system show the sharp stick of US power , the potential carrots are enormous , too .
Islamic pride cannot be purchased , but neither can a proud nation ignore a more hopeful vision of its future .
The American troop surge is not likely to impact Iran 's on - the - ground influence in Iraq .
Their presence serves the interests of some in Iraq ; and they are deeply embedded and widely active .
Only their perception of new interests and opportunities is likely to do this .
They would need to see their situation through a different lens .
It is asking a lot .
But , can not the world 's most powerful nation deign speak to the resentful and scheming regional power that is Iran ?
Can we not speak of the interests of others , work to establish a sustained dialogue , and seek to benefit the people of Iran and the region ?
Could not such a dialogue , properly conducted , begin a process that could , over time , help realign hardened attitudes and polarizing views within the region ?
And is n't it easier to undertake such a dialogue now , before more die , and more martyrs are created to feed extremist passions ?
And , finally , if every effort should fail , before we take military action , do n't we at least want the moral , legal and political " high ground " of knowing we did everything possible to avert it ?
Whatever the pace of Iran 's nuclear efforts , in the give and take of the Administrations rhetoric and accusations and Iran 's under - the - table actions in Iraq , we are approaching the last moments to head off looming conflict .
Surely , it is past time to ask our elected officials in the White House and Congress to exercise leadership : recognize the real strategic challenge we face , and start to work now to avoid an escalation and widening of conflict in the Mideast .
Thank you for reading my thoughts on Iran .
This is a critical issue for our nation , and I look forward to discussing it further with you in the comments below .

An international research consortium today published a set of papers that promise to reshape our understanding of how the human genome functions .
The findings challenge the traditional view of our genetic blueprint as a tidy collection of independent genes , pointing instead to a complex network in which genes , along with regulatory elements and other types of DNA sequences that do not code for proteins , interact in overlapping ways not yet fully understood .
In a group paper published in the June 14 issue of Nature and in 28 companion papers published in the June issue of Genome Research , the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements ( ENCODE ) consortium , which is organized by the National Human Genome Research Institute ( NHGRI ) , part of the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , reported results of its exhaustive , four - year effort to build a parts list of all biologically functional elements in 1 percent of the human genome .
Carried out by 35 groups from 80 organizations around the world , the research served as a pilot to test the feasibility of a full - scale initiative to produce a comprehensive catalog of all components of the human genome crucial for biological function .
“ This impressive effort has uncovered many exciting surprises and blazed the way for future efforts to explore the functional landscape of the entire human genome , ” said NHGRI Director Francis S. Collins , M.D. , Ph.D.
“ Because of the hard work and keen insights of the ENCODE consortium , the scientific community will need to rethink some long - held views about what genes are and what they do , as well as how the genome ’s functional elements have evolved .
This could have significant implications for efforts to identify the DNA sequences involved in many human diseases . ”
The completion of the Human Genome Project in April 2003 was a major achievement , but the sequencing of the genome marked just the first step toward the goal of using such information to diagnose , treat and prevent disease .
Having the human genome sequence is similar to having all the pages of an instruction manual needed to make the human body .
Researchers still must learn how to read the manual ’s language so they can identify every part and understand how the parts work together to contribute to health and disease .
In recent years , researchers have made major strides in using DNA sequence data to identify genes , which are traditionally defined as the parts of the genome that code for proteins .
The protein - coding component of these genes makes up just a small fraction of the human genome — 1.5 percent to 2 percent .
Evidence exists that other parts of the genome also have important functions .
However , until now , most studies have concentrated on functional elements associated with specific genes and have not provided insights about functional elements throughout the genome .
The ENCODE project represents the first systematic effort to determine where all types of functional elements are located and how they are organized .
In the pilot phase , ENCODE researchers devised and tested high - throughput approaches for identifying functional elements in the genome .
Those elements included genes that code for proteins ; genes that do not code for proteins ; regulatory elements that control the transcription of genes ; and elements that maintain the structure of chromosomes and mediate the dynamics of their replication .
The collaborative study focused on 44 targets , which together cover about 1 percent of the human genome sequence , or about 30 million DNA base pairs .
The targets were strategically selected to provide a representative cross section of the entire human genome .
All told , the ENCODE consortium generated more than 200 datasets and analyzed more than 600 million data points .
“ Our results reveal important principles about the organization of functional elements in the human genome , providing new perspectives on everything from DNA transcription to mammalian evolution .
In particular , we gained significant insight into DNA sequences that do not encode proteins , which we knew very little about before , ” said Ewan Birney , Ph.D. , head of genome annotation at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory ’s European Bioinformatics Institute ( EBI ) in Hinxton , England , who led ENCODE ’s massive data integration and analysis effort .
The ENCODE consortium ’s major findings include the discovery that the majority of DNA in the human genome is transcribed into functional molecules , called RNA , and that these transcripts extensively overlap one another .
This broad pattern of transcription challenges the long - standing view that the human genome consists of a relatively small set of discrete genes , along with a vast amount of so - called junk DNA that is not biologically active .
The new data indicate the genome contains very little unused sequences and , in fact , is a complex , interwoven network .
In this network , genes are just one of many types of DNA sequences that have a functional impact .
“ Our perspective of transcription and genes may have to evolve , ” the researchers state in their Nature paper , noting the network model of the genome “ poses some interesting mechanistic questions ” that have yet to be answered .
Other surprises in the ENCODE data have major implications for our understanding of the evolution of genomes , particularly mammalian genomes .
Until recently , researchers had thought that most of the DNA sequences important for biological function would be in areas of the genome most subject to evolutionary constraint — that is , most likely to be conserved as species evolve .
However , the ENCODE effort found about half of functional elements in the human genome do not appear to have been obviously constrained during evolution , at least when examined by current methods used by computational biologists .
According to ENCODE researchers , this lack of evolutionary constraint may indicate that many species ’ genomes contain a pool of functional elements , including RNA transcripts , that provide no specific benefits in terms of survival or reproduction .
As this pool turns over during evolutionary time , researchers speculate it may serve as a “ warehouse for natural selection ” by acting as a source of functional elements unique to each species and of elements that perform the similar functions among species despite having sequences that appear dissimilar .
Other highlights of the ENCODE work include :
* Identification of numerous previously unrecognized start sites for DNA transcription .
* Evidence that , contrary to traditional views , regulatory sequences are just as likely to be located downstream of a transcription start site on a DNA strand as upstream .
* Identification of specific signatures of change in histones , which are the proteins that organize DNA , and correlation of these signatures with different genomic functions .
* Deeper understanding of how DNA replication is coordinated by modifications in histones .
“ Teamwork was essential to the success of this effort .
No single experimental approach can be used to identify all functional elements in the genome .
So , it was necessary to conduct multiple , diverse experiments and then analyze them using multiple computational methods , ” said Elise A. Feingold , Ph.D. , program director for ENCODE in NHGRI ’s Division of Extramural Research , which provided most of the funding for the pilot project .
Authors of the ENCODE papers include researchers from academic , governmental and industry organizations located in Australia , Austria , Canada , Germany , Japan , Singapore , Spain , Sweden , Switzerland , the United Kingdom and the United States .
The ENCODE project has been open to all interested researchers who agree to abide by the consortium ’s guidelines .
“ Following the Human Genome Project ’s model of free and rapid data access , we have designated ENCODE as a community resource project .
This designation means all ENCODE data were deposited in public databases as soon as they were experimentally verified , ” said Peter Good , Ph.D. , program director for genome informatics in NHGRI ’s Division of Extramural Research .
The main portal for ENCODE data is the University of California , Santa Cruz ’s ENCODE Genome Browser ( www.genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE); the analysis effort is coordinated from Ensembl , a joint project of EBI and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute , at ( http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/encode.html).
Much of the primary data have been deposited in databases at the NIH ’s National Center for Biotechnology Information at ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/ENCODE.html) and EBI at ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/).

“ It would have been impossible to conduct a scientific exploration of this magnitude without the skills and talents of groups representing many different disciplines .
Thanks to the ENCODE collaboration , individual researchers around the world now have access to a wealth of new data that they can use to inform and shape research related to the human genome , ” said Eric D. Green , M.D. , Ph.D. , director of NHGRI ’s Division of Intramural Research , which has multiple investigators participating in the ENCODE research consortium .
In addition to contributing to the Nature paper , NHGRI intramural researchers authored two of the ENCODE papers in Genome Research .
The first study , led by Elliot H. Margulies , Ph.D. , an investigator in the Genome Technology Branch , analyzed the genomes of 23 mammalian species for all ENCODE targets .
This paper details how Dr. Margulies and his colleagues explored the correlation — and , in some cases , lack of correlation — between DNA sequences that are constrained across mammalian evolution and DNA sequences that act as functional elements .
In the second study , a bioinformatics team led by NHGRI ’s Deputy Scientific Director Andreas D. Baxevanis , Ph.D. , along with Laura L. Elnitski , Ph.D. , an investigator in NHGRI ’s Genome Technology Branch , and Tyra G. Wolfsberg , Ph.D. , an associate investigator in the same branch , describes how they built a Web portal that provides simplified access to data from the ENCODE consortium .
That portal , called ENCODEdb , is freely accessible to the research community at http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/ENCODEdb.
In a related development , NHGRI last month launched a companion project to ENCODE that will identify all functional elements in the genomes of the fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) and the round worm ( Caenorhabditis elegans ) .
That four - year effort , dubbed model organism ENCODE ( modENCODE ) , will examine the functional landscape of the smaller , and therefore more manageable , genomes of the two key model organisms , which should aid efforts to tackle such questions in humans .
The scientific community relies heavily on the fruit fly and round worm to identify common genes , regulatory sequences and processes that underlie human conditions .

Banned by Indian law for more than a decade , the practice of prenatal selection and selective abortion remains a common practice in India , claiming up to half a million female children each year , according to a recent study by the British medical journal , The Lancet .
The use of ultrasound equipment to determine the sex of an unborn child - introduced to India in 1979 - has now spread to every district in the country .
The study found it played a crucial role in thetermination of an estimated 10 million female fetuses in the two decades leading up to 1998 , and 5 million since 1994 , the year the practice was banned .
Few doctors in regular clinics offer the service openly , but activists estimate that sex-selection is a $ 100 million business in India , largely through mobile sex-selection clinics that can drive into almost any village or neighborhood .
The practice is common among all religious groups - Hindus , Sikhs , Jains , Muslims , and Christians - but appears to be most common among educated women , a fact that befuddles public health officials and women 's rights activists alike .
" More educated women have more access to technology , they are more privileged , and most educated families have the least number of children , " says Sabu George , a researcher with the Center for Women 's Development Studies in New Delhi , who did not participate in the study .
" This is not just India .
Everywhere in the world , smaller families come at the expense of girls . "
Like China , India has encouraged smaller families through a mixture of financial incentives and campaigns calling for two children at most .
Faced with such pressure , many families , rich and poor alike , are turning to prenatal selection to ensure that they receive a son .
It 's a problem with many potential causes - from social traditions to the economic burden of dowries - but one that could have strong social repercussions for generations to come .
The Lancet survey , conducted by Prabhat Jha of St. Michael 's Hospital at the University of Toronto and Rajesh Kumar of the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Research in Chandigarh , India , looked at government data collected from a 1998 sample of Indian families in all the districts of the country .
From this data , they concluded that 1 out of every 25 female fetuses is aborted , roughly 500,000 per year .
Many doctors , including the Indian Medical Association , dispute the findings of the report , saying that the number of female feticides is closer to 250,000 per year .
They note that the data sample used by The Lancet study precedes a 2001 Supreme Court decision outlawing the use of ultrasounds to check for girls .
But activists note that the law is largely unenforced .
" If there were half a million feticides a year , " S.C. Gulati of the Delhi Institute of Economic Growth told the Indian news channel IBN , " the sex ratio would have been very skewed indeed . "
Yet the sex ratio is skewed .
According to the official Indian Census of 2001 , there were 927 girl babies for every 1,000 boy babies , nationwide .
The problem is worst in the northwestern states of Haryana , Punjab , Delhi , and Gujarat , where the ratio is less than 900 girls for every 1,000 boys .
Against common expectations , female feticide is not a crime of India 's backward masses .
Instead , it is most common among India 's elite , who can afford multiple trips to an ultrasound clinic , and the hushed - up abortion of an unwanted girl .
In the prosperous farming district of Kurukshetra , for instance , there are only 770 girl babies for every 1,000 boys .
In the high - rent Southwest neighborhoods of New Delhi , the number of girl babies is 845 per 1,000 boys .
Some activists say it is wrong to blame Indian society for the incidents of female feticide .
The main cause for the " girl deficit , " they say , is the arrival of ultrasound technology , and the entrepreneurial spirit of Indian doctors .
" This is not a cultural thing , " says Donna Fernandez , director of Vimochana , a women 's rights group based in Bangalore .
" This is much more of an economic and political issue .
It has got a lot to do with the globalization of technology .
It 's about the commodification of choices . "
Cultures do n't change overnight , of course , so it 's no wonder that activists are focusing attention on regulating the technology that makes feticide possible , the ultrasound .
By law , the government can regulate - but not deny - the use of prenatal diagnostic techniques for the purposes of detecting birth defects , but not gender itself .
Activists say that while most doctor 's offices and clinics have signboards saying that they cannot disclose the gender of a child , it is rare to see a doctor prosecuted if he does so .
Karuna Bishnoi , spokeswoman for UNICEF in Delhi , says it should n't come as a surprise that educated women are among the most likely to use prenatal sex determination .
" I personally believe this as a failure of society , not a failure of women , " says Ms. Bishnoi .
" Women who choose this technique may be victims of discrimination themselves , and they may not be the decisionmakers .
Nobody can deny that the status of women is very low in India .
There is no quick fix to this . "
The cultural practice of giving a dowry to the groom 's family puts a tremendous financial burden on a bride 's family .
The cost of not paying a larger dowry can be even higher .
In the high - tech city of Bangalore , activists report that it is still common for women to be burned alive by husbands who expected a larger dowry .
While most of India 's religions condemn discrimination against women , there are a few temples in the state of Punjab that promise to help bring fewer women into existence .
At the Bir Baba Mandir in Amritsar , couples eat flatbread and onions to ensure a boy child .
As a researcher for 20 years on female feticide , conducting field research in the highly educated state of Tamil Nadu , Sabu George says he has some qualms about The Lancet study .
In particular , he feels that taking the figures from one year and projecting them backward 20 years just does n't square with the facts on the ground .
But while he believes
The Lancet study may have exaggerated the number of female abortions in the past 20 years , it also might underestimate the exponential growth of female feticide into the futures .
" This is a much larger problem in the future , " he says .
" Without strong pressure by civil society groups , we 'll be seeing 1 million female feticides every year within five years time , definitely . "
Building a great mobile app has its difficulties , but translating it should n’t be one of them .
With modern technology we now possess in the year 2019 , we should be able to translate anything , anywhere , anytime .
Let me show you some of the cleanest and most reliable sources for all of your translating needs .
Come on !
i Translate
Here we have an app called “ iTranslate , ” and it ’s easily one of the best translation services on the AppStore .
Because the app has the Dictionary App installed , you ’ll never make a grammatical error again .
With an entire dictionary at your disposal , translating your app should be as simple as downloading the app , installing the dictionary app , and putting up your camera to said language .
When you ’re using iTranslate on your smartphone , it ’s like you ’re looking at the world through a completely different pair of eyes .
It ’s really incredible .
When all you have to do is hold your camera up to your finished product to view it ’s a direct translation , translating your entire interface is as easy as 1 - 2 - 3 .
If you do n’t believe me , you can click on that download link above to get the full scoop .
Google Translate
As bad as it sounds , you need to know that Google Translate is more useful than almost any other translation app , partially because of it ’s a never - ending connection with the world wide web , but also because Google just always seems to know exactly what they ’re doing .
When you ’re translating an app for a foreign market , it ’s important to double check all of your phrases before you send off the final product .
You never know – you could have meant to say something like “ Delete All , ” but you end up with something more along the lines of “ All Deleted ” instead .
Nothing is worse than getting lost in translation , and that ’s especially true for app development .
Nobody wants to take their pride and joy and ruin it with some sloppy translations .
It ’s just a disappointment .
Protecting yourself from errors with Google Translate is easy , and best of all , FREE .
You ’ll never spend a cent when you ’re using it , and the download is free !
TripLingo
TripLingo might seem like a regular old translation app upon first glance , but after you realize how complete it ’s inner workings are , you start to understand how many layers there are to language .
If you want to include some slang words , which is n’t too heavily recommended , I ’d suggest using TripLingo .
It was originally designed for people out on the streets of Europe who did n’t know what the hell was going on , so it has four levels of slang incorporated into its vocabulary .
That means any sort of slang term , from the most basic , to the most complex , will instantly get picked up by this app .
It ’s almost like your own personal Urban Dictionary .
Not bad , huh ?
Well , it ’s also incredibly useful for app development since you can actively avoid using words with more than two meanings – if you catch my drift .
The only thing more embarrassing than making a grammatical or spelling error in your finished product is not installing this app immediately .
It ’s also a nice touch when you download a foreign app that speaks your langue well , so remember that the next time you ’re using a pocket dictionary to translate your app ’s inner workings .
It matters more than you think .
Microsoft and FairUse4WM
If you really want to see Microsoft scramble to patch a hole in its software , do n’t look to vulnerabilities that impact countless Internet Explorer users or give intruders control of thousands of Windows machines .
Just crack Redmond ’s DRM .
Security patches used to be rare .
Software vendors were happy to pretend that vulnerabilities in their products were illusory — and then quietly fix the problem in the next software release .
That changed with the full disclosure movement .
Independent security researchers started going public with the holes they found , making vulnerabilities impossible for vendors to ignore .
Then worms became more common ; patching — and patching quickly — became the norm .
But even now , no software vendor likes to issue patches .
Every patch is a public admission that the company made a mistake .
Moreover , the process diverts engineering resources from new development .
Patches annoy users by making them update their software , and piss them off even more if the update does n’t work properly .
For the vendor , there ’s an economic balancing act : how much more will your users be annoyed by unpatched software than they will be by the patch , and is that reduction in annoyance worth the cost of patching ?
Since 2003 , Microsoft ’s strategy to balance these costs and benefits has been to batch patches : instead of issuing them one at a time , it ’s been issuing them all together on the second Tuesday of each month .
This decreases Microsoft ’s development costs and increases the reliability of its patches .
The user pays for this strategy by remaining open to known vulnerabilities for up to a month .
On the other hand , users benefit from a predictable schedule : Microsoft can test all the patches that are going out at the same time , which means that patches are more reliable and users are able to install them faster with more confidence .
In the absence of regulation , software liability , or some other mechanism to make unpatched software costly for the vendor , “ Patch Tuesday ” is the best users are likely to get .
Why ?
Because it makes near - term financial sense to Microsoft .
The company is not a public charity , and if the internet suffers , or if computers are compromised en masse , the economic impact on Microsoft is still minimal .
Microsoft is in the business of making money , and keeping users secure by patching its software is only incidental to that goal .
There ’s no better example of this of this principle in action than Microsoft ’s behavior around the vulnerability in its digital rights management software PlaysForSure .
Last week , a hacker developed an application called FairUse4WM that strips the copy protection from Windows Media DRM 10 and 11 files .
Now , this is n’t a “ vulnerability ” in the normal sense of the word : digital rights management is not a feature that users want .
Being able to remove copy protection is a good thing for some users , and completely irrelevant for everyone else .
No user is ever going to say : “ Oh no .
I can now play the music I bought for my computer in my car .
I must install a patch so I ca n’t do that anymore . ”
But to Microsoft , this vulnerability is a big deal .
It affects the company ’s relationship with major record labels .
It affects the company ’s product offerings .
It affects the company ’s bottom line .
Fixing this “ vulnerability ” is in the company ’s best interest ; never mind the customer .
So Microsoft wasted no time ; it issued a patch three days after learning about the hack .
There ’s no month - long wait for copyright holders who rely on Microsoft ’s DRM .
This clearly demonstrates that economics is a much more powerful motivator than security .
It should surprise no one that the system did n’t stay patched for long .
FairUse4WM
1.2 gets around Microsoft ’s patch , and also circumvents the copy protection in Windows Media DRM 9 and 11 bet a2 files .
That was Saturday .
Any guess on how long it will take Microsoft to patch Media Player once again ?
And then how long before the FairUse4WM people update their own software ?
Certainly much less time than it will take Microsoft and the recording industry to realize they ’re playing a losing game , and that trying to make digital files uncopyable is like trying to make water not wet .
If Microsoft abandoned this Sisyphean effort and put the same development effort into building a fast and reliable patching system , the entire internet would benefit .
But simple economics says it probably never will .

LAT : Surge fails to bring needed reconciliation to Iraq Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday September 4 , 2007
Print This Email This
As the Bush administration prepares to present its version of " progress " associated with the president 's troop surge that began seven months ago , independent assessments show the surge has failed to catalyze political developments necessary for the country 's future .
The Los Angeles Times reports that Iraq 's parliament has passed none of the major legislation Washington had expected it to approve .
The 28,500 additional troops who have filed into the country since February also have failed to substantially decrease civilian deaths in Iraq , and more Iraqis are fleeing their homes now than before the surge began .
The best possible summation of the surge 's results indicate it has created a " holding pattern " in the country , which is wholly dependent on US troops to maintain what few decreases in violence have been observed .
" The military offensive has temporarily suppressed , or in many cases dislocated , armed groups , " Joost Hiltermann of the International Crisis Group told the Times .
" Once the military surge peters out , which it will if there is no progress on the political front , these groups will pop right back up and start going at each other 's , and civilians ' , throats again . "
President Bush and his allies point to Al Anbar provence as an example of the surge 's success .
Sunni insurgents who previously targeted US troops have shifted allegiances and now fight al Qaeda in Iraq operatives alongside the US .
But , as the Times notes , " There is no indication that progress made there can be replicated on a grand enough scale to have a nationwide effect . "
As Congress prepares to hear from US troop commander Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker next week , debate is expected to address whether the US should maintain its troop increase .
However , reports have indicated that the military does not have enough soldiers and Marines to maintain post - surge levels much beyond next spring .
The Washington Post on Tuesday also examined the surge 's results and found " that recent improvements are sometimes tenuous , temporary , even illusory . "
In Baghdad 's Dora market , military officials point to the fact 349 stores have reopened , but that is less than half the 850 shops the market supported before the US invasion .
Even some soldiers are skeptical of the progress claims .
" Personally , I think it 's a false representation , " Staff Sgt. Josh Campbell told the Post , referring to the portrayal of the Dora market as an emblem of the surge 's success .
" But what can I say ?
I 'm just doing my job and do n't ask questions . "
The hexidecimal representation of a very large number also happens to be the number the MPAA uses to decrypt the contents of HD - DVDs , according to Stibbons .
APNG Update
In a public ( experimental ) release , following the initial alpha release , Opera 9.5 added support for APNG .
Animated PNG is a small extension on top of PNG that , surprise , enables animation .
Alpha transparency and a lot more colors is of course the big advantage here .
Demo pages : 1 , 2 and 3 . APNG Editor add - on for Firefox .
The format is quite trivial to support and does n’t increase the footprint as much as MNG .
Another advantage is that it has fallback support so the image does not become completely unusable in browsers that do n’t support APNG yet , such as Safari , Internet Explorer and older versions of Opera and Firefox .
The main disadvantage of APNG seems to be that it is currently not a standard .
The PNG Group rejected the proposal .
Apparently turning PNG into an animation format besides handling still images was not considered to be a good idea .
It would need to have a separate media type and all that which kind of defeats the purpose of the format as proposed .
There are several counterproposals and there is a page comparing them .
Hopefully everyone can draw their own conclusions out of that data .
Also , avoid using pngcrush on APNG files .
Use svg2png to convert animated SVG to APNG .
That ’s it , I think .

Barnett Rubin relays a message from a well - connected friend in Washington on the Cheney Administration ’s plans to roll out a military confrontation with Iran in September .
He writes at the Global Affairs blog :
” My friend had spoken to someone in one of the leading neo-conservative institutions .
He summarized what he was told this way :
They [ the source ’s institution ] have “ instructions ” ( yes , that was the word used ) from the Office of the Vice - President to roll out a campaign for war with Iran in the week after Labor Day ; it will be coordinated with the American Enterprise Institute , the Wall Street Journal , the Weekly Standard , Commentary , Fox , and the usual suspects .
It will be heavy sustained assault on the airwaves , designed to knock public sentiment into a position from which a war can be maintained .
Evidently they do n’t think they ’ll ever get majority support for this –they want something like 35 - 40 percent support , which in their book is “ plenty . ”
Of course I cannot verify this report .
But besides all the other pieces of information about this circulating , I heard last week from a former U.S. government contractor .
According to this friend , someone in the Department of Defense called , asking for cost estimates for a model for reconstruction in Asia .
The former contractor finally concluded that the model was intended for Iran . ”
— –
Cole : there has been some recent similar reporting .
For instance , just on Tuesday Raw Story covered a paper by two British academics arguing that the US has the capability and perhaps the intention of launching an aerial assault on Iran ’s enrichment facilities .
Earlier , McClatchy reported on Aug. 9 that Cheney has been urging bombing of Iranian trails to Iraq .
This position struck me as eerily reminiscent of Nixon - Kissinger ’s treatment of Cambodia ( which is what really caused the Khmer Rouge horrors , not , as Bush said the other day , US withdrawal from Vietnam ; we dropped enormous amounts of ordnance on that country and severely disrupted it ) .
Also at Raw Story on Aug. 10 .
And Gareth Porter on Aug. 16 responding to the McClatchy article .
So , maybe something is up .
If you want to see what I think of a war with Iran , see this golden oldie .

It can be real breaking news – just one hour ago a big explosion happened in St. Petersburg downtown .
Many local bloggers started posting photos of 16 - stored house high fire .
People say that the explosion was so loud that it was heard at all the parts of the Russia second most populated city .
More updates would follow shortly .
No comments from authorities were yet made .
More photos and videos :
Here are two videos :
and two more photos :
and some Russian Photoshop lovers started already expressing their view on the subject , it symbolizes probably that in the lack of information any version is possible :
“ It has gone . ”
This silver skyscraper building was planned to be built in historical center of the city and was not appreciated on a larger scale by local population .
Also it correlates with a famous phrase by Mr. Putin at Larry King ’s show when he was asked what has happened with “ Kursk ” submarine ( sunk , 100+ dead ) .
He answered : “ It has sunk . ”
And that ’s Chumazik ( Choomuhzeek ) , Russian first Internet hero .
The predecessor of Glazastik .
He appears each time when Photoshopers come to play .
“ Allah Akbar ” is written in Russian on this one .

Bernie Reese : this is exactly was OpenID needs : Open iDNS , or “ Open Id Domain Name System . ”
This service would work just like DNS , and would map email addresses to an OpenID provider designated by the owner .
Looking at Jabber recently caused me to see this prior discussion in a new light .
With Google Talk , one ’s gmail.com email - style address is one ’s identity .
I just created a second address , one without a gmail .com account behind it .
And Google Talk and GMail seem to be doing just fine .
Part of the problem is that the people working on OpenID are concerned about privacy , and the perception is that giving away an email address may be revealing too much .
But as email address can be minted at will , the user is still in full control .
And those that wish to can still use http flavor URIs , so nobody loses .
Another part of the problem is that the solution proposed required people to do real work , deploy real software in production , and have to deal with all of the counter - measures designed to stop spammers , etc .
Ironically DNS SRV records were dismissed prematurely :
Although big providers could easily adopt this , others ( consumers , mostly ) would have to make substantial efforts in order to adjust .
[ Emphasis added ]
Here ’s a version of the consumer side of the code for a fully load balancing solution :
import DNS , sys , random DNS.ParseResolvConf ( ) # resolve _xmpp-server per RFC 2782 for domain in sys.argv [ 1 : ] : # resolve the service request = DNS.Request ( qtype='srv' ) response = request.req ('_xmpp-server._tcp.%s . ' % domain ) services = [ service [ ' data ' ] for service in response. answers ] # choose services with the highest priority services .
sort ( ) services = [ service for service in services if service [ 0 ] ==services [ 0 ] [ 0 ] ]
# make a weighted choice amongst these services random. shuffle ( services ) choice = sum ( [ service [ 1 ] for service in services ] ) * random.random ( ) for service in services : choice -= service [ 1 ] if choice <= 0 : print " % s:\t %s : %d " % ( domain , service [ - 1 ] , service [ - 2 ] ) break else : print " % s:\t < none > " % domain
Try it against gmail.com to see how it works .
DNS records are already distributed and cached , so after the first request there would be little to no noticeable latency .
The software is already deployed .
People could update SRV records without needing to wait for clients to be deployed , and clients could start checking for this without waiting for people to update SRV records .

The English Editor Screenshot Tour First , a couple of notes :
The cursor does n't show up in these screenshots , because that 's the way BeOS does screenshots .
More importantly , the coolest aspects of the program involve animation ( scrolling , margin resizing ) , which can't be shown here .
Here is what an English Editor window looks like : Notice how it resembles a piece of paper , with wide margins .
There is no menu bar or toolbar ; all controls are in the margins , and only appear as the cursor approaches them .
For instance , the scroller is in the lower - right corner :
The margin controls are in the lower - left corner , up against the text .
The text reflows live as you move them :
In the upper - right corner are the change indicator ; the asterisk control that brings up a window for creating new documents ; and the commands .
The mouse is over the " Undo " command , and the " Redo " command is disabled : Clicking inside the document provides an insertion point for editing .
In this case , the insertion point is between two words ; typing will create a new word : Double - clicking selects a word : Triple - clicking selects a sentence : Quadruple - clicking selects a paragraph : Selected text is moved by dragging .
As you drag , an arrow indicates where the text will go .
Words can go only between other words , sentences between other sentences ... ... and paragraphs between other paragraphs : The English Editor can work with plain ASCII text files , Usenet messages , and ( in a limited way ) HTML files .
Probably the most annoying missing feature right now is cut - and - paste .
Work on the original English Editor has stopped in favor of The English Editor II , which will look and work much the same , but which is XML / DOM - based and supports stylesheets .
A Contra Costa County school district's use of wood chips in play boxes makes it harder for boys and girls in wheelchairs to get to swings and slides , a violation of the disabled children 's rights , a federal judge has ruled .
The decision by U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken of Oakland could lead to replacement of wood chips with firmer surfaces in public playgrounds at other schools and parks around the country , said a representative of the group that sued the Mount Diablo Unified School District in central Contra Costa .
" Our experts and people with disabilities tell us that wood chip surfaces are not accessible , " said Larry Paradis , executive director of Disability Rights Advocates .
" They constantly form mounds and gullies ... and they 're impossible to maintain .
Little kids in wheelchairs are already struggling to get around , they have less muscular strength , and it 's important that play structures be easily accessible for them so they can be mainstreamed ( with other children ) as much as possible . "
Wilken ruled this week that the Mount Diablo district , which has 32 elementary schools and 16 middle and high schools , was violating a 2000 agreement to make its playgrounds accessible to the disabled because it uses wood chips .
She gave school officials a month to work out a replacement plan with Disability Rights Advocates , representing a student who sued the Concord - based district in 1998 .
Paradis said Friday that he would like the district to install rubberized play box matting , which he said costs more to put in than wood chips but less to maintain .
Attorneys for the school district were unavailable for comment on the ruling .
In a recent court filing , district lawyer Gregory Widmer said there was " no evidence that any student with a mobility disability ever complained about the accessibility " of play boxes with wood chip surfaces .
He also said rubberized mats are eight times as expensive as wood chips and would cost the district more than $ 2.7 million if installed in 32 play boxes .
But Paradis said wood chips do n't meet disabled children 's needs for a firm and stable surface , with little or no sloping , to wheel themselves to swings , slides and sandboxes .
He said wood chip manufacturers have been boosting their sales and misleading customers by asserting that their product meets the standards of disability laws .
However , a playground designer said Friday that federal regulators have found that engineered wood fiber , the product used in schools and parks , complies with accessibility standards if properly compacted and maintained .
" Most places can't maintain it to that level , and they 're probably better off with rubber , " to reduce maintenance costs and the likelihood of lawsuits , said Susan Goltsman , whose Oakland firm , MIG , also designs schools and zoos .
She said both products are safe , although wood chips are more yielding and may cushion falls better .

Aesthetically , though , a mix is best , Goltsman said .
" If you 've got a monoculture of the same surfacing material everywhere , you 've got a boring environment , " she said .
" It 's like having asphalt everywhere . "
Wilken 's ruling follows a report by an MIG consultant who studied the play boxes and their use by disabled children in the 2005 - 06 school year .
Both sides said the consultant 's findings supported their position .
Paradis said he hopes the case encourages other districts in California and elsewhere to quit installing new wood chip play boxes and gradually replace the old ones .
" We want districts to learn from Mount Diablo 's mistake , " he said .
Opinion
Save the Earth , buy less
China will over take the United States next year to become the world 's largest producer of greenhouse gases .
China and the United States together emit 40 percent of the planet 's carbon dioxide , according to the International Energy Agency .
It is clear that leadership , not finger - pointing , is required from both of these nations if the global community is to deal successfully with the challenge of climate change .
China points to the fact that each American is responsible for generating six times more carbon dioxide than the average Chinese citizen , ( 24.5 tons to 3.9 tons , respectively ) .
Washington , for its part , refuses to take action until China agrees to binding emissions reduction targets , while Beijing claims that the culprits are the developed nations , which have no right to deny economic growth to others .
Apportioning blame is of little use .
What is important is to resolve this climate stalemate .
The White House likes to remind our global neighbors that the United States is the only remaining superpower .
But China is catching up quickly .
The market - based reforms initiated by Deng Xiaoping and cemented into place by each successive Chinese leader have led to 10 percent annual economic growth .
Goldman Sachs projects that by 2027 the Chinese economy will be larger than that of the United States .
China 's growth , however , is powered by America 's demand for consumer products -- and this growth is fueled by coal .
These two factors lie at the heart of the political impasse .
China and the United States each worry that if they agree to binding greenhouse - gas reduction targets , their respective house of economic cards will collapse .
This unhealthy symbiotic relationship needs to be unraveled if any global post - Kyoto global warming agreement is to be reached .
The high rate of consumer spending over the past several years is credited with keeping the U.S. economy afloat , but it did n't come without consequences .
The products we buy have an enormous impact on the climate , and represent the hidden cost of our consumer lifestyle .
Each TV , cell phone , kitchen appliance -- in fact every consumer item we buy from China ( or elsewhere ) -- creates greenhouse - gas emissions to produce and transport .
Americans have become deeply addicted to consuming .
If it 's cool , if it 's trendy , if it 's shiny and new , we buy it .
As a consequence , we are running up ever - higher levels of debt in order to have a lifestyle beyond our financial means and beyond the ability of the Earth to sustain it .
Americans spent $ 42 billion more than they earned last year , turning the annual U.S. savings ratio negative for the first time since the Great Depression of the 1930s .
If the United States imports less , China 's gross domestic product growth will slow .
This would accomplish Beijing 's goal of cooling down the overheated Chinese economy , and the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank 's desire to put U.S. savings in the black .
Reducing economic reliance on China 's production and our consumption , however , can only be achieved by buying less .
In America , consumer spending drives a full 70 percent of our economy .
This is significantly higher than any Western European country .
Norway , consistently ranked by the United Nations as the best country in which to live , spends only 43 percent of its GDP on stuff .
So buying less can bring rewards by helping get us out of debt , removing the need for more self - storage units and reducing our impact on the planet .
China , for its part , needs to meet us halfway by using available technologies to manufacture products more efficiently ( i.e. , expending less energy per dollar of product ) and to move its national energy mix away from coal - fired generation .
So the next time you think about going into debt to be able to buy your third plasma TV , a new massaging recliner , or when you are about to dump your Blackberry for an iPhone , think of the economic and environmental benefits of buying less .
( CNN ) -- Heidi Gill admits she had been drinking at a bar in Warren , Ohio , and gotten into a " disagreement " with a bartender earlier this month .
But she said she did n't deserve to have a police officer use a Taser gun on her multiple times .
Warren , Ohio , officer Rich Kovach is on paid administrative leave pending an investigation .
Video footage from the police cruiser shows Gill , 38 , crawling on the ground while the officer stands over her with the stun gun .
She 's screaming wildly .
At one point , officer Rich Kovach shoves her with his foot as she struggles .
" I 've never been electrocuted , " she told CNN's " American Morning " on Wednesday .
" I did n't know what this was .
And I really did n't think this pain was ever going to stop .
It was nonstop . "
She said she was trying anything to get away " so I could live . "
Watch Gill describe the Taser treatment »
In the video , Gill , once inside the police car , kicks the back - seat window and continues to scream .
" At this point , I had been Tased for so long and just drug around by my handcuffs .
I was terrified of this man .
He was no longer a police officer to me . "
Authorities have launched a formal investigation into the September 2 incident .
Kovach has been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation .
Police referred all questions to the city of Warren 's legal department .
Greg Hicks , law director for Warren , said the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation will analyze the Taser gun to determine how many times it was used .
Kovach said he used the device on Gill at least seven times , including twice while she was handcuffed , according to the police report .

Taser effects 
An average Taser device can emit a 50,000 - volt electric shock .
In comparison , a device in emergency rooms to shock hearts back to life starts at around 300 volts .
 A shock of half a second duration will cause intense pain and muscle contractions , startling most people , according to sources familiar with Taser devices .
 Two to three seconds of the shock will often cause the subject to become dazed and drop to the ground .
More than three seconds of exposure usually disorient a person and cause him or her to drop to the ground for at least several seconds .
 Taser International Inc. , the company that makes the device , warns law enforcement agencies that " prolonged or continuous exposure " to the shock may lead to medical risks such as cumulative exhaustion and breathing impairment and even heart damage .
From CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta
" What kind of threat did she pose to the officer and the public ?
She had no weapon , " said her attorney , Mark Hanni .
Hicks said Gill was extremely intoxicated and that she was not obeying the officer 's commands when the Taser gun was used .
He said police have the right to deploy the force that 's necessary when confronted with such situations .
When a Taser gun is used and it does n't temporarily incapacitate the suspect , he said , police can use it again .
" It 's a good , nonlethal weapon for somebody who is out of control , " he said .
In the police report , Kovach describes responding to a " fight / disturbance " at the Up A Creek tavern and finding a belligerent Gill , who began cursing , refused to give her real name , then ran to the back of the property and got into a sport utility vehicle that was n't hers .
She was hunched in the driver 's seat hiding from Kovach , according to the report .
" She was drunk behind the wheel of a car , " Hicks said .
The officer asked her to get out and she refused , trying to " climb over to the passenger seat to jump out the passenger side of the car .
I then Tasered her from my position , " the report said .
Kovach acknowledges using the stun gun several more times to try to get her under control .
He said once he got her into his cruiser , she kicked out the back window , tried to climb in the front of his car and would not listen to him , the report said .
He used the Taser device again and requested a car with a cage to transport Gill .
As he was moving her to the other vehicle , the officer said she tried to run away again , so he used the stun gun one more time .
" She fell to the ground , " according to the report .
" I did see her body hit the pavement and then her head . "
Gill said she was in pain throughout the ordeal .
" At one point , you can see me crawling on the ground .
I was just grasping for grass , rocks , anything that I could just crawl away from him . "
Gill was charged with resisting arrest , disorderly conduct , vehicle trespass for getting into a car that was n't hers and assault on a police officer .
Hicks said those charges are under review and could be lessened .
Authorities also are examining the officer 's behavior .
" We 're going to try to get to the bottom of the whole thing , " Hicks said .
Gill said she has had vision and other medical problems as a result of the officer 's actions .
She said she has nearly three dozen burn marks on her pants as a result of the officer using the Taser gun so many times .
Gill has not filed a formal complaint with the police , according to Hicks .
Dan Letson , an attorney for the Up A Creek tavern , said a list of employees who witnessed what happened in the bar , leading to Gill being escorted out , has been turned over to investigators .

BAGHDAD , Aug. 23 — The number of Iraqis fleeing their homes has soared since the American troop increase began in February , according to data from two humanitarian groups , accelerating the partition of the country into sectarian enclaves .
Despite some evidence that the troop buildup has improved security in certain areas , sectarian violence continues and American - led operations have brought new fighting , driving fearful Iraqis from their homes at much higher rates than before the tens of thousands of additional troops arrived , the studies show .
The data track what are known as internally displaced Iraqis : those who have been driven from their neighborhoods and seek refuge elsewhere in the country rather than fleeing across the border .
The effect of this vast migration is to drain religiously mixed areas in the center of Iraq , sending Shiite refugees toward the overwhelmingly Shiite areas to the south and Sunnis toward majority Sunni regions to the west and north .
Though most displaced Iraqis say they would like to return , there is little prospect of their doing so .
One Sunni Arab who had been driven out of the Baghdad neighborhood of southern Dora by Shiite snipers said she doubted that her family would ever return , buildup or no buildup .
Most Bay Area counties are easing restrictions , but at different degrees .
It ’s hard to keep track of what ’s happening where .
So we broke it down for you here .
In much the same way , unexpressed anger can give a one - two punch to your energy level .
The reason : " We 're expending all our energy trying to contain our angry feelings , and that can be exhausting , " Baard tells WebMD .
The good news , says Baard , is that we can counter these energy killers by programming more relaxation activities into our day .
While for many folks , increasing exercise burns off the chemical effects of stress and anger , others find relief in quiet pursuits : listening to music , reading a steamy romance novel , or even just talking on the phone .
" Whatever is relaxing for you will reduce tension and that will help increase energy , " says Baard .
6. Drink More Water and Less Alcohol
You may already know that it 's easy to confuse signals of hunger with thirst ( we think we need food when we really need water ) .
But did you know that thirst can also masquerade as fatigue ?
" Sometimes , even slight dehydration can leave you feeling tired and lethargic , " says nutritionist Keith Ayoob , EdD , RD , an associate professor at the Albert Einstein School of Medicine in New York and author of The Uncle Sam Diet .
The solution is simple : a tall , cool glass of water .
This is particularly important to boost energy after exercise , when your body is likely to be craving fluids , Ayoob says .
Conversely , Heller says , if you find yourself frequently fatigued even after a good night 's sleep , try cutting down on alcohol during the evening hours .
' While alcohol initially helps you fall asleep , it also interferes with deep sleep , so you 're not getting the rest you think you are -- even if you sleep a full eight hours , " she says .
By cutting down on alcohol before bedtime , you 'll get a better night 's rest , which is bound to result in more energy the next day .
7. Eat More Whole Grains and Less Sugar
The key here is keeping blood sugar balanced so energy is constant .
" When you 're eating a sweet food , you get a spike in blood sugar , which gives you an initial burst of energy , " Heller says .
" But that 's followed by a rapid drop in blood sugar , which in turn can leave you feeling very wiped out . "
VIDEO UPDATE :
As seen below , we 've obtained footage of the actual branding , which was recorded by a small camera inserted in the patient 's stomach .
A Kentucky woman claims that a doctor branded her uterus with the initials of his alma mater during an operation to remove the organ last year , according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday .
Stephanie Means , a 38 - year - old school administrator , alleges that while Dr. James Guiler ( picture at left ) performed an August 14 hysterectomy at Central Baptist Hospital in Lexington , he " used a cauterizing instrument to intentionally brand the letters ' UK , ' approximately 4 - 5 cm in height , on Plaintiff Stephanie Means 's uterus . "
Means 's lawsuit , a copy of which you 'll find here , notes that since she and her husband were apprehensive about the surgery , Guiler filmed the procedure and gave the couple a copy of the videotape , which , the Fayette Circuit Court lawsuit states , " clearly showed the instrument being used to brand Stephanie 's uterus . "
Guiler , a 1976 graduate of the University of Kentucky College of Medicine , was a sponsor of a 2001 fundraiser benefitting UK 's basketball museum .

Johnston said he had followed events on a radio during most of his time as a hostage and thanked people round the world , as well as his colleagues at the British public broadcaster , for their support and efforts to help secure his release .
He said he had spoken briefly to his family in Scotland .
The BBC issued a statement on behalf of Alan 's parents , Graham and Margaret Johnston , and his sister Katriona :
" A short time ago , we received the news we ’ve waited 114 days for – that Alan is free and is safe - and we are overjoyed .
" The last 114 days have been a dreadful time for us – but particularly for Alan .
Through it all , we never lost hope .
Alan had always told us of the friends he ’d made in Gaza .
We knew , in the end , they would be there for him .
" We ’ve always known Alan was special .
But the last 14 weeks have shown us how special he is to others - to his friends in Gaza , to his colleagues at the BBC , and to the listeners and viewers who ’ve written in their thousands .
Their support has buoyed us up through the darkest days .
We ’ve drawn our strength from them .
" We want to thank all those who ’ve worked so hard to secure Alan ’s release -- the people in Gaza , those in the wider Middle East region , as well as the Foreign Office and the BBC . "
Hamas had demanded Johnston 's freedom since it violently seized control of Gaza last month , in an apparent bid to gain favour with the West .
On Tuesday , Hamas gunmen took positions around the stronghold of the shadowy group holding Johnston , stepping up the pressure to secure his release .
Johnston was kidnapped from a Gaza City street on March 12 , spending far more time in captivity than any Western journalist abducted in Gaza .
Hamas had said it knew where to find him , but has not raided the hideout for fear he would come to harm .
Members of Hamas ' 6000 - strong militia moved onto rooftops of high - rise buildings on Tuesday and deployed gunmen in streets in the Gaza City neighbourhood inhabited by the Doghmush clan .
The large , heavily armed family leads the Army of Islam , a little known group that has been holding Johnston .
" The clocks have begun ticking toward the release of Alan Johnston , '' said Hamas spokesman Ghazi Hamad .
" The operation of the interior ministry Executive Forces has started , and they are tightening the siege on the people involved in his kidnap . ''
The Doghmush clan last night released nine students loyal to Hamas that they kidnapped earlier in the week .
Hamas officials and mediators said the release was meant to pave the way for Johnston 's release .
Then four of Army of Islam members were freed by Hamas , said Abu Mujahid from the Popular Resistance Committees , the militant group handling the negotiations .
Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum accused Johnston 's captors of smearing the Palestinian people 's reputation and of seeking " to prove to the world that we are a group of militias that fight each other to gain personal ends . ''
The Army of Islam , whose formerly close relations with Hamas have soured , had demanded that Britain first release a radical Islamic cleric with ties to al - Qaeda .
It also had threatened to kill Johnston if Hamas tried to free him by force .
On Monday , Hamas arrested the spokesman of the Army of Islam , giving it a potentially valuable bargaining chip in its efforts to release Johnston .
Last week , the Army of Islam posted a video message from Johnston on a militant web site in which he appeared to be wearing an explosives belt that he said his captors would detonate if there were an attempt to free him .
The same group was involved in the capture of Israeli Cpl. Gilad Shalit , who was seized more than a year ago in a raid on an Israeli army post near Gaza .

Childhood stress can interfere with the development of the teeth to the extent that a traumatic experience leaves a recognisable line in the tooth enamel that remains as a record of past traumas .
I discovered this when reading about a study published in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences [ pdf ] that used these lines to compare the number of childhood traumatic experiences that occured in people diagnosed with schizophrenia and healthy controls .
New approaches to the problem of estimating stress during early brain development are required .
In this regard , human enamel has promise as accessible repositories of indelible information on stress between gestation and the age of 13 .
Stressful experiences induce long - term activation of the sympatho - adrenal system , slowing of tropic [ growth - related ] parasympathetic functions , and they then induce disrupted secretion of the enamel matrix .
During the brain development ( in infancy , childhood and preadolescence ) , ameloblast activity in human enamel is slowed during 1 to 2 days of extreme stress , and the segment of enamel rods is smaller and often misshapen , making a particular dark line seen by the use of a microscope ( we referred this line to Pathological Stress Line , PSL in short ) .
Retzius reported that this line is incremental lines reflecting the layered apposition of enamel during amelogenesis ( Retzius , 1937 ) , and after that this line is termed the Retzius line .
The line is conceptually akin to tree rings which are markers of environmental adversity in the tree ’s life .
Schizophrenia was once thought to be largely caused by genetic factors , but in the last decade a number of studies have shown that childhood trauma contributes to the chance of developing the disorder .
One difficulty with this type of research is that it often relies on people remembering back to their childhood after the onset of psychosis , which could mean that the memories are n’t perfectly reliable in some cases .
Stress - induced lines in tooth enamel are one way of looking at the link between trauma and schizophrenia that does n’t rely on potentially hazy memories of the past .

So a guy logs into Facebook .
He posts a message on some girl 's wall .
This makes her socially obligated to reciprocate .
The whole transaction is public .
What he said does n't matter .
What she said does n't matter .
Each creates social capital for the other .
So what ?
Now Girl C comes along .
She visits the profile of Guy A .
She sees that Girl B posted on his wall .
He looks non-threatening .
Maybe even a good guy to get to know better ...
( Trust me , this totally works .
I read it on a blog .
I think it was Guy Kawasaki . [ 1 ] )
This is what Facebook was made for .
Facebook is n't a platform for " connecting people . "
It 's a platform for creating and distributing social capital .
Take a look at the most popular apps .
The majority do one or both of the following
They make you look cool .
They make your friends look cool .
Strategy # 1 is the tried and true .
The best non-facebook example is the ringtone industry .
Why does a twelve - second ringtone sell for $ 3.50 when the whole song is only a buck ?
Because it lets you express yourself .
In other words , it makes you look cool .
How much is that self - expression worth ?
Apparently at least three billion dollars a year .
While it 's unclear whether Where I 've Been will achieve profitability , there is clear precedent for people shelling out on this type of prepackaged self - expression .
I think though that the real potential of Facebook comes through strategy # 2 .
That is , making your friends look cool .
There was this running joke this fall that instead of giving my girlfriend little gifts , I 'd give them to her friends to give to her instead .
That way not only would she know that I 'd been thinking of her , but so would all her friends .
( If a girl thinks her friends would date you , she 's much less likely to break up with you .
Trust me , this totally works .
I read it in a magazine .
I think it was PC Gamer . [ 2 ] )
On Facebook , doing nice things for others has these multiplicative effects because it 's something that others can see .
Not only does doing something nice show the other person that you care , but it also makes them look cool .
And with any luck they 'll reciprocate and make you look cool back .
Several of the top ten Facebook apps take advantage of this phenomenon .
Apps # 2 Graffiti , # 7 X me , # 8 Superpoke , # 9 Free Gifts , # 15 Superwall , # 16 Foodfight in particular . [ 3 ]
There seems to be a pattern .
A good app lets you buy an mp3 for a dollar .
A great app lets you buy your friend an mp3 for a dollar .
A good app makes your taste in clothes look cool .
A great app makes your friends ' taste in clothes look cool .
A good app lets you poke yourself .
A great app lets you ...
Well , you get the idea
With all the hype these days you'd think that in five years Facebook will be used for everything from shopping to ordering takeout .
I doubt it .
The user interface is n't good enough .
The user experience would be incoherent .
People do n't go to Facebook to buy .
They do n't go to Facebook to sell .
They go to Facebook because they care about their friends .
And the real strength of the platform lies with this , with the creation and distribution of social capital .
And I expect that in the long term the most successful Facebook apps will be the ones that realize this and leverage it .
[ 1 ] False .
But now he 's socially obligated to link back to my blog .
Unless he 's a bad person .
You 're not a bad person , are you Guy ???
[ 2 ] False but accurate .
[ 3 ] True .

General Sir Mike Jackson , who headed the army during the war in Iraq , described as " nonsensical " the claim by the former US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld that US forces " do n't do nation - building " .
He has also hit back at suggestions that British forces had failed in Basra .
Mr Rumsfeld was " one of the most responsible for the current situation in Iraq , " Gen Jackson says in his autobiography , Soldier .
He describes Washington 's approach to fighting global terrorism as " inadequate " for relying on military power over diplomacy and nation - building .
Last week General Jack Keane , a US commander just returned from Iraq , said the security situation in southern Iraq was " deteriorating " and there was " general disengagement " by the British military in Basra .
But Gen Jackson told the Daily Telegraph , which is serialising his book : " I do n't think that 's a fair assessment .
" What has happened in the south , as in the rest of Iraq , was that primary responsibility for security would be handed to the Iraqis once the Iraqi authorities and the coalition were satisfied their training and development was appropriate .
" In the south we had responsibility for four provinces .
Three of these have been handed over in accordance with that strategy . "
He is also critical of the decision to hand control of planning the administration of Iraq to the Pentagon , and said disbanding the Iraqi army and security forces had been " very short - sighted " .
The Pentagon said divergent views were a " hallmark of open , democratic societies " .
THE employment statistics and the bond market are combining to send out a warning that has been heard only rarely in the past two decades : A recession is coming in the United States .
The two charts show the double warning .
Both charts warned of an economic downturn before the 1990 and 2001 recessions , and they are doing so again .
While each has arguably registered false warnings , they have never done so together .
The first chart shows the difference between the yield on two - year Treasuries and the Federal Reserve ’s target rate for federal funds — the rate on loans between banks .
In normal times , the Treasury rate is usually higher .
In bond market jargon , the opposite condition is an inverted yield curve .
And when it is very inverted , the recession warning is sent .
If you are n’t already using StumbleUpon to find cool websites about all sorts of stuff , you may not get these jokes – but you should become part of the StumbleUpon social and website network !
The first and last image shown here are real screenshots encountered while Stumbling , while the rest are satirical , critical and otherwise humorous responses to aspects of StumbleUpon .
(8) Stumbling too fast : this is a real message you get when you are simply Stumbling like mad .
It is probably a good sign you should be doing something else besides using StumbleUpon
(7) I HAS STMBLED TWO MUCHEZ : speaking of Stumbling too fast , there is also such a thing as Stumbling too much !
This particular meme ( a derivative of the LOLCATS phenomenon ) started on one site and spread virally throughout StumbleUpon .
(6) The Perfect StumbleUpon Page : a fairly hilarious spoof of the somewhat formulaic content that seems to succeed more often than not on the site .
This is probably related to how many Stumblers just vote on a quick view of what is visible ‘ above the fold ’ on a page .
(5) StumbleUpon Insomnia : of course , you ’re really not a true Stumbler until you stay up too late Stumbling things .
Hopefully , however , you ’re not trying to Stumble while driving !
(4) Here ’s a Suggestion : agree or disagree , this is a pretty clever way to visually play off the fact that you can , in fact , point to where peoples ’
StumbleUpon buttons are .
The creator also has a point : a lot of people spend a surprising amount of time trashing pages they could just Stumble past !
(3) STOP QUOTING THE ENTIRE PAGE : again , not all Stumblers think this is good advice – but we are all familiar with those reviews that replicate the entire content of the page in the review itself .
The irony , of course , is that many people who saw this quoted it all !
(2) Adult StumbleUpon Feature Request Spoof : many Stumblers are all too familiar with the crossed out image on the left .
A vocal minority of Stumblers keeps reintroducing that meme into the mix .
One Stumbler finally got fed up and made the entire above image .
(1) You have seen all StumbleUpon pages .
Explore others : this is , amazingly enough a real screenshot displayed when people have Stumbled their way through all of the content under a given tag .
What makes it , of course , even funnier is the double - reading : all StumbleUpon pages ?
Really ?
That ’s the end of StumbleUpon ?
Wow !
Every summer , residents of Atlanta and geeks from all over the world get ready for Dragon Con , a meeting of sci- fi and fantasy fans .
The convention , which takes place over Labor Day weekend , attracts a crowd .
Attendance in 2011 was around 46,000 people , from fans to dealers to guests [ source : Dragon Con ] .
The convention spans five hotels -- the Hyatt Regency Atlanta , the Marriott Marquis , the Atlanta Hilton , the Sheraton Atlanta and the Westin Peachtree Plaza -- and its Saturday morning parade stops traffic downtown .
This may not sound like much compared to Comic - Con , which boasts more than 140,000 attendees , or CES , which has to categorize its vendor listings so people can find their way around .
But Dragon
Con has its own sense of overwhelming , nerdy bustle and its own hazards .
Here are some suggestions for making it through the weekend without mishaps .

First , get through registration as early as possible .
If you live in the Atlanta area , or if you 're arriving on Thursday , stop by registration and pick up your badge on Thursday , the earlier the better .
The convention wo n't have officially started yet , but you 'll be able to get your badge , program book and pocket program , and stay around for some of the concerts and meetups that have sprung up on Thursday night .
If you can't make it to registration on Thursday , try to get there early on your day of arrival .
While arriving earlier wo n't necessarily mean less time spent in line -- queuing up early has become a Dragon Con tradition -- it should mean less time spent in line while the convention is actually going on .
Dragon Con switched to a barcode system for 2011 to make the registration process smoother , and the Daily Dragon ( the official convention newsletter ) offers other tips for making registration go faster .
If you 've never attended Dragon Con , Thursday night is also a good time to get acquainted with where everything is , before the rest of the convention crowd arrives .
The Hyatt 's floor plan can be a little confusing , so take a good look at the map and explore the hotel on your own .
For convention veterans , this is a good time to check out anything that may have changed from previous years .
You 'll also find some unofficial parties and meet - ups going on : the Daily Dragon has a list .
Regardless of when you get to the convention , your badge is essential .
You 'll need to wear your badge the entire time you 're at the convention .
If you lose your badge , you 'll have to buy a new one .
It 's a good idea to bring or buy a lanyard that will hold your badge securely .
You can also keep the clip closed by wrapping it with a small rubber band .
Also , make sure your badge 's laminated cover is completely sealed so that the inside of the badge does n't slip out .
The pocket program will tell you what 's going on at the convention .
To do things the old - fashioned way , pick up a copy at registration and sit down with a pen or a highlighter and mark everything you want to attend on the schedule grid .
But here 's a caveat : Because of last - minute changes and updates , the pocket program is usually out out of date before the convention even begins .
If you 've got a smartphone , your best bet for making sure your schedule is up - to - date is one of the official apps .
There 's one for Android , one for iOS devices , and one for everything else .
The convention organizes its programming into tracks so it 's easier to find the panels and events that interest you .
You may want to take a look at what 's going on in all of the tracks so you do n't miss something that may have been fun or interesting .
If you 're interested in celebrity events , make sure to take a careful look at everything that 's happening in the hotel ballrooms .
These larger rooms are usually the venues for the most prominent guest panels .
Next , we 'll look at some ideas for making it through the convention itself .

Engineers at the University of Pennsylvania have taken a step toward simplifying the creation of nanostructures by identifying the first inorganic material to phase separate with near - perfect order at the nanometer scale .
The finding provides an atomically tuneable nanocomposite “ workbench ” that is cheap and easy to produce and provides a super - lattice foundation potentially suitable for building nanostructures .
The findings appear in the August issue of Nature Materials .
Alerted by an unusual diffraction effect of a common ceramic material , researchers used imaging to identify a two - phase structural pattern ideal as the first step towards nanodevice construction .
Practical application of nanotechnology will rely upon engineering ’s ability to manipulate atoms and molecules into long - range order to produce materials with desired functionalities .
The Penn findings provide a simpler method for the ordering of composite parts on the nanometer scale , which is integral to the incorporation of nano - objects such as particles and wires that make up nanodevices .
The material used in the Penn study is an ionically - conductive , crystalline ceramic ( Nd 2/3-x Li 3 x ) TiO 3 that engineers observed with transmission electron microscopy .
The powdered perovskite exhibited two distinct patterns at the atomic scale with identical periodicity : a nanoscale chessboard pattern and a diamond pattern that indicated periodic separation into two phases within the structure .
This spontaneous separation of phases could present a new foundation on which to build nanodevice technology .
This material – made using standard and easily reproducible ceramic processing methods – represents the formation of a spontaneous microscopic surface controlled on the nanoscale with atomic precision .
Further study revealed that the separation of the structure into two distinct phases was a result of the oxide separating into lithium rich squares and lithium poor stripes .
By varying the amount of lithium and neodymium , two ingredients in the ceramic powder , engineers controlled the length and spacing of the alternating phases , thereby tuning the workbench upon which nanodevices could be built .
On a larger - than - atomic scale , the research extends science ’s knowledge of the properties of a most common oxide structure type , currently used for superconducting materials , magnetoresistive materials and ferroelectrics .
“ This study represents great potential for the use of standard ceramic processing methods for nanotechnology , ” said Peter K. Davies , chair of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Penn .
“ The phase separation occurs spontaneously , providing two phases whose dimensions both extend into the nanometer scale .
This unique feature could lead to its application as a template for the assembly of nanostructures or molecular monolayers . ”

One of the most difficult jobs for the US Iraq Study Group , which is due to report today , has perhaps been to pinpoint the moment that Iraq started to go wrong .
How did scenes of joyful Iraqis hacking down Saddam 's statue so quickly turn into images of car bombs , grieving mothers and burning helicopters ?
Some experts argued before the panel that it was a mistake to disband the Iraqi security forces .
Others said there had not been enough troops on the ground .
In most analyses , however , there is a tendency to treat the invasion and post- invasion of Iraq as separate entities .
The invasion is generally portrayed as well planned and executed , the post - invasion strategy as ill thought - out , chaotic and undermanned ; hidden somewhere in the months following the arrival of US forces in Baghdad there lies a magic moment when Iraq somehow began to descend into chaos .
In fact , the fight to get to Baghdad and the one coalition forces have been engaged in ever since have much in common .
All the information about the nature of the trouble to come was apparent from the first days of the war .
If lessons learned then had been incorporated into military and political thinking , it would have injected a much - needed dose of realism at an early stage .
Those lessons were best synthesised in a little known but bloody battle , fought in a lesser known part of Iraq on day four of the war .
It was a battle that America nearly lost .
It was dawn on March 23 2003 when marines from Task Force Tarawa approached the town of Nasiriya in southern Iraq .
They had been assigned a routine manoeuvre , taking two key bridges to open up a route to Baghdad .
Nasiriya was a predominantly Shia town that had rebelled against Saddam Hussein during the first Gulf war .
US intelligence suggested that as soon as the Americans rolled into town , the city 's defenders would lay down their weapons and , as one marine commander expressed it , " put flowers in our gun barrels , hold up their babies for us to kiss and give us the keys to the city " .
But when Task Force Tarawa 's lead units reached the outskirts they came across the burnt out remnants of several vehicles of the US army 's 507th Maintenance Company .
A captain in the 507th told wide - eyed marine commanders how his convoy had taken a wrong turn at night , driven into Nasiriya and been attacked by Iraqi fighters .
Several US soldiers were still missing , including a young army private , Jessica Lynch .
It was her fate that attracted attention in the days following .
But it's what happened to Task Force Tarawa that is most instructive about the nature of the Iraq war and about what life would be like once coalition forces got to Baghdad .
As marine units moved into Nasiriya they were attacked by massed numbers of Iraqi fighters .
To the surprise of marines on the ground , few of the Iraqi combatants seemed to be wearing military uniforms .
Many were dressed in the distinctive black pyjamas worn by Shia Muslims , and much of the gunfire came from dwellings flying black flags , denoting them as Shia homes .
And yet the Shias were supposed to be on the Americans ' side .
What 's more , as the marines were drawn into a raging battle in the city centre , more and more people came out of ordinary homes to take up arms .
One group of young marines , separated from their unit and forced to commandeer a house , found themselves under attack for several hours from what appeared to be armed civilians .
They had been expecting to fight Iraqi soldiers .
Instead they found themselves shooting at old men , women , even children .
Of course , there were Sunni -led fedayeen troops and foreign fighters who fought that day .
But some who picked up weapons were also civilians intent on defending homes against foreign invaders .
The potent and complex mix of insurgency - Sunni and Shia militants , civilians and foreign fighters - that causes such chaos in Iraq today was already apparent during the battle of Nasiriya .
Intelligence about the terrain was also sorely lacking .
Marine tanks spearheading the manoeuvre took a route that led to a bog where they sank , mired uselessly in thick mud , while the battle raged .
This is more than just a metaphor for coalition forces post- invasion , in towns such as Falluja and Samarra .
It was the product of a rush to arms without adequate intelligence or planning .
At one stage in Nasiriya , in a friendly - fire incident , US planes fired at marines on the ground , killing up to 10 .
Radio communications repeatedly failed .
Units lost contact with each other and went missing in the city .
Faced with an increasingly determined enemy , marine commanders thought they might just lose the battle .
It showed another truth , obscured during the march to Baghdad , that has become strikingly apparent since .
There is a limit to what armour and technology can do against a people with faith , who fight because they feel their country has been violated .
There were other incidents in Nasiriya , minor at the time , that foreshadowed events that would become an international embarrassment .
At one point , a marine commander came across a gruesome scene : young marines , standing over a pile of Iraqi corpses , taking photos of each other , thumbs up and grinning inanely .
One year later the first photos of US soldiers grinning over the bodies of abused prisoners emerged .
But what was most striking at Nasiriya in those very early days of the war was the absence of that grand coalescence of freedom - deprived Iraqis who were to come forward and support coalition forces .
At best , civilians stood by and watched the US war machine thunder into town .
At worst , they ran to arms staches , grabbed AK47s and took to the streets .
And that did not bode well for life in post- invasion Iraq .
Instead of coming together , Iraqis would fall back into their faiths and tribes and end up killing coalition forces , and each other .
Eighteen marines died in Nasiriya that day in what turned out to be the bloodiest phase of the Iraq invasion .
Four days later the city was finally declared secure .
One week after that American forces triumphantly entered Baghdad and toppled Saddam 's statue .
There was much praise for the speed and efficiency with which US forces had fought their way to Baghdad .
And the trauma of Nasiriya was forgotten .
And that was a shame .
If the intelligence from Nasiriya had been gathered , recognised and analysed more soberly early on - instead of trampled in a rush of triumphalism - coalition forces might have learned useful lessons for the reconstruction of Iraq : the limits of military power ; the importance of understanding the complexity of a place and its people ; the perils of underestimating an enemy .
Instead , George Bush stood on the USS Lincoln and made his hubristic speech announcing the end of combat operations under a banner that read " Mission Accomplished " .
The battle of Nasiriya taught that there was , contrary to first appearances , no simple route to Baghdad .
It should also serve to remind those in London and Washington that there will be no simple route out of it , and that the next move Britain and the United States make in Iraq should be handled with less haste , more care , more sensitivity , and more humility .

Before FDR stole the term coined by Yale Professor William Graham Sumner , " The Forgotten Man " was a hypothetical " D " who was stuck with the bill after " A " and " B " got together to find a way to help poor , suffering " C. " ( FDR of course , tried to make us forget about " D " by claiming " C " was " The Forgotten Man . " )
I have attempted to make my new book ( The Big Ripoff : How Big Business and Big Government Steal Your Money ) a book for the Forgotten Man .
Specifically , I describe how big businesses lobby for and profit from big government programs  higher taxes , stricter regulation , corporate welfare  that rip off consumers , entrepreneurs , and taxpayers .
The Forgotten Man is an abstraction , but in researching some big ripoffs for The Big Ripoff I came across a man whose name is now immortal among lawyers , but who still is fairly called " The Forgotten Man . "
His name is Pennington : James Pennington .
In the field of anti-trust , that name is now synonymous with the collusion between big business , big government , and big labor .
Lest his story be forgotten , I will tell it here .
The 1950s began with labor unrest in the coal industry .
Mineworkers , protesting their wages , shortened their weeks and threatened to walk out .
Things were approaching a crisis .
That year labor and ownership came face to face .
George H. Love had worked in a coal mine in his youth , but then went to Harvard Business School .
By 1950 , Love had pieced together a coal empire , combining a handful of coal companies into Pittsburgh Consolidated Coal Company , the world 's largest coal company .
When Love sat down at the table he was representing not only his own coal giant , but all the big soft coal mine operators in the country .
Across from him was John L. Lewis .
The son of Welsh immigrants , Lewis was working the mines by the age of 15 .
At 37 years old , he was the head of the United Mine Workers of America ( UMW ) .
He founded the Congress of Industrial Organizations , which is now the " CIO " of the AFL - CIO .
When the two hammered out an agreement giving Lewis almost everything he wanted on wages and hours , newspapers called it " submission " on the part of Love .
As the agreement played out for the rest of the decade , it began to look like something else .
A jury later it called it " a conspiracy . "
The agreement was modified over the next few years , and by 1958 , the coal companies Love had represented were paying far higher wages than any other industry .
They were also prohibited from buying coal from or selling it to non-union shops , and could not lease their land to non-union shops .
This arrangement , it turns out , was a good one for the big coal companies .
The large mine operators were already shifting towards increased mechanization of mining .
This increased productivity , which offset the higher wages .
If George Love paid a worker 50 % more , but the worker dug up twice as much coal each day , Love was paying less per ton than before .
These machines , however , were expensive , and the smaller coal companies could not afford them .
If all mineworkers demanded these wages , the small coal companies would go out of business .
Even with mechanization , Love and Lewis knew these agreements would drive up the cost of mining coal .

This was unproblematic as long as the costs were being absorbed by the whole industry — which was almost the case .
There still remained , however , small coalmine operators who did not sign onto Love 's agreement .
The agreements surely made things harder for the little guys , with the higher union wages dragging away most potential labor .
But they could still survive as long as they had customers .
Given their lower costs , these small , non-union mines ( such as James Pennington 's Phillips Brothers Coal Company ) could get customers by charging less for their coal than Love 's mines would .
So , the unions and big coal mines tried to take away these small coal companies ' labor .
A union organizer in 1955 beat Andrew Frost for refusing to sign a union contract , Frost testified in court .

But this was n't enough , so big business and big labor had to take away their customers .
The typical way to do that would be to offer a better product or lower prices .
But coal is a commodity : a ton of Mr. Pennington 's coal is no worse than a ton of Mr. Love's .
Also ,
Love was charging more , and had to , thanks to his higher wages .
Why , then , would a buyer ever willingly pay higher prices for a commodity ?
He would do so only if he were spending someone else 's money .
Enter big government .
During the Depression , Franklin Roosevelt created the Tennessee Valley Authority , which was supposed to create jobs and electrical power at the same time .
The TVA originally was in the business of building and operating dams , which would use water to generate electricity .
By 1954 , however , it was in the business of coal - run power plants .
This made it the largest coal customer in the country .
In 1954 , the TVA bought 8 million tons of coal from the " dogholes in the mountains " as Lewis called the small coal mine operators .

Lewis and Love would set this right .
Lewis met with Dwight Eisenhower 's Secretary of Labor , James Mitchell .
The Labor Department , Lewis argued , should invoke the Depression - era Walsh - Healey Act , which allowed the federal government to set a minimum wage for any company receiving a government contract worth $ 10,000 or more .
Love , of course , agreed with Lewis , and all the biggest coal companies joined forces .
They leaned on the Eisenhower Administration to go even farther than Lewis 's original request , and stop making even small purchases ( exempt from Walsh - Healey ) from small mine operators .
Lewis and his big business cohorts got their way , and the federal government agreed to freeze out any coal company not paying union wages  all in the name of protecting the worker , FDR's " Forgotten Man . "
But what about Sumner 's Forgotten Man ?
The small operators were now unable to sell coal or subcontract for the big operators ( thanks to the labor agreements ) and also unable to sell to the biggest coal customer in the country : Uncle Sam .
From the small mine operators ' perspective , a conspiracy of big labor , big business , and big government , was threatening their existence .
Some tried to make due under these restrictions .
Others caved and signed the union contracts .
James Pennington ran the Phillips Brothers Coal Company , which , facing all these handicaps for non-union operators , signed on with Lewis 's agreements .
Soon he found it impossible to afford the high costs , and he was unable to make the contributions ( 40 cents per ton ) to the mineworkers ' retirement fund that the agreement demanded .
Pennington went out of business , but then he fought back .
He went to court in 1961 , alleging a conspiracy in restraint of trade that violated anti-trust laws .
Pennington argued that the big coal companies and the UMW had conspired to drive him and other small coal companies out of business by demanding the companies contribute 40 cents to a UMW retirement fund for each ton of coal mined and by imposing the high minimum wage .
He also alleged that the unions loaned millions of dollars to the companies to help them conspire against the little guys .
Pennington 's argument , as summarized later by the Supreme Court , was : " the union entered into a conspiracy with the large operators to impose the agreed - upon wage and royalty scales upon the smaller , nonunion operators , regardless of their ability to pay and regardless of whether or not the union represented the employees of these companies , all for the purpose of eliminating them from the industry , limiting production and pre-empting the market for the large , unionized operators . "
In May 1961 , a jury found the union guilty .
In December 1963 , a federal appeals court upheld that verdict .
UMW went to the Supreme Court .
Justice Byron
White wrote that the agreements between Love and Lewis might have constituted a conspiracy in constraint of trade , but that bilateral agreement was n't what drove Pennington under .
The nail in Pennington 's coffin was the entrance of the government into the conspiracy .
According to White , that government 's involvement also made the conspiracy legal .
The opinion read : " Joint efforts to influence public officials do not violate the antitrust laws even though intended to eliminate competition . "

The irony in the case of Pennington is that as long as the conspiracy did not involve the government , it was ineffective and illegal .
Once the government entered , the big business - big labor plan to drive out the small guy started to work .
The net effect of coal companies ' going out of business was a marginal upward pressure on coal prices for consumers .
This meant that electricity bills were higher than they would have been .
To the degree the TVA was paying more for coal , its customers and its patrons — the taxpayers — were paying more .
The agreements also led to massive unemployment in the coal mining industry .
James Pennington lost his coal company , and then his court case .
In so doing , he won eternal fame among anti-trust lawyers .
The Noerr - Pennington doctrine , combining the coal case with a similar case ( Noerr ) in the realm of trucking and railroads , lays out , in effect , that a conspiracy in restraint of trade is legal as long as one of the co-conspirators is the government .
