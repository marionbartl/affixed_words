Professor Michel Barsoum stands before one of the Egyptian pyramids for which he has found evidence suggesting some of the stone blocks were cast , not quarried .
This Behind the Scenes article was provided to LiveScience in partnership with the National Science Foundation .
" This is not my day job , " begins Michel Barsoum as he recounts his foray into the mysteries of the Great Pyramids of Egypt .
As a well respected researcher in the field of ceramics , Barsoum never expected his career to take him down a path of history , archaeology , and " political " science , with materials research mixed in .
As a distinguished professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Drexel University , his daily routine consists mainly of teaching students about ceramics , or performing research on a new class of materials , the so - called MAX Phases , that he and his colleagues discovered in the 1990s .
These modern ceramics are machinable , thermal - shock resistant , and are better conductors of heat and electricity than many metals — making them potential candidates for use in nuclear power plants , the automotive industry , jet engines , and a range of other high - demand systems .
Then Barsoum received an unexpected phone call from Michael Carrell , a friend of a retired colleague of Barsoum , who called to chat with the Egyptian - born Barsoum about how much he knew of the mysteries surrounding the building of the Great Pyramids of Giza , the only remaining of the seven wonders of the ancient world .
The widely accepted theory — that the pyramids were crafted of carved - out giant limestone blocks that workers carried up ramps — had not only not been embraced by everyone , but as important had quite a number of holes .
Burst out laughing
According to the caller , the mysteries had actually been solved by Joseph Davidovits , Director of the Geopolymer Institute in St. Quentin , France , more than two decades ago .
Davidovits claimed that the stones of the pyramids were actually made of a very early form of concrete created using a mixture of limestone , clay , lime , and water .
" It was at this point in the conversation that I burst out laughing , " Barsoum said .
If the pyramids were indeed cast , he said , someone should have proven it beyond a doubt by now , in this day and age , with just a few hours of electron microscopy .
It turned out that nobody had completely proven the theory … yet .
" What started as a two - hour project turned into a five - year odyssey that I undertook with one of my graduate students , Adrish Ganguly , and a colleague in France , Gilles Hug , " Barsoum said .
A year and a half later , after extensive scanning electron microscope observations and other testing , Barsoum and his research group finally began to draw some conclusions about the pyramids .
They found that the tiniest structures within the inner and outer casing stones were indeed consistent with a reconstituted limestone .
The cement binding the limestone aggregate was either silicon dioxide ( the building block of quartz ) or a calcium and magnesium - rich silicate mineral .
The stones also had a high water content — unusual for the normally dry , natural limestone found on the Giza plateau — and the cementing phases , in both the inner and outer casing stones , were amorphous , in other words , their atoms were not arranged in a regular and periodic array .
Sedimentary rocks such as limestone are seldom , if ever , amorphous .
The sample chemistries the researchers found do not exist anywhere in nature .
" Therefore , " Barsoum said , " it 's very improbable that the outer and inner casing stones that we examined were chiseled from a natural limestone block . "
More startlingly , Barsoum and another of his graduate students , Aaron Sakulich , recently discovered the presence of silicon dioxide nanoscale spheres ( with diameters only billionths of a meter across ) in one of the samples .
This discovery further confirms that these blocks are not natural limestone .
Generations misled
At the end of their most recent paper reporting these findings , the researchers reflect that it is " ironic , sublime and truly humbling " that this 4,500 - year - old limestone is so true to the original that it has misled generations of Egyptologists and geologists and , " because the ancient Egyptians were the original — albeit unknowing — nanotechnologists . "
As if the scientific evidence is n't enough , Barsoum has pointed out a number of common sense reasons why the pyramids were not likely constructed entirely of chiseled limestone blocks .
Egyptologists are consistently confronted by unanswered questions :
How is it possible that some of the blocks are so perfectly matched that not even a human hair can be inserted between them ?
Why , despite the existence of millions of tons of stone , carved presumably with copper chisels , has not one copper chisel ever been found on the Giza Plateau ?
Although Barsoum 's research has not answered all of these questions , his work provides insight into some of the key questions .
For example , it is now more likely than not that the tops of the pyramids are cast , as it would have been increasingly difficult to drag the stones to the summit .
Also , casting would explain why some of the stones fit so closely together .
Still , as with all great mysteries , not every aspect of the pyramids can be explained .
How the Egyptians hoisted 70 - ton granite slabs halfway up the great pyramid remains as mysterious as ever .
Why do the results of Barsoum 's research matter most today ?
Two words : earth cements .
" How energy intensive and / or complicated can a 4,500 year old technology really be ?
The answer to both questions is not very , " Barsoum explains .
" The basic raw materials used for this early form of concrete — limestone , lime , and diatomaceous earth — can be found virtually anywhere in the world , " he adds .
" Replicating this method of construction would be cost effective , long lasting , and much more environmentally friendly than the current building material of choice : Portland cement that alone pumps roughly 6 billion tons of CO2 annually into the atmosphere when it 's manufactured . "
" Ironically , " Barsoum said , " this study of 4,500 year old rocks is not about the past , but about the future . "

Editor 's Note :
This research was supported by the National Science Foundation , the federal agency charged with funding basic research and education across all fields of science and engineering .
When Theodore H. Maiman unveiled the world ’s first working laser 47 years ago , headline writers around the country were stimulated into paroxysms of hyperbole .
“ L.A. Man Invents Death Ray , ” wrote one .
In fact , Maiman ’s device was a lousy death ray , as President Reagan discovered when he proposed a space - based laser defense system .
But it turned out to have so many other uses -- supermarket scanners , eye surgery and measuring devices -- that Maiman was nominated for the Nobel Prize and inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame .
Advertisement
Maiman died May 5 in a Vancouver , British Columbia , hospital after a long illness , his wife , Kathleen , said Wednesday from the couple ’s home in Canada .
He was 79 .
Maiman was born July 11 , 1927 , in Los Angeles , the son of an electrical engineer and hobbyist inventor .
He worked his way through the University of Colorado , where he earned his bachelor ’s degree , by repairing electrical appliances .
He studied physics at Stanford , getting his master ’s degree in 1955 shortly after physicist Charles H. Townes rocked the scientific world by building the first device to concentrate and intensify electromagnetic energy , the maser .
While the maser depended on microwave energy , Townes suggested that another device operating on the same principle might use visible light .
Advertisement
That touched off a scramble among various scientific laboratories , including Bell Labs , where Townes worked , and Hughes Research Laboratories in Malibu , where Maiman worked .
Maiman , who spent $ 50,000 , won the race .
“ It was a flash .
You saw a bright red spot on the wall , ” he told the Washington Post years later .
“ It worked the first time , ” Maiman told the Vancouver Sun in 2000 .
“ I was exhilarated ....
I thought , ‘ Wow , it ’s working ! ’
But to tell you the truth , I was a little numbed ....
I did not appreciate the gravity of what I had done . ”
Even so , it would be Townes who got the Nobel Prize ( when Bell Labs claimed the invention ; Maiman , intensely competitive , would demand to see their laser ) .

The concept behind a laser uses an energy source such as a powerful light beam to stimulate the atoms in a medium , which in the case of Maiman ’s laser was a synthetic ruby .
Maiman put reflective silver on each end of the ruby tube so that the light beam bounced back and forth , gaining intensity until a single pulse of highly concentrated light was emitted .
Albert Einstein first speculated about the possibility of such intensified radiation in 1917 .
He suggested that a photon -- the massless particle of light -- could stimulate an atom in a high - energy state to emit two photons .
What gave Maiman ’s laser its power was the fact that the photons were virtual copies of each other .
In the early days , lasers were cataloged by units called Gillettes ; an eight - Gillette laser was powerful enough to burn through eight razor blades .
In the crush of publicity over Maiman ’s invention , he sometimes found himself defending his work .
When actress Bette Davis asked him at a cocktail party if he felt guilty for the mayhem his device would cause , he replied that no one had ever been killed by a laser .
Many had been healed by one , he said .
Advertisement
She apologized .
Ironically , considering how many uses the laser serves today , some scientists could n’t see a use for the device .
It was , they said , a solution without a problem .
Maiman was n’t one of them .
He quickly left Hughes and founded Korad Corp. to develop increasingly powerful laser devices .
Korad was bought out by Union Carbide in 1968 .
In 1972 , Maiman co-founded Laser Video Corp. to develop large - screen , laser - driven video displays .

Although he never won the Nobel Prize , he was honored with many other awards , including the Japan Prize in 1987 , the Wolf Prize in Physics from Israel ’s Wolf Foundation and the Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize from the American Physical Society .
In 2000 , he published “ The Laser Odyssey , ” his version of the historic scramble to build the first laser .
Townes , reached by phone at his home in Berkeley , said Maiman “ had a remarkable discovery .
He built the first laser , and he had an important role in the laser business . ”
Formerly a resident of Santa Barbara , Maiman and his wife , Kathleen , moved to Vancouver nearly a decade ago after a visit .
They became permanent residents of Canada but did not become citizens .
Kathleen Maiman said her husband had been ill for some time , but doctors only recently diagnosed him with a rare genetic disease for which there is no cure .

He remained vigorous almost to the end , she said .
“ He was extremely determined , ” she said .
The family is planning to set up scholarships in the memory of Maiman and his daughter , Sheri Maiman Warner , who died a decade ago .
His papers are being archived at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver .

Many people think that if you want to play games on your PC , you ’ll need to have an expensive , high - end computer .
Our Build - It configuration for the is tempting and impressive , but it ’s really an anomaly :
Most gamers do n’t have PCs nearly that expensive .
As much as we ’re impressed by the sheer power of rigs like that , and by the fantastic craftsmanship of the systems in our Ultimate Game Machine competition , a PC that will let you play all of today ’s games does n’t have to cost a ton of money .
Most sub -$ 1000 PCs from major manufacturers are decent , but they ’re not quite optimized for games .
Sometimes you can get very close ; just a video card upgrade and you ’re good to go .
Often , name - brand PCs keep their prices down by making a little extra money on the side , agreeing to pre-load your system with software that sucks up valuable resources and bogs everything down .
The solution ?
Build your own !
Our recipe for a gaming PC costing around $ 800 is surprisingly powerful , with room to grow .

Logos are usually not chosen at random but rather for the message they convey , though sometimes mistakes seem to happen .
Logos can easily offend people , certainly those who have a very broad definition of blasphemy .
This is the Arabic script for " Allah . "
It resembles a flame with five tongues that increase in size :
Six years ago Nike had to recall 800,000 shoes because Muslims took offense at the logo on a certain brand of its models .
According to " offended " Muslims the logo could be read as " Allah . "
Below is the shoe logo :
Last year Burger King had to change the logo of an ice - cream cone because , according to " offended " Muslims it could be read as " Allah . "
The chain is being forced to spend thousands of pounds redesigning the lid with backing from The Muslim Council of Britain .
It apologised and said : “ The design simply represents a spinning ice - cream cone . ”
The offending lid was spotted in a branch in Park Royal last week by business development manager Rashad Akhtar , 27 , of High Wycombe .
He was not satisfied by the decision to withdraw the cones and has called on Muslims to boycott Burger King .
He said : “ This is my jihad .
How can you say it is a spinning swirl ?
If you spin it one way to the right you are offending Muslims . ”
Below is the ice - cream logo and the Arabic script for Allah :
In 1987 the United Nations changed the logo of its Human Rights Commission from a flame ( below , on the left ) into something ( below , on the right ) resembling ... , well , that looks strikingly like the Arabic word " Allah . "
So far , there have been no protests from " offended " Muslims , though the logo definitely looks more like " Allah " than the Nike and Burger King logos .
Was the change in the UN Human Rights logo a coincidence ?
Some specialists do not think so .
Apparently it may have been a high - ranking Muslim UN official who changed the logo .
It is perhaps as much a coincidence as last week 's common declaration signed by EU Foreign Policy Coordinator Javier Solana , UN Secretary - General Kofi Annan and Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu , the Secretary - General of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) .
The three men pledged to rewrite the UN Human Rights Charter to “ protect the sanctity of religions and the prophets . ”
About the uproar in Muslim countries regarding the Danish Muhammad cartoons they said : “ We understand the deep hurt and widespread indignation felt in the Muslim world .
The freedom of the press [...] should respect the beliefs and tenets of all religions . ”

Computer models show how to give metals more mettle .
A simulation of a shock wave travelling up through nanocrystalline copper , squishing grains together as it goes .
© Science
Sudden shocks make you harder .
At least , they can do if you 're a metal .
A team of researchers in the United States and Switzerland hope that this discovery could point the way to ultra - hard metals for engineering in extreme environments , such as nuclear fusion reactors .
The team simulated the atomic - scale structure of a slab of copper , made up of a patchwork of grains about 20 nanometres ( millionths of a millimetre ) across .
Their study showed that the material becomes harder and stronger after a shock wave has passed through .
An explosion could produce such a shock , suggest the team , led by Eduardo Bringa at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California .
Ultra - hard metals are needed not just for military armour but for applications such as nuclear fusion .
Researchers are looking into initiating fusion reactions using laser blasts , and very strong materials are needed to contain these reactions .
“ We can go even further along the hardening path than people thought . ”
James McNaney
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , California
Metals are a patchwork of grains stuck together .
These materials bend and deform when misalignments of rows of atoms , called dislocations , slip through a grain .
This allows the material to adapt itself to different shapes when under stress , making the metal soft .
Smaller grains make for harder metals , because dislocations tend to get stuck when they reach the edge of a grain .
So in grains just a few tens of nanometres across , dislocations can move travel a very small distance , limiting how much the material can change shape .
Slip and slide
But there is a limit to the strengthening effects of shrinking crystalline grains .
If stressed far enough , the grains themselves may slip and slide against each other , deforming the material .
Bringa and colleagues sought to stop these slips by investigating what happens when one subjects a metal with nanoscale grains to sharp shocks .
A shock wave creates a very high pressure over a very narrow region as it travels through a material .
As the region of stress is on the same size scale as a grain itself , the pressure can't force grains to slide over each other .
Instead , the material can only accommodate the deformation by dislocations appearing within the grains .
But this time , that hardens the metal , they report in Science1 .
The dislocations produce kinks on the grain edges that knit them together , providing extra strength .
" The dislocations hook the grain boundaries a little bit and stop them sliding , " says team member James McNaney of the Lawrence Livermore .
" That way , we can take nanocrystalline metals even further along the hardening path than people thought we could . "
Shocker
The researchers have preliminary evidence that same thing happens in real life , as well as simulations .
A piece of nanocrystalline nickel , after being subjected to an explosive shock , becomes peppered with dislocations inside the grains .
" Normally you never see that , because the grains slide first , " says McNaney .
The team has n't tested the strength of their shocked nickel , because such measurements are tricky with such tiny amounts of material .

Julia Weertman , a specialist in nanocrystalline metals at Northwestern University in Evanston , Illinois , says that the results are interesting and could be useful for fusion research .
But for large - scale industrial applications such as aerospace engineering , she says , the question is whether one can make enough of the material to be useful .
" The jury is out on that , " McNaney admits , although he says that there are already industrial techniques for shocking large volumes of materials .
He thinks that these strengthened metals might make ultra - hard coatings for other materials .
Weertman also cautions that hardness comes at the cost of brittleness .
" Dislocations serve a purpose in engineering , " she says .
" They make things more forgiving .
That 's why we make aircraft out of [ bendy ] metal instead of [ brittle ] ceramics . "
McNaney agrees : " What you 'd like is something that is ductile and strong at the same time . "

Spam messages punting pornographic websites dropped in frequency to reach an all time low last month .
Adult spam represented only three per cent of the total amount of spam sent , while overall junk mail levels remained virtually unchanged , according to a study by net security firm Symantec .
Health , financial and product spam dominate the junk mail landscape with scam emails accounting for a mere eight per cent of junk mail traffic .
Symantec reckons 70 per cent of the total email volume in February was spam , a slight increase on previous months .
Many of these spam messages ( 38 per cent ) adopted the increasingly popular tactic of displaying spam messages in the form of images , a tactic designed to foil less sophisticated anti-spam software .
A separate study by email filtering firm MessageLabs , also covering February , paints a different picture of junk email trends .
MessageLabs reckons the global ratio of spam in email traffic was 77.8 per cent ( or one in 1.29 emails ) , an increase of two percentage points on previous months .
One in 203.7 ( 0.49 per cent ) of emails sent in February involved some form of phishing attack .
MessageLabs estimates 55.4 per cent of all malicious emails intercepted in February were phishing attacks , a decrease of 0.8 percentage points from January 2007 . ®
The Rebels start in the cup .
Here ’s the most common question a Business Analyst ( BA ) is ever asked : “ What does a BA do ? ” my standard answer is “ It depends who ’s employing me and what stage a project is at . ”
A slightly better explanation of what I do is a combination of translator and problem solver .
The idea is that I understand both the business side and technical side of projects well enough to translate for each camp because in my experience , both the IT group and the business group have trouble communicating their issues in a way the other group understands or finds useful .
I usually find that part easy but the problem solving side can present some prickly challenges .
Perhaps the most obvious reason problem solving presents challenges is that the problems are often quite difficult ones – otherwise they would n’t be problems , right ?
The second , and usually thornier , issue is that problems often morph from being technical problems into being political issues .
For programmers who do n’t understand why you need BAs , this is their main service to you : they ’re a shield against the idiocy that threatens to destroy your working days .
If all a BA ever does is come up with creative ways to say “ You ’re an idiot , we ’re not doing that , ” then that BA is your best friend .
Because no matter how much an idiot deserves to be told “ You ’re an idiot , ” it ’s rarely a good career move to put it so bluntly .
That brings me to the title of this piece : although “ discretion is the better part of valour ” is a well known saying , I often find myself struggling with identifying the boundary between discretion and wimping out .
Bowing to pressure every time it ’s applied is a recipe for disaster but continuing to argue way past the point of productivity is also destructive for all concerned .
Unfortunately , solving this is more art than science – there is no single equation that can be applied ( this might explain why , in my experience , many programmers have trouble dealing with this issue . )
You have to take into account the importance of the person who may be demanding a particular solution , the cost ( in both time and money ) of going along with a demand , the potential long term impacts of both resisting and going along with a demand , the technical feasibility of a demand and how your recommendation is going to affect your standing in the organisation ( or marketplace if you are dealing with customers ) among other factors .
So , having said there are no hard and fast rules to govern this situation , here is my number one rule to apply when you find yourself being pressured to do something you think is wrong .
Avoid saying one proposal is wrong unless you can put forward an alternative that you think is right .
I learned this approach from an old boss of mine who had two sayings “ Do n’t tell me I ’m wrong unless you can tell me what ’s right , ” and “ Do n’t come to me with problems , come to me with solutions . ”
Now , she was one of my best bosses but she could be a bit hard - headed this way .
You literally could n’t go to her and complain without offering a viable alternative – she simply would n’t listen .
This approach is good for forcing you to think but it does n’t really fit situations where you just know a proposal is wrong but you have n’t yet come up with an alternative .
Sometimes stopping forward momentum is as important as providing an alternative trajectory .
This brings me to my second rule : if you ca n’t offer an alternative at least clearly articulate what your problems are .
Simply saying “ it wo n’t work , ” is n’t good enough .
Even if you ’re right .
Because human nature is an unpredictable thing , sometimes even bringing up a list of logical flaws is n’t good enough .
People can be so pissed off at you for questioning their vision that what you see as logic , they see as picking a fight .
And some people are always ready for a fight .
One way I ’ve found to defuse this mindset is to not put your problems forward as problems – ask them as questions and articulate what you think a negative consequence could be .
Keeping your responses open - ended can be a very powerful ploy .
When your antagonist says something along the lines of “ You always say we ca n’t do things , ” respond with “ I did n’t say we could n’t do it , I asked if you had considered that doing that would have the consequence of … ”
When you ’re dealing with a really belligerent workplace bully ( and we all have to deal with this type at some point ) who refuses to back down no matter what , get it in writing .
It ’s amazing how many bullies fold when you say “ OK , we ’ll document that I raised issue X would have consequence Y and you said that was n’t a problem and we should keep going . ”
A paper trail is a good defence against being blamed for someone else ’s mistakes .
Even if they are so intransigent that a paper trail wo n’t make them back down , at least you ’ll have the evidence if worse comes to worst that you voiced your concerns at the appropriate time .
For me , that ’s the last garrison , the “ Alamo ” moment .
If you retreat from that point you may as well cut your wrists .
I do n’t believe in wasting too much effort on a losing battle but if you do n’t at least ensure your voice is heard and documented , all you ’re doing is setting yourself up to be the patsy .
If some idiot with an MBA is trying to shout you down but wo n’t commit it to writing , it means they do n’t have the courage of their convictions and they ’re deliberately leaving a back door open to blame you if things go wrong .
If you let them get away with it then you ’re the idiot .
If you find yourself in this situation and you are n’t given the opportunity to have your objections recorded , you need to do one of two things : quit or accept that your working life is going to be miserable .
When it gets to this point , discretion is no longer the better part of valour .
If you wimp out this badly , you pretty much deserve to be the office whipping boy .
Windows Vista 's licensing terms have raised eyebrows among PC enthusiasts .
As previously reported , Windows Vista sports a new Software Protection Platform ( SPP ) aimed at curbing piracy .
Among SPP 's many " features " is a service that monitors PCs for evidence of significant hardware changes .
New hard drive ?
New motherboard ?
Windows Vista will recognize and keep track of the hardware in your PC , much like its predecessor Windows XP did , and it will use that information to monitor licensing compliance .
What has enthusiasts concerned are language changes to the retail license for Vista that restrict the number of times you may transfer Vista from one device to another .
The license reads : " The first user of the software may reassign the license to another device one time .
If you reassign the license , that other device becomes the ' licensed device . ' "
Putting SPP and the new license together , many have wondered if Windows Vista would permit major hardware changes such as swapping out a motherboard .
To make matters more confusing , reports circulated last week claiming that Microsoft 's official policy allows for 10 re-activations stemming from hardware changes .
We decided to contact Microsoft to get to the facts .
Of re-activations and algorithms
A Microsoft spokesperson told Ars Technica that " the hardware tolerance of product activation for Windows Vista has been improved and is more flexible than that for Windows XP , " indicating that re-activations caused by minor changes to a PC should be less common .
" We believe these improvements will better accommodate the needs of our PC enthusiast customers , " the spokesperson said .
Microsoft told Ars Technica that SPP monitors the system and measures changes against the original hardware configuration of the PC in an attempt to determine if the software has been moved to a new device .
SPP uses an undisclosed algorithm to to track changes , and it remains unclear how the algorithm assesses different hardware changes .
The spokesperson reiterated the company 's view that Vista 's hardware tolerance is more flexible than before .
As to the issue of multiple re-activations , Microsoft is standing behind the language of its licenses .
" Validation will fail if the software detects a substantially different hardware configuration , " the spokesperson said .
" At that point , the customer is able to use the one reassignment for the new device .
If , after using its one reassignment right , a customer again exceeds the tolerance for updated components , the customer can purchase an additional license or seek remediation through Microsoft ’s support services . "
Asked specifically about the rumors that Vista would permit 10 such re-activations instead of only one , Microsoft indicated that the company had no further comments .
The company 's official policy remains fixed on one device transfer .
Waiting game , redux
For those reading between the lines , Microsoft 's response is telling .
The option of seeking remediation through Microsoft support is a sign that the company has left a giant " safety net " in place , much as they did with Windows XP .
As I have noted before , similar concerns over hardware upgrades surfaced before Windows XP launched .
The reality since that launch has been far less dramatic than many commentators predicted .
In our extensive experience with re-activations caused by hardware changes , the outcome experienced most often amounts to this : we had to use Microsoft 's automated phone system to retrieve a new activation code .
No money changed hands .
On average , the calls took less than five minutes .
Nevertheless , we were never thrilled to have to jump through hoops to use products we legally purchased .
We still believe that the best license , of one must be used , is that which is assigned to individuals and not devices .
Will history repeat itself with Windows Vista ?
Time will tell , but from where we sit , SPP appears to have all of the bark and the bite of a pack of pugs .
It might sound like a pack of big dogs is behind the door , but the reality is something else .
Objectophilia , Fetishism and Neo-Sexuality Falling in Love with Things
Some people love their laptops more than anything else in the world .
Others are sexually aroused by musical instruments or buildings .
Experts are trying to understand a bizarre sexual obsession known as objectophilia .
I did not expect this one : despite ongoing rumors that Viacom would snap up the music site for a massive $ 450 million , CBS will announce today the acquisition of Last.fm for $ 280 million in cash , according to an unverified source .
The aim is to attract young people to the CBS brand .
The price is actually a little on the low side , at least in the current atmosphere of frenzied buying and ridiculous prices , but it 's still a very good exit for the London - based music site .
Last.fm has deals with record labels like EMI , Warner and The Orchard , and it would surely have made a good buy for a record company or any big media player .
Last.fm is also looking much healthier than competitor Pandora , which is being pummeled on all sides by licensing issues - with a dedicated fan base , it may pull through .
Looking for confirmation .
( UPDATE : LAtimes has it .
Still surprised .
CBS also just acquired Wallstrip , another bizarre buy for them .
Anyone know what 's going on here ? )

" The question has come up whether a guild master of the weaving industry should be allowed to try an innovation in his product .
The verdict : ' If a cloth weaver intends to process a piece according to his own invention , he must not set it on the loom , but should obtain permission from the judges of the town to employ the number and length of threads that he desires , after the question has been considered by four of the oldest merchants and four of the oldest weavers of the guild . '
One can imagine how many suggestions for change were tolerated .
Shortly after the matter of cloth weaving has been disposed of , the button makers guild raises a cry of outrage ; the tailors are beginning to make buttons out of cloth , an unheard - of thing .
The government , indignant that an innovation should threaten a settled industry , imposes a fine on the cloth - button makers .
But the wardens of the button guild are not yet satisfied .
They demand the right to search people 's homes and wardrobes and fine and even arrest them on the streets if they are seen wearing these subversive goods . "

As regular readers know , I 've been working through a series of posts on how economics works when scarcity is removed from some areas .
I took a bit of a break over the holidays to catch up on some reading , and to do some further thinking on the subject ( along with some interesting discussions with people about the topic ) .
One of the books I picked up was one that I have n't read in well over a decade , but often recommend to others to read if they 're interested in learning more about economics , but have no training at all in the subject .
It 's Robert L. Heilbroner 's The Worldly Philosophers .
Beyond giving readers a general overview of a variety of different economic theories , the book actually makes them all sound really interesting .
It 's a good book not necessarily because of the nitty gritty of economics ( which it does n't cover ) , but because it makes economics interesting , and gives people a good basis to then dig into actual economic theory and not find it boring and meaningless , but see it as a way to better understand what these " philosophers " were discussing .
Reading through an early chapter , though , it struck me how eerily a specific story Heilbroner told about France in 1666 matches up with what 's happening today with the way the recording industry has reacted to innovations that have challenged their business models .
Just two paragraphs highlight a couple of situations with striking similarities to the world today : Requiring permission to innovate ?
Feeling entitled to search others ' property ?
Getting the power to act like law enforcement in order to fine or arrest those who are taking part in activities that challenge your business model ?
Do n't these all sound quite familiar ?
Centuries from now ( hopefully much , much sooner ) , the actions of the RIAA , MPAA and others that match those of the weavers and button - makers of 17th century France will seem just as ridiculous .
If you 're looking to catch up on the posts in the series , I 've listed them out below :
Allow me to advance a radical thesis : Today ’s outbreaks of nasty online behavior are directly linked to the history of the counterculture in America , and in particular to the war on drugs .
In order to build a bridge over what might at first seem like a huge distance , I ’ll need to go over some background .
It is widely perceived that the problem of uncivil conduct online has reached epidemic proportions .
Michael Kinsley , a pioneer of confrontational political debate on cable television , recently wrote in Slate , “ When you write for the Web , you open yourself up to breathtakingly vicious vitriol .
People wish things on your mother , simply for bearing you , that you would n’t wish on Hitler . ”
David Pogue echoed this sentiment in The New York Times : “ The deeper we sail into the new online world of communications , the sadder I get about its future .... What ’s really stunning is how hostile ordinary people are to each other online these days . ”
But it ’s not true that people are universally nasty online .
Behavior actually varies considerably from site to site .
There are many reasonable theories about what brings out the best or worst online behaviors ; demographics , economics , child - rearing trends , perhaps even the average time of day of usage could very well play a role .
My opinion , however , is that certain details in the design of the user experience of a Web site are the most important factors .
People who can spontaneously invent a pseudonym in order to post a comment on a blog or on YouTube are often remarkably mean .
Buyers and sellers on eBay are usually civil , despite occasional annoyances like fraud .
Based on those data you could propose that transient anonymity coupled with a lack of consequences is what brings out online idiocy .
With more data , the hypothesis can be refined .
Participants in Second Life ( a virtual online world ) are not as mean to each other as people posting comments to Slashdot ( a popular technology news site ) or engaging in edit wars on Wikipedia , even though all use persistent pseudonyms .
I think the difference is that on Second Life the pseudonymous personality itself is highly valuable and requires a lot of work to create .
So a better portrait of the culprit is effortless , ­ consequence - free , transient anonymity in the service of a goal , like promoting a point of view , that stands entirely apart from one ’s identity or personality .
Call it drive - by anonymity .
Anonymity certainly has a place , but that place needs to be designed carefully .
Voting and peer review are pre-Internet examples of beneficial anonymity .
Sometimes it is desirable for people to be free of fear of reprisal or stigma in order to invoke honest opinions .
But , as I have argued ( in my November 2006 column ) , anonymous groups of people should be given only specific questions to answer , questions no more complicated than voting yes or no or setting a price for a product .
To have a substantial exchange , you need to be fully present .
That is why facing one ’s accuser is a fundamental right of the accused .
Drive - by anonymity scares me because people connected over the Internet have significant power .
That power can be beneficial , as when customers band together to force companies to act more ethically or when bystanders document bad behavior on YouTube .
Unfortunately , scary outbreaks of online mob behavior also occur .
Recently , a series of “ Scarlet Letter ” postings in China have incited online throngs to hunt down accused adulterers , to the point that some ­individuals have had to barricade themselves in their homes .
It ’s not crazy to worry that , with millions of people connected through a medium that sometimes brings out their worst tendencies , massive , fascist - style mobs could rise up suddenly .
This new style of anonymity has actually been incubating for awhile .
Before the Web , there were other types of online connections , of which Usenet was probably the most influential .
Usenet was an online directory of topics where anyone could post comments , drive - by style .
One portion of Usenet , called “ alt , ” was reserved for nonacademic topics , including those that were oddball , pornographic , illegal , or offensive .
A lot of the alt material was wonderful , such as information about obscure musical instruments , while some of it was sickening , such as tutorials on cannibalism .
To get online in those days you usually had to have an academic , corporate , or military connection , so the Usenet population was mostly adult and educated .
That did n’t help .
Users still turned into mean idiots online .
That is one piece of evidence that it ’s the design , not the demographic , that concentrates bad behavior .
Since there were so few people online , though , bad “ netiquette ” was then more of a curiosity than a problem .
Why was drive - by anonymity supported by Usenet ?
You could argue that it was the easiest design to implement at the time , but I ’m not sure that ’s true .
All those academic , corporate , and military users belonged to large , well - structured organizations , so the hooks were immediately available to create a nonanonymous design .
If that had happened , today ’s Web sites might not have inherited the drive - by design aesthetic .
So if it was n’t laziness that promoted online anonymity , what did ?
Here ’s where I think the war on drugs has left us with an unfortunate legacy .
The Internet ’s foundational design ( going all the way back to its 1960s origins as the Defense Department ’s Arpanet ) was initially motivated by the cold war .
A decentralized communications network was supposed to have better odds of surviving a massive nuclear weapons attack .
The next layers of code built on top of that base , including Usenet , were created mostly in the countercultural climate of the 1970s and 1980s , and particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area , which includes Silicon Valley .
For that generation of digital designers , fears of a foreign attack were supplanted by fears of an overly intrusive government at home .
I often found myself a little out of step with my peers in those pre-Web days .
One notable example occurred at a lunch with a few of my Net- philic buddies in San Francisco in the early 1990s .
This lunch turned out to have been the founding event for an admirable organization called the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) — and I declined to become one of the founders .
The hot issue of that moment was encryption .
The EFF ’s initial top goal was to ensure that everyone would be able to use what was then thought of as “ military - grade ” encryption to communicate .
I could n’t sign up for that mission .
The thought of everyone communicating in absolute secrecy seemed lonely and scary to me .
Well , I had never been worried about being arrested in America !
I suspect that all the others at the table had experienced that worry , though .
Experimentation with illegal , mind - altering drugs was the rule , not the exception , in computer culture at the time .
For some reason I was never interested in drugs , so that fear was n’t something I knew directly .
Many influential engineers were also a few years older than I was , the right age to have faced the draft to fight in Vietnam .
My worries were n’t entirely different ; they just were n’t prioritized in the same order .
I was more afraid of what ordinary folks like us were capable of than of the police .
The notion in the air those days was that the good , enlightened people would use digital networks to evade the bad enforcers , who answered only to an evil elite that was trying to oppress everyone else .
I was more concerned that “ the people ” could suddenly get nasty .
( My mother was sent to a concentration camp when she was only a little girl by a society that went mad en masse within a remarkably short period of time . )
It ’s strange to think of all those brilliant engineers , who understood they were building the greatest source of new wealth in a generation , worrying about getting busted .
It ’s even stranger to think of China ’s self - appointed antiadultery militias being enabled by the same privacy - seeking behaviors of America ’s old hippies .
This all comes down to a question of balance : Techniques that help repel the power of one mob can become the source of excessive power for a different mob .
The idea that freedom meant protecting the privacy of bands of bad boys was not just part of the character of coastal , liberal America — it swept the whole country .
In the 1970s there was widespread discontent in the heartland with the newly imposed 55 - mile - per - hour speed limit .
A populist outlaw culture rose up around a media technology , and that technology was CB radio .
Truckers and those who idolized them would make up untraceable names , or handles , and warn each other about where the police were on the freeway , waiting to issue speeding tickets .
In short , the CB craze was another source of the allure of instant easy anonymity .
Today ’s anonymous screen names and e-mail addresses even resemble those old CB handles .
Now that most of America , and much of the world , has Internet access , it really matters if online design is bringing out mean and irresponsible aspects of people ’s personalities .
At the same time , the fears of the EFF types are still worth considering .
If anonymity were banished today , would some company or agency compile a dossier on what each person had said or downloaded online , simply by watching ?
That information would be so valuable that it would probably be collected .
Then we would have to deal with record companies suing over each song a kid downloaded improperly , marketers targeting each of us with enough accuracy to be more than annoying , and perhaps nightmare scenarios of instant witch hunts and roundups .
Computers have an unfortunate tendency to present us with binary choices at every level , not just at the lowest one , where the bits are switching .
It is easy to be anonymous or fully revealed , but hard to be revealed just enough .
Still , that does happen , to varying degrees .
Sites like eBay and Second Life are more valuable than their stock prices will ever indicate because they give hints about how design can promote the essential middle path — one that balances online privacy with online civility .
MS Paint might seem basic compared to the other photo editing programs , such as Photoshop and Corel Draw , but these creations show off its true capabilities .

Joe no longer fears death .
In fact the last time it happened he rather enjoyed the ride .
First he was plunged into darkness , then came a bright light , a field of flowers , and a man in white who told him about his future .
Later doctors informed him that his pulse had been flat for 44 seconds .
For Joe his near - death experience ( NDE ) was a very real preview of what is in store for him after death .
Science has a different take : NDEs are real , but they have nothing to do with the afterlife .
Instead , they are illusions created by a fading brain .
But despite numerous attempts , no one has been able to scientifically explain all the elements of an NDE .
Now one researcher thinks he can .
For Kevin Nelson , a neurophysiologist at the University of Kentucky in Lexington , NDEs may be little more than dream - like states brought on by stress and a predisposition to a common kind of sleep disorder .
If he ’s right , as many as 40 per cent of us could be primed to see the light .
Written accounts of NDEs go back more than two thousand years and have been reported all over the world .
Most include a “ point of no return ” that if crossed will lead to death , and a person who turns you away from it .
The identity of the person seems to depend on your religion .
Christians , for example , often meet Jesus or a dead relative while Hindus may see Yamraj , god of the dead .
For Nelson , this suggests that NDEs stem from something fundamentally human .
“ People say that because there ’s a common thread running …
The number one question MovingScam.com receives is “ Can you recommend a good moving company ? ” .
If the answer to that question was easy , then there would n’t be a reason for maintaining a web site called MovingScam.com ( see our article “ How to Find a Reputable Moving Company ” for more information ) .
Currently moving companies are overseen by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration ( FMCSA ) , part of the Federal Department of Transportation ( DOT ) .
The last we knew , the FMCSA had only nine investigators to handle all of the thousands of complaints against moving companies each year .
What does that mean for consumers ?
It means this :
Most complaints against movers are overlooked and the consumer becomes a statistic while no action is ever taken against the moving company .
When Congress dissolved the Interstate Commerce Commission ( ICC ) in 1995 , they also removed the authority from the FMCSA to step in on a consumer ’s behalf if they are taken advantage of by a moving company .
In other words , they do n’t have the authority to help you even if they want to .
If an investigation does occur , it takes months if not years for the FMCSA to , yes , get this …
Fine the moving company .
The scam moving companies get away with not paying the fines and if they did , the consumers do n’t see a dime of their money back .
The money from the moving company ’s fines go to pay for highway improvements !
There are in fact laws governing moving companies , but the moving industry is unique in having special privileges and protections that no other industry could even imagine enjoying .
How did we get here ?
The interstate household goods moving industry was “ price - deregulated ” with the Household Goods Transportation Act of 1980 .
This
Act allowed interstate moving companies to issue binding or fixed estimates for the first time .
Until then , the moving industry was overseen by the ICC like a public utility ( like phone and electricity services ) .
There were only a handful of companies , now known as the “ major ” van lines , that were allowed to transport household goods interstate , and they all charged according to their tariff — a schedule of rates and services — which had a built - in profit .
ALL estimates were non-binding .
Movers sold themselves on service , not price .
The profit margin was very thin , but there was profit .
When the Household Good Transportation
Act was passed in 1980 , not only could moving companies now compete on price by giving consumers binding estimates , but also there was a provision in the Act that new companies could enter the market .
Regarding the “ freedom ” to give binding estimates , was something the major players did n’t want .
For a while some carriers just had a policy of sticking to non-binding estimates only .
But because customers wanted the price certainty of binding estimates , those companies finally caved in and started issuing binding moving estimates too .
So how did the moving industry end up with a special governing body to oversee it in the first place ?
There is a federal statute enacted in 1906 called the Carmack Amendment .
It was originally enacted in response to railroad barons who controlled the few railroads in existence and who were giving their friends favors in transportation rates and squeezing small farmers and everyone else .
Back then , railroads were the major method of transporting goods across the still - developing country , and so the ICC was set up , in effect , to regulate the monopoly that was the railroads .
The Carmack Amendment forbade “ price discrimination ” ; that is , the railroad baron had to charge a set rate ( contained in the railroad ’s tariff ) , approved by the ICC , to all shippers .
When roads and trucking later arose , the ICC started overseeing that , too .
The major van lines and their agent system first got organized , and wrote their tariffs , in the 1930s .
OK , fast forward to 1980 and beyond .
Because of the Household Goods Transportation
Act of 1980 , by the late 1990 ’s there were hundreds of interstate moving companies in existence , all with their own “ interstate operating authority ” granted to them by the U.S. Department of Transportation ( DOT ) .
( Compare that with the handful of companies who had interstate operating authority pre-1980 . )
Now , anyone can be an interstate mover .
It used to take 5 years to get interstate operating authority .
Now it takes 3 weeks .
Throw into this mix the fact that moving companies were now , theoretically , competing on price and quality of service .
The competition was so fierce , and the moving companies so numerous , that low - balling moving estimates soon became a popular practice .
Of course , low - balling does n’t pay if the moving company does n’t practice hostage - freight taking ( price - gouging during the move ) as well , because the mover has to make money somehow .
The need to low - ball to get moves , a direct consequence of the Household Transportation
Act of 1980 , is responsible for many of the abuses in the moving industry today .
The ability of moving companies to get away with it , however , is caused by the Carmack Amendment .
So what ’s the problem caused by the Carmack Amendment ?
Carmack purports to govern every single aspect of the shipping transaction .
In the late 1990s , several courts handed down decisions interpreting Carmack as being so thorough and far - reaching that it “ preempts ” all other remedies that would otherwise be available to a plaintiff - shipper under state law .
That is , suing for fraud under state consumer fraud / deceptive practices statutes was preempted .
That means that an interstate mover can tell you : “ I guarantee you that your move will cost only $ 2000 , ” while intending to hold your goods hostage for $ 4000 at destination while knowing all the while that there ’s nothing you can do about it .
Believe it or not , should he do that , according to these courts , you can only sue the mover under Carmack ( not for state fraud , etc. ) , and Carmack , in turn , will allow you to ONLY get your $ 2000 overcharge back from the moving company .
Believe it or not , a mover ’s “ punishment ” for stealing from you is to give back what he stole , and that ’s only if he gets caught and someone forces him to give it back which is no small undertaking in itself .
Overall , it ’s a pretty sweet situation for moving companies , would n’t you say ?
So that is what “ deregulation ” in interstate moving is about .
It ’s about PRICE deregulation and “ ENTRY INTO THE MARKET ” deregulation , coupled with the unfortunate decisions of certain courts in the late 1990s that moving companies can only get a slap on the wrist for even the worst abuses .
The ICC ’s disbandment in 1995 was just the last nail on the coffin — by then , the ICC could n’t really oversee the industry anyway , since so many movers had entered the market and “ tariffs ” were now anachronisms .
In today ’s environment of price competition , the current scamming will continue ( and get worse ) unless there are mechanisms for the consumer to force the mover to stick to his price bid .
Those mechanisms are police intervention , punitive damages , and actual enforcement of regulations by the FMCSA .
Consumers need to fight back .
Talk to your local police , and file complaints with the FMCSA and DOT .
Get in touch with your local , state , and federal reps , and tell them that you want them to support consumer protections .
Call your local media – newspapers , television stations .
Get a web site of your own and get the word out .
Whatever you can do to let other consumers know what ’s going on in the moving industry .
The US and EU said there was not enough evidence of change
In Washington the US secretary of state and the EU foreign policy chief renewed their call for the government to recognise Israel and renounce violence .
The presence of militant group Hamas in the government is a major obstacle for the US , correspondents say .
But the US and EU said they would stay in touch with moderate Palestinians .
That means those loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , but not members of Hamas , says the BBC's Jonathan Beale in Washington .
The so - called Middle East Quartet - the United Nations , the EU , Russia and the US - have demanded that the Palestinian government renounce violence , recognise Israel and accept past peace agreements .
Since Hamas won elections in January last year , a freeze has been imposed on international aid to the government .
' Does n't sound good '
After meeting in Washington , the top diplomats from the US and EU said they had not seen evidence that the government had changed its stance since Hamas agreed to admit other parties to a unity coalition .
" I have to say that this government does not comply fully with the principles " laid down by the Quartet , EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said .
Non-Hamas members have joined the new Palestinian cabinet
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the new unity government 's defence of its right to resist Israel 's occupation did not bode well .
" I 'm not going to try to interpret what the right of resistance means but I 'll tell you it does n't sound very good to me when one talks about ' all forms of resistance ' , " she said .
" So I would put the question to the Palestinian government and to its prime minister - do you mean the right of resistance by violence ?
And let 's get an answer . "
Both the US and the European Union have urged the Palestinians to prove by their deeds that they are now committed to peace .
Condoleezza Rice is expected to visit the Palestinian territories and Israel later this week but her hopes of renewing peace talks still seem distant , says our correspondent .
By PAUL KRUGMANThe New York TimesJanuary 19 , 2007
There ’s something happening here , and what it is seems completely clear : the Bush administration is trying to protect itself by purging independent - minded prosecutors .
Last month , Bud Cummins , the U.S. attorney ( federal prosecutor ) for the Eastern District of Arkansas , received a call on his cellphone while hiking in the woods with his son .
He was informed that he had just been replaced by J. Timothy Griffin , a Republican political operative who has spent the last few years working as an opposition researcher for Karl Rove .
Mr. Cummins ’s case is n’t unique .
Since the middle of last month , the Bush administration has pushed out at least four U.S. attorneys , and possibly as many as seven , without explanation .
The list includes Carol Lam , the U.S. attorney for San Diego , who successfully prosecuted Duke Cunningham , a Republican congressman , on major corruption charges .
The top F.B.I. official in San Diego told The San Diego Union - Tribune that Ms. Lam ’s dismissal would undermine multiple continuing investigations .
In Senate testimony yesterday , Attorney General Alberto Gonzales refused to say how many other attorneys have been asked to resign , calling it a “ personnel matter .
” In case you ’re wondering , such a wholesale firing of prosecutors midway through an administration is n’t normal .
U.S. attorneys ,
The Wall Street Journal recently pointed out , “ typically are appointed at the beginning of a new president ’s term , and serve throughout that term . ”
Why , then , are prosecutors that the Bush administration itself appointed suddenly being pushed out ?
The likely answer is that for the first time the administration is really worried about where corruption investigations might lead .
Since the day it took power this administration has shown nothing but contempt for the normal principles of good government .
For six years ethical problems and conflicts of interest have been the rule , not the exception .
For a long time the administration nonetheless seemed untouchable , protected both by Republican control of Congress and by its ability to justify anything and everything as necessary for the war on terror .
Now , however , the investigations are closing in on the Oval Office .
The latest news is that J. Steven Griles , the former deputy secretary of the Interior Department and the poster child for the administration ’s systematic policy of putting foxes in charge of henhouses , is finally facing possible indictment .
And the purge of U.S. attorneys looks like a pre-emptive strike against the gathering forces of justice .
Wo n’t the administration have trouble getting its new appointees confirmed by the Senate ?
Well , it turns out that it wo n’t have to .
Arlen Specter , the Republican senator who headed the Judiciary Committee until Congress changed hands , made sure of that last year .
Previously , new U.S. attorneys needed Senate confirmation within 120 days or federal district courts would name replacements .
But as part of a conference committee reconciling House and Senate versions of the revised Patriot Act , Mr. Specter slipped in a clause eliminating that rule .
As Paul Kiel of TPMmuckraker.com — which has done yeoman investigative reporting on this story — put it , this clause in effect allows the administration “ to handpick replacements and keep them there in perpetuity without the ordeal of Senate confirmation . ”
How convenient .
Mr. Gonzales says that there ’s nothing political about the firings .
And according to The Associated Press , he said that district court judges should n’t appoint U.S. attorneys because they “ tend to appoint friends and others not properly qualified to be prosecutors . ”
Words fail me .
Mr. Gonzales also says that the administration intends to get Senate confirmation for every replacement .
Sorry , but that ’s not at all credible , even if we ignore the administration ’s track record .
Mr. Griffin , the political - operative - turned - prosecutor , would be savaged in a confirmation hearing .
By appointing him , the administration showed that it has no intention of following the usual rules .
The broader context is this : defeat in the midterm elections has n’t led the Bush administration to scale back its imperial view of presidential power .
On the contrary , now that President Bush can no longer count on Congress to do his bidding , he ’s more determined than ever to claim essentially unlimited authority — whether it ’s the authority to send more troops into Iraq or the authority to stonewall investigations into his own administration ’s conduct .
The next two years , in other words , are going to be a rolling constitutional crisis .
The children , one as young as 10 , have apparently paid someone in Romania to send them to Slough .
Slough Borough Council said it was puzzled as to why the children were going there , but it has set up a special team to support them .
It has called for more government help to offset the strain on other services .
Family members
The authority has revealed that since 1 January , when Romania joined the European Union , 88 Romanian Roma children have arrived asking for help .
The children usually arrive in groups of three , but six have had babies of their own and seven have been pregnant .
The local authority has set up an emergency Roma assessment team and spent £ 150,000 on housing and keeping the children .
It is currently supporting 53 children while others have been sent to live with family members who have been located in other parts of the UK .
The council said more money is needed from the government to help them with migrants otherwise other services could be cut .
Congressman Ron Paul is the most - demanded GOP presidential candidate on Eventful.com and the third most - demanded candidate overall , trailing only Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton .

REST based authentication
Summary
It is possible to distinguish between requests from authenticated and non-authenticated users by relying upon a standard feature of browsers , namely that they include the Authentication HTTP header even for unprotected portions of the site .
Portions of the site that really require authentication will work correctly , because the Authentication header is included .
Portions of the site that do not need authentication , can use the name of the authenticated user mentioned in the HTTP authentication header to do personalization .
This page shows how to achieve these effects with all the common browsers and almost pure Apache 2.2 ( it probably works with the 1.3 series as well ) .
Authentication is hard
Authentication is one of the hardest issues when developing software .
Because if you got even one bit wrong , your solution is no longer secure .
And your reputation may go down with it .
So why do web developers insist on developing their own security ?
Why not use HTTP authentication which is probably far more secure than most programmers will ever be able to develop themselves ?
Common authentication issues
When people talk about user authentication with a web browser , the following topics tend to come up :
Authentication should be optional : unauthenticated users should be able to use ( part of ) the site .
Authentication gives access to additional features .
Login screen should be customizable .
User should be able to logout .
User should be logged out automatically after a certain time period .
It is generally believed that cookies are necessary to support these features .
RESTafarians however like to change light bulbs without cookies , so are we stuck ?
We can answer that question with a firm denial .
As far as I know , Jean - Michel Hiver was the first to show an alternative technique that relies only on HTTP authentication and does n't use cookies .
As the code he presents is somewhat outdated ( it does n't work with the latest Apache and mod_perl module for example ) , is not complete , and he does n't clearly state why his approach works , I have also brought his code up - to - date .
The actual solution chosen by Jean - Michel 's company works fine however , you can see it in action at MKDoc .
I also improved upon his log off functionality .
His solution does not work with Internet Explorer and Opera , but I found some techniques that give acceptable results .
The solutions presented here use only voodoo , so sacrifice your chickens and let 's go !
Optional authentication
Use case : if the user is authenticated , display a personalised greeting message or show a personalised version of the site .
If the user is not authenticated , display a login screen or generic version of the site .
The solution to this problem is to let the browser include the Authentication HTTP header , even when the site does n't require authentication .
Because the site does n't need authentication , anonymous access is still allowed .
But if the user has authenticated himself , we can use this header to personalise the site .
Let 's first have a look at the Authentication header .
It looks something like this :
Authorization : Digest username= " myname " , realm = " My Site " , nonce= " uJPKOnEOBAA=7c7d02a5ed5e214c7bb21f28bdc577f422ca0b47 " , uri= " /index.html " , algorithm=MD5 , response= " adefccac270ee8110639460a0fb90 f4c " , qop=auth , nc=00000004 , cnonce = " c87ceaa8c4e9d15
c "
It 's the username parameter in which we are interested .
But how can we trick a browser to send us this header ?
Let 's first create the page that anyone who is n't logged on will see .
The body is something like this :
< body > < p >< a href= " .login " >
Please login < /a > to use this site .
</ p> </ body >
( By the way , a full demo of the code in this document is available under a subdirectory of this page , just follow this link to see the login page .
Username is “ myname ” , password is “ test ” )
Before looking at how login works , you will need to make sure Apache is setup correctly .
The most important setting is that a .htaccess file can override any security setting .
Your httpd.conf should therefore include the following settings :
AllowOverride All Options FollowSymLinks
in its VirtualHost or Directory directive .
The login link points to a URL which we will catch in .htaccess .
That is easier than the approach chosen by Jean - Michel which requires some Perl hacking .
The .login entry in our .htaccess is this :
< Files .login > AuthType Digest AuthName " My Site " AuthUserFile /var/www/html/rest/login/passwd Require valid-user </ Files >
So there is no .login file , it 's just a URL that will trigger authentication because accessing this URL requires a user to be authenticated .
AuthType is set to Digest .
I chose to use Digest authentication because it solves some important security concerns compared to the Basic setting used by Jean - Michel .
It will not come as a surprise that the largest software vendor on this planet has released another piece of software that requires , due to the sheer market presence of that vendor , everyone else in the world to work around a bugs it contains when using digest authentication .
Make absolutely sure you have this directive in your configuration or .htaccess file :
BrowserMatch " MSIE " AuthDigestEnableQueryStringHack=On
Note that if you use SSL , basic authentication is as secure as the digest variant , because the password is now impervious to sniffing as well .
The AuthName directive is used to present the site name to the user for which he has to specify a user name and password .
The password file itself is in the passwd file .
You add users this file with the htdigest utility like this :
htdigest -c passwd " My Site " myname
It subsequently asks for a password for the user " myname " .
The passwords you create are stored in a plain text file .
To achieve scalability above more than a few dozen users , Apache also supports storing users and their passwords in a DBM file or in a relational database .
The statement Require valid - user is necessary in order for Apache to send the WWW - Authenticate header to the browser .
It indicates that this file or directory is protected .
As soon as any user tries to access this URL , he or she will need to provide a user name and password .
In our case the user name is " myname " and the password is " test " .
At this point it is important to point out that the login URL must point to something that is in or below every directory that wants to profit from optional authentication .
For example if the the login was a directory like / login the user would be authenticated , but the authentication header would never be send if the user went to / other / part .
At least not with FireFox 1.5.0.1 .
You would think that adding URLs to the AuthDigestDomain setting would do the trick , but that setting does n't seem to be widely supported right now .
Assuming that the Authentication header is present , is not a trick that just happens to work due to some browser quirks .
RFC 2617 states :
The Authorization header may be included preemptively ; doing so improves server efficiency and avoids extra round trips for authentication challenges .
This advise is probably followed by all decent browsers .
It is at least by the browsers I 've tested this approach with .
Careful readers might have seen that AuthDigestDomain was not present in the .login .
As mentioned support for AuthDigestDomain seems to be lacking in browsers , but we can rely on particular feature when it is not present .
As RFC 2617 states :
If this directive is omitted or its value is empty , the client should assume that the protection space consists of all URIs on the responding server .
Exactly the feature we 're looking for when basing personalisation on HTTP authentication !
Ok , that 's enough about Apache 's HTTP authentication settings for now .
Back to the browser which just has popped up a login dialog box if you followed the .login URL .
If you provide the correct user name and password , Apache will next try to send you the .login file .
But that would be rather pointless .
After a successful login the user should be redirect to the home page and this should now indicate that the user has logged in .
We can do the redirect from within the .login section in the .htaccess by adding these statements to it :
< Files .login > ... RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{REMOTE_USER} != " " RewriteRule ^.*$ /index.html [ R ]
</ Files >
In the first line we turn on Apache 's rewrite engine .
The next statement is a conditional : if the REMOTE_USER environment variable is set , execute the following rewriting rule .
REMOTE_USER is set if a browser has sent an Authenticate header and if Apache has successfully authenticated the user .
The rewrite rule simply directs the user to the site 's home page .
Although the user is now redirected to the home page , the default page ( see above ) , index.html , is still served saying the the user needs to login .
But when the user has been authenticated , we want to serve a different page .
This can be solved either dynamically or statically .
In your scripts you could emit different HTML when the REMOTE_USER environment variable is set .
In our example we simply serve a different page , in this case one that let 's a user logout .
Serving a different page if a user has been authenticated sounds familiar .
And indeed , just like with login's .htaccess section we can accomplish this with another rewrite :
RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{REMOTE_USER} != " "
RewriteRule ^index.html$ authenticated .html
Again we turn the rewriting engine on and check if REMOTE_USER has been set .
If so , we serve authenticated .
html instead of index.html .
However , if you try this , you will notice that this does not work , even when you were just authenticated !.
The reason is that the environment variable REMOTE_USER does not have a value .
Apache sets this only when these three conditions are met :
The browser sends the Authenticate header .
Apache is asked to validate the user .
For example the .htaccess file contains the Require valid - user directive .
Validation succeeds .
The browser sends the Authenticate header , but Apache does n't have to validate the user , so it does not set REMOTE_USER .
So we 're stuck or what ?
One solution is to make sure REMOTE_USER is indeed set .
That 's a solution that I explore in the alternative section .
But there 's even an easier solution , one that does n't require any mod_perl skills at all !
Just vodoo ...
We know that the Authorization HTTP header is send , so why not use that ?
That leads to the following solution that nicely redirects a previously authenticated user to a personalised page :
RewriteEngine on RewriteCond % {HTTP : Authorization} username=\ " ( [ ^\ " ] + ) \ " RewriteRule ^index.html$ authenticated .html [ L ]
If you try this , you will be properly redirected to the authenticated .
html page .
Where you can logout if you so wish .
And that is the subject of the next section .
There are some other solutions as well that make the authenticated user available , see the alternative solutions page .
User should be able to log off
Use case : user has logged on to our application from a public terminal .
Before leaving the public terminal , the user wants to log off the session so a subsequent user cannot continue his session .
In order to understand the solution let 's first have a look at what is happening after we have authenticated .
After we have authenticated , the browser has stored the supplied user name and password .
It needs to store these values so it can use them when the supplied nonce value has become stale for example .
This is no different from any other authentication scheme .
The client needs to store some kind of ticket that can be used for a certain amount of time or automatically renewed if the client remains active .
The purpose of a log off is to make a browser forget the supplied user name and password .
If the browser does not forget the user name and password , the browser will always be able to re-authenticate .
Relying upon HTTP authentication is the most secure way of accomplishing this .
There are many more eyes viewing HTTP authentication issues than the usual roll - your - own cookie based authentication scheme .
Unfortunately , no browser does offer an out - of - the - box logout feature for their HTTP authentication .
This is a lamentable failure in their implementation and unfortunately not something the poor web developer can solve .
For certain browsers , such as FireFox , there is an extension that adds logout .
But most FireFox users will not have this extension installed .
It is therefore commonly thought , see for example HowToLogOff and HTTP Authentication and Forms , that it is not possible to allow a user to log off his HTTP authenticated session .
However this is not true .
You can ‘ trick ’ a browser to forget the credentials .
Unfortunately the solution is browser dependent .
The approach that should work is forcing a user to re-authenticate by sending by sending a 401 response to a request .
This should popup the login dialog box .
If the user presses cancel here , the browser should discontinue sending the Authenticate header to the server .
This technique works for Mozilla / FireFox and Opera ( with a twist ) , but not for Internet Explorer .
We can force a re-authenticate by sending the browser to a URL called . logout for example .
This resource will always return the 401 response , thereby forcing the user to press the Cancel button after which the credentials will be forgotten .
And the “ Authorization Required ” page will be displayed .
Jean - Michel observes : “ However that 's very ugly . ”
But that can be fixed as well .
But let 's see how such a thing can be done with the usual .htaccess trickery .
First a portion of the home page that is shown when a user has been authenticated :
< p> You 're authenticated .
But you may < a href=" .logout " > logout</a>.</ p>
What happens when the browser tries to access . logout ?
We require authentication when something tries to access . logout , but we do two things differently :
We specify a user name that does not exist .
So a user cannot authenticate and we respond to the browser 's request with 401 Authentication Required .
We specify an authentication realm that is either equal or different from our the authentication real used with .login .
We need an equal realm for Mozilla / FireFox to forget the authentication credentials , but we need a different realm to trick Opera unfortunately .
We do not mention AuthDigestDomain so the change should apply to all URLs on our server .
Assuming our browser is FireFox , .logout can be implemented as below .
This will not work for Internet Explorer , it will give a weird error message , it will not even popup the login dialog box .
Opera will simply not forget the credentials if you press cancel in the login dialog box .
But trusted FireFox works fine :
< Files .logout > AuthType Digest AuthName " My Site " AuthUserFile /var/www/html/rest/login/ passwd
Require user nonexistent </ Files >
But it is indeed not friendly at all .
Popping up a dialog box is OK .
It helps the user to understand that he is really logged off and can walk away from the public terminal now , because the next user will have to type in the credentials or press cancel .
But what if our user just wants to log on again with either the same or different credentials ?
That should be supported nicely as well .
So a logout can be either of two things : logout , but also logging again .
Logout and login are actually the same thing !
Once this concept is grasped , the solution falls into place quite nicely :
The logout link is the same as the login link .
We add a special query string to it so login can deny access on the first attempt , forcing the browser to display the login dialog box .
The “ first attempt ” is the issue here .
It sounds like we need to store state on the server .
That 's always a big no - no as things start to get complicated .
It 's much better if the client can store the state .
But how to do that ?
If we let the browser ask for a URL of the form logout ?
first_attempt=true and based on the presence of first_attempt always return 401 Authorization required to the browser , the user will never be able to authenticate .
The browser will simply popup a box asking for the proper user name and password and submit this again and again to our URL , i.e. logout?first_attempt=true .
So how do we get around this and avoid storing state on the server ?
And here Jean - Michel had his second brilliant idea : use a time stamp .
If the time stamp is less than a few seconds ago we assume it 's the user 's first attempt , and we force him to logout .
If the time stamp is past the current time , we assume he typed in his password and wants to login again .
We can solve this problem with almost pure voodoo ( I 've written the non .htaccess parts in Perl , so it keeps looking like voodoo :-) ) .
First the logout .
When the user follows the .logout link we redirect him to login , but include the time stamp .
Have this handler in your .htaccess file :
< Files .logout > RewriteEngine on RewriteRule ^.*$ /.login?logout=${timestamps:0} [ R , L ] </ Files >
The redirect to login now includes a parameter .
It is important that this be an external redirect .
The browser must get this exact time stamp , because that is where the state is stored !
The actual time stamp value is retrieved from a rewrite map .
A rewrite map is something that accepts a key and returns a string .
It can be a hashed file .
But in our case it is a simple program that returns the current UNIX time ( seconds since the Unix Epoch ) + 7 seconds .
That will give the browser 7 seconds to receive the redirect , send it to the server again , which will respond by showing the login dialog box to the user .
The time stamp returning program can be written in any language , here is the Perl variant :
#!/usr/bin/perl $ | = 1 ; while ( < STDIN > ) { print time ( ) + 7 , "
" ; }
The program simply reads a line from standard input and writes the time stamp to standard output .
The input is not important , anything will do .
The resulting redirect URL is of the format .login?logout=1141933263 .
Installing rewrite maps that are programs takes some care .
As they are started when Apache is started they need to be in your server config or VirtualHost directive .
And make sure the RewriteEngine is turned on , else you will get the error message “ map lookup FAILED ” when you use the map .
RewriteEngine On RewriteMap timestamps prg:/var/www/perl/timestamps.pl
The .login link needs to handle the case where the logout query is present , so we add these rewrite rules before any other rules :
RewriteEngine on RewriteCond % {QUERY_STRING} ^logout= ( [ 0 - 9 ] + ) $ RewriteRule ^.*$ /${optional-forced-logout:%1 } [ L ]
What 's happening here ?
First we have a conditional on the presence of the logout parameter .
Due to the presence of parentheses in the regular expression , the value of the time stamp is stored in the % 1 variable .
We pass the time stamp to another rewrite map .
Again it is a simple program that accepts the time stamp on stdin and decides if the time stamp is new enough to force a login or not .
The output of the optional - forced - logout rewrite map is one of these two values :
.force_logout_offer_login .dologin
Depending on the output of the rewrite map we redirect the user to one of these URLs .
The rewrite map program can be written in any language as it is extremely simple , but the Perl version is this :
#!/usr/bin/perl $ | = 1 ; while ( < STDIN > ) { my $ timestamp = $ _ ; if ( $ timestamp > time ( ) ) { print " .force_logout_offer_login
" ; } else { print " .dologin
" ; } }
It keeps on reading standard input and for every received time stamp it emits the proper redirection URL .
You have to add this rewrite map to your VirtualHost or Directory directive as follows :
RewriteEngine On RewriteMap optional - forced - logout prg:/var/www/perl/optional-forced-logout.pl
So what happens when the .optional - forced - logout is received ?
It is treated as an internal redirect , the browser is n't aware of it , an important point .
Actually , we need three redirects , depending on the browser .
Remember that the authentication realm must be the same for Mozilla / FireFox , but different for Opera , and for Internet Explorer we must do something different altogether .
So the rewrite engine routes us to one of these three URLs :
.force_logout_offer_login_mozilla , or .force_logout_offer_login_opera , or .force_logout_offer_login_ie .
Each does the actual logoff .
The redirect voodoo looks like this :
< Files .force_logout_offer_login> RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ( MSIE ) RewriteRule ^.*$ /rest/tada/.force_logout_offer_login_ie [ L ]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ( Opera ) RewriteRule ^.*$ /rest/tada/.force_logout_offer_login_opera [ L ]
RewriteRule ^.*$ /.force_logout_offer_login_mozilla [ L ] </ Files > < Files .force_logout_offer_login_mozilla > AuthType Digest AuthName " My Site " AuthUserFile /var/www/html/rest/login/passwd Require user nonexistent </ Files > < Files .force_logout_offer_login_opera > AuthType Digest AuthName " Not My Site " AuthUserFile /var/www/html/rest/login/passwd Require user nonexistent </ Files > < Files .force_logout_offer_login_ie > RewriteEngine on RewriteRule ^.*$ /rest/tada/logged_out.html ? [ R ] </ Files >
The force log off resource simply requires a user name that does not exist in the password file .
So the server responds to the browser that authentication has failed .
The browser shows the login dialog box .
Let 's assume that the user types in his credentials again .
If he presses OK , the browser again hits the .login?logout=123456789 URL .
Let us further assume that 7 seconds have gone by .
The optional - forced - logout rewrite map ( see above ) returns just .dologin .
This is an internal redirect to :
< Files .dologin > AuthType Digest AuthName " My Site " AuthUserFile /var/www/html/rest/login/passwd AuthDigestDomain / Require valid-user #
If user is authenticated , redirect to main page RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{REMOTE_USER} != " "
RewriteRule ^.*$ /index.html ? [ R ] </ Files >
By the way , . dologin is similar to the first version of .login we presented .
The browser has sent us the credentials again and assuming the user has typed them in correctly , the user will be validated and redirected to our home page .
This approach works brilliantly with Mozilla / FireFox .
If you find the dialog box that it displays less than brilliant , there 's even a solution for that .
With Opera we have a minor issue : because we have changed the authentication realm , Opera will ask for a password for that realm .
If the user presses cancel , everything is fine and Opera will have forgotten the password .
However , if the user enters the password , he will not be authenticated because the realm is " Not My Site " , but the user is directed to a URL that requires a password for “ My Site ” .
So a 401 is returned , and Opera will popup another login dialog box .
User enters the correct password , this time for “ My Site ” Validation now proceeds correctly .
As you might have seen above , in case the browser is Internet Explorer , we redirect the browser straight to logged_out .
html .
The problem with Internet Explorer is that forcing re-authentication does n't work : if you try it for the same authentication realm , this browser will come up with a weird error message .
If you try a different authentication realm , it will not forget the credentials .
So that 's why we redirect to logged_out .
html .
The purpose of this page will be discussed below .
This page contains some JavaScript trickerly that will force Internet Explorer to forget its credentials .
Unfortunately this trick only works for version 6 SP1 or higher .
When this page is loaded , we execute this JavaScript and now even Internet Explorer has logged off :
< script language = " javascript " type = " text / javascript " > var agt=navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase ( ) ; if ( agt.indexOf ( " msie " ) != - 1 ) { document.execCommand ( " ClearAuthenticationCache " ) ; } </script >
Note that this log off solution works against three common browsers .
Jean - Michel 's logout does not work for Internet Explorer and Opera .
If you try this out on the live MKDoc site , it says you 're logged off , but you are not actually .
I 've not tested it myself , but others have told me that this solution also works on Safari 2.0.4 ( 419.3 ) .
There are two remaining issues to be discussed .
What happens when the user types in his user name and password within 7 seconds , i.e. within our time stamp period ?
In that case access will still be denied .
The user will probably think he mistyped his password .
It 's not nice , but not a very likely scenario either .
If all users to your site are on a fast connection , you could lower the 7 second timeout value to further minimise occurrence of this case .
The second issue is that after the users logs out by pressing the cancel button , he gets an ugly “ Authentication Required ” page .
How that is solved , is discussed below .
Required authentication
Pickup up a user 's name without real authentication raises security concerns .
It is trivial to fake HTTP headers .
When this approach is followed , care should be taken to protect sensitive URLs with the proper AuthXXXX directives .
That should be done anyway , so this approach wo n't make a site less secure .
But for the unprotected data a designer should always keep in mind that although we have a user name , it might not be the actual user .
Automatic log out after a period of inactivity
Use case : if the user has not accessed the site , upon the next request the user will be asked to re-enter his or her credentials .
Banks seem to like this approach a lot .
If you do not use the site for a while , they force you to log on again .
I wo n't be showing any code how to solve this issue , but I will just be sketching how it can be done .
This is a case where the server needs to keep state unfortunately .
Client state is n't reliable as it can be faked .
Because the user has been authenticated ( else he or she is by definition not logged in ) , we have a proper user name .
For every access that a user does we update the last access time for that user in a database .
Apache supports checking user credentials against a database , so there 's no need to duplicate user information .
When we receive an access from the user that is past a certain number of seconds compared to his last access , we can force re-authentication .
There are two approaches :
The simplest is to send an external redirect to browser to the .logout URL .
But that requires the user to find his way back , very annoying .
It would be much nicer to allow the user to proceed with the original request , after he has been re-authenticated again .
I have n't actually developed any code for the second approach , but I believe this can be done if we realise that the user 's name and password has n't changed , but what has changed is the authentication realm .
The authentication realm has expired and is no longer valid .
The user needs to supply the username and password for the new realm .
Here 's how this could be done :
Update the last access time of the user .
Force an internal redirect to something like the .force_logout_offer_login URL .
It 's important that this URL has the new authentication realm .
The new authentication realm is user dependent , so this needs to be stored in the database .
Because the realm has changed , the server will send a 401 to the browser .
The browser will popup the login dialog box .
The user must now authenticate or press cancel .
If the user authenticates again , the browser will retry the original request .
Because the last access time has been updated , the request is considered valid .
Because the resource is protected by authentication , authentication will be done and succeed if the user has supplied the correct credentials .
If the user presses cancel , he will be properly logged off in all browers , because even if the browser continues to remember the credentials , the authentication realm has expired so the user must login before being able to proceed to secured pages .
Apache 's mod_authn_dbd seems to be very suited to do this as it allows you to lookup the username and realm in a database .
Personalised login page
Use case : when the user logs on , do not force the browser to present the default login , but present a nicely formatted page where the user can enter his credentials .
With the help of AJAX pure , HTTP authentication will even support this !
The steps are simple :
Put a user name and password input box on the form .
Put a “ Login ” button on the form .
On click it should not post the data , but call a JavaScript function .
The JavaScript function asks the server if the user name and password are correct .
If so , the function access our original .login URL using the XmlHttpRequest object .
This object allows you to pass the user name and password ( Note : Opera currently does not support this ) .
Because the user name and password are correct , the browser will not popup a dialog box .
If they are incorrect , the browser will do this , even for an asynchronous call !
( Note : Opera will not popup a dialog box , just return a 401 status code ! )
Because the server responds that authentication has been successful , the browser will now continue to send the Authentication HTTP header to every URL to the directory of the current URL and all its subdirectories , as discussed before .
Problem solved .
Or nearly .
The big issue is item 3 .
If you send your user name and password as clear text over the internet , you defeat the entire purpose of using HTTP authentication .
To solve this issue properly you need to implement an entire Challenge - Response scheme .
This is nicely explained by Eric Lippert in a four part series Eric .
This is the non-trivial part and is therefore left as an exercise to the reader .
But let 's look at a few other parts of the code .
First the onclick action of the button :
login ( document.getElementById('username').value , document.getElementById(' password').value )
On click the button calls a function called login ( ) , and passes in the user name and password .
The login ( ) function is this :
function login ( username , password ) { request.open ( " GET " , " .login " , true , username , password ) ; request.onreadystatechange = onLogin ; request.send ( null ) ; }
The request object is an instance of XmlHttpRequest .
This asynchronous call simply calls .login with the proper user name and password .
If you want to check the user name and password before making this call , you have to implement step 3 with all the responsibilities to get it correct .
The callback function is onLogin .
This checks if we have received a 200 response and in that case redirects us to the home page :
function onLogin ( ) { if ( request.readyState == 4 ) { if ( request.status == 200 ) { window.location=" index.html " ; } } }
Which should indicate that we have logged on , because in our .htaccess we redirect to authenticated .
html in that case .
Note that you should have FireBug disabled , else you still will get the standard login dialog box !
I have ambivalent feelings about custom login screens .
Not only are they hard to get secure as discussed before , but how careful is the browser with storing this user name and password ?
Does it get stored in the cache ?
In unprotected areas of the computers memory ?
The browser does n't know this data is sensitive .
I have the feeling that the browser will be more careful with the user name and password supplied by HTTP authentication than with two input fields on a page .
And lastly : it is probably very hard for a rogue application or third party to fake the default HTTP authentication login screen .
This should be impossible really .
That way a user can be sure he is using trusted authentication with proper security controls .
Faking a custom login screen is much easier .
Forgot password page
Use case : if a user can no longer remember his password and gives up authentication by pressing the cancel button in the authentication dialog box , display a page where the user can request a new password .
This use case is just one of all the essential use cases a well - behaving HTTP - authentication application will have to cover .
Because when a user presses the cancel button , the application knows the user cancelled the login , but not why .
Did n't the user remember his password anymore ?
Did the user want to logout ?
Or had the user more pressing issues right now , but wants to login at a later time ?
So after pressing the cancel button we have to display a page that allows a user to do the following :
Allow the user to log on again , perhaps under a different identity .
Let the user request a new password .
In addition this page should confirm the user 's current status , i.e. that the user is logged off .
Perhaps reiterating the point , after authentication only two things can happen :
The user supplies the correct user name and password .
In that case the user will be given access to the authorised page .
The user gives up the authentication process by pressing cancel .
In that case the error page is displayed .
The browser will never give up authentication until one of these two things have happened .
When HTTP authentication fails , Apache serves the error document for the 401 status .
This can be overridden in your .htaccess with the ErrorDocument directive :
ErrorDocument 401 /logged_out.html
The URL must start with a slash , else Apache thinks it is just an error message .
The error document must contain the links to allow a user to login again or request a new password .
Caching issues
Because of all the URL rewriting and serving of different content when a user is authenticated , you must make sure caching does n't get in the way .
For this example it is enough to disable sending any expiry information and disabling any intermediate caches .
Put these lines in your .htaccess to make it all work :
ExpiresActive Off Header append Cache - Control " no- cache "
ExpiresActive only needs to be set to Off when it has been set to On and when the Expires module is loaded of course .
The “ no - cache ” value makes sure no caching takes please anywhere .
For a real site you probably want to be very cache friendly , but while testing you want to avoid tracking errors that are just due to you being send a non-updated page .
Conclusion
Cookie - less authentication is quite possible while retaining all the features that are usually associated with choosing cookie - based authentication in the first place .
I appreciate comments and questions about this solution .
And because I do n't have access to Safari I like to get a note from those users if this approach works for their browser as well .
And I appreciate it even more if you let me know if you think I have made a fatal flaw in my reasoning or code .

Appendix : my configuration
I 've tested my sample code against the following browsers :
FireFox 1.5.0.1 : full support .
Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0.2800.1106 ( version 6 SP1 ) : full support ( do n't forget to turn on the workarounds in Apache to work around IE 's Digest authentication bug ) .
Mozilla 1.7.11 : full support .
Opera 8.52 : custom logon does not work .
Apache 2.2 was built with :
./configure -- prefix=/usr -- bindir=/usr/sbin --sbindir=/usr/sbin --localstatedir=/var/run/httpd --enable-module=so --sysconfdir=/etc/httpd/ --enable - rewrite --enable - expires --enable - headers --enable - include --enable - deflate --enable -disk - cache --enable - cache --enable-auth- digest --enable-authn-dbm --enable-authz-dbm --enable-ssl --with-ssl=/usr/local/ssl --enable-cgi --enable - headers --enable-vhost-alias --enable-log-forensic
I used Perl 5.6.1 for the RewriteMap examples I presented .
In alternative solutions I have used mod_perl 2.0 .

Diabetes and Cinnamon Diabetes and cinnamon go together like heart disease and aspirin .
While cinnamon will not cure diabetes , just as aspirin wo n't cure heart disease , it will help control the condition .
The exact mechanism behind cinnamon 's blood sugar lowering ability is not clear .
It serves a dual purpose in diabetes control ; as a blood glucose lowering agent and as a natural sweetener .
Blood Glucose Levels Save & Share Article Digg del.icio.us Reddit Google Cinnamon does appear to help the body regulate blood glucose levels , especially when taken as part of a sensible diet and exercise routine .
Cinnamon has been shown to be an effective weight control supplement as well .
Diabetes and cinnamon are an important combination .
Diabetics who take cinnamon on a regular basis find their blood glucose easier to control , and sometimes less medication is needed to keep it under control .
Cinnamon has been used as a flavoring in foods for a long time .
It serves as an alternative to sugar for diabetics and cinnamon also provides an alternative in baking .
Many times the amount of sugar can be reduced by adding cinnamon to recipes .
Adding cinnamon to some of the bland foods , often found on the menu of a diabetic , helps to spice up the diet .
Type II Diabetes Diabetes and cinnamon , especially type II diabetes , fit together nicely .
The cinnamon has been purported to support the beta cells in the pancreas , which are responsible for producing insulin .
Studies have also shown direct blood sugar lowering effects similar to insulin injections in type II diabetics when 1 - 2 teaspoons of cinnamon were taken .
The mechanism behind this effect is still being researched .
Cinnamon can be taken in capsule form or powdered form .
The powdered form can be added to teas , shakes , or during baking to increase intake .
One to two teaspoons a day have been shown to have a profound impact on blood glucose levels for some diabetics .
For this reason diabetes and cinnamon have become a necessary combination .
Diet and Nutrition Including cinnamon as part of a solid nutritional plan and exercise routine may be just the ticket for controlling diabetes .
It generally takes a few weeks to see the effects of regular cinnamon use .
However , the benefits are often fairly dramatic .
Whether used for its blood sugar lowering or simply as a sugar free sweetener it can add a new dimension to the dietary regimen of the diabetic .
Supplements are important for those people with diabetes , and cinnamon is an important one .
There are many nutritional supplements that support diabetics .
Some of the others include gymnema sylvestre , bilberry , bitter melon , alpha lipoic acid , evening primrose oil , and fenugreek .
The FDA does not control these supplements , like cinnamon , and the claims made about them have not been evaluated .
They do come with centuries of anecdotal evidence and use .
Of course , as with any medicine or supplement , it is important to consult a physician before adding anything new to the diet .
Diabetes and cinnamon may be bedfellows out of necessity , but that is the impetus that brings many great combinations together .
Diabetics who add cinnamon to their diet on a regular basis often find a great sugar alternative , and a blood sugar lowering tool as well .
When all is said and done , diabetes and cinnamon may not be as strange of bedfellows as once thought .

It was August 2006 when one of the young Muslim men accused of plotting to kill soldiers at Fort Dix first broached the idea , according to the authorities .
Talking to an informer who was secretly taping the exchange , the young man said that he thought he could round up six or seven other men willing to take part , and that a rocket - propelled grenade might be the most effective weapon , the authorities said .
And he had one more notion :
He wanted the informer to lead the attack , according to a federal complaint .
“ I am at your services , ” the young man is quoted as telling the informer , who had presented himself as an Egyptian with a military background .
That moment , recorded on tape and submitted in federal court this week in Camden , N.J. , as the authorities charged six Muslim men in the plot , captures something of the complexity of using informers in terror investigations .
The informer , sent to penetrate a loose group of men who liked to talk about jihad and fire guns in the woods , had come to be seen by the suspects as the person who might actually show them how an act of terror could be carried off .
Indeed , over the months that followed , as the targets of the investigation spoke with a sometimes unfocused zeal about waging holy war , the informer , one of two used in the investigation , would tell them that he could get them the sophisticated weapons they wanted .
He would accompany them on surveillance missions to military installations , debating the risks , and when the men looked ready to purchase the weapons , it was the informer who seemed to be pushing the idea of buying the deadliest items , startling at least one of the suspects .

Have you ever been afraid ?
Everyone gets scared sometimes .
Maybe thunderstorms make your heart beat faster .
Or maybe your mouth goes dry when your teacher announces a pop quiz , or your palms sweat when it 's your turn to give your report in front of the class .
Perhaps you get butterflies in your stomach when you see the bully who picks on you .
Everyday Worries
We all have fears from time to time .
That 's true no matter how big we are or brave we can be .
Fear can even be good for you sometimes and even help you stay healthy .
Fear of getting too close to a campfire may save you from a bad burn .
And fear of getting a bad grade on a test might make you study more .
Being a bit on edge also can sharpen your senses and help you perform better in a recital or during a track meet .
Some people even enjoy being a little scared .
That 's why they like to watch scary movies or go on roller - coaster rides .
What Happens When You 're Scared ?
Have you ever wondered why being scared makes your heart beat faster and makes you breathe quicker ?
The body 's reaction to fear is called the " fight or flight " response .
And people have had it since the beginning of time .
Here 's how it works .
Imagine you 're a caveman or cavewoman living 100,000 years ago — and you come face to face with a hungry saber - toothed tiger .
You have two choices : 1 ) Run for it ( that 's flight ) , or 2 ) pick up your club and battle the tiger ( that 's fight ) .
A final choice ( be eaten ) does n't seem like such a good one !
Today , you can apply fight or flight to that bully who confronts you and wo n't listen to reason .
You have two choices : 1 ) Turn and walk away ( flight ) , or 2 ) fight , even though you know fighting wo n't solve the problem .
To prepare for fight or flight , your body does a number of things automatically so it 's ready for quick action or a quick escape .
Your heart rate increases to pump more blood to your muscles and brain .
Your lungs take in air faster to supply your body with oxygen .
The pupils in your eyes get larger to see better .
And your digestive and urinary systems slow down for the moment so you can concentrate on more important things .
What Is Anxiety ?
Usually , our bodies go into fight or flight only when there is something to fear .
However , sometimes this occurs when there does n't seem to be anything to be frightened about .
When you feel scared but there does n't seem to be a clear reason , that 's called anxiety ( say : ang - ZYE - uh - tee ) .
Other feelings might come along with anxiety — like a feeling of tightness in your chest , a bellyache , dizziness , or a sense that something horrible is going to happen .
These feelings can be very frightening .
Sometimes anxiety can interfere with things you need to do , like learning and sleeping .
For some kids , feelings of anxiety or worry can happen anytime .
For others , they might occur only at certain times , like when they 're leaving their home or family to go somewhere .
In some people , this feeling of anxiety occurs almost all the time and gets in the way of doing what they want to do .
Some kids may have a phobia ( say : FOE - bee -uh ) , which is an intense fear of something specific , such as being up high , getting dirty , the number 13 , or spiders .
Why Do People Have Anxiety ?
Anxiety can run in families .
Or a person might develop anxiety after something terrible happens , like a car crash .
Sometimes certain medical illnesses can cause feelings of anxiety .
So can abusing alcohol or other drugs , like cocaine .
Another part of the explanation has to do with the different chemicals in the nerve cells of the brain .
How the chemicals in our brain 's nerve cells are balanced can affect how we feel and act .
One of these chemicals is serotonin ( say : sir - uh - TOE - nun ) .
Serotonin is one of the brain chemicals that helps send information from one brain nerve cell to another .
But for some people with anxiety , this brain chemical system does n't always seem to work the way it should .
Also , some scientists think that a special area in the brain controls the fight or flight response .
With anxiety , it 's like having the fight or flight response stuck in the ON position — even when there is no real danger .
That makes it hard to focus on everyday things .
Dealing With Anxiety
Anxiety can be treated successfully .
Tell your mom or dad if find yourself more scared than you feel you should be or if your anxiety becomes strong and is getting in the way of what you want or need to do .
Your parents might take you to a doctor , who can help find out if a medical problem is making you feel anxious , or to a therapist , who can help find a way to lessen the anxiety through talking , activities , relaxation exercises , or medication ( or a combination of these things ) .
Of course , if you do come face to face with a hungry saber - toothed tiger , there 's just one thing you should do . . .
RUN !
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- McDonald 's is messing with the sacred french fry -- and doing it for our own good .
The No. 1 burger chain said Thursday at its annual shareholders ' meeting that within a year it will use only transfat - free oil to fry foods at all of its U.S. locations .*
Transfat oils add hydrogen to make food taste better and extend its shelf life , according to the Food and Drug Administration .
The ingredient is widely used in fried and processed foods .
But the artery - clogging oil has come under widespread attack recently for contributing to the country 's obesity epidemic .
Last week , a nutrition advocacy group sued rival Burger King ( up $ 0.75 to $ 24.65 , Charts ) over the hamburger chain 's use of transfats .
McDonald 's ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) joins a number of food retailers that are kicking the transfat habit , among them Wendy 's ( Charts ) , Starbucks ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , and Yum Brands ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , the parent of Pizza Hut , Taco Bell , and KFC .
Burger King has also vowed to eliminate transfats from its menu .
Last year New York City became the first U.S. city to pass a ban on transfat use that will rid local restaurants of the ingredient by 2008 .
McDonald 's quietly decided last fall to transition to transfat - free oils , but is gradually implementing the change to ensure a " seamless transition , " said company spokeswoman Lisa McComb .
In other words , the company wants to make sure the switch to a new frying oil does n't ruin the taste of its sacrosanct fries .
The new oil is simply a different blend -- minus the hydrogen additive -- that produces the same flavor , McComb said .
She noted it will be used not just for french fries , but for all of McDonald 's fried foods .
The pace of McDonald 's change over to the healthier oil is affected by the availability of canola and soybean crops grown in North and South America that produce the oil .
McDonald 's now uses uses a healthier oil in 3,500 restaurants and will expand its use to all 13,700 locations within a year , said McComb .
In other company news , McDonald 's CEO Jim Skinner told Reuters Thursday that he expects the world 's largest restaurant chain to increase the pace of new restaurant openings .
The company slowed its expansion rate four years ago to focus on improving its existing operations .
" We do expect to pick the growth rate up some , " Skinner said during a news conference following the company 's annual shareholder meeting in Oak Brook , Ill .
In recent years , McDonald 's has increased the number of restaurants by about 0.9 percent to 1 percent , Skinner said .
That rate is likely to increase to about 1.2 percent to 1.3 percent , he added , but did not give a time - frame .
-- from staff and wire reports
Correction : an earlier version of this story stated that McDonald 's plans to use the transfat free oil by the end of 2007 .
McDonald 's plans to phase in the new oil within a year .

Man in the mask returns to change world with new coalition and his own sexy novel
A bead of sweat is visible through the eyehole of his famous black balaclava .
Latin America 's most celebrated living rebel must be feeling the heat , but a glass of water would mean taking off the mask and that is out of the question .
He makes do with a puff on his pipe , and a subject that is close to his heart .
" My new book 's coming out in June , " Subcomandante Marcos announces with relish during the first interview he has given to a British paper in years .
" There 's no politics in the text this time .
Just sex .
Pure pornography . "
There has been a literary component to Marcos 's revolutionary persona ever since he led the ragtag Zapatista indigenous army out of the jungle in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas on New Year 's Day 1994 .
It began with lyrical communiques on Mayan Indian rights , passed through a stage of barbed sarcasm and scatological put - downs , and recently included a crime novel featuring a rebel detective .
Fundraising
Now even his erotic imagination has been harnessed to the Zapatista cause as a fundraiser .
" I 'm sure it will sell if we put a lot of Xs on the cover . "
Still , Marcos says that his next writing project will be a work of political theory analysing the forces he believes are pushing Mexico towards social upheaval .
From dispossessed indigenous communities powerless to stop dams and agribusiness destroying their lands , to street vendors evicted from the capital 's kerbs to make way for the retail magnates , he says the country 's poor and exploited are close to their limit .
The former orthodox Marxist - Leninist turned anti-globalisation guru , who is not himself indigenous , predicts that the subconscious power of the year 2010 - the 200th anniversary of the war of independence and the 100th of Mexico 's revolution - will ignite a fuse laid by American efforts to secure the bilateral border , leaving millions unable to escape to jobs in the north .
" Mexico will turn into a pressure cooker , " he says .
" And , believe me , it will explode . "
Marcos says that Mexico 's politicians , the media , and even earnest leftwing academics are oblivious to the radicalisation he sees bubbling just under the surface .
He points out that they also had no idea that the reputedly docile indigenous population in Chiapas was on the point of armed revolt 13 years ago .
Not that the Zapatista rebellion fitted the traditional mould of macho Latin American armed struggle , or Marcos ever looked or sounded like rebel leaders elsewhere .
Even the " sub " in his title - designed to imply an improbable subordination to a council of indigenous commanders - subverted the concept of military discipline employed in most other guerrilla armies .
" We left the jungle to die , " Marcos recalls , remembering how poorly armed his fighters were .
" It sounds dramatic I know , but that 's the way it was . "
The Zapatistas were beaten back by the Mexican army within days , but not before triggering a wave of sympathy across the country and the world that forced the government to call a ceasefire , as well as agree to peace negotiations that would eventually crumble .
In less than two weeks the Chiapas Indians became an international cause celebre and their mysterious mask - wearing , pipe - smoking , and poetry - spouting leader emerged as the closest approximation yet to the romance of the martyred Che Guevara .
They have hardly done any fighting since then .
Powerful persona
Sitting in a sweltering back room of a Mexico City internet cafe , Marcos admits that the message in those early years would sometimes get lost in the fascination his persona inspired .
He even confesses to occasionally letting celebrity go to his head .
" But there was always the acerbic humour there to say ' tone it down , remember you are a myth , you do not really exist ' . "
It is certainly a durable myth , which has survived despite the world 's attention shifting to more dramatic conflicts and the government 's revelation that the man behind the mask is a former philosophy lecturer called Rafael Sebastián Guillén .
Still , the subcomandante does always seem to be looking over his shoulder at himself , which is perhaps one explanation for his periods of near total silence .
The longest came in 2001 , shortly after the so - called Zapatour in which the Marcos bandwagon travelled the country accompanied by hundreds of international sympathisers and a police escort .
Elections had just ended 71 years of one - party rule in Mexico and the Zapatistas had decided to test the new democracy with the demand for an indigenous bill of rights .
When parliament ignored the pressure , the rebels returned to the jungle and concentrated on putting indigenous self - government into practice , with or without constitutional sanction .
Marcos disappeared from view , emerging four years later with a new concern to build alliances beyond the indigenous movement .
" This is the last battle of the Zapatistas , " he says of the strategy , which relies on the government deciding not to reactivate old arrest warrants for fear of sparking more sympathy for Zapatista .
" If we do n't win it we will face complete defeat . "
The subcomandante 's specific aim in his current low - key tour of the country is to consolidate the broad and loose collection of marginal left groups known as The Other Campaign .
Marcos hopes this rather chaotic mix of everybody from radical transvestites to Marxist trade unionists will eventually play a leading role in channelling the discontent he is sure will soon be raging into an unarmed civilian movement organised around the principle of respect for difference .
" We think that what is going to happen here will have no 'ism ' to describe it . "
His voice becomes wistful .
" It will be so new , beautiful and terrible that it will make the world turn to look at this country in a completely different way . "
Ballot box
Such talk could be seen as contrary , perhaps , at a time when the left has taken power in much of Latin America through the ballot box , but Marcos is unimpressed by elections he views as primarily a mechanism for ping - ponging power within the elite .
So while he gives Evo Morales in Bolivia a nod of approval for his links to a radical indigenous movement , he describes Hugo Chávez in Venezuela as " disconcerting " , and brands Brazil 's President Lula and Nicaragua 's Daniel Ortega as traitors .
Mexico 's politicians on both left and right receive nothing but his scorn .
Is it easier to claim the moral high ground when your face is hidden ?
Marcos acknowledges that the mask helps , although he stresses it is also a burden .
It can be itchy and uncomfortable , and it is so intertwined with his revolutionary persona that to take it off in public even for a few seconds would be the end of the subcomandante .
" The mask will come off when a subcomandante Marcos is no longer necessary , " he says .
" I hope it 's soon so that I can finally become a fireman like I 've always wanted .
Firemen get the prettiest girls . "
One of my most successful posts in 2006 was the Complete Guide to Web Analytics Solutions I put together in February .
Now that over a year has passed , I realized that quite a few things have changed in the web analytics space .
We ’ve had acquisitions , new companies , and other random changes .
Without further adieu , here is the 2007 Edition of the Complete Guide To Web Analytics Solutions .
The Freebies
There are numerous free solutions out there , and they range from very useful to “ you paid for what you got ” .
As you might expect , the free solutions lack a lot of the power of the paid ones , and they usually do n’t offer much support .
If you do n’t have any money to spend on analytics or you ’re new to it and want to get some experience before paying for a solution , then going with a free package is a great way to go .
Analog –
One of the oldest web analytic packages available .
Analog is free , and runs off of your log files .
It can require quite a bit of customization , and is pretty cut and dry for what it offers .
I used Analog for years , but find it just is too old school and a pain to work with to really be a great option these days .
AWStats – An improvement on Analog , but still a logfile - based solution .
There are a few nice things about logfile packages , such as the fact that they work with users who have javascript or cookies disabled .
However , the storing of logfiles can take up a lot of disk space , requires that you manage the files , and the analytics package takes usually can take time to analyze large files .
AWStats is an improvement on some other options , it provides some graphs , and it ’s nice that it also can do streaming and email statistics from their log files .
Clicktracks Appetizer – A newer edition to the Clicktracks suite of products , Appetizer is a limited but free “ appetizer ” of the full - featured Clicktracks products .
It gives a great taste of the different workflow and visual way of looking at statistics that Clicktracks has pioneered .
Clicky –
An application I had n’t heard of until contacted by the founder who coincidently went to my high school , Clicky bills themselves as “ Web Analytics 2.0 ” .
While I ’m not so sure it ’s a huge revolution in analytics , it ’s definitely a clean Web 2.0 interface , RSS reports , and a “ Spy ” feature that works just like Digg Spy except you ’re watching your site visitors in real - time .
You can also choose to make your site statistics public if you ’re open about these things .
They ’ve also integrated the Google Maps API so you can view your visitors on a Google Map .
Google Analytics – After a rough start , Google Analytics has solidified into the most full - featured free web analytics solution .
As long as you ’re comfortable with Google holding your data , the amount of statistics they provide in a free hosted service is amazing when you look back at the industry before they made their move to free .
Before Google made the move to free , the free solutions were all packages you download yourself and host your code and data .
They all also lacked ecommerce statistics which Google provides , and not to mention the handy tie - in Google Analytics can do with Google Adwords for Adwords advertisers .
MapSurface – I did a full review of MapSurface in September of 2006 , and my thoughts remain the same .
It does n’t have a ton of stats , but it ’s really handy to be looking at a page on your site and just hit Alt - X to popup the floating window and see the primary basic stats for that page , without having to login and remember a password .
The stats update pretty quickly making it a really fast way to check in on recent blog posts to see if they are getting any links or traction .
phpMyVisits – Available in 29 languages , this is a free and easy to use open source web analytics application .
Open source has it ’s advantages in that you can change and hack the code as you please , but sometimes open source projects also do n’t innovate as fast as they could or provide the necessary support .
But for free , it ’s a good deal .
Tracewatch – Another free PHP application that you download and host yourself .
It has a very powerful busy dashboard interface which I think some people would love , and some would hate .
There is a lot of information all on the main page so you can get a lot done in one space , but it can be overwhelming as well .
It is done without javascript code , and provides real - time reporting .
StatCounter – A free solution that ’s strength is that it works in real - time and shows details on the last 100 page loads .
It is limited though in it ’s lifetime data beyond the last 100 page loads , although for some low fees depending on traffic you can buy more lifetime detail .
The free version is also monetized by StatCounter with Google Adsense ads around the interface .
It is easier to use than options like Google Analytics and has a good set of stats though .
SiteMeter – A popular solution for bloggers and small websites , Sitemeter has a free version that just requires you put their colorful logo at the bottom of your site .
If you leave your data open , others can click to see your stats .
This has some cool social aspects to it , and for those selling advertising it can be helpful .
Overall , the application seems pretty old at this point , and does n’t provide a wealth of data in the free version .
However , it is a simpler solution than Google Analytics , and you do n’t have to mess with logfiles .
Webalizer – Similar to AWStats and Analog , Webalizer is a logfile analysis solution that is free .
It has some customizable charts and provides all the basics , but like the others I do n’t feel that it really measures up to the ease of use of Google Analytics or Sitemeter .
Blog Specific Solutions
The rise of blogs has lead to many application developers in all industries to start making blog - specific applications .
Analytics is no exception and in the last year we ’ve seen a few solid entries in the blog analytics space .
Blogs tend to be simpler than some regular websites , and they do n’t usually need ecommerce statistics .
These applications focus on blogs , so if you ’ve got a standard blog , you may want to look here .
Feedburner / Blogbeat – Back in mid-July Feedburner announced the acquisition of Blogbeat .
They quickly integrated Blogbeat ’s analytics into Feedburner ’s Analyze interface for their feeds so they now provide a good set of basic web analytics stats as well .
The stats are simple , but big and easy to read and provide enough for the majority of bloggers .
It ’s a pretty killer combination because if you ’re using Feedburner to manage your RSS feeds , it ’s handy to have web analytics in the same interface .
Mint – Perhaps the first analytics application aimed at blogs , Mint is a one man show run by Shaun Inman .
Do n’t let the low employee count fool you , Mint is a nice application .
It has a cost of $ 30 per site , but that ’s not too spendy if you care about your stats .
The interface is very AJAXy and cool , and you host the data on your own instead of giving it over to a third party like with most analytics applications .
It also has an API so developers can build on it , very cool .
One problem though , is you need to be able to host it on a server running Apache , PHP , and mySQL .
A great application though from a one - man army .
MeasureMap – MeasureMap was once the darling of the blog analytics space with lots of buzz throughout their private beta / alpha period .
Before they even launched they were acquired by Google .
MeasureMap was originally developed by a four - person team from information architecture / visual design powerhouse Adaptive Path .
It ’s definitely pretty and smooth , and it ’s very blog - focused with post stats , referrals , links out , and comment stats .
What ’s odd is that MeasureMap has still not ever opened to the public , and I ’m not aware of any integration that ’s taken place with any other Google tool or service .
What does the future hold for it ?
I do n’t know .
MyBlogLog – Snapped up by Yahoo in January , MyBlogLog is more than just web analytics as it ’s a hybrid social blog network widget that also has web analytics built in .
For free you get some basic stats that should satisfy your average blogger , but for $ 3 a month you can get slightly more detailed statistics over a longer period of time .
It ’s convenient to have the analytics right there with their other services in one interface , but they are n’t really full - featured enough for an analytics junkie .
Low Cost Solutions
If you ’ve got a serious small business web site , but do n’t want to go the free route with something like Google Analytics , you might consider one of these low cost solutions .
They are on par or better than Google Analytics , and your data is safe from Google , and because you pay you get support and near real time data .
Hitbox Professional – The lighter version of analytics application HBX ( profiled below ) , Hitbox is an affordable solution at around $ 26.95 a month depending on volume , and it gets you most of the basic to intermediate stats a user would want , from an analytics leader in public company WebsideStory .
Hitslink – A stats app that ’s been around a while from Net Applications .
Hitslink is a solid mix of a typical web analytics application with simplicity and some more advanced stats like ecommerce and setting conversion goals .
It ’s not flashy , but it gets the job done at an economical price .
A 30 - day trial is available and installation was very easy for me .
I keep find myself going back to Hitslink and actually paying for it when ecommerce is a need .

The price is cheap , so if you think you ’d be into a very visual view of your stats , give it a shot .
The Big Guns
If you ’ve got a serious web business , you need serious data .
When you ’re making hundreds of thousands of dollars a month from your web presence you ’re losing money by NOT using one of these applications to know exactly how your users are behaving on your site .
These applications can really be used to test and improve your site , but you ’ll have to pay for their superior features and support .
Clicktracks –
The originator of the “ page overlay ” analytics technique , Clicktracks has always had a different user interface and style delivering analytics data to it ’s user .
For some people their interface style is a huge favorite , for others such as myself I just could n’t get into it that much .
I can see how some would love it , but perhaps my years of standard analytics interfaces lead me to want something else .
I do like how they offer both a hosted ASP solution and a software solution if you want to keep the data on your own server (s ) .
Pricing is spendier then the low - cost solutions , but it ’s also cheaper than the most of the other big gun analytics providers .
E -commerce data is a big part of the mix if you want it to be , so I think Clicktracks fits well as a user - friendly small business ecommerce solution .
Coremetrics – A long time player who I ’ve never had the chance to use .
I demo’d it years ago , so I ca n’t really say much as I ’m sure they ’ve iterated quite a bit since then .
They have a lot of big clients , and their feature list looks very powerful .
Pricing is n’t cheap , and is usually negotiable but comes from a baseline of usage .
Deepmetrix – Purchased by Microsoft in 2006 , it ’s believed that Deepmetrix has been rolled into the upcoming Microsoft analytics product codenamed Gatineau .
According to “ > this post from Microsoft ’s Ian Thomas , Gatineau will be aimed at a similar audience as Google Analytics .
Fireclick – Another full - powered application I have n’t had the chance to use .
Like Coremetrics they have an impressive client list and have a nice looking feature set .
The Fireclick Index is a report that features a dozen key performance indicators to track your key metrics all from one report .
They also feature an Excel plugin and a site overlay tool to see your data while viewing your site .
Pricing is not listed and most likely negotiable .
HBX – A superpower web analytics application from public company WebsideStory .
One of the leaders in all kinds of types of analytics reporting .
HBX was one of the first to implement setting up custom funnels to track conversion on goals , they ’ve had a site overlay for a long time , have a great plugin with Excel called ReportBuilder , introduced user segmentation early on , integration with PPC advertising , and have been using AJAX and other “ web 2.0 ” technologies before the term even existed .
They have an impressive client list , and I ’ve also had the pleasure of attending their user forum where they did a great job educating and also talking to their customers to get help on where to take their product .
Pricing is n’t cheap , and is negotiable .
Instadia – A Danish company that was one of the leaders in Europe , Instadia was acquired by Omniture in early 2007 to bolster Omniture ’s business in Europe .
Intellitracker Enterprise – A UK enterprise product , but I could n’t find much about them because the website is mostly text with nothing about features , a trial , a demo , or screenshots .
Omniture – A web analytics company based out of Utah that ’s been on fire over the past couple of years signing big clients like eBay and AOL .
I have n’t used Omniture , but have heard very good things about their SiteCatalyst solution for it ’s power in user segmentation and ecommerce statistics .
They also have a Data Warehousing feature that allows real time reporting combined with the flexibility of having good access to old data .
Pricing is n’t cheap , and once again is negotiated with a salesperson .
Sitestat – Made by Netstat and based in Europe and thus available in many languages , Sitestat is aimed at larger businesses and focuses on three main areas .
Those areas are Campaign , Content , and Conversion .
Unica ’s Affinium NetInsight –
The big brother of their NetTracker , they pitch it as a solution for tracking marketing programs across multiple marketing channels .
The strength appears to be their focus on flexibility and their drag and drop interface .
Visual Sciences – A web analytics company that ’s been in “ stealth ” mode for a long time , they ’ve long been talked about as having a disruptive technology compared to their competitors .
They were just purchased by WebSideStory which should make for a very interesting application in the future as they make HBX and Visual Sciences merge or work together somehow .
Webtrends –
The granddaddy of serious web applications , Webtrends has been around forever and been sold a few times along the way .
Their now on their 8th version of their application , and they boast a big client list .
Some new features include a conversion view from five points , bookmarking and sharing of analytics , a unique first - party cookie solution , and more .
Unlike some of the other power applications , they do offer a free trial , but pricing is n’t cheap .

Klein's Quartic Curve
John Baez
May 23 , 2013
This is a movie of Klein 's quartic turning itself inside out , made Greg Egan .
Beautiful , eh ?
But to understand what 's it 's really about , let 's back up and start at the beginning ...
Take a bunch of equilateral triangles .
Glue them together so that 3 meet at each corner .
You get a regular tetrahedron :
Then take a bunch of squares .
Glue them together so that 3 meet at each corner .
You get a cube :
Next , take a bunch of regular pentagons .
Glue them together so that three meet at each corner .
You get a regular dodecahedron :
This is fun !
We 're getting a series of Platonic solids .
Next , take a bunch of regular hexagons and glue them together so that three meet at each corner .
Now the angles of the hexagons add up to 360 degrees , so we do n't get a Platonic solid .
Instead , we get a tiling of the plane .
It looks like a honeycomb that stretches out forever in all directions :
But , if you want something finite in size , you can cut out a portion of this honeycomb and curl it up to get a doughnut , or torus .
There are actually lots of ways to do this .
You might have fun figuring out what they all are .
Can you take just one regular hexagon and curl it up to form a torus ?
Anyway , these tori deserve to be called " Platonic surfaces " , since they are surfaces tiled with regular polygons , with the same number meeting at each vertex .
Next , let 's take a bunch of regular heptagons and glue them together so that three meet each corner .
Now the angles add up to more than 360 degrees , so we get a tiling of the " hyperbolic plane " .
The hyperbolic plane is like the opposite of a sphere , since it 's saddle - shaped at every point instead of bulging out at every point .
In fact the sphere and the hyperbolic plane are the two most symmetrical forms of non-Euclidean geometry .
The sphere is " positively curved " , while the hyperbolic plane is " negatively curved " .
You may have trouble visualizing the hyperbolic plane tiled with regular heptagons , but if we distort it , it fits into a disk and looks really pretty !
Don
Hatch has drawn a nice picture of it :
It 's called " {7,3} " , since it 's made of 7 - sided figures with 3 meeting at each corner .
In this picture there 's one heptagon at the center , surrounded by rings of heptagons that appear smaller ( but are n't really : that 's just an effect of the distortion ) .
Can we cut out a portion of this tiling and curl it up to get a torus ?
No !
But we can curl up a portion to get a 3 - holed torus — like the surface of a doughnut with three holes .
However , we can only do this if we use precisely 24 heptagons !
The result is called Klein 's quartic .
Klein 's quartic is an amazingly symmetrical thing : it has 336 symmetries if we include reflections , or half that many — 168 — if we do n't .
These numbers look pretty weird , but have you ever heard someone say they 're working " 24 - 7 " ?
That is , 24 hours a day , 7 days a week ?
Well , \ [ 24 \times 7 = 168 \ ] so there are 168 hours in a week , and 336 hours in a fortnight .
Surely this is an irrelevant coincidence — though it should help you remember these numbers .
What really matters is that Klein 's quartic has 24 heptagons , and there 's a symmetry sending your favorite heptagon to any of these 24 , but it can also be rotated 7 ways , for a total of 168 symmetries ... or twice as many if we also allow it to be reflected .
Exactly how do you curl up the hyperbolic plane to get Klein 's quartic ?
You need to make sure all the heptagons with the same numbers here get glued together :
( The numbers here were drawn by Mike Stay on top of Don Hatch 's picture . )
Unfortunately , it 's pretty hard to visualize the result of this procedure !
You can check mathematically that you get a 3 - holed torus , but it 's impossible to embed this surface in 3d Euclidean space without either warping it or doing some other funky maneuvers , as shown here :
So ... let 's warp it !
It 's actually easier to start with a tiling of the hyperbolic plane by equilateral triangles , with 7 meeting at each vertex :
Unsurprisingly , this tiling is called " { 3,7} " .
It has the same symmetries as our friend { 7,3} , and indeed you can still see the heptagons in blue .
We say that { 7,3} and { 3,7} are " Poincaré duals " of each other , just like the cube and octahedron .
If we curl up this thing correctly , we get a 3 - holed torus tiled by 56 triangles ( or dually , by 24 heptagons ) .
If you try to make a paper model this way , the result is inevitably a big mess .
To see what I mean , try Mike Stay 's webpage , where he wisely stops just short of completing the task — and Gerard Westendorp 's page , where he succeeds in finishing the job by using pastry instead of paper !
There might be a small market for Klein quartic birthday cakes , but for visualizing the quartic , computer graphics are better :
Voilà !
The above picture was created a long time ago by Joe Christy , using a program called Geomview , which creates virtual 3d objects .
It took about a day on the fastest Linux machine they had at the time .
The advantage of Geomview is that it lets you easily see different views :
Felix Klein originally built his surface in a different way .
In his original 1879 paper he drew a surface tiled by 24 heptagons , together with directions for how to create a 3 - holed torus by attaching the sides of this surface to each other .
I found this color version on Tony Smith 's website :
You 'll notice the heptagons are drawn in a fancy style : each one has been " barycentrically subdivided " into 14 little right triangles .
But do n't worry about those yet — concentrate on the heptagons !
There 's a blue heptagon in the middle , 7 red ones touching that , 7 yellow ones touching those , then 7 green ones falling off the edge of the picture , and 2 blue ones broken into bits all around the corners of the picture .
That 's a total of 24 heptagons .
We wrap this thing up into a 3 - holed torus using the numbers on the edges of the picture :
connect edges 1 and 6
connect edges 3 and 8
connect edges 5 and 10
connect edges 7 and 12
connect edges 9 and 14
connect edges 11 and 2
connect edges 13 and 4
In other words , connect edges 2n+1 and 2n+6 mod 14 .
To connect them the right way , make sure that triangles of the same color never touch each other .
Here 's how to see if you 've done it right .
Ignore the little triangles ; just pay attention to the heptagons !
Then :
Start on any edge of any heptagon and march along in either direction .
When you get to the end , turn left .
When you get to the end , turn right .
When you get to the end , turn left .
When you get to the end , turn right .
When you get to the end , turn left .
When you get to the end , turn right .
When you get to the end , turn left .
When you get to the end , turn right .
You should now be back where you started !
These are like the devil 's driving directions to people who ask the way out of hell : LRLRLRLR and you 'll be right back !
Hellish driving directions ... but the Klein quartic is heavenly .
As I said , it 's incredibly symmetrical .
To better understand its symmetries .
let 's count those little right triangles in the picture above .
Since the picture shows 24 heptagons , each chopped into 14 right triangles , the total number of right triangles is \ [ 24 \times 14 = 336 \]
Hey !
This is precisely the number of symmetries of the Klein quartic , including reflections !
This is no coincidence .
We can specify a symmetry by saying where it sends our favorite right triangle .
Since it can go to any other triangle , there are 336 possibilities .
If we exclude reflections , we get half as many symmetries : 24 × 7 = 168 .
By the way , this trick works for ordinary Platonic solids as well .
For example , if we take a dodecahedron and barycentrically subdivide all 12 pentagons , we get 10 × 12 = 120 right triangles .
If we pick one of these as the " identity element " , we can specify any symmetry by saying which triangle this triangle gets sent to .
So , the set of triangles becomes a vivid picture of the 120 - element rotation / reflection symmetry group of the dodecahedron .
This idea generalizes in many directions , and is incredibly useful .
Now let 's see if we can visualize the 24×7 - fold symmetry of Klein 's quartic , not counting rotations .
The 7 - fold symmetry is easiest to visualize as rotations of Klein 's original picture :
The 24 - fold symmetry is a bit harder to see .
A tetrahedron has 12 rotational symmetries , and it 's easy to see these here :
This wonderful picture was drawn by Greg Egan with the help of ideas from Mike Stay and Gerard Westendorp .
It 's probably the best way for a nonmathematician to appreciate the symmetry of Klein 's quartic .
It 's a 3 - holed torus , but drawn in a way that emphasizes the tetrahedral symmetry lurking in this surface !
You can see there are 56 triangles : 2 for each of the tetrahedron 's 4 corners , and 8 for each of its 6 edges .
However , 12 is just half of 24 , so there should be an extra 2 - fold symmetry , besides the 12 rotational symmetries of the tetrahedron .
And there is !
It consists of twisting Klein 's quartic inside out , like this :
Is n't that cool ?
Klein 's quartic has many other charms .
For example , if we take our hyperbolic plane tiled with heptagons and count them grouped according to how far they are from the central one , we get this sequence : \[ 7 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 35 , 56 , 91 , \dots \]
7 times the Fibonacci numbers !
To dig deeper , though , it helps to think about complex analysis .
If we think of the hyperbolic plane as the unit disc in the complex plane , this surface becomes a " Riemann surface " , meaning that it gets equipped with a complex structure .
This was Felix Klein 's viewpoint when he first discovered this stuff .
He showed that his surface could be described by an incredibly symmetrical quartic equation in 3 complex variables : \[ u^3 v + v^3 w + w^3 u = 0 \]
where we count two solutions as the same if they differ by an overall factor .
So , his surface is called " Klein 's quartic curve " .
Why is it called a " curve " and not a surface ?
Because it takes one complex number to say where you are on it .
We have 3 unknowns and one equation , but we mod out by an overall factor , so we get something locally parametrized by one complex number ... so algebraic geometers call it a curve .
Ordinary people find that confusing .
Anyway , Klein proved that his surface was a 3 - holed torus , and that it can be tiled by 24 regular heptagons just as we have described above .
His proof is not very easy ; you can see a simpler one on Greg Egan 's website .
You can read Klein 's original article translated into English as part of a whole free online book on Klein 's quartic curve :
Silvio Levy , editor , The Eightfold Way : the Beauty of Klein's Quartic Curve , MSRI Research Publications 35 , Cambridge U. Press , Cambridge 1999 .
This book was put out by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley to celebrate the completion of sculpture of Klein 's quartic curve made by Helaman Ferguson .
I must admit that the sculpture leaves me unmoved .
But the curve itself — ah , that 's another story !
It 's great .
Mathematically , Klein 's quartic curve is special because it has the maximum number of symmetries of any 3 - holed Riemann surface .
By " Riemann surface " , I mean a surface equipped with a way of measuring angles .
For an oriented surface , like a 3 - holed torus , this is the same as a smoothly varying way to rotate tangent vectors 90 degrees counterclockwise .
We can think of this as a way to multiply these vectors by √ - 1 — in other words , a " complex structure " .
Thus , we can do complex analysis on any Riemann surface .
Locally , it might as well be the complex plane .
To understand the theme of incredibly symmetrical Riemann surfaces , let 's first consider a Riemann surface with no holes : a sphere .
There 's only one way to make a sphere into a Riemann surface - it 's called the Riemann sphere .
You can think of it as the complex numbers plus a point at infinity .
This has infinitely many symmetries .
They 're called conformal transformations , and they all look like this : \[ z \mapsto \ frac{a z + b}{c z + d} \]
They form a group called \( \mathrm {PSL} ( 2, \mathbb{C} ) \ ) , since it 's the same as the group of 2×2 complex matrices with determinant 1 , mod scalars .
It 's also the same as the Lorentz group , famous in special relativity !
There are different ways to make a torus into a Riemann surface , some with more symmetries than others ( see " week124 " of my column ) .
But , there are always translation symmetries in both directions , so the symmetry group is always infinite .
On the other hand , a Riemann surface with 2 or more holes can only have a finite group of conformal transformations .
In fact , in 1893 Hurwitz proved that a Riemann surface with \( g \ge 2\ ) holes has at most \ [ 84 ( g - 1 ) \ ] conformal transformations ( not including reflections ) .
When \( g = 3 \ ) , this is 168 .
So , Klein 's quartic curve is as symmetrical as a 3 - holed torus can possibly be !
The appearance of the number 84 in Hurwitz 's theorem is pretty shocking at first .
Why does such a weird number show up in such a fundamental result ?
It 's because to get the most symmetrical Riemann surfaces , we should start with a tiling of the plane with triangles whose vertex angles are \ ( \pi / p\ ) , \ ( \pi/q\ ) and \ ( \pi/r\ ) for some integers \ ( p , q , r\ ) , and then cut out a portion and curl it up to form a \ ( g\ ) - holed torus .
For example , to get Klein 's quartic curve we take \( p = 2 , q = 3 , r = 7 \ ) :
If you tile a \ ( g\ ) - holed torus with triangles like this , Euler 's formula says \[ V - E + F = 2 - 2g \ ] where \ ( V\ ) is the number of vertices , \ ( E\ ) is the number of edges and \ ( F\ ) is the number of faces : that is , triangles .
But \[ E = \ frac { 3} { 2} F \ ] since each face has 3 edges , but 2 faces share each edge .
We can also figure out the number of vertices if we know the number of faces .
You 'll see in the pictue above that vertices come in three kinds : those where \ ( 2 \times 2 \ ) triangles meet , those where \( 2 \times 3 \ ) triangles meet , and those where \( 2 \times 7 \ ) triangles meet .
That 's how it 's got to work for a highly symmetric tiling : there will be vertices where \ ( 2 p\ ) triangles meet , vertices where \ ( 2 q\ ) triangles meet , and vertices where \ ( 2 r\ ) triangles meet .
So , if you scratch your head and think a while , you 'll see that \[ \displaystyle {
V = ( \frac { 1} {2 p} + \ frac{1}{2q} + \ frac{1}{2r} ) F } \]
Taking the last 3 equations I 've written down and doing a little algebra , you can show \ [ F = \ displaystyle { \frac{4( g - 1) }{1 - \ frac{1}{p} - \ frac{1}{q} - \ frac{1}{r}} } \]
So , this is the number of triangles .
But in the most symmetrical situations , there 's a symmetry sending any triangle to any other !
That takes work to show ... but the upshot is that at least for \( g \ge 2\ ) , the most symmetrical Riemann surfaces have \[ \ displaystyle { \frac{4( g - 1) }{1 - \ frac{1}{p} - \ frac{1}{q} - \ frac { 1 }{r}} } \ ] symmetries for some positive integers \ ( p , q , r\ ) .
To make this number of symmetries as big as possible , we need to make \[ \displaystyle {1 - \ frac{1}{p} - \ frac{1}{q} - \ frac { 1}{r} } \ ] as small as possible ( while still being positive ) .
And now for the magic part !
To make this number as small as possible we need to use \( p = 2 , q = 3 , r = 7 \ ) : \[ \displaystyle {1 - \ frac{1}{2} - \ frac{1}{3} - \ frac{1}{7} = \ frac{1}{42} } \]
You can check this by considering all the different options in a systematic way — it 's a great exercise if you 're ever stuck on a long bus ride .
So , we get a maximum of \ [ 42 \times 4 ( g - 1 ) = 168 ( g - 1 ) \ ] symmetries !
But these symmetries include reflections ; if we disallow those , as usually done in stating Hurwitz 's theorem , we get half as many : \[ 84 ( g - 1 ) \]
So , we see that far from being arbitrary flukes , the numbers 84 and 168 are burnt deep into the fabric of reality .
The Fano plane
Sitting inside \( \mathrm {PSL}( 2, \mathbb{Z} ) \ ) is a group called \ ( \Gamm a ( 7 ) \ ) , consisting of guys where each entry of the matrix \[ \ left ( \ begin{array}{cc} a & b \\ c & d \end{array} \right ) \ ] is congruent to the corresponding entry of the identity matrix \[ \ left ( \ begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \right ) \] modulo 7 .
This is an example of a " congruence subgroup " ; these serve to relate complex analysis to number theory in lots of cool ways .
In particular , Klein 's quartic curve is just \[ \ mathbb {H}/\Gamma(7 ) \]
Since \( \Gamma ( 7 ) \ ) is a normal subgroup of \( \mathrm {PSL} ( 2, \mathbb{Z} ) \ ) , the quotient group \[ \mathrm {PSL} ( 2, \mathbb{Z} )/\Gamma(7 ) = \ mathrm {PSL}(2, \mathbb{Z}/7 ) \ ] acts as symmetries of Klein 's quartic curve .
And , this group has 168 elements !
This group does n't include reflection symmetries , since they do n't preserve the complex structure — they 're like complex conjugation .
If we include them , we get a 336 - element group called \( \mathrm {PGL} ( 2, \mathbb{Z}/7 ) \ ) .
In fact , \( \mathrm {PSL} ( 2, \mathbb{Z}/7 ) \ ) is the second smallest nonabelian simple group .
The smallest one is the rotational symmetry group of the icosahedron , which has 60 elements .
This group is actually \( \ mathrm {PSL} ( 2, \mathbb{Z}/5 ) \ ) , and Klein had run into it in his work on the icosahedron and quintic equations .
So , it 's actually far from sheer luck that he then moved on to \( \ mathrm {PSL} ( 2, \mathbb{Z}/7 ) \ ) and ran into his wonderful quartic curve .
By the way , this 168 - element group is also known as \( \mathrm {PSL}( 3 , \mathbb{ Z}/2 ) \ ) — the symmetries of the " Fano plane " .
This is another name for the projective plane over Z / 2 .
It has 7 points and 7 lines , with 3 points on each line and 3 lines through each point .
If you draw one of the lines as a circle , it looks like this picture from the Wikipedia article on finite geometries :
A symmetry of the Fano plane is any function from points to points that sends lines to lines .
Such symmetries can send any point to any other point , and even while not moving one point they can permute the 4 lines not containing that point in an arbitrary way , for a total of \ [ 4 ! \times 7 = 168 \ ] symmetries .
The 7 - fold symmetry of the Fano plane is visible in this picture drawn by Burkard Polster , author of Geometries on Surfaces and The Mathematics of Juggling :
The 24 - fold tetrahedral symmetry of the Fano plane is best seen by drawing 4 of its lines as circles and the rest as actual lines , like this :
This picture was drawn by Joe Christy .
Here the points of the Fano plane are seen as singular points of the real part of a surface which is called the Roman surface because the mathematician who discovered it was in Rome at the time .
This surface probably deserves a webpage of its own ....
But now let 's think harder about the symmetries of Klein 's quartic curve and why they match those of the Fano plane .
First , there 's the obvious 7 - fold symmetry of Klein 's original picture , which matches the 7 - fold symmetry of Burkhard Polster 's picture of the Fano plane :
There are some subtleties .
For example , rotating the central blue heptagon also has the effect of rotating each of the two blue heptagons near the edges .
If you rotate the central heptagon 1 / 7 of a turn , one of the other heptagons rotates 2/7 of a turn and the other rotates 4 /7 of a turn .
Since 8/ 7 of a turn is the same as 1 /7 of a turn , we can say there are 3 heptagons rotating , each twice as fast as the previous one !
Greg Egan has made a movie of this in the Poincare dual picture where the Klein quartic is tiled by 56 triangles :
If you look carefully you 'll see three 7 - valent vertices rotating around .
Second , there 's the obvious 12 - fold rotational symmetry of Egan 's tetrahedral picture :
together with this extra 2 - fold symmetry :
These fit together to give a 24 - fold symmetry of Klein 's quartic curve .
In fact , if you watch carefully , you 'll see that the tetrahedron gets reflected as it turns inside out in Egan 's movie .
More precisely , if you follow the four corners of the tetrahedron , you 'll see that two come back to where they were , while the other two get switched .
So , this symmetry acts as a reflection , or odd permutation , of the 4 corners .
The rotations act as even permutations of the corners .
So , these 24 symmetries form a group isomorphic to the rotation / reflection symmetry group of a tetrahedron .
Algebraically speaking , this group is S 4 : the permutations of 4 things .
These match the 24 permutations of 4 lines not going through a given point in the Fano plane .
But S 4 has another significance , as well : it 's the rotational symmetry group of a cube .
And Egan was able to spot a hidden cube lurking in his picture !
Can you ?
If you look carefully , you 'll see each corner of his tetrahedral gadget is made of a little triangular prism with one triangle facing out and one facing in : for example , the pink triangle staring you right in the face , or the light blue one on top .
Since 4 × 2 = 8 , there are 8 of these triangles .
Abstractly , we can think of these as the 8 corners of a cube !
They are n't really , but we can pretend .
The way these 8 triangles come in pairs corresponds to how the vertices of a cube come in diagonally opposite pairs .
Using this , you can see that the group S 4 acts on these 8 triangles in precisely the same way it acts via rotations on the vertices of a cube .
In fact , you can even draw a picture of a cube on the Klein quartic by drawing suitable curves that connect the centers of these 8 triangles !
It 's horribly distorted , but topologically correct .
Part of the distortion is caused by embedding the Klein quartic in ordinary 3d Euclidean space .
If we gave the Klein quartic the metric it inherits from the hyperbolic plane , the edges of the cube would be geodesics .
This remark also helps us see something else .
The Klein quartic is tiled by 56 triangles .
8 of them give the cube we 've just been discussing .
In Egan 's picture these triangles look special , since they lie at the corners of his tetrahedral gadget .
But this is just an illusion caused by embedding the Klein quartic in 3d space .
In reality , the Klein quartic is perfectly symmetrical : every triangle is just like every other .
So in fact there are lots of these cubes , and every triangle lies in some cube .
But this is where it gets really cool .
In fact , each triangle lies in just one cube .
So , there 's precisely one way to take the 56 triangles and divide them into 7 bunches of 8 so that each bunch forms a cube .
So : the symmetry group of the Klein quartic acts on the set of cubes , which has 7 elements .
But as I explained last week , this symmetry group also acts on the Fano plane , which has 7 points .
This suggests that cubes in the Klein quartic naturally correspond to points of the Fano plane .
And Egan showed this is true !
He showed this by showing more .
The Fano plane also has 7 lines .
What 7 things in the Klein quartic do these lines correspond to ?
Anticubes !
You see , the cubes in the Klein quartic have an inherent handedness to them .
You can go between the 8 triangles of a given cube by following certain driving directions , but these driving directions involve some left and right turns .
If you follow the mirror - image driving directions with " left " and " right " switched , you 'll get an anticube .
Apart from having the opposite handedness , anticubes are just like cubes .
In particular , there 's precisely one way to take the 56 triangles and divide them into 7 bunches of 8 so that each bunch forms an anticube .
Here 's a picture of the 7 cubes and 7 anticubes , drawn Greg Egan :
Each triangle has a colored circle and a colored square on it .
There are 7 colors .
The colored circle says which of the 7 cubes the triangle belongs to .
The colored square says which of the 7 anticubes it belongs to .
If you stare at this picture for a few hours , you 'll see that each cube is completely disjoint from precisely 3 anticubes .
Similarly , each anticube is completely disjoint from precisely 3 cubes .
This is just like the Fano plane , where each point lies on 3 lines , and each line contains 3 points !
So , we get a vivid way of seeing how every figure in the Fano plane corresponds to some figure in the Klein quartic curve .
This is why they have the same symmetry group .
This is an excellent example of Felix Klein 's " Erlangen program " for reducing geometry to group theory .
We are beginning to see how two superficially different geometries are secretly the same :
FANO PLANE KLEIN'S QUARTIC CURVE 7 points 7 cubes 7 lines 7 anticubes incidence of points and lines disjointness of cubes and anticubes
KLEIN'S QUARTIC CURVE FANO PLANE 24 vertices ???
84 edges ??? 56 triangular faces ???
incidence of vertices and edges ???
incidence of edges and faces ???
For now , let me give the precise driving directions that define a " cube " or an " anticube " in Klein 's quartic curve .
Say you 're on some triangle and you want to get to a nearby triangle that belongs to the same cube .
Here 's what you do :
hop across any edge ,
turn right ,
hop across the edge in front of you ,
turn left ,
then hop across the edge in front of you .
hop across any edge ,
turn left ,
hop across the edge in front of you ,
turn right ,
then hop across the edge in front of you .
You 'll notice that these instructions are mirror - image versions of each other .
They 're also both 1/4 of the " driving directions from hell " that I described earlier .
In other words , if you go LRLRLRLR or RLRLRLRL , you wind up at the same triangle you started from .
You 'll have circled around one face of a cube or anticube !
In fact , your path will be a closed geodesic on the Klein quartic curve ... precisely like this long dashed line in Klein 's original picture :

For more , you should look at Greg Egan 's pages about Klein 's quartic curve — which emphasizes the tiling by triangles and the symmetries — and Klein 's quartic equation , which shows how to get everything starting from the equation \[ u^3 v + v^3 w + w^3 u = 0 \]

Dietary supplement can make generations of mice obese .
Can too many vitamins be bad for a pregnant mom ?
© Punchstock
A simple vitamin supplement in a pregnant mouse 's diet can make her offspring fatter , according to research presented on 1 June at the Human Genome Organisation meeting in Helsinki , Finland .
The effect is thought to be due to chemical changes made to the mother 's DNA , which can be passed down the generations .
The study adds to the debate over whether it's a good idea for expectant mothers to up their dietary intake of folic acid , a common supplement used to help lower the incidence of spina bifida .
Rob Waterland and his team at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , Texas studied the effects of certain compounds in food , including folic acid and vitamin B 12 .
These compounds are known to add chemical constituents called methyl groups to DNA , which affects the activity of genes : part of a phenomenon called ' epigenetics ' .
Other researchers had already shown that adding methyl donors to a female mouse 's diet can influence gene activity in her pups .
In mice with a mutation in a coat - colour gene called agouti ( the mutation is called agouti variable yellow , or Avy ) , supplementing the diet of pregnant females turns their pup 's coats from yellow to brown .
Waterland 's team later showed that the supplements did this by methylating a bit of DNA that regulates the agouti gene , which effectively turns off the abnormal gene activity caused by the mutation .
Avy mice are also obese .
So Waterland 's team wanted to see whether this too could be altered by epigenetics .
Feed me
The researchers fed Avy females methyl - donating chemicals in the form of folic acid , vitamin B 12 , betaine and choline .
They collected and weighed their pups , and then repeated the experiment : feeding methyl donors to the female pups and then looking at their offspring .
They expected to find that pup weight decreased over the generations as the animals inherited and acquired more and more methylation of their Avy mutation , which would be expected to turn down the agouti gene 's activity .
Instead , they found the opposite : the mice got heavier down the generations .
What 's more , when they repeated the experiment with non-Avy mice , they got similar results .
Vitamin supplements would n't be expected to affect the weight of pups , particularly not in a way that accumulates from one generation to the next , just from their nutritional value alone .
So methylation of some as - yet - unknown gene , the researchers say , is the most likely explanation for the heritable weight gain .
David Barker of Southampton University , an expert on the fetal origins of adult disease , says the findings give new insight into how maternal nutrition could affect the fetus .
" This rapid rise of epigenetics is making sense of what we have been working on for the past 20 years , " he says .
" We know that the human embryo is extremely sensitive to the nutritional environment . "
The doses of methyl donors given to the mice were comparable to those taken by people who use vitamin supplement tablets , says Waterland .
" This raises the question , can too many vitamins be bad for us ? " he asked the conference .
Fortified diet
Women planning a pregnancy are advised to take folic acid supplements because they drastically reduce the chances of having a baby with neural tube defects such as spina bifida .
Some countries , including the United States , have introduced mandatory fortification of grains and flour to bump up the folic acid levels in women across the board .
Neural tube defects in the United States have dropped sharply thanks to mandatory fortification .
But there is fierce debate over whether this is a good idea .
There is a complex relationship between dietary exposure to folic acid and the risk of developing certain cancers , for example .
ADVERTISEMENT
The emerging picture from studies of how methyl donors in a mouse 's diet can influence her offspring 's gene expression and weight will add an extra dimension to this debate .
Waterland emphasizes that there is currently no evidence that folic acid can have these sorts of effects all by itself .
All the studies so far have used combinations of different methyl donors , and they have all been in mice .
So it is too early to draw any conclusions about the effects of folic acid in humans .
" I think it 's premature at this point , " he says .
Waterland 's team is investigating further .

… awaiting her boyfriend ’s return to her home within two months of the rape .
That boyfriend was in prison for molesting his own daughter .
That ’s hardly a credible witness with any sympathy for victims of sexual assault …
Additionally , the two ‘ friends ’ were the ones who convinced the 17 year old that she should report it to the police .
So if the young woman is guilty [ of filing a false rape charge ] , the instigating accessories to her ‘ crime ’ are considered credible experts about how a rape victim should act .
Even though the woman never said she lied or recanted her story , city prosecutors say they took the unusual step of filing charges against her because of the seriousness of her accusations .
[…]
Ted Naemura , the assistant city attorney who prosecuted the case , said the woman 's false accusations were serious enough to lead to charges .
The young men faced prison sentences of at least 7 years and a lifetime labeled as sex offenders .
In addition , police spent considerable resources investigating the accusations .
Beaverton has no policy about prosecuting such cases , but reviews each one on its merits , Naemura said .
The city prosecuted a similar case a year ago in which a judge ordered the woman to pay $ 1,100 in restitution for the city 's investigation costs , said Officer Paul Wandell , a Beaverton Police Department spokesman .
The bottom line , Naemura said , is that people can't use the criminal justice system to further their own ends .
This case should not deter legitimate victims from reporting crimes , he said .
Kevin Neely , spokesman for the Oregon Attorney General 's Office , said it was rare for alleged sex crime victims to be charged much less convicted of filing a false police report .
" Our concern is always with the underreporting of sexual assaults , " he said , " not with false reporting .
It 's a safe bet that prosecutions for false reporting are rare . "
A 17 - year - old girl went to police at the urging of her friends after she was allegedly gang - raped by three men , including her boyfriend .
The men testified that the act was consensual .
After reviewing all the information and statements , prosecutors decided they did n’t think they could prove a rape allegation , and so declined to prosecute the case .
Instead , they prosecuted the victim for filing a false police report .
Yesterday , she was found guilty .
The victim has never recanted her story .
Instead , the decision was based on the judge ’s opinion that the three men were more credible , in part because a police detective and the victim ’s friends testified she did not “ act traumatized ” in the days after the incident .
In cases like this , people tend to draw their own conclusions , based on what ’s reported , filling in the blanks in a way that satisfies one ’s judgment .
What are you thinking right now ?
That maybe it reallya false rape charge ?
That maybe the victim was just vindictive ?
That there had to bethat the judge found her guilty ?
Let me give you some more information — something that is only a possibility because The American Street ’s Kevin Hayden has known the victim nearly her whole life .
He attended the trial .
He noticed that the prosecutor repeatedly referred to the attackers as “ boys , ” even though they were grown men and the victim was 17 .
He noticed that the judge acknowledged he had found inconsistencies in all of their stories , but , inexplicably , decided that the same reasonable doubt that kept prosecutors from pursuing charges against the attackers was n’t enough to keep him from finding the victim guilty .
He also noted what was , and was not , allowed to be introduced as evidence .
Allowed :
The 17 - year - old victim ’s sexual history .
Not allowed :
That one of the victim’s “ friends , ” her mother , has problems with alcohol and prescription drugs , provided her daughter with the alcohol she ’d had that evening ( which the mother had stolen from the store at which she cashiers ) , and was : Again :
The judge decided that the victim was not credible because her friend and her mother said she did not “ act traumatized ” in the days after the incident .
He then filed a charge against the victim which turned the two people he had deemed credible witnesses into criminal conspirators .
That seems rather confusing , that two criminal conspirators could also be credible witnesses , and experts on post - rape trauma no less .
Although , it is rather convenient for a judge and prosecutors who might want to make a point
It should n’t , should it ?
Something tells me it just might , particularly when a judge admits he found inconsistencies in the stories of both the woman and her attackers , but decided nonetheless that thewere “ legitimate ” victims and the woman was not .
As it is , only 10 % of victims of sex crimes in Oregon file reports with police .
Just how safe a bet ?
Heather J. Huhtanen , Sexual Assault Training Institute director for the Attorney General 's Sexual Assault Task Force , reports that Portland police have found thatof sexual assault cases were falsely reported .
By way of comparison , of auto theft cases were falsely reported .
Here are some things we hear a lot : Vindictive women use rape charges to get back at men .
Women ’s sexual histories can be informative in a rape case .
Women who were “ really raped ” are easily identified by the way they behave .
Yes , there are some women ( and men ) who file false rape charges .
They are , however , rare , usually quickly identified as false , and are almost always thrown out long before trial .
In truth , many genuine victims of rape never see their cases reach trial due to lack of evidence ; a genuine rape victim is exponentially less likely to see her attacker prosecuted than an erroneously charged man is toprosecuted .
A woman ’s sexual history has absolutely no bearing on whether she was raped — .
A rapist does n’t give a rat ’s ass whether he rapes a virgin or a whore , or any of the majority of us who fall somewhere in between , which makes each of us as likely to fall victim to the crime as anyone else .
There is no such thing as a “ typical ” response to rape .
Immediately following a rape , some women go into shock .
Some are lucid .
Some are angry .
Some are ashamed .
Some are practical .
Some are irrational .
Some want to report it .
Some do n’t .
Most have a combination of emotions , but there is no standard response .
Responses to rape are as varied as its victims .
In the long term , some rape victims act out .
Some crawl inside themselves .
Some have healthy sex lives .
Some never will again .
Now here are some things that are true .
Rape is underreported .
Reporting a rape is difficult , and can be embarrassing , shameful , hurtful , frustrating , and too often unfulfilling .
Quite bluntly , there is very little incentive to report a rape .
It ’s a terrible experience , and the likelihood of seeing justice served is a long shot .
Even if it is , it usually comes at great personal cost , with one ’s sexual history put on public display amidst the dismay of reliving the attack — and an extended trial can necessitate living in a state of suspended animation , where moving on from that moment is all but impossible .
The only real incentive one has is knowing the sacrifice might prevent the same thing from happening to someone else .
Not a small thing , but a big personal investment .
And now , women have one less reason to come forward — the possible horror of watching their attackers go free while they are found guilty .

That legislation , dumped on an almost - straight party line vote , was one of many Democratic - sponsored measures to die in the Republican - controlled Senate in 2006 and part of a whopping three - quarters of Democratic initiatives squashed over the two years of the 109th Congress .
An analysis of all Senate roll call votes in 2006 , shows that , true to the form they established the previous year , the GOP killed most legislation proposed by Senate Democrats .
In all , Democrats were able to scrape together a handful of Republican votes to pass just 28 pieces of legislation in all of 2006 .
There were
Add the 70 percent kill - rate of the Democratic measures defeated in 2006 with the greater number
Of all the nauseating tactics used by the Republican party in the 2006 , midterm election campaign , one of the more galling was their continued insistence that Democrats had " no plan " for national security .
To provide cover for that bogus claim , the Senate 's GOP leadership made damn sure that , on September 13 , 2006 , they killed 528 pages of a national - security blueprint , proposed by Democrats , called the Real Security Act of 2006 -- and then went around for the next six weeks saying the Democrats had no plan .
That legislation , dumped on an almost - straight party line vote , was one of many Democratic - sponsored measures to die in the Republican - controlled Senate in 2006 and part of a whopping three - quarters of Democratic initiatives squashed over the two years of the 109th Congress .
An analysis of all Senate roll call votes in 2006 , shows that , true to the form they established the previous year , the GOP killed most legislation proposed by Senate Democrats .
In all , Democrats were able to scrape together a handful of Republican votes to pass just 28 pieces of legislation in all of 2006 .
There were 279 roll call votes in the second half of the 109th Congress -- January through December of this year -- and 104 votes involved measures sponsored by Democrats .
Of those , 73 , or 70 percent , had a negative outcome , meaning that they were rejected in an up - or - down vote or tabled / killed by the GOP majority .
( And this is with a generous interpretation that gives Republicans " credit " for allowing benign , crowd - pleasers to pass , such as a Barbara Boxer amendment to punish parents who have committed incest and a measure by Barack Obama for Katrina relief , which both passed by unanimous votes .
) Add the 70 percent kill - rate of the Democratic measures defeated in 2006 with the greater number beaten back by Republicans in 2005 and the GOP ends the 109th Congress having shot down 207 of 283
pieces
of Democratic - sponsored legislation -- or 73 percent .
There are two things that jump out when one considers the votes of the last Senate …
One is that it was indeed as partisan as it appeared to those of us observing it each and every day and the deck was at all times stacked against Democrats and any legislation they tried to move forward .
This was brought into specific relief when I averaged the roll call votes on all 73 times in 2006 that Democratic legislation was killed and the average numeric vote in those instances was 46 - 53 -- amazingly close to the exact split of 44 Democrats and 55 Republicans in the 2004 - 2006 Senate .
How 's that for a look at what results a Democratic Senator should have reasonably expected , no matter what legislation they brought to the floor ?
The other startling thing that becomes obvious when analyzing the votes , is the sheer number of bills related to national security or helping America 's Veterans that were voted down by the Republicans -- with no substitute measures of their own -- simply because the ideas came from the other side of the aisle .
Here 's some examples of Democratic legislation that was killed by the Senate GOP majority in 2006 :
Senator Daniel Akaka ( D - HI ) proposed S.Amdt.
3007 to " increase Veterans medical services funding by $ 1.5 billion in FY 2007 to be paid for by closing corporate tax loopholes . "
It was voted down 46 - 54 with every Republican but Lincoln Chafee ( R - RI ) voting against it .
S.Amdt. 3141 , was proposed by Senator Debbie Stabenow ( D - MI ) to provide for Veterans benefits that steadily increased over time to account for both inflation and the large number of troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan .
Stabenow 's bill was rejected 46 - 54 -- probably because she stipulated that it be " paid for by restoring the pre-2001 top rate for income over $ 1 million , closing corporate tax loopholes and delaying tax cuts for the wealthy . "
John Kerry ( D - MA ) who has consistently been a Veterans advocate , proposed S.Amdt .
3143 , to keep medical - care fees and co-pays from going up on military retirees , only to see it shot down by the Republicans .
Two measures by Senator Robert Menendez ( D - NJ ) -- S. Amdt. 4999 and S.Amdt.
3054 -- were proposed to provide additional funding to increase inspections at America 's shipping ports and to improve the security of cargo containers destined for the United States .
Both were killed on party line votes that saw only Jim Talent ( R - MO ) cross the aisle to vote with Democrats on one of the bills .
Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) introduced S.Amdt.
4587 , to boost transit security funding in major cities by $ 300 million and saw it rejected by the Republican majority .
America 's firefighters had a friend in Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) who proposed S.Amdt.
4641 in July " .. to fund urgent priorities for our Nation 's firefighters , law enforcement personnel , emergency medical personnel , " but saw it go down on the Senate floor because he proposed paying for it " by reducing the tax breaks for individuals with annual incomes in excess of $ 1,000,000 " -- obviously the kiss of death in a GOP - controlled Congress .
Byron Dorgan ( D - ND ) proposed S.Amdt.
4292 , to thoroughly weed out fraud and war profiteering among big Republican donors like Halliburton and had it defeated 44 - 52 , with only one Republican -- Lincoln Chafee again -- siding with Democrats , troops and American taxpayers .
The U.S. attorney firings scandal has laid bare the administration 's -- and particularly Karl Rove 's -- preoccupation with prosecuting voter fraud .
But there 's a flip side to this coin .
The Justice Department 's Civil Rights Division has virtually abandoned its traditional role , undertaken since the 1965 Voting Rights Act , of actively protecting African American voters from discrimination .
There 's no greater demonstration of that fact than this simple fact :
During the first five years of the Bush administration , the Justice Department 's voting section only filed a single case alleging voting discrimination on behalf of African American voters .
That 's despite the fact that the section , part of the Civil Rights Division , was created mainly to protect African American voters from discrimination .
But during that same time period , the section managed to file the first ever " reverse " discrimination case under the Voting Rights Act .
That case , United States v. Ike Brown and Noxubee County , alleges that Brown , the chairman of Noxubee County 's Democratic Executive Committee in Mississippi , has been trying to limit whites ' participation in local elections .
The case , filed in 2005 , is currently being tried , and is likely to reach its conclusion later this month .

Blackmail and poison pen letters .
As a new book reveals the nightmare of marrying a man with a bitter ex-wife , three women describe the hell of joining The Second Wives Club .
Sandra James had every reason to feel happy and contented when an envelope arrived through the post .
Blessed with an adored baby girl from her marriage to second husband Tom , and enjoying every moment of her maternity leave , life seemed sweet indeed .
She recalls smiling as she opened the envelope and started to read the letter inside - but the memory of what came next still leaves her shaking with emotion .
There , in scrawled handwriting , screamed the word " Slut " .
As she read on in horror , each new sentence was seeped in venom and vitriol - accusing her of sleeping around and being an unfit mother to the child she adored .
An immaculate 35 - year - old mother - of - three , Sandra recalls : " I was shaking so much that I could hardly read .
By the end of the letter , I was crying my eyes out .
It was n't just the crazy accusations themselves which were so upsetting - it was the amount of hate behind them . "
But these were no rantings from an anonymous stalker .
The author of the poisonous missive was , in fact , Tom 's former wife - who had signed the letter - furious with Sandra for having found love with the husband she had dumped years earlier .
" I feel as if I am fighting a battle all the time - and she has come so close to breaking me , " says Sandra .
" The only thing which keeps me going is my love for Tom , but sometimes I even ask myself if life would be easier if I just raised the children alone , without having to face the ex-wife from hell .
" Apart from the abusive letters she has sent to my home , she has also sent letters to my boss and my parents , claiming that Tom is not the biological father of our little daughter , Amy , and that I am not a good mother .
" The personal abuse is bad enough , but there are also the grasping demands for money .
She sees Tom and me as an open chequebook , and the situation is so bad that just last week I sank on to the kitchen floor and just sobbed in desperation . "
A new novel , The Second Wives Club , by Jane Moore - herself a second wife - details the nightmare problems a former wife can bring to a new family .
From divided loyalties , torn emotions , open hostility and constant battles over money and access to children , each chapter brings fresh fictional horror .
But to thousands of second wives across Britain , who , like Sandra , find themselves facing a bitter ex-wife , fact is even more terrifying than the pages of any bestseller .
Sandra 's problems began in early 2004 , when she found herself comforting a fellow civil servant and work colleague who had just been dumped by his wife .
A divorcee living in Wiltshire with daughters Charlotte , now 16 , and Sophie , 14 , from her first marriage , she says : " Tom went home from work one evening to find the door locked and a note on it telling him he was no longer welcome .
He did n't have any money on him , or even his mobile phone .
" In desperation , he walked to a phone box and rang the office to ask if someone could give him a lift to his parents ' house .
I happened to pick up the phone , and said I 'd take him .
" We became friends , and five months after he had split up with his wife , I realised I had fallen in love with him .
" Right from day one , I tried to stay out of his relationship with his ex-wife and his children , but it was so hard seeing him being torn apart .
" From the moment they split , she would n't let him see his children , and he still has n't seen them , even though we have spent £ 18,000 on legal fees trying to get access .
" Their divorce dragged on and on , and during the course of this she has requested every little detail about me , my salary , how much my house is worth , how big my mortgage is , and even asking to see my bank statements .
" It is like being burgled .
It 's as if she
wants me to hand over my life , everything I have built up over the years , just because I have had the audacity to fall in love with her former husband . "
The arrival of baby Amy ten months ago has simply inflamed an already desperate situation .
" I love my job , but it seems Tom 's exwife is at liberty to come after me financially , and I am deliberately not going back to work after Amy 's birth so I do n't have an income she can claim , " says Sandra .
" Why should I support her ?
She does not have a mortgage to pay and she lives in a lovely four - bedroom house .
" I could understand it if we'd had a year - long affair and I was the reason for the break - up , but that 's not the case .
She does n't want him back , but she does n't want him to be happy with anyone else .
" Poor Tom is mentally exhausted by it all - he longs to see his children and that separation is like a physical pain .
The past three years have been absolute hell and I think that second families are like a black sheep to the Government - there 's no protection for us in law , and no set rules in place to protect me or my family .
" The irony is that I have a great relationship with my older children 's father - he has access to them whenever he wants and we share the financial cost of bringing them up 50 - 50 .
" My children refer to Tom 's ex-wife as ' the mean lady ' .
They are utterly bewildered by her behaviour .
" We are being punished for being in love , while she appears to have short - term relationships which never seem to last more than a month .
It must be awful for her children . "
When Lucy Craft , a 39 - year - old teacher from Surrey , fell in love with John , a 47 - year - old pharmacist , she relished every moment of life as a soontobe stepmother .
" John 's sons are aged 11 and 13 , and I liked them immediately .
They got on well with my own son Lucas , who is 13 , and I just loved the Sunday mornings we would spend together , all sitting in bed watching TV and eating croissants , " she says .
" It felt like we were one big happy family and I relished every moment .
" But then I became engaged to John in 2005 , after a year together , and his former wife started to turn the boys against me .
When I gave them presents , she apparently told them : ' Do n't you dare be nice to that woman or take her gifts , ' and they stopped talking to me .
Whatever I said to them , they would ignore .
" They 're just kids - their loyalty obviously is to their mum and she is controlling them by saying they must not accept me .
It hurts me so much because I just want them to be happy and to make their father happy .
" His ex-wife is an extremely controlling person , and even though they are divorced she still wants to control him .
It 's hurtful for my parents , too - we used to take John 's sons to see them but now they wo n't talk to them , either .
" Christmas is awful , with all of us sitting around the table , and the boys ignoring me if I say anything , even ' pass the butter ' .
Then John gets angry and says : ' Stop behaving like this ! '
I feel as if I am being ripped down the middle , when I have done nothing wrong .
" The first time his ex-wife brought the boys to the old family home - where I was living with John - she said , ' I can see she is in my house , meaning me ' .
" Yet I know she does n't love him any more or want him back - he 's just a cheque book to her .
John has bought her a house , she has no money worries and she does n't have to work .
" My son copes by staying out of it - when the boys ignore him he just goes off and reads a book .
All he says to me is , ' I want you to be happy , mum ' .
" Dealing with John 's ex-wife is like playing an appalling game of poker , where you do n't know what move your opponent will make next - she is so full of contradictions .
" John is caught in the middle - and now she claims she will stop him seeing his children when we marry .
It would simply break his heart .
I 'm a member of a support group called the British Second Wives Club , and without their support I do not know what I would do .
" The only thing which keeps me going is love for John .
I have days when I sit with my head in my hands , wondering if all this agony is worth it , but I have to hang on to the fact that one day we will be together and it will all be worthwhile . "
But are mind games , undisguised hostility and the use of children as innocent pawns an inevitable result of our growing culture of divorce ?
Claire Halsey , 49 , is a consultant clinical psychologist who has worked with many families with separate homes and divided loyalties .
Claire - a stepmother and second wife herself - from Cheshire , says : ' There is a big difference between letting go of your adult relationship with a partner , and having someone else who you do n't know , and did n't choose , to be parenting your child for part of the time .
' When a new relationship starts and a new stepmother comes in , the mother has no control over who is now influencing their child 's life .
They feel powerless - and a mother 's basic instinct is to protect .
" Sometimes , mothers feel they do n't know what is going on in the new family unless they ask the children , and this leads to a terrible spiral of interrogation and family conflict .
" As a professional , I know that family - relationships after a break - up are more successful when the child retains a loving relationship with both parents - and crucially when the adult business is dealt with between the adults .
" But it is sometimes a lot to ask for people to put aside hurt emotions and act as adults - with or without children involved .
" Some ex-wives have been dislodged for a younger version , others may find new partners living in the homes that they themselves worked hard to make beautiful .
" Also , money worries add to the stress .
Statistically , single women usually come off financially worse after divorce .
" They tend to have continuing primary care of the children , which makes it hard to work full - time , and they often have had career breaks , so they are not as high up the career ladder or earning so much .
" It is important to remember that many stepfamilies do manage to have happy relationships - I am a step - parent myself and I was incredibly lucky that the children were very accepting and it worked out positively .
" But I see so much tension and conflict over second marriages during my work - and I know just how hard it can be to make these new relationships work for everyone concerned . "
Ellie Carmichael , a 39 - year - old secretary from North Yorkshire met her husband Michael , a 42 - year - old divorcee , through a dating agency three years ago .
She blames his ex-wife 's unhappiness for the hamster - wheel of bitterness and resentment which has been spinning ever since .
Ellie , who has an 18 - year - old daughter Chloe from her first marriage , says : " I 've never had a penny of financial support from my exhusband , which makes the behaviour of Michael 's ex-wife so hard to understand .
She seems to have no pride or self - respect , and it is one battle after another .
" We have been together for three years , married for a year , and it has been hell .
At the moment , it 's the quietest it has ever been , but I am permanently on tenterhooks , waiting for the next saga .
She 's been hugely unreasonable , greedy and manipulative , and it pains me to say it , but she seems to put money before the needs of her son .
" If Michael does n't immediately give her the money she asks for , she withholds his visiting rights and wo n't let him see his 12 - year - old son .
This is not only hurtful for Michael , but for Nicholas too , who feels very caught in the middle .
He 's a very sensitive boy and this must be tearing him apart .
" We have Nicholas every other weekend , but if she 's in a bad mood she says he 's ill , or she has made other plans .
Basically she is using him as a tool to get at Michael .
" I did n't break up the marriage - they had been living separately , within the same house , for a year before they even split .
It was a very big house , and they had their own bedroom and living room .
" Michael waited for two years before he applied for a divorce , and there was no contest .
" They split up because his wife had an affair - but unfortunately her lover then went back to his wife after she and Michael split , which means that she is now on her own and able to dedicate all her attention towards us .
I think her bitterness about this fuels her attitude towards us - she 's not happy , so she thinks we should n't be happy either .
" I actually feel quite sorry for her , as we are very happy together when we can forget about all this .
They had been married for 12 years before the split , and it's only now that he says he can understand what a happy marriage is .
" Michael pays for everything for her - the mortgage , all the bills , maintenance for his son , and maintenance for her .
She gets £ 300 a month just to spend on herself , for clothes and things like that .
She works fulltime , but he still pays for everything .
" We get bombarded with emails all the time - ' Nicholas needs new trainers .
Nicholas needs a hair - cut ' , which is fair enough , but Michael 's already paying his maintenance .
" He just pays up but it makes me seethe .
If we buy anything , she questions how we can afford it - I bought Michael a new DVD player and she said , ' How can you afford that ?'
" It 's as if we 're not allowed to spend money on ourselves .
Nicholas has everything he wants here , a PlayStation , a wardrobe full of clothes , but she says we are squandering money on ourselves and taking it away from him .
Honestly , you would laugh if it was n't so heartbreaking .
" I can't wait for the day when Nicholas is out of full - time education and Michael can just tell his ex-wife to get lost . "
Her sentiments , clearly , are ones that would be echoed by many women across the country .

Dr Pena indicated the path of the bullet that killed Clarkson
Dr Louis Pena said bruising suggested the barrel of a gun may have been forced into Ms Clarkson 's mouth before she was fatally shot in 2003 .
Ms Clarkson was a hopeful person with no history of depression or suicide attempts , he told the court .
Mr Spector , 67 , is accused of killing Ms Clarkson at his Hollywood mansion .
The defence says she shot herself .
It says she placed the gun in her mouth and pulled the trigger .
' Blunt - force trauma '
Dr Pena also told the court that there were bruises on Ms Clarkson 's right arm and wrist but could not confirm the cause of the marks .
Referring to the bruise on her tongue , he said it was " very unique and is consistent with blunt - force trauma .
Something struck the tongue " .
Dr Pena said there was no evidence that Ms Clarkson had been preparing to kill herself and that she died with a purse on one shoulder , which , he said , was not typical of a suicide .
" I found her to be a hopeful person from the notes I read , " he said .
Ms Clarkson had been taking two drugs generally given for depression at the time of her death , but her neurologist had prescribed them for her chronic headaches , Dr Pena said .
Lawyers for Mr Spector say Clarkson killed herself
Dr Pena conceded he was not an expert in gunshot residue or blood spatter and acknowledged he consulted textbooks in coming to his conclusions .
Mr Spector pioneered the " Wall of Sound " recording technique in the 60s , working with stars such as The Beatles , Tina Turner and The Righteous Brothers .
He is accused of killing is Ms Clarkson , 40 , on 3 February 2003 , hours after meeting her at the Sunset Strip nightclub House of Blues where she worked .
If convicted , Mr Spector faces between 15 years and life in prison .
“ The Court of Appeals , finally , drew the wrong conclusion from the risk of courts and patent examiners falling prey to hindsight bias .
A factfinder should be aware , of course , of the distortion caused by hindsight bias and must be cautious of arguments reliant upon ex post reasoning .
…
Rigid preventative rules that deny factfinders recourse to common sense , however , are neither necessary under our case law nor consistent with it . ” p. 17
The above passage is curious .
The mantra of avoiding “ hindsight bias ” has , in general , been directed to the analysis of the ultimate question of obviousness – which as everyone knows is a question of law , not fact .
The KSR Court noted that Graham itself warned against a “ temptation to read into the prior art the teachings of the invention in issue . ”
And the TSM test was intended to prevent the use of “ hindsight bias . ”
But , there seems to be a disconnect here .
On the one hand , Graham talks about how the so - called “ secondary considerations ” of nonobviousness help to avoid the use of hindsight , and “ to resist the temptation to read into the prior art the teachings of the invention in issue . ”
But , it seems to me that there are two different issues involved here .
When the Graham court refers to avoiding the use of hindsight , it seems to me that they were referring to the use of hindsight in deciding the ultimate legal question of obviousness .
The part about not reading the teachings of the invention into the prior art goes to an earlier step in the process – determining the scope and content of the prior art ( which is a factual , not legal , undertaking ) .
The improper use of hindsight is usually not an issue during that step of the analysis .
As for the TSM test , its purpose was to prevent the use of hindsight bias during the final step of the obviousness analysis – determining , as a matter of law , the ultimate question of obviousness based upon the earlier factual determinations .
But , the question of what a particular reference taught or suggested was still viewed by the Federal Circuit ( at least so they said ) as a factual determination to be made by the factfinder .
So , if a strict application of TSM is no longer permitted , where is the line drawn between the obligations of the factfinder and those of the court ?
The KSR Court talks about how rigid application of TSM will “ deny factfinders recourse to common sense . ”
But , how does the factfinder exercise their “ common sense ” on the issue of obviousness without crossing the line into the realm of determining the ultimate LEGAL issue of obviousness ?
The KSR Court clearly states that the factfinder should be permitted to use their common sense , but where do factfinders do this within the framework of the obviousness analysis ?

I 've started writing something I hope will be an ebook called Take Control of SSH .
It 's an amazingly long process , so here 's an excerpt -- the coolest trick , which initially made me want to write about SSH .
This is for all those of you ( us ) who support family and friends remotely .
If you 'd like to read the rest , please vote for Take Control of SSH .
Reverse Tunnel ( Meet in the Middle )
This is a somewhat strange but very powerful feature .
One of the problems with modern - day networking is that most computers are protected behind firewalls and / or Network Address Translation ( NAT ) , meaning it may not be possible to connect directly to the computer you want to reach .
For example , I sometimes want to remotely control my father 's PowerBook to help with a problem , but he has a private dynamic address , behind an AirPort Extreme base station which itself has another dynamic address and provides NAT .
Even if my father told me his IP address and his base station 's address , I would n't be able to reach his PowerBook .
Reverse tunneling works around this by allowing him to " project " a tunnel to another computer .
If I can reach that computer , the tunnel connects back to his computer .
Because he establishes the reverse tunnel from his computer as a client , he does n't have trouble with ( Network Address Translation ) NAT , and he does n't even have to know his own IP address .
For reverse tunneling to work , my father and I both need access to a computer running sshd .
In this example , my PowerBook is called pb , his is called dad , and the server is www.reppep.com .
Note that reverse tunneling provides access to the tunneling computer , and so could be a violation of network security policies .
The tunnel is restricted ( only accessible from the gateway computer , or other systems with access to it ) , but it is important to check with the network administrators before implementing a reverse tunnel .
In addition , reverse tunneling is fairly complicated .
A simpler option is to make SSH directly accessible , but unfortunately this often cannot be arranged .
If you 'd like to read more about configuring dynamic DNS and firewalls for direct SSH access , please vote for Take Control of SSH .
To use Remote Desktop through a reverse tunnel and an intermediate system , there are several steps ( this can be simplified if the client is directly on the Internet and accessible via ssh ) .
There might be as many as 3 separate encryption / decryption cycles in this scenario , but performance is generally decent .
These instructions were originally written for Apple Remote Desktop 2 , but apply equally to Remote Desktop 3 .
Generally , I strongly suggest connecting with Remote Desktop 3's " Encrypt all network data ( more secure ) " option , but in this case it does n't do quite what is needed , and would only add a redundant extra layer of encryption .
On the computer to be controlled ( dad in this example ) , make sure Apple Remote Desktop is enabled in System Preferences : Sharing : Services .
On the computer to be controlled ( dad ) , open a couple ports on the server and point them at the ssh and VNC servers on dad , by typing the following into a Terminal window .
The sleep command ensures the tunnels will be accessible for at least an hour -- they stay open automatically while in use : ssh -R 6900:127.0.0.1:5900 - R 6922:127.0.0.1:22 www.reppep.com sleep 3600
On the machine running Remote Desktop.app ( pb in this example ) , set up tunnels to those ports on the server : ssh -C - L 6900:127.0.0.1:6900 - L 6922:127.0.0.1:6922 -o HostKeyAlias= dad www.reppep.com
Now you can log into dad with : ssh -p 6922 www.reppep.com
Alternatively , you can connect to 127.0.0.1:6900 with Remote Desktop ( or port 6900 / display 1000 in a VNC client ) , and control dad .
Note that if the firewall in Mac OS X ( non- Server ) is on , and any services are enabled in System Preferences : Sharing : Services , the appropriate network ports are automatically opened in the firewall , accessible to the entire Internet ; this is overly exposed .
OpenSSH can be restricted with TCP Wrapper ; the Apple Remote Desktop agent ( which is a VNC server at its core ) cannot ; VineServer has an option to only listen on the loopback address , so external hosts cannot connect -- or even detect the presence of a VNC server -- without first establishing an ssh tunnel .
http://www.redstonesoftware.com/products/vine/server/
To make this easier for my father , I made sure he uses the same login name on www.reppep.com as on dad , and I gave him a double - clickable file ( ssh- tunnel.command ) to run step # 2 ( the part he has to do each time I 'm going to help him ) , in his Dock , to establish the ssh tunnel .
Files ending with .command are automatically executed by Terminal when opened in Mac OS X .
To see what TCP ports are accepting connections , use " netstat - an | grep LIST " .
Step # 2 creates tunnels on the server 's ports 6900 & 6922 ( connected back to dad ) , and step # 3 opens the same port numbers on the client ( pb ) , tunneled to the server .

How to Debate a Point How to Debate a Point Even if you are in an office job , debate skills are vital elements to climbing up any job market ( corporate , medical , or educational ) .
Some people are better debaters than others .
Consequently , they go into fields such as law or sales .
Still , debating points is integral to improving your professional situation .
You will need to know how to debate a point to increase your salary , you will need to debate a point to get the best position you deserve , the best desk , the best hours , the best clients , and so on .
Even if your work takes you to places that argumentative skills are extraneous , they will always help you in your job pursuits .
Perhaps you will need to debate a point just to get the job .
You must convince an employer that you are the best candidate for the job in order to secure it and move up in the corporation ( or school or hospital ) .
Follow these few steps to create a strong " point " or argument .
From this point on , we will refer to a " point " as an argument or a theme .
Research all information around " the point . "
Pick a side to debate .
There are always two ( or more ) ideas to a debate or points to argue .
You must select one viewpoint and follow it through .
If you are a little iffy on your argument , it will appear in your debate .
You do not even have to agree with your argument , you just must commit to it in order to create a strong debate .
Once you have researched both sides to a point , you must begin creating your debate .
Like an essay , a debate point is a formulaic .
It has an introduction , evidence , and a conclusion .
The main difference is that most debates are oral .
You speak in public , sometimes extemporaneously .
Your point must have an introduction , but not a flowery introduction .
Usually , you just jump to the point .
You can open with a general thought or anecdote , but do not veer too far from the subject matter or else people will start fidgeting .
They will not listen to your debate .
Gather at least three pieces of evidence .
Have them prepared ahead of time .
You may not use them all while speaking .
However , you will always have more the enough information to fall back on if there is an uncomfortable silence .
Conclude your debate by disproving the opponent 's point .
You will then reaffirm the certitude of your point by repeating your thesis statement aloud .
While debates are usually oral , here are a few tips to follow in order to appear calm and collected and prepared .
Confidence is vital in debate .
Your presentation , speech , and appearance matter almost as much as your delivery and your content .
Dress appropriately
Have notes prepared .
You do not want your debate to be an oral presentation of a written essay .
Practice speaking aloud in front of a mirror and then in front of other people
Understand both sides of the debate so that you are prepared to contradict the other side .
Be ready to concede small points .
It does not matter if you lose many little battles , so long as you win the war .
Remember , debates are just like essays .
There is a thesis ( central argument ) , several pieces of evidence , and a conclusion .
The main difference in a debate is the presentation .
You are not reading aloud a written essay .
You are presenting a theme , an argument , a point orally .
You must convince the opponent that you are correct and he or she is incorrect .
You do this by appearing confident , disproving the opponent 's point , and overpowering your points .
It is vital to understand all sides of an issue so that you can disprove your opponent 's point .
This difference is where debating a point differs the most from writing an essay .
San Francisco
AMERICAN playgrounds often seem anything but playful .
Their equipment is designed not so much to let children have fun as to make sure they do n’t hurt themselves .
Sure , a simple sandbox and climbing gym are enough to mesmerize toddlers .
But what ’s to lure older children ?
No wonder children aged 8 to 12 — the “ tweens ” — have abandoned playgrounds en masse for instant messaging .
Playgrounds were originally conceived as places to raise future citizens in a social democracy , according to Roy Kozlovsky , an architectural historian , but now they seem geared more toward facilitating easy parental supervision .
Well - meaning efforts to reduce the risk of injury have overwhelmed opportunities for self - expression and creativity .
The idea of a playground as what Mr. Kozlovsky calls a “ pure place ” persists , but increasingly , it is also an empty place .
Hope may be on the horizon .
We seem to be witnessing , if not a tipping point , then a seesaw tilt in playground design .
The slide - swing set - sandbox - seesaw - repeat model is giving way , in some places , to approaches like slickly engineered skate parks , portable performance spaces and do - it - yourself activity centers .
Instead of fostering the repetitive motor skills that are essential milestones for a toddler but mind - numbingly dull for a 9 - or 10 - year - old , these new spaces seek to stimulate the imagination ( and the metabolism ) by encouraging exploration and free play .
I knew I wanted her the minute I saw her .
She was beautiful , radiant , clad totally in black , hanging out on the other side of the the hardware department at Fry's .
I did n't have a lot of experience back then , and I was nervous about approaching her .
I did n't want to embarass myself in front of her and everybody else .
A kid who looked like he was about 16 was at my feet , trying to stock the shelf I was standing in front of .
Once it became obvious I was n't going to move over because I had n't noticed him , he stood up to see what I was staring at .
It was her .
" She 's a piece of work , huh ? " he said .
" Yeah ... "
I sighed , before realizing what I was saying .
" I mean , uh ... "
I stammered , before finally settling on a quiet " uh , yeah . "
" The sad thing is , " he said , " if you get her , you 'll be sick of her in a year . "
" No way !
She 's beautiful , " I argued .
" How could you ever get sick of looking at that ? "
The kid looked at me for a minute , then shrugged .
" It 's not just about looks , dude , " he said , then returned to marking boxes of printers at my feet with a price gun .
" At first , she 'll make you feel like you can do anything .
You 'll feel like the coolest guy on earth having her near you .
And then , little by little , you 'll start to notice things you do n't like about her .
Stupid things , like she 's not bright enough , or she 's too loud , or something petty like that .
And over time , you 'll start to resent those things , even though she was like that all along .
It 's just that you do n't notice it right away .
After a while , you 'll get so used to how she looks , and being hot wo n't be enough for you anymore . "
He finished up with the price gun and stood up to walk away .
" I 've seen it before man , " he told me , putting his hand on my shoulder comfortingly .
" A year .
Then you 're sick of her . "
I knew he was right .
I knew that , even if I somehow managed to get her , I 'd be checking out others within a few months .
I hated the kid for spoiling my fantasy , and I hated myself because I knew he was right .
I felt so shallow .
But I went ahead and got her , anyway .
I needed a new laptop .
Tidbits & Shockers @ Intel
We recently had the opportunity to eke some news out from the boys at Intel .
We talked about upcoming stuff like Bearlake , DDR3 and future processors like Wolfdale and Penryn which will debut later this year .
But the biggest shocker is what Intel intends to do about 3D graphics .
Join us for some tidbits and shockers as we chew on the Intel grapevine .
Bearlake & DDR3
With the imminent debut of the new Bearlake ( x3 x ) chipset on June 4 , Intel will be aggressively pushing DDR3 .
The first series of Bearlake motherboards will offer DDR2 slots , but Intel wants to encourage a " quicker " transition to DDR3 .
So , expect DDR3 motherboards and DDR3 modules to debut early and in relative abundance too .
Memory manufacturers will all fall in line .
After all , they are expected to continue losing money until the middle of next year , as far as DDR2 is concerned .
What better way to improve profitability than to move to DDR3 ?
However , just how fast DDR3 picks up will depend on availability and more importantly , cost .
No matter how hard Intel pushes , ultimately consumers will decide if the transition to DDR3 is worth the cost and hassle .
Wolfdale & Yorkfield
Intel 's 45 nm process and the Penryn family will debut in Q3 of this year with the release of the Wolfdale processor .
The Wolfdale is the successor to the current Core 2 Duo ( Conroe ) processor .
It will have two processor cores with 6MB of shared L2 cache and a 1.33 GHz FSB .
The quad - core Yorkfield and the mobile Penryn processor will only debut in Q4 , 2007 or Q1 , 2008 .
The Yorkfield will be the Core 2 Extreme QX6700 - equivalent of the Wolfdale processor .
It will consist of two Wolfdale dies on a single processor , with two separate 6MB L2 cache and a 1.33 GHz FSB .
CPU Graphics
Probably the most shocking news on the grapevine is the not - so - subtle hint that Intel will be a LOT more serious about 3D graphics .
Although they may eventually offer discrete graphics solutions , like what NVIDIA and ATI are doing right now , they are actually looking to integrate the graphics circuitry within the processor itself !
Now , Intel is no stranger to integrated graphics .
Their chipsets have always offered integrated graphics solutions , which have proven to be robust and functional , if nothing else .
In fact , the new Graphics Media Acceleration X3100 was just launched for the new Centrino Duo and Centrino Pro platforms .
However , integrating graphics into the CPU itself is a totally different cup of tea .
It will be a new feat for Intel and potential cause for concern for ATI and NVIDIA .
Even if these CPUs cannot offer the same cutting - edge performance as the GeForce 8800 Ultra or the upcoming Radeon HD 2900 XT , they will still cut into the OEM graphics market which is where the big money lies .
We are unable to obtain much details on these CPUs with integrated graphics but our source did not refute the possibility that the graphics core might come with some very fast onboard RAM .
It stands to reason though that the graphics core will make use of system RAM for most , if not all , of its framebuffer and texturing requirements .
These CPUs with integrated graphics will be manufactured on the 45nm process and will debut after Wolfdale is launched in Q3 , 2007 .
So , we should expect Intel to possibly launch these CPUs in Q4 , 2007 or Q1 , 2008 .
Questions & Comments
Please feel free to post your questions or comments here !
Winston Churchill called him “ one of the noblest Americans who ever lived , ” and Theodore Roosevelt called him “ the very greatest of all the great captains that the English - speaking peoples have brought forth . ”
But has political correctness turned Robert E. Lee into a villain ?
That will be the question explored by six historians this weekend at a symposium commemorating the bicentennial of the Confederate commander ’s birth .
“ We were afraid that Lee would not receive the honors he should get because of the prevailing political correctness , ” says Brag Bowling , a Richmond resident who helped organize Saturday ’s event at the Key Bridge Marriott Hotel in Arlington .
The symposium will be the largest event of its kind this year honoring Lee , who was born Jan. 19 , 1807 .
The event site was chosen in part to be near the former Lee family home in Arlington ( which now overlooks Arlington National Cemetery ) .
He and his wife , Mary Custis Lee , were married there in 1831 , and Mrs.
Lee inherited her grandfather ’s mansion on his death in 1857 .
The symposium site was chosen because of its proximity to Washington .
“ We wanted to take this to the nation ’s capital , ” says Mr. Bowling , a national board member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans , which is hosting the symposium .
More than 200 have registered to attend .
“ They ’re coming in from all over the country , ” he says .
“ I had one phone call … from some guy in Norway .
We ’ve got people coming from California , Texas , Massachusetts — all over the country , and from Canada . ”
Lee , the son of Revolutionary War hero “ Light Horse Harry ” Lee , was born in Westmoreland County , Va. , and graduated from West Point .
He served more than 30 years in the U.S. Army , distinguishing himself in the Mexican War as an aide to Gen. Winfield Scott .
Lee , who freed the slaves his wife inherited from the Custis family , called slavery “ a moral and political evil ” and opposed secession .
After Virginia seceded in 1861 , he resigned his commission in the U.S.
Army rather than bear arms against “ my native state . ”
Hostility to Confederate heritage “ has really gotten bad in the last decade , ” says Mr. Bowling , who says that political correctness in academia and in the press often leads to “ dishonoring Confederate soldiers and ignoring the true reasons why the South wished to secede . ”
Such hostility is based on a misunderstanding of the political background of the war , says Thomas DiLorenzo , who will speak at Saturday ’s symposium .
“ It ’s hard for people to understand Lee ’s legacy unless they understand the political philosophy that he held and that informed him as to why he was fighting , ” says Mr. DiLorenzo , a professor of economics at Baltimore ’s Loyola College .
“ Lee was a military man , so he very seldom said anything about politics .
But after the war , he did . ”
Lee saw the war as “ a continuation of the battle between the Hamiltonian consolidationists and the Jeffersonian decentralists , ” says Mr. DiLorenzo , referring to the “ remarkable correspondence ” between Lee and British statesman Lord John Acton in 1866 .
In a letter to Acton , Lee referred to the writings of Jefferson and Washington and warned that “ the consolidation of the states into one vast republic , sure to be aggressive abroad and despotic at home , will be the certain precursor of that ruin which has overwhelmed all those that have preceded . ”
Lee ’s letter was “ a very eloquent expression of the Jeffersonian philosophy of the Constitution … and I think it tells us a lot about why he believed he was fighting this war , ” Mr. DiLorenzo says .
Joining Mr. DiLorenzo at the symposium will be author Kent Masterson Brown , historian John J. Dwyer , Donald Livingston of Emory University , novelist Thomas Moore and Clyde Wilson of the University of South Carolina .
Robert Krick , former chief historian at Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park , will speak at a banquet Saturday evening .
“ We have people who are going to make you think , ” Mr. Bowling says .
“ When you leave this seminar , you ’re going to say , ‘ That ’s a really unique way of looking at things .
I have n’t thought of it like that before . ’ ”
The official sponsor of Saturday ’s symposium is the S.D. Lee Institute , which was begun in 2005 as the “ academic wing ” of the Sons of Confederate Veterans , Mr. Bowling says .
The institute is named for Confederate Lt. Gen. Stephen Dill Lee ( no relation to Robert E. Lee ) , who at a 1906 SCV gathering declared : “ To you , Sons of Confederate Veterans , we will commit the vindication of the cause for which we fought . ”
Mr. Bowling hopes the Arlington symposium “ will be the blueprint for other S.D. Lee seminars around the country . ”
Nationally , the Sons of Confederate Veterans enrolls 30,000 members who are descendants of those who served in the Confederate military services .
“ There are tons and tons of people who are proud to be Southerners and proud of their Confederate heritage , ” says Mr. Bowling .
“ We ’ve taken polls and we have overwhelming support in Virginia , but you ’d never know it , to read the newspapers . ”

Being a living Elisp virtual machine , Emacs naturally provides the ability to evaluate any Elisp expression anywhere .
Just put the cursor right after the expression to be evaluated and press C - xC-e : the result appears in the mini-buffer .
I use this continuously , for instance while reading about a variable to know its value .
For instance , imagine i see this line in one of my files :
( setq planner - project " planner " )
and want to know if planner - project has been modified .
I just need to put my cursor right after the variable name and get its value with C - xC-e .
As i said , C - xC-e works in any ( well , almost ) buffer .
Imagine you ’re writing a note and need to perform an arithmetic operation : you could write something like
Yesterday I spent (+ 2234.34 3423.4 (* 12.0 12.2 ) 10 ) dollars at ...
put the cursor just before ‘ dollars ’ , press the eval shortcut , and see the result of the arithmetic operation in the mini-buffer .
You memorize it , delete the Elisp expression … hmm , wait , this should be easier , should n’t it ?
What we want is Emacs to eval and replace the expression for us .
I ’m sure that you already know what comes next 🙂
As it happens , this time i did n’t need to write the Elisp snippet myself : i stole it instead from Jorgen “ forcer ” Schäfer ’s configuration file :
( defun fc - eval - and - replace ( ) " Replace the preceding sexp with its value . " ( interactive ) ( backward - kill - sexp ) ( prin1 ( eval ( read ( current - kill 0 ) ) ) ( current - buffer ) ) )
Complemented with the mandatory shortcut :
( global - set - key ( kbd " C-c e " ) ' fc-eval - and - replace )
this little gem has probably the highest usefulness to lines of code ratio in my Elisp toolbox .
Give it a try !
Update : pdq notes in a comment that , if the expression to be evaluated is malformed ( like , say , ( +1 1 ) ) it gets deleted , and it would be nice if it would n’t .
A quick way to get this functionality is to catch errors in eval and undo the killing in a generic error handler .
To wit :
( defun fc - eval - and - replace ( ) " Replace the preceding sexp with its value . " ( interactive ) ( backward - kill - sexp ) ( condition - case nil ( prin1 ( eval ( read ( current - kill 0 ) ) ) ( current - buffer ) ) ( error ( message " Invalid expression " ) ( insert ( current - kill 0 ) ) ) ) )
Divorce seems an unusual topic for economists , but decisions to end a marriage weigh costs and benefits and thus reflect economic reasoning .
Justin Wolfers and Betsey Stevenson , both assistant professors of economics at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania , have led the creation of new studies , which are surveyed in their working paper “ Marriage and Divorce : Changes and Their Driving Forces . ”
The evidence suggests that married people — especially married men — are better off than the unmarried .
But this does n’t mean that everyone should marry , or that no one should divorce .
Sometimes a marriage no longer makes sense , or it did n’t make sense in the first place .
In the year after a separation , most people report being less happy , at least in one major study based on British data .
Nonetheless , one year after the divorce , both men and women are happier for their decisions ( Jonathan Gardner , a business consultant , and Andrew J. Oswald , an economics professor at the University of Warwick , “ Do Divorcing Couples Become Happier By Breaking Up ? ” ) .
In the United States , the availability of divorce has increased with unilateral divorce , which allows either member of the couple to dissolve the union .
The change has been associated with lower rates of female suicide and domestic violence , and fewer wives murdered by their husbands .
Unilateral divorce shifts the bargaining power to the person who is getting less out of the marriage and thus is most likely to leave .
The partner getting more from the marriage has to work harder to keep the other person around , which can be good for the marriage and good for the couple .
In other words , unilateral divorce benefits victims and potential victims .
The movement of waves in Saturn 's rings offers clues to activity and conditions within the planet .
This natural - color view of Saturn was taken from 764,000 miles ( 1.2 million kilometers ) away .
The Cassini spacecraft has captured a fresh view of Saturn from high above the planet 's gorgeous rings and also provided a stunning video of its travels through the ring plane .
The robotic probe has climbed to higher and higher inclinations over the past several months , providing looks at the planet and rings that scientists have eagerly awaited .
" Finally , here are the views that we 've waited years for , " said Carolyn Porco , Cassini imaging team leader at the Space Science Institute in Boulder , Colo .
" Sailing high above Saturn and seeing the rings spread out beneath us like a giant , copper medallion is like exploring an alien world we 've never seen before .
It just does n't look like the same place .
It 's so utterly breath - taking , it almost gives you vertigo . "
The new photograph shows the rings from a 40 - degree angle on high .
The video shows the rings as they appeared to Cassini while it sped from south to north , rapidly crossing the ring plane .
When the rings are seen edge - on in the video , they disappear .
Saturn 's rings are thought to have been created about 100 million years ago when a comet or asteroid struck a moon orbiting the giant planet .
They are 150,000 miles wide and just a tens of yards thick .
They are made mostly of water ice , which makes them shimmer with reflected sunlight , but they contain some mud , too .
Cassini's highly inclined orbits around Saturn will be progressively lowered so that , by late June - three years after entering orbit - the spacecraft will once more be orbiting in the ring plane .
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
The EU report said the US had operated 1,245 flights
The UK , Germany and Italy were among 14 states which allowed the US to forcibly remove terror suspects , lawmakers said .
The EU parliament voted to accept a resolution condemning member states which accepted or ignored the practice .
The EU report said the CIA had operated 1,245 flights , some taking suspects to states where they could face torture .
The report was adopted by a large majority , with 382 MEPs voting in favour , 256 against and 74 abstaining .
Vigilance
The final version denounces the lack of co-operation of many EU member states and it condemns the actions of secret services and governments who accepted and concealed renditions .
We must be vigilant that what has been happening in the past five years may never happen again
Giovanni Fava
Italian Socialist MEP and report author
Tales of torture Rendition or rights ?
It is unlikely , the report says , that European governments were unaware of rendition activities on their territory , something the British government , among others , has denied .
" This is a report that does n't allow anyone to look the other way .
We must be vigilant that what has been happening in the past five years may never happen again , " said Italian Socialist Giovanni Fava , who drafted the document .
The parliament also called for an " independent inquiry " to be considered and for closure of the US ' Guantanamo Bay detention camp .
Human rights campaigning group Amnesty International welcomed the EU lawmakers ' vote , but urged member states to carry out independent investigations .
Revealing facts
Although the report has no force in EU law , Mr Fava said during the parliamentary debate that the related investigation , over a year , had uncovered much new evidence .
EU STATES INVOLVED Austria Belgium Cyprus Denmark Germany Greece Ireland Italy Poland Portugal Romania Spain Sweden United Kingdom
Key excerpts of report
Many of those taken from EU states were subjected to torture to extract information from them , the report said .
It said there was a " strong possibility " that this intelligence had been passed on to EU governments who were aware of how it was obtained .
It also uncovered the use of secret detention facilities used as the flights made their journey across Europe towards countries such as Afghanistan .
It was not possible to contradict evidence or suggestions that secret detention centres were operated in Poland and Romania , the report said .
' Incommunicado detention '
Centre - right MEPs - the largest group in parliament - have been highly critical of the report , saying it is primarily motivated by anti-Americanism .
EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini said the commission would act on the truth , even if it were uncomfortable or unpalatable .
But he called for a relaunching of the Euro - Atlantic relationship and said Europe must continue to work with its US partners .
During the course of their investigation , delegations of MEPs travelled to countries including Romania , Poland , the UK , the US and Germany to investigate claims of European involvement in so - called extraordinary renditions .
The governments of Austria , Italy , Poland , Portugal and the UK were criticised for their " unwillingness to co-operate " with investigators .
The report defines extraordinary renditions as instances where " an individual suspected of involvement in terrorism is illegally abducted , arrested and / or transferred into the custody of US officials and / or transported to another country for interrogation which , in the majority of cases involves incommunicado detention and torture " .
STOCKHOLM , Sweden – Last Jan. 1 , almost on a whim , 35 - year - old IT manager Rickard Falkvinge got into politics .
Concerned about the reach of copyright and patent law , Falkvinge erected a web page with a sign - up form for a radical new pro-piracy party to compete in Sweden 's parliamentary system .
He did n't know if anyone would care , but the next day the national media picked it up , and two days later international media started calling .
The site was flooded with new members – enough for the nascent movement to sail past the requirements for participation in the national election .
Falkvinge now faced a decision : stay with his nice job and let the whole thing quietly sink , or quit and become a campaigning politician .
He chose to become the leader of Sweden 's newest and fastest - growing political party : Piratpartiet , or the Pirate Party .
Special Report : The Pirate Kings of Sweden Secrets of the Pirate Bay
Efforts to sink the word 's largest BitTorrent tracker have backfired into political scandal , and spurred even more downloading .
But the three guys behind the Pirate Bay are facing a national controversy of their own .
A Nation Divided over Piracy
The Pirate Bay survives , and politicians and entertainment lawyers confront a youth movement that embraces file sharing .
Who would have thought Sweden would end up the internet 's free content haven ?
Gallery : The Faces of Sweden 's Pirate Wars
The Evidence ( .zip )
Did the Motion Picture Association ask Swedish politicians to illegally intercede with law enforcement ?
Read the docs and decide for yourself .
Striding through the narrow , cobbled streets of Gamla Stan , Falkvinge looks nothing like a politician in his " Pirat " baseball cap and polo shirt .
" We have a lot in common with the environmental movement , " he says .
Where environmentalists see destruction of natural resources , the pirates see culture at risk .
" ( We ) saw a lot of hidden costs to society in the way companies maximize their copyright . "
Falkvinge is interrupted by a passing teenager .
She 's a young punk , with green dreads and a jacket covered in an indistinguishable combination of angry quips and band names – in short , exactly the type who once would have spent her disposable income on music .
She takes out a piece of notebook paper and asks Falkvinge for an autograph .
Lawyers , academics and pirates agree : File sharing is an institution here .
Sweden has faster broadband with deeper penetration than just about anywhere in the world .
That , combined with the techno - friendly attitude that pervades Scandinavia and a government slow to take any kind of action , allowed file sharing to root deeply in practice and popular culture .
In March , game show contestant Petter Nilsson won the politically themed Top Candidates show by delivering speeches supporting file sharing , and committing to donating 20 percent of his $ 30,000 winning to the Pirate Bay .
A cultural minister from a southern Sweden municipality admitted in June to the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet that he downloaded music on a daily basis , and called for more adults to " come out of the file - sharing closet . "
Last May 's raid on the Pirate Bay sparked street protests and cyberattacks on government websites .
But it was the spike in the Pirate Party 's numbers after the raid that might have the most lasting consequences for Sweden .
Membership shot past the nation 's Green Party , which holds 17 seats in the Riksdag , Sweden 's parliament .
There 's no guarantee that membership will translate into votes , but the pirates have raised enough funds to print 3 million ballots for next month 's election , and they have enough volunteers to get them out to all the polling places .
This week , the Pirate Party broke out its own version of a chicken in every pot when it endorsed a low - cost , encrypted anonymizing service offered by a Swedish communications company called Relakks .
For 5 euros a month , a portion of which goes to the party , anyone can share files or communicate from a Relakks IP address in Sweden , potentially complicating efforts to track downloaders .
The party endorsement generated enough interest to cause performance issues on the new service .
Falkvinge may be learning the ropes of glad - handing and political speechmaking , but a guileless fan boy slips out when I introduce him to the founders of Piratbyran – the pro-piracy group that created the Pirate Bay in 2003 , and inspired Falkvinge 's foray into renegade politics .
He introduces the punk girl that recognized him to co-founder Rasmus Fleischer with a hurried explanation – " Piratbyran , Piratbryan ! " – and Fleischer soon finds himself autographing another piece of notebook paper , looking confused .
Piratbyran , or " Pirate Bureau , " is hard to nail down as an organization .
It is best described as an ad hoc pro-piracy think tank , but Fleischer 's partner in the effort , Marcus Kaarto , wo n't even go that far .
" We 're like a gas , " Kaarto says , laughing .
" You ca n't get a hold on us . "
Founded in 2003 , Piratbyran is older than the Pirate Bay and the Pirate Party .
The group has 58,000 members registered on its website , but its structure is informal , and no one seems to know exactly how much money it has .
It gets by on donations , including contributions through the Pirate Bay – with which it is no longer officially affiliated .
Kaarto and Fleischer are n't the typical think tank or political types .
Fleischer is a classically trained musician and former leftist journalist ; Kaarto plays poker for a living .
They are comfortable and funny twenty - somethings in cargo shorts , dark T - shirts and imprecise haircuts – blending artist and geek in a way that is uniquely European .
They walk me around Soder , the island in the middle of Stockholm that went from working class to gentrified bohemian in the ' 80s .
Eventually we land in Medborgarplatsen , a square that hosts Stockholm 's large communist May Day demonstration every year , and entertainment / retail the rest of the time .
This night it 's full of cafe - goers , and posters advertising the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie – a film destined to break box office records and top the downloading charts at the same time .
Over the din , Fleischer says the Piratbyran 's message is n't so much about fighting the copyfight as explaining to the other side that they 've already lost .
" Their business model wo n't work with digital technology , " he says .
In Fleischer 's world , the Motion Picture Association of America and rights holders are attacking digital technology itself , trying to hang on to an outdated model .
" It 's an inevitability that digital data will be copied ....
The alternative to peer - to - peer piracy is person - to - person piracy , " he says .
While some online pirates take pains to distinguish themselves from those who sell counterfeit DVDs and CDs , he sees such physical bootlegging as just " a symptom of underdeveloped computer networks . "
When asked about compensation for artists , both men reject the language itself .
No artist sits down to " create content , " Fleischer says .
" Culture has always been heterogeneous , " and money is only one way of rewarding creativity .
The idea of a rights holder , like a record label or movie studio , that patronizes and distributes human creativity is , for Fleischer , " a very strange utopia that has never existed . "
But Piratbyran is not dedicated to copyright or patent abolition – it has no legislative agenda .
It holds a nuanced view of the created work itself : Each work must find its own social and economic niche .
" I do n't think of this ( as ) the big battle , " says Fleischer , " but thousands of microbattles . "
Part of the surprise of Sweden is how far this approach has gotten them .
Kaarto and Fleischer are quoted in the press frequently , often accorded the same respect a law professor would receive in the United States .
Last year the pair co-edited Copy Me , a collection of essays about intellectual property ; the first run of 2,300 sold out , and another is on its way .
Their positions find fertile ground in politics and public opinion .
Piracy is the subject of serious debate here , rather than crime - busting press releases .
And copyright 's defenders find themselves in an uphill battle for the soul of the nation .
Attorney Monique Wadsted , the MPAA 's representative here , has the hardest job in Sweden – not just to try to enforce copyright under an indifferent and occasionally hostile regime , but to convince the average Swede that file sharing is wrong .
She meets me in a corner conference room in her office high above a square full of Scandinavian hipsters and the punky goth kids of Stockholm .
With a knit brow , she explains that she never expected Sweden to become a rogue nation .
" ( It 's ) become a copyright haven , a territory where you spread everything without fear of prosecution , " Wadsted says .
Wadsted knows Fleischer – she recently stood in a public debate with him at the formal opening of Sweden 's election campaign season .
She was not impressed .
" Nobody has ever presented a good argument why this should be free ....
They like to talk about music ; they have a problem with ( talking about ) movies , because movies cost a lot to make . "
Movies are Wadsted 's passion , as well as her job , and she seems prepared to throw herself bodily between the medium she loves and the pirates who threaten its financial lifeblood .
As a child , " I would see ( movies ) with my family ... or sneak off to see them on my own , all the time , " she says .
And if file sharing and the Pirate Bay had existed when she was young ?
She confesses she does n't know if she'd have been a downloader herself .
" Would I have known any better at 14 ? " she muses , leaving the question unanswered .
What 's certain is she 'd like to see the Pirate Bay 's crew in jail .
The copyright fight is getting tense in Sweden .
Wadsted speaks emotionally of threats made against her and anti-piracy spokesman Henrik Pontien .
She says her address has appeared online , accompanied by talk of firebombing .
Ugly suggestions have been made against Pontien and his children .
Wadsted says she knew she was opening herself up for criticism by becoming the public face of the MPAA in Sweden , but the experience has clearly frightened and shocked her .
The Pirate Bay 's crew has n't been spared much from the other side .
They 've been called gang members , terrorists and even child pornographers .
While they laugh whenever the subject comes up , they too seem incredulous that the debate has come to this point .
There 's no evidence that extremists on either side will take violent action , but the idea that a previously obscure area of law excites such fanatical rhetoric was unthinkable before file sharing .
Sweden stands at a crossroads .
" There will be many Pirate Bays if this case does n't succeed , " says Marianne Levin , professor of private law and intellectual property at the University of Stockholm .
Everyone – pirates and lawyers and politicians – agrees : Sweden probably wo n't continue to be friendly ground for overt pirates if the Pirate Bay is convicted .
That 's the point of pursuing its operators .
But even with a victory in court , Levin and her doctoral research students acknowledge that Swedish file sharing is n't going to stop .
They talk a lot about alternatives : mitigation and compromise .
One oft - proposed solution would levy a tax on internet access that would be redistributed to artists – but as distinctions between professionals and amateurs get more fuzzy , it 's harder to make such a system fair .
A tax would also mean more payouts to the porn industry than is politically feasible , points out legal researcher Viveca Still , a faculty member at the Institute of International Economic Law in Helsinki , Finland .
That 's one reason Still joins many academics in advocating a technological solution : digital rights management , or DRM , in which music and movie players – software or hardware – would simply refuse to cooperate with pirates .
But a strict DRM regime has problems , too :
For one , it would require hard - coded limits on digital technology itself .
" This would lead to outlawing digital technology ... the Turing machine ( itself ) , " says Piratbyran 's Kaarto .
This is a price too high for society to pay to protect intellectual property , according to DRM opponents .
If piracy 's foes offer flawed solutions , Sweden 's pirates concede that their own vision is n't utopian .
Parting with many copyright minimalists in the United States , Piratbyran acknowledges that file sharing can do real harm to rights holders .
When Kaarto and Fleischer discuss this aspect of their movement , their flippancy fades , and their mood becomes reflective .
Fleischer tells the story of Swedish jazz in 1962 .
When pop music came to Sweden , it hit hard enough that in a single summer most of Sweden 's jazz artists were left scrambling for a livelihood .
Just as silent movies destroyed theater , then talkies left the silent stars unemployed , progress , he hints , always creates losers as well as winners .
But progress has to be accommodated anyway , says Kaarto .
" You have to change the map , not the world . "
Later , the Pirate Bay 's Peter ( who does n't want his last name revealed , in part for fear it would endanger his day job ) is dining with a crew of pirates from all over Europe .
Over tabbouleh and sausage , the talk turns to strategy : how to create media events , awareness campaigns , educational programs to let people know that piracy is n't about free movies – it's about clearing the way for culture to progress .
Peter talks about expanding the Pirate Bay beyond the current 25 - language translation .
He turns to me , with bright eyes : " We want to make a Pirate Bay for kids ! "
Sebastian Gjerding of Denmark 's Piratgruppen warms to the idea , and starts talking about designing a poster to hang in schools , teaching children how to share files .
The pirates bandy about names for the campaign and seem , for the moment , to settle on " iCopy . "
Later , I 'm in Peter 's old BMW station wagon .
" One day , all these cars will run on hydrogen , " Peter proclaims , gesturing around Malmo .
" How will they make the hydrogen ? " I ask .
He answers quickly , smiling , " I do n't know ! "
But , he assures me , they will and it is n't his problem to figure out how .
It 's not the problem of the pirates , he tells me later , to figure out how to compensate artists or encourage invention away from the current intellectual property system – someone else will figure that out .
Their job is just to tear down the flawed system that exists , to force the hand of society to make something better .
If the next thing is n't good enough , they will tear that down , too .
Tiny worms that can trick the body 's natural defences could hold the key to new treatments for a range of conditions , including diabetes , asthma and hay fever .
University of Edinburgh scientists , who have discovered that helminth parasites can exploit an ' Achilles heel ' in our immune system , now hope to mimic the worms ' survival tactics in a bid to beat infection .
To find out how helminths fool the body 's defences , the team are focusing on the role played by so - called ' regulatory cells ' , which fulfil a policing role that protects our bodies .
These cells decide when to stop the immune system from attacking the body 's own proteins ( a process called autoimmunity ) and also prevent it from attacking harmless environmental molecules .
It is thought that helminths produce molecules that trigger a response in regulatory cells ( similar to the one that prevents autoimmunity ) , which tricks the body into switching off the response that would otherwise kill the parasites .
If that is the case , then infections could be cured , not by vaccination or drug treatment , but by reactivating the immune system .
It is the first time such a concept has been explored to curb the tropical diseases caused by helminths – such as filariasis and schistosomiasis – which affect one in four of the global population .
The study – the first findings of which are reported in the Journal of Experimental Medicine – could also help growing numbers of people in the developed world who have autoimmune conditions such as diabetes , asthma and hay fever .
Again , the key is identifying the molecules that helminths produce in order to influence regulatory cell activity .
If scientists can understand how these molecules trigger suppression of the immune system , they might also employ the molecules to stop the immune system from attacking the body 's own cells – which is what happens in diseases caused by over - active immune responses .
Professor Rick Maizels , of the University of Edinburgh 's School of Biological Sciences , has been awarded £ 1.3 million by the Wellcome Trust to conduct the research .
He said : " Perhaps we can borrow a trick from parasites , and employ the molecules which suppress the immune system to treat these auto - immune disorders .
The project therefore offers potential for new treatments of diseases in both the developed world and the disadvantaged countries of the tropics . "
As his strong comments against abortion and Catholic politicians who vote to legalize it continued to provoke debate , Pope Benedict XVI on Thursday urged Latin America ’s youth to lead lives of prayer and faith and to resist “ the snares of evil ” that deprive them of true Christian happiness .
Tens of thousands of young people , traveling here from across South America , greeted the pope at Sao Paulo ’s Pacaembu soccer stadium .
He sat on a red and gold throne and watched a parade of samba dancers and musicians offering a display of Brazilian culture .
Benedict is on the second day of his first pilgrimage to the Americas , where he hopes to shore up the declining Roman Catholic Church and its traditional family values on a continent with a more relaxed interpretation of those values .
The pope told his youthful audience to eschew premarital sex , remain monogamous in marriage , care for the elderly and serve as examples of Christian conduct in social and professional relationships .

“ Be men and women who are free and responsible .
Make the family a center that radiates peace and joy .
Be promoters of life , from its beginning to its natural end , ” he said .
“ Above all , have great respect for the institution of the sacrament of matrimony ....
Build your future hopes upon chastity . ”
The encounter featured some of the more energetic , folkloric elements associated with the church here -- and less common in the more subdued formalities of Rome .
At one point , a young Brazilian priest grabbed a mike and led the crowd in chants like a cheerleader .
Advertisement
Benedict smiled at the entertainment , and drew boisterous applause and squeals when he saluted his audience with “ um grande abraco bem brasileiro ” ( a warm Brazilian embrace ) .
But soon his tone turned serious .
Delivering a long speech in Portuguese , the pope implored the assembled youths to become missionaries and “ builders of a new society ” based on Christian moral values .
“ The church needs you , as young people , to manifest to the world the face of Jesus Christ , visible in the Christian community , ” he said .
“ Without this young face , the church would appear disfigured . ”
Advertisement
It was what some in the audience wanted to hear .
“ The problem is the world has lost its values , and the pope is trying to bring them back , ” said Luigi Marson , a 19 - year - old engineering student .
“ It ’s the world that has everything backward , not the pope . ”
Others , however , had trouble relating to Benedict ’s conservative message on morality .
Casual sex , out - of - wedlock births and illegal abortions are commonplace in Brazil .
Watching the pope on large screens outside the stadium , Cristiani Valeska de Albuquerque , 21 , said she hoped his presence would help Sao Paulo bring down its high levels of prostitution and murderous violence .
But much of what the pope said was simply not realistic , she added .
Advertisement
“ Well , I have a lot of respect for the pope , but if he wants us to not have sex before getting married , then that will never work , ” Albuquerque said .
“ In fact , I ’m living in sin .
Everyone knows that men will never wait for that . ”
Her friend Valdinette Olveira had a different thought .
“ Maybe if the young men would listen to the pope , they will learn to respect women more , ” said the 25 - year - old .
“ Because right now , men do n’t really respect women . ”
Lidio Pereira da Silva , 17 , a member of a Catholic youth group from Maua , an industrial suburb of Sao Paulo , said that living according to the church ’s rules was complicated .
Advertisement
“ The problem is , especially for the young , that temptation is everywhere , ” he said .
Veronica Fattore , 17 , also a member of the group , agreed .
“ The pope is correct about only having relations in marriage , ” she said .
“ We know that , but that can be a very hard thing to do . ”
She added that the pope was absolutely right about abortion , “ the worst thing in the world . ”
Advertisement
Some in the crowd waved signs saying , “ Religion , not modernism ! ” and others chanted , “ Life , yes !
Abortion , no ! ”
Abortion became the focus of renewed debate after the pope began his trip here this week by condemning Catholic politicians who legalize the practice .
The Vatican has attempted to tone down the pope ’s initial comments , which seemed to endorse excommunication for politicians who support abortion rights , but the reaction has been lively nonetheless .
There is mounting pressure here and in much of Latin America to loosen some of the restrictions on abortion , and the Vatican is determined to stop it .
“ One can not prescribe dogmas and principles of a certain religion for a whole society , ” said Jose Gomes Temporao , Brazil ’s health minister , who has been pushing for a referendum on liberalizing abortion laws .
Advertisement
Polls have shown that a majority of Brazilians oppose abortion , but Temporao said he believed sexism prevented a meaningful debate .
“ Men wo n’t get pregnant , ” he said .
“ If they did , I ’m sure the issue would have been solved a long time ago . ”
Women ’s groups favoring the decriminalization of abortion were planning demonstrations during the pope ’s five - day visit to Brazil .
By some estimates , there are up to a million illegal abortions in the country every year , with botched procedures making abortion the fourth - leading cause of women ’s deaths .

“ There ’s a great distance between what the church proposes and what society does , ” said Iuri Puello Orozco , one of the organizers .

The blinkx - Quintura partnership proves that the Google - YouTube partnership has a strong opponent .
Turn over a scandal in Washington these days and the chances are you ’ll find Karl Rove .
His tracks are everywhere : whether it ’s helping to purge United States attorneys , coaching bureaucrats on how to spend taxpayers ’ money to promote Republican candidates , hijacking the White House Office of Faith - Based and Community Initiatives for partisan politics , or helping to organize a hit on the character of one of the first people to publicly reveal the twisting of intelligence reports on Iraq .
Whatever the immediate objective , Mr. Rove seems focused on one overarching goal : creating a permanent Republican majority , even if that means politicizing every aspect of the White House and subverting the governmental functions of the executive branch .
This is not the Clinton administration ’s permanent campaign .
The Clinton people had difficulty distinguishing between the spin cycle of a campaign and the tone of governing .
That seems quaint compared with the Bush administration ’s far more menacing failure to distinguish the Republican Party from the government , or the state itself .
This was , perhaps , the inevitable result of taking the chief operative of a presidential campaign , one famous for his scorched - earth style , and ensconcing him in the White House — not in a political role , but as a key player in the formation of policy .
Mr. Rove never had to submit to Senate confirmation hearings .
Yet , from the very start , photographs of cabinet meetings showed him in the background , keeping an enforcer ’s eye on the proceedings .
After his re-election in 2004 , President Bush formally put Mr. Rove in charge of all domestic policy .
In that position , as David Kirkpatrick and Jim Rutenberg reported in The Times , Mr. Rove took a lead role in selecting federal judges and the hiring — and firing — of United States attorneys .
Mr. Rove ’s staff maneuvered to fire the prosecutor in Arkansas and replace him with a Rove protégé , and also seems to have been involved in the firing of a United States attorney in New Mexico who refused to file what he considered to be baseless charges of election fraud against Democrats .

Skype Call Traced
Kobi Alexander fled the United States ten days ago .
He was tracked down in Sri Lanka via a Skype call :
According to the report , Alexander was located after making a one - minute call via the online telephone Skype service .
The call , made from the Sri Lankan capital Colombo , alerted intelligence agencies to his presence in the country .
Ars Technica explains :
The fugitive former CEO may have been convinced that using Skype made him safe from tracking , but he — and everyone else that believes VoIP is inherently more secure than a landline — was wrong .
Tracking anonymous peer - to - peer VoIP traffic over the Internet is possible ( PDF ) .
In fact , it can be done even if the parties have taken some steps to disguise the traffic .
Let this be a warning to all of you who thought Skype was anonymous .

Open Letter to Mozilla : Put up or Shut up
I have been using Firefox since it was Phoenix 0.1 .
It was the best browser then , and it is the best browser now .
The first computer language that I ever learned was HTML , and I learned it largely by hitting " View Source " .
Without it , who knows if I would be a programmer today ?
Today , though , the world is a different one than it was back in 1998 when I was plunking around with HTML .
Broadband has ( finally ! ) gotten widespread adoption , and with it the web has gotten past animated rollover effects .
Youtube serves millions of crappy videos per year , pandora.com sends millions of bits worth of music over the wire every day , and you can head over to espn.com and check out the highlight 's of tonight 's Red Sox - Yankees game .
And do you notice something that all three of those sites have in common ?
All of them use Flash to serve their content .
So , while I 'm not a big fan of people developing in a closed environment that costs ungodly amounts of money to develop in , and leaves *nix developers in the dark , I 'm a bigger fan of innovative products and services continuing to crop up on the internet .
Mozilla , information may want to be free , but it wo n't be if it can't outcompete the closed kind .
You are in a unique position to make that happen , but you 're falling behind .
We all know about Java applets , and Flash has been around for a while , but with the release of Silverlight and Apollo , the web is threatening to sneak away from us .
It 's awfully tempting that one lets me write rich web interfaces in my favorite language , and the other lets me bring my applications offline .
So while it 's all well and good to post about the high cost of free tools , and talk about how important Freedom is , you need to bring us a viable alternative .
Give me the tools to write a file upload box that does n't suck ;
Give me the tools to show my users video and audio ;
Give me the tools to put the closed - source developers to shame .
Maybe someday SVG wo n't suck , or < canvas > will be a viable answer to flash .
If that day does n't come soon , it may come too late .
Update : jerf at reddit takes a slightly different angle , but says some things that I think but that I failed to get across .
WHEN Eugene McCarthy was making his first and most famous attempt on the presidency , in 1968 , he was often asked why he was running .
It was a good question .
And he had a good answer :
Nor law , nor duty bade me fight ,
Nor public men , nor cheering crowds :
A lonely impulse of delight
Drove to this tumult in the clouds .
This fragment of Yeats seemed to epitomise the man who quoted it .
Irishness , daring , puckish humour , wilful solitariness , a sense of the pervading importance of higher things , were all delivered with professorial elegance by a man once described as “ Thomas Aquinas in a suit ” .
Two criticisms only could be made .
First , that it was delivered in the white heat of one of America 's nastiest election campaigns , to crowds chafing for more solid fare .
And , second , that it was not true .
Mr McCarthy 's peculiar political career was driven not by the impulse of delight but , in fairly equal measure , by principle and pique .
His model of political behaviour was Thomas More , a witty but pig - headed martyr for his beliefs in Tudor England ; his training ground was the hockey field at the various Catholic institutions at which he was educated , on which his desire to win could be shockingly intense .
In political life , he kept his ambition well buried under layers of diffidence and urbanity .
But he had some , and when he was slighted he did not forget .
His decision to oppose Lyndon Johnson in 1968 was a case in point .
Mr McCarthy had come ardently to oppose the Vietnam war .
He also could not help remembering that Johnson had humiliated him at the 1964 Democratic convention , choosing Hubert Humphrey , rather than him , as his running - mate at the last minute .
He thought Johnson “ a barbarian ” , determined to barge his way through any kind of checks and balances to prosecute the war .
But the Senate had no desire to curb him .
Someone , therefore , had to take the debate to the public .
That someone ( no one else being brave enough ) would have to be Eugene McCarthy .
His campaign was odd in the extreme .
He did not call himself a candidate , but an “ accidental instrument ” to express the will of the country .
He knew he could not win .
By challenging Johnson , he simply hoped to force the convention open for someone else .
In fact , he came so close to Johnson in the New Hampshire primary that the president realised he was doomed , and soon quit the race .
The nomination went eventually to Humphrey , no improvement in Mr McCarthy 's view .
But he had managed to shake his party to its foundations .
He had also mobilised the young , inspiring them to shave off their beards and get knocking on doors in a way not seen again until Howard Dean 's insurgency in 2004 .
The radicals of the anti-war movement did not take to him , however , nor he to them .
As riots raged in the streets of Chicago at the 1968 Democratic convention , Mr McCarthy , watching from the windows of the Hilton hotel , said the scene below reminded him of the Battle of Lake Trasimeno in the Punic Wars .
Politics as football
He was a politician , yet he despised politics .
In the House , where he sat for Minnesota 's Fourth District from 1949 to 1959 , he would pointedly read books in committee meetings .
In the Senate , where he served from 1959 to 1971 , he seemed bored , and was often absent .
Instinctively shy , he hated pressing the flesh or canvassing for money .
He once compared politics to being a football coach : “ You have to be smart enough to know the game and dumb enough to think it 's important . ”
Was it important to him ?
His opinions could be hard to sift , sometimes far to the left of his party , sometimes conservative .
He believed in “ redistributive justice ” , a relic of his youthful days in the Catholic Worker movement , but endorsed Ronald Reagan .
He also opposed all limits on political donations as crimps on freedom of speech .
That freedom was his passion in politics .
Accordingly he hated the stale old bunfight between Republicans and Democrats , and left the Democrats in 1972 to become an independent .
His three later forays into presidential politics were embarrassing and looked self - indulgent .
But Mr McCarthy believed he could still shake Americans out of their political torpor .
The irony was that the Democrats , responding in part to the shock he had administered , became increasingly a party of the elite and intellectual rather than the working man .
He might never have entered politics at all .
As a young man , he almost became a monk .
In his home town , a small German - Catholic community lost in the Minnesota prairie , to take orders was the highest career .
He tried the novitiate for a year , but was thrown out for intellectual pride .
The same pride tortured him in politics .
His mind was too acute and freewheeling to suffer its restrictions .
Norman Mailer , meeting him in 1968 at a fundraiser in Harvard , found him drooping and baggy - eyed , longing to be rescued .
Some weeks later , he saw him in Chicago .
He had just definitively abandoned the race , and was dining and joking with friends .
He was free .
And Mr Mailer suddenly glimpsed in him then the perfect president , “ harder than the hardest alloys of steel ” .
Although many persist in denying it , I continue to believe that what Sept 11 , 2001 , did was to plunge us headlong into nothing less than another world war .
I call this new war World War IV , because I also believe that what is generally known as the Cold War was actually World War III , and that this one bears a closer resemblance to that great conflict than it does to World War II .
Like the Cold War , as the military historian Eliot Cohen was the first to recognize , the one we are now in has ideological roots , pitting us against Islamofascism , yet another mutation of the totalitarian disease we defeated first in the shape of Nazism and fascism and then in the shape of communism ; it is global in scope ; it is being fought with a variety of weapons , not all of them military ; and it is likely to go on for decades .
This is the traditional thesis of the necoons , and the basis for the " 9/11 changed everything " mindset : the ardent belief in an all out ideological struggle - Good vs Evil , just like the good old days of the Cold War .
It 's the chance for today 's pundits and Deciders to be heroes , too .
As the currently main center of the Islamofascist ideology against which we have been fighting since 9/11 , and as ( according to the State Department 's latest annual report on the subject ) the main sponsor of the terrorism that is Islamofascism 's weapon of choice , Iran too is a front in World War IV .
Moreover , its effort to build a nuclear arsenal makes it the potentially most dangerous one of all .
After dismissing Iraq and Afghanistan as mere skirmishes in a wider battle ( " theaters that have been opened up in the early stages of a protracted global struggle " )
Podhoretz zooms in on THE enemy - the evil nasties who dared humiliate the USA almost 30 years ago .
This is never said , of course , but his whole texte just burns with hate for the absolute evil that emanates from that country , and its leaders , and it is the typical discourse of a bully that has just been smacked in the face and wants - demands !
- cannot live without !! - retribution .
9/11 was a similar case of lèse - majesté for these guys , but created a great opening for action ( read invading countries and killing the local population ) ; the Iranian embassy hostage crisis is a festering wound that has yet to be given closure , and these guys desperately itch to go and smack the insolent offender once and for all .
Their first priority , as repeatedly and unequivocally announced by their president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , is to " wipe Israel off the map " - - a feat that could not be accomplished by conventional weapons alone . (...)
Still less would deterrence work where Israel was concerned .
For as the Ayatollah Rafsanjani ( who is supposedly a " pragmatic conservative " ) has declared :
If a day comes when the world of Islam is duly equipped with the arms Israel has in possession . . . application of an atomic bomb would not leave anything in Israel , but the same thing would just produce damages in the Muslim world .
In other words , Israel would be destroyed in a nuclear exchange , but Iran would survive .
The pretext for intervention , of course , are the recent provocative pronouncements of Iran 's figurehead president .
It does n't matter that Israel has a couple hundred nuclear bombs to Iran 's yet inexistent one ; it does n't matter that Iran has a 5,000 - year history as a nation , has run a mostly pragmatic foreign policy in the past 30 years despite its fiery islamist leadership , and is highly unlikely to commit suicide , even for a twisted version of Islam .
It also matters not at all that Iran ( rightly ) feels threatened by the USA , which engineered a coup against its democratically elected government not so long ago , and has been meddling in the country 's politics for more than a half - century , and has been sending out regular messages seeking out some form of peace arragement with the USA .
No , they are making threatening noises , so they have to be obliterated :
In exerting pressure for reform on countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia , these nonmilitary instruments are the right ones to use .
But it should be clear by now to any observer not in denial that Iran is not such a country .
As we know from Iran 's defiance of the Security Council and the IAEA even while the United States has been warning Ahmadinejad that " all options " remain on the table , ultimatums and threats of force can no more stop him than negotiations and sanctions have managed to do .
Like them , all they accomplish is to buy him more time .
In short , the plain and brutal truth is that if Iran is to be prevented from developing a nuclear arsenal , there is no alternative to the actual use of military force -- any more than there was an alternative to force if Hitler was to be stopped in 1938 .
Since a ground invasion of Iran must be ruled out for many different reasons , the job would have to be done , if it is to be done at all , by a campaign of air strikes .
Furthermore , because Iran 's nuclear facilities are dispersed , and because some of them are underground , many sorties and bunker - busting munitions would be required .
And because such a campaign is beyond the capabilities of Israel , and the will , let alone the courage , of any of our other allies , it could be carried out only by the United States .
Ah , the reference to Hitler in 1938 ( and there are several paragraphs comparing Ahmadinejad to Hitler ) .
The sense that the USA has a God - given mission to save the world from itself .
The casual encouragement to rain death and destruction from afar .
It 's to save the Iranians , you understand .
Oh , but he is reality - based :
Iran would retaliate by increasing the trouble it is already making for us in Iraq .
It would attack Israel with missiles armed with nonnuclear warheads but possibly containing biological or chemical weapons .
There would be a vast increase in the price of oil , with catastrophic consequences for every economy in the world , very much including our own .
The worldwide outcry against the inevitable civilian casualties would make the anti-Americanism of today look like a lovefest .
I readily admit that it would be foolish to discount any or all of these scenarios .
Each of them is , alas , only too plausible .
Nevertheless , there is a good response to them , and it is the one given by John McCain .
The only thing worse than bombing Iran , McCain has declared , is allowing Iran to get the bomb .
It is with a heavy heart that he admits to catastrophic consequences .
It 's just that the alternative would be worse , you see .
It 's the goodness in him that makes him consider the alternative , and choose the least catastrophic one .
Because , you see , it 's because the damn Europeans are , again , appeasers .
You'd think they'd have learnt , this time .
alas , no :
But in the meantime , looking at Europe today , we already see the unfolding of a process analogous to Finlandization : it has been called , rightly , Islamization . (... )
[ The main European ] countries have large and growing Muslim populations demanding that their religious values and sensibilities be accommodated at the expense of the traditional values of the West , and even in some instances of the law .
Yet rather than insisting that , like all immigrant groups before them , they assimilate to Western norms , almost all European politicians have been cravenly giving in to the Muslims ' outrageous demands .
As in the realm of foreign affairs , if this much can be accomplished under present circumstances , what might not be done if the process were being backed by Iranian nuclear blackmail ?
Already some observers are warning that by the end of the 21st century the whole of Europe will be transformed into a place to which they give the name Eurabia .
Whatever chance there may still be of heading off this eventuality would surely be lessened by the menacing shadow of an Iran armed with nuclear weapons , and only too ready to put them into the hands of the terrorist groups to whom it is even now supplying rockets and other explosive devices .
Muslims are uniformly evil ; Europeans and liberals are uniformly cowardly , weak and spineless , and we need strong - willed men like Podhoretz and Bush to take things in their hands and protect us .
: : ::
And , again , this is given a full page in a serious newspaper , is given polite , thoughtful consideration in pundit circles , and influences everybody else 's discourse .
and , as we know , these people have a direct , proven influence on actual US policies .
We do n't have until September .
" There 's a strong sense in the upper echelons of the White House that Iran is going to surface relatively quickly as a major issue - in the country and the world - in a very acute way , " said NBC TV's Tim Russert after meeting the president .
This is borne out by the fact that Bush has sent forces to the Gulf that are irrelevant to fighting the Iraqi insurgents .
These include Patriot anti-missile missiles , an aircraft carrier , and cruise - missile - firing ships .
Many military analysts see these deployments as signals of impending war with Iran .
The Patriot missiles are intended to shoot down Iranian missiles .
The naval forces , including British ships , train to pre-empt Iranian interference with oil shipments through the straits of Hormuz .
Having been given so much advice on what to do in Iraq - most notably by the Baker - Hamilton Iraq Study Group - the president went with the recommendations of the neoconservative American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) .
So much for the idea that the Iraq debacle marginalised the neocons .
The political context as seen from inside the White House and Downing Street is that we are in a war as serious as the second world war .
John Bolton exemplified this outlook when he compared US problems in Iraq with the fighting with Japan after Pearl Harbour .
Donald Rumsfeld and the AEI have developed a strategy for regime change in Iran that does not involve a ground invasion .
Weapons of mass destruction will provide the rationale for military action , though it wo n't be limited to attacks on a few weapons factories .
It will include limiting Iranian retaliatory capability , using bombers to destroy up to 10,000 targets in the first day of any war , and special forces flying in to destroy anything that 's left .
In the aftermath , the US will support regime change , hoping to replace the ayatollahs with an Iran of the regions .
The US and British governments now support a coalition of groups seeking a federal Iran .
This may be another neocon delusion , but that may not be the point .
Making Tehran concentrate on internal problems leaves it unable to act elsewhere .
Bush has said he will destroy the Syrian and Iranian networks in Iraq .
These may include Moqtada al - Sadr 's militia , but are also likely to target the Iranian - created Badr brigades , now wearing Iraqi police uniforms .
In the south , the withdrawal of British troops to Basra airport looks more like a preparation to avoid a Shia backlash than a handover to the government of Iraq .
The US director of national intelligence , John Negroponte , explained that the threat to launch Hizbullah against Israel was the main deterrent to a US attack on Iran .
Although politically Hizbullah scored a major victory in holding off the Israeli army last summer , in fact it was badly damaged .
The Iranian regime seems prepared for confrontation , perhaps confident Washington is bluffing .
Next month Iran celebrates its completion of the nuclear - fuel cycle , in defiance of UN sanctions .
Expect Bush and Blair to ask what the world will do to prevent a new Holocaust against the Jews .
In his Plymouth speech , Blair told us that we could not pick and choose our wars .
He may have been telling us more than we realised .

スペル修正プログラムはどう書くか
Peter Norvig / 青木靖 訳
先週、2人の友人(ディーンとビル)がそれぞれ別個にGoogleが極めて早く正確にスペル修正できるのには驚くばかりだと私に言った。たとえば speling のような語でGoogleを検索すると、0.1秒くらいで答えが返ってきて、
もしかして : spelling じゃないかと言ってく る( Yahoo や Microsoftのものにも同様の機能がある)。ディーンとビルが高い実績を持ったエンジニアであり数学者であることを思えば、スペル修正のような統計的言語処理についてもっと知っていて良さそうなものなのにと私は驚いた。しかし彼らは知らなかった。よく考えてみれば、
別に彼らが知っているべき理由はないのだった。
間違っていたのは彼らの知識ではなく、私の仮定の方だ。
このことについてちゃんとした説明を書いておけば、彼らばかりでなく多くの人に有益かもしれない。Googleのものみたいな工業品質のスペル修正プログラムについて詳細に書
くのは、啓蒙するよりは混乱させるだけだと思う。それで、出張から帰る飛行機の中で
、1ページくらいのおもちゃのスペル修正プログラムで、80から90%の精度で毎秒10語程度処理できるものが書けないだろうかと考えてみた。
そうして書いたのが、以下に挙げる21行のPython 2.5コードで、これは完全なスペル修正プログラムになっている。
import re , collections def words ( text ) : return re.findall ( '[ a - z ] + ' , text.lower ( ) ) def train ( features ) : model = collections.defaultdict( lambda : 1 ) for f in features : model[f ] += 1 return model NWORDS = train ( words ( file ( ' big.txt ' ) .read ( ) ) ) alphabet = ' abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ' def edits1 ( word ) : n = len( word ) return set ( [ word [ 0 :i ] + word [ i+1 : ] for i in range ( n ) ] + # deletion [ word [ 0 :i ] + word [ i+1 ] + word [ i] + word [ i+2 : ] for i in rang e ( n - 1 ) ] + # transposition [ word [ 0 :i ] + c+word [ i+1 : ] for i in range ( n ) for c in alphabet ] + # alteration [ word [ 0 :i ] + c+word [i :] for i in rang e ( n+1 ) for c in alphabet ] ) # insertion def known_edits 2 ( word ) : return set ( e2 for e1 in edits1 ( word ) for e2 in edits1 ( e1 ) if e2 in NWORDS ) def known ( words ) : return set ( w for w in words if w in NWORDS ) def correct ( word ) : candidates = known ( [ word ] ) or know n ( edits1 ( word ) ) or known_edits 2 ( word ) or [ word ] return max ( candidates , key=lambda w : NWORDS[w ] )
このコードは関数 correct を定義してお り
、1つの語を入力として、もっとも適当と思われるスペル修正を結果として返す。
>>> correct ( ' speling ' ) ' spelling ' >>> correct ( ' korrecter ' ) ' corrector '
どういう仕組みになっているのか : 確率論を少しばかり
どういう仕組みになっているのか?
最初に、少し理論について話そう。与えられた語に対し、その語に対する最も可能性の高いスペル修正候補を選びたいとする。絶対確実な答えというのはなく
( たとえば lates は late と修正すべきだろうか、それとも latest と修正すべきだろうか ? ) 、
そのため確率がからむことになる。私たちは元の語
w に対し、可能な修正候補の集合の中から確率最大である修正語 c を見つけたい 。
argmax c P( c|w )
argmax c P( w|c ) P( c ) / P(w )
argmax c P( w|c ) P( c )
P( c ) は修正語 c 自体の確率で、言語モデルと呼ばれている。これは｢語 c が英語の文章に現われる見込みはどれくらいか?｣という問への答えと考えるといい。たとえば
P ( " the " ) は比較的確率が高いのに対し 、P( " zxzxzxzyyy " ) はほとんど 0 に近い。 P( w|c ) は文章の中で語 c を意図して語 w がタイプされる確率で、誤りモデルと呼ばれている。これは ｢文章を書く人が語 c を書くつもりで語 w をタイプする見込みはどれくらいか ?｣という問への答えと考えるといい。 argmax c は制御機構で、すべての可能な c の値を列挙して、 その中から組み合わせ確率値が最大となるものを選択する。
ここでの当然の疑問は、どうして P( c|w ) のような単純な式を2つのモデルがかかわる複雑な式に置き換えたのかということだろう。それは
P( c|w ) にはすでに2つの要素が融合しており、2者を分離して明示的に扱った方が簡単
になるからだ。スペルミスを含む語 w=" thew " と 、2 つの修正候補 c=" the " と c=" thaw " を考えてみよう 。P( c|w ) が大きいのはどちらの語だろうか ?
a を e に変えるだけなので 、" thaw " はいい修正候補と思える。一方 、 " the " は非常によく使われる語であり、タイプするときに指が e から w に滑ってしまったのかもしれないので 、" the " というのも大いにありそうだ。要は 、P( c|w ) を推定しようと思うときには、語 c の確率と、c が w に変わる確率の両方を考慮する必要があるということだ。だから2つの要因を形の上で分離しておいた方が明確にすることができる。
これでプログラムの仕組みを説明する準備ができた。最初に
P( c ) の部分だが、100万語ほどからなる大きなテキストファイル big.txt を読み込むことにする。このファイルはProject Gutenbergで公開されている何冊かの本と、WiktionaryとBritish National Corpusから取った最も良く使われる語のリストをつなぎ合わせたものだ。(飛行機の中で手元にあったのは、たまたまノートPCに入っていたシャーロックホームズの小説だけだった。あとで他のソースからのテキストも追加していって、効果が変わらなくなったところで止めた。これについては評価の節で触れる。)
このテキストファイルからそれぞれの語を抽出する(関数 words を使う。このときすべて小文字に置き換えている。" the " も" The " も同じ語として扱い、語はアルファベットの並びとして定義される。そのため、" don't " は " don " と " t " の2語と見なされる)。それから確率モデルのトレーニングを行う。これはそれぞれの語が何回現われるか数えるというのを格好つけて言っただけだ。
これには関数 train を使う。ここまでのコードは以下のようになる。
def words ( text ) : return re.findall ( '[ a - z ] + ' , text.lower ( ) ) def train ( features ) : model = collections.defaultdict( lambda : 1 ) for f in features : model[f ] += 1 return model NWORDS = train ( words ( file ( ' big.txt ' ) .read ( ) ) )
これで NWORDS [ w ] には語 w が何回現われたかが記録され る
。1つ厄介なことがある。未知の語だ。正しい英単語ではあるが、我々のトレーニングデータに は入ってないような語をどう 扱うかということだ。これまで見たことがないというだけで確率0だというのは不作法というものだ。この問題については標準的に用いられているアプローチがいくつかあるが、ここでは一番簡単なのを使おう。未知の語は、1度現われたものとして扱うのだ。この処理方法はスムージングと呼ばれていて、それは確率分布の0だった部分を最小のカウントに引き上げてなら
すことになるからだ。コードでは collections .defaultdict クラス がこれを行っている。このクラス はPythonの普通のdict ( 他の言語ではハッシュテーブルと呼ばれているもの)
のように振る舞うが、キーに対してデフォルトの値を設定することができ、ここではそれを1にしている。
次に与えられた語 w に対して可能な修正語 c を列挙する問題を考えよ う 。2つの語の間の編集距離という概念 がよく用いられる。すなわち、一方から他方を得るのに必要な修正の回数
ということだ。ここで編集は、削除( deletion、文字を取り除く ) 、転位( transposition、隣り合う文字を入れ替える ) 、置換( alteration、1つの文字を別な文字に変える ) 、挿入( insertion、文字の追加 ) のいずれかだ。次の関数は w か ら1 回 の編集で得られる語 c の集合を返す。
def edits1 ( word ) : n = len( word ) return set ( [ word [ 0 :i ] + word [ i+1 : ] for i in range ( n ) ] + # deletion [ word [ 0 :i ] + word [ i+1 ] + word [ i] + word [ i+2 : ] for i in rang e ( n - 1 ) ] + # transposition [ word [ 0 :i ] + c+word [ i+1 : ] for i in range ( n ) for c in alphabet ] + # alteration [ word [ 0 :i ] + c+word [i :] for i in rang e ( n+1 ) for c in alphabet ] ) # insertion
この集合は大きなものになりうる。長さ n の語に対し、削除が n、転位が n-1、置換が 26n、挿入が 26( n+1 ) 通りあって、トータルでは54n+25 になる(この中には結果として同じになるものもある)。たとえばlen(edits1(' something ' ) ) — — edits1 ( ' something ') の結果の要素数 — — は494になる。
スペル修正に関する文献によれば、スペルミスの80ないし95%は意図されたものからの編集距離が1であるということだ。すぐに見るように、私は開発用に270語からなるスペルミスのコーパスを用意したが、編集距離1であるものは76%だけだった。私が見つけた例は典型的な場合よりも難しいのかもしれない。なんにせよ、編集距離1だけというのは不十分と思
われるので、編集距離2も考慮に入れることにする。これは簡単で、
edits1 の結果に対して edits1 を適用するだけ でいい。
def edits2 ( word ) : return set ( e2 for e1 in edits1 ( word ) for e2 in edits1 ( e1 ) )
コードとしては簡単だが、計算量はかなり大きくなる。len(edits2(' something ' ) ) は 114,324 だ。しかしこれでかなりのスペルミスがカバーできるようになる。270のテストケースのうち、編集距離が2より大きいのは3つだけだ。つまり
edits2 はテストケースの98.9%をカバーすることになり、これは私には十分に思える。編集距離が2より大きいものは扱わないので、ちょっとした最適化をすることができる。修正候補として、既知の語だけを取っておくのだ。依然可能性はすべて検討するが、大きな集合を保持せずに済む。この関数 known_edits2 は以下のようになる。
def known_edits 2 ( word ) : return set ( e2 for e1 in edits1 ( word ) for e2 in edits1 ( e1 ) if e2 in NWORDS )
そうすると、たとえば known_edits2( ' something ') は、edits2 が生成す
る114,324語の集合のかわりに、たった3語の集合になる : {' smoothing ' , ' something ' , ' soothing '}。こうすることで計算時間が10%ほど早くなる。
残る部分はエラーモデル P( w|c ) だ。ここが難しかった部分 で、インターネット接続のない飛行機の座席で行き詰ってしまった。スペルミスのモデルを構築するためのトレーニングデータがなかったのだ。いくつか直感的にわかることはあった。母音を間違う確率は子音を間違う確率よりも高いとか、語の最初の文字を間違う可能性は低いとか、そういったことだ。しかしそれを裏付ける数字がなかった。それで近道をすることにした。 ｢編集 距
離1の既知の語が起きる可能性は、編集距離2の既知の語が起きる可能性よりはるかに高く、編集距離0の既知の語が起きる可能性よりはるかに低い｣という単純なモデルを定義することにしたのだ。ここで｢既知の語｣で意味しているのは、言語モデルのトレーニングデータに現われる語——辞書にある語——ということだ。この戦略は以下のように実装できる。
def known ( words ) : return set ( w for w in words if w in NWORDS ) def correct ( word ) : candidates = known ( [ word ] ) or know n ( edits1 ( word ) ) or known_edits 2 ( word ) or [ word ] return max ( candidates , key=lambda w : NWORDS [w ] )
関数 correct は修正候補の集合として、元の語への編集距離が最短の語の集合を選ぶ( その集合が既知の語を含むという条件で ) 。
修正候補の集合を特定すると、 NWORDS モデルで定義される P( c ) の値が最大となる要素を選択する。
評価
このプログラムがどれほど効果があるか評価してみることにしよう。飛行機の中で私はいくつかの例を試してみて、うまく行くように見えた。飛行機が着陸したあと、Oxford Text Archiveか らRoger Mitton のBirkbeck spelling error corpusをダウンロードした。このデータから修正のテストセットを2つ抽出した。最初のものは開発用で、プログラムを開発している間に使うためのものだ。2番目のは最終テストセットで、中身を見たり、データに合わせてプログラムを修正しない。この2つのテストセットを使うというプラクティスは
健全なやり方だと思う。1つの特定のテストセットに合わせてプログラムをチューニングして、実際よりもうまくやっていると思いこむ罠を避けられる。以下に2つのテストセットの一部と、それを実行するための関数を示す。テストの全体(およびプログラムの残りの部分)を見るには、ファイルspell.py を見て欲しい。
tests1 = { ' access ' : ' acess ' , ' accessing ' : ' accesing ' , ' accommodation ' : ' accomodation acommodation acomodation ' , ' account ' : ' acount ' , ...} tests2 = {' forbidden ' : ' forbiden ' , ' decisions ' : ' deciscions descisions ' , ' supposedly ' : ' supposidly ' , ' embellishing ' : ' embelishing ' , ...} def spelltest ( tests , bias= None , verbose = False ) : import time n , bad , unknown , start = 0 , 0 , 0 , time.clock ( ) if bias : for target in tests : NWORDS [ target ] += bias for target , wrongs in tests.items ( ) : for wrong in wrongs.split( ) : n += 1 w = correct ( wrong ) if w! =target : bad += 1 unknown += ( target not in NWORDS ) if verbose : print ' %r => %r ( %d ) ; expected %r ( % d ) ' % ( wrong , w , NWORDS[w ] , target , NWORDS [ target ] ) return dict ( bad=bad , n=n , bias=bias , pct=int ( 100 .
- 100.* bad/n ) , unknown=unknown , secs=int ( time.clock ( ) - start ) ) print spelltest ( tests1 ) print spelltest ( tests2 ) ## only do this after everything is debugged
これの出力は以下のようになる。
{'bad ' : 68 , ' bias ' : None , ' unknown ' : 15 , ' secs ' : 16 , ' pct ' : 74 , 'n ' : 270} {' bad ' : 130 , ' bias ' : None , ' unknown ' : 43 , ' secs ' : 26 , ' pct ' : 67 , 'n ' : 400}
開発セットの270のケースに対しては74%正しく修正して16秒かかり(17語/秒)、最終テストセットでは67%正しく修正した( 15語/秒 )。
更新 : このエッセイの最初のバージョンでは、バグのために、それぞれのテストセットについて実際より高いスコアを報告していた。バグは小さなものだったが、気付くべきだった。以前のバージョンを読んだ読者
をミスリードする結果となったことを謝罪する。 spelltest の最初のバージョンでは関数の4行目の if bias : をつけていなかった ( そしてデフォルト値は bias=None ではなく bias=0 だった ) 。私は bias = 0 のときに は、 NWORDS [ target ] += bias は効果がないと思っていた。実際 NWORDS [ target ] の値は変わらない のだが、効果はあった。 ( target in NWORDS ) が true になるのだ。そのため、 spelltest は未知の語を既知の語とみなすことになる。これはつまらない誤りで、 defaultdict はプログラムを簡潔にしてくれたが、通常のdict を使っていれば起きなかったことだ 。
結論として、プログラムの簡潔さ、開発時間、実行時間の点では目標に達することができたが、正確さの点では目標に至らなかった。
今後の課 題
c
言語モデ ルP( c)。言語モデルの中に誤りの原因となっているものを2つ特定できる。より重大な方は、未知の語だ。開発セットには、未知の語が15個、5%あり、最終テストセットには43個、11%ある。以下は verbose=True で spelltest を実行したときの出力例だ。 correct ( ' economtric ' ) => ' economic ' ( 121 ) ; expected ' econometric ' ( 1 ) correct ( ' embaras ' ) => ' embargo ' ( 8 ) ; expected ' embarrass ' ( 1 ) correct ( ' colate ' ) => ' coat ' ( 173 ) ; expected ' collate ' ( 1 ) correct ( ' orentated ' ) => ' orentated ' ( 1 ) ; expected ' orientated ' ( 1 ) correct ( ' unequivocaly ' ) => ' unequivocal ' ( 2 ) ; expected ' unequivocally ' ( 1 ) correct ( ' generataed ' ) => ' generate ' ( 2 ) ; expected ' generated ' ( 1 ) correct ( ' guidlines ' ) => ' guideline ' ( 2 ) ; expected ' guidelines ' ( 1 ) この出力では、 correct を呼んだ結果 ( 括弧の中は結果 の NWORDS 数) と、テストセットが期待している語 ( 同様に括弧の中 は NWORDS 数) を示している。これでわかるのは、'econometric' という語を知らなければ、' economtric ' を正しく修正することはできないということだ。トレーニング用のコーパスにテキストを追加
することでこの問題は軽減できるが、間違った答えになる語も増えるかもしれない。最後の4行は、辞書に別な語形として書かれているものであることに注意して欲しい。だから動詞に'- ed'
をつけたり名詞に'- s 'を つけても構わないというモデルがあるといいかもしれない。
言語モデルの持つ2番目の潜在的な誤りの源は確率の不適切さで、辞書に2つの語が現われるが、間違った方が頻繁に現われるという場合だ。実際にこれが誤りの原因となっている例は見つけられなかったので、もう1つの問題の方が重要だと思われる。
テストを誤魔化すことで、 言語モデルの改良によってどれくらい結果が改善しうるのかシミュレートすることができる。テストデータの語に対し、正しいスペルで書かれた語を1回、10回、あるいはそれ以上見たことがある振りをするのだ。
これで言語モデルにもっと多くのテキスト(しかも正しいテキストだけ)がある場合をシミュレートできる。関数 spelltest の引数 bias を使うとこれができる。正しいスペルの語にバイアスをかけたときに開発テストセットと最終テストセットに対する結果がどうなるか示した表を以下に挙げる。
bias 開発セット 最終テス ト 0 74 % 67 % 1 74 % 70 % 10 76 % 73 % 100 82 % 77 % 1000 89 % 80 % どちらのテストセットでも大きな改善が見られ、80-90%近くになっている。これは十分に良い言語モデルがあれば、正確さの目標に到達できることを示している。一方でこれはおそらく楽観的な値で
、大きな言語モデルを作ると、間違った答えを導くような語も持ち込むことになるからだ。
未知の語に対するもう1つの対処法は、既知でない語への修正も認めるというものだ。たとえば入力を"electroencephalographicallz"としたとき、適切な修正 がおそらく最後の " z " を " y " に変えることであるのは、" electroencephalographically " が辞書になかったとしてもわかる。これは語の要素に基づいた言語モデルがあれば実現しうる。音節やサフィックス( " - ally " のような)を使うこともできるが、2、3、ないしは4字のシーケンスに基づいて処理する方がずっと簡単だろう。
誤りモデ ルP( w|c)。これまで使っていた誤りモデルは、編集距離が小さいほど小さな誤りとみなすという簡単なものだった。これには以下に示すような問題がある。まず、 correct は編集距離1の語を返すが正しい答は編集距離2であるような場合がいくつか見られる。 correct ( ' reciet ' ) => ' recite ' ( 5 ) ; expected ' receipt ' ( 14 ) correct ( ' adres ' ) => ' acres ' ( 37 ) ; expected ' address ' ( 77 ) correct ( ' rember ' ) => ' member ' ( 51 ) ; expected ' remember ' ( 162 ) correct ( ' juse ' ) => ' just ' ( 768 ) ; expected ' juice ' ( 6 ) correct ( ' accesing ' ) => ' acceding ' ( 2 ) ; expected ' assessing ' ( 1 ) たとえば、 ' d ' を' c ' に置換して ' adres ' を ' acres ' にする変更は、' d ' を ' dd ' に、's ' を 'ss '
にする2つの変更を合わせたよりも大きいと見る必要がある。
また、いくつかのケースでは同じ編集距離の間違った語が選択されている。 correct ( ' thay ' ) => ' that ' ( 12513 ) ; expected ' they ' ( 4939 ) correct ( ' cleark ' ) => ' clear ' ( 234 ) ; expected ' clerk ' ( 26 ) correct ( ' wer ' ) => ' her ' ( 5285 ) ; expected ' were ' ( 4290 ) correct ( ' bonas ' ) => ' bones ' ( 263 ) ; expected ' bonus ' ( 3 ) correct ( ' plesent ' ) => ' present ' ( 330 ) ; expected ' pleasant ' ( 97 ) これについても同様のことが言える。'thay ' における ' a ' から ' e 'への変化は、'y ' から ' t ' への変化より小さいと見る必要がある。どれくらい小さいか?
' they 'に対する ' that ' の出現頻度の大きさを乗り越えるためには、少なくとも2.5倍にする必要がある。
編集コストについてもっといいモデル が使えるのは明らかだ。我々の直感に従い、同じ文字を連続させるとか、母音を別な母音に変えるといったことには( 任意の文字間の変更と比べ)低いコストを割り当てることもできるだろう。しかしデータを集めた方が良さそうだ。スペルミスのコーパスを作り、周りの文字に応じて、それぞれの挿入、削除、置換がどの程度起こりやすいか測定するのだ。
これをうまくやるには多くのデータが必要になる。左右2文字ずつを枠として1つの文字が別な文字に変わるケースを考えると266通りあり、これは3億文字以上になる。それぞれの場合についていくつかの例がほしいだろうから、少なくとも10億文字の修正データが必要になる。たぶん100億くらいに考えておいた方が安全だろう。
言語モデルと誤りモデルの間には関連があることに注意する必要がある。今のプログラムはごく単純な誤りモデル(編集距離1の語はすべて編集距離2の語より優先する)を使っており、これは言語モデルへの制約になる。言語モデルに珍しい語を追加するのはためらわれ、それはたまたまそういう珍しい語の編集距離が1である場合には、編集距離2の非常に一般的な語があったとしても、珍しい語の方が選ばれてしまうからだ。もっといい誤りモデルを使っていれば、珍しい語を辞書に追加することにもっと積極的になれる。以下は珍しい語が辞書に入っていることで結果が損なわれている例だ。 correct ( ' wonted ' ) => ' wonted ' ( 2 ) ; expected ' wanted ' ( 214 ) correct ( ' planed ' ) => ' planed ' ( 2 ) ; expected ' planned ' ( 16 ) correct ( ' forth ' ) => ' forth ' ( 83 ) ; expected ' fourth ' ( 79 ) correct ( ' et ' ) => ' et ' ( 20 ) ; expected ' set ' ( 325 ) 可能な修正候補の列挙 argmax c 。我々のプログラムは編集 距
離2以内のすべての修正を列挙する。開発セットで編集距離が2より大きくなるのは270語のうち3語だけだが、最終テストセットでは400語中に23語あ

離3も含めるようにモデルを拡張することも可能だ。たとえば、母音の隣への母音の挿入、母音の他の母音への置換、 " c " と " s " のような近い子音間の置換について編集距離3を含めるなら、これらのケースのほとんどを正しく扱えるようになる。
第 4 の ( そして最良の ) 改善方法がある。 correct のインタフェースをもっとコンテキストを見るように変更するというものだ。これまでは、 correct は1度に1つの単語しか見ていなかった。しかし多くのケースでは、1つの単語だけで正しい判断をするのは困難だ。テストセットが辞書に載っている語を他の語に修正すべきと言っているような場合を考 ればよくわかると思う。 correct ( ' where ' ) => ' where ' ( 123 ) ; expected ' were ' ( 452 ) correct ( ' latter ' ) => ' latter ' ( 11 ) ; expected ' later ' ( 116 ) correct ( ' advice ' ) => ' advice ' ( 64 ) ; expected ' advise ' ( 20 ) correct ( ' where ' ) が、ある場合には ' were ' と修正し、別な場合には ' where ' のままとすべきであるというのはわかりようがない。しかし問い合わせが correct ( ' They where going ' ) であるなら 、" where " は " were " と修正した方が良さそうだとわかる。 明らかな誤りに対し、いい修正候補が複数ある場合にも、周りにある語のコンテキストが助けになる。以下の場合を考えてみよう。 correct ( ' hown ' ) => ' how ' ( 1316 ) ; expected ' shown ' ( 114 ) correct ( ' ther ' ) => ' the' ( 81031 ) ; expected ' their ' ( 3956 ) correct ( ' quies ' ) => ' quiet ' ( 119 ) ; expected ' queries ' ( 1 ) correct ( ' natior ' ) => ' nation ' ( 170 ) ; expected ' nature ' ( 171 ) correct ( ' thear ' ) => ' their ' ( 3956 ) ; expected ' there ' ( 4973 ) correct ( ' carrers ' ) => ' carriers ' ( 7 ) ; expected ' careers ' ( 2 ) どうして ' thear ' を ' their ' でなく ' there ' と修正すべきなのだろう ?
単独の単語だけで言うのは難しいが、質問が correct ( ' There 's no there thear ' ) であるなら答えは明らかだ。 複数の語を同時に見るモデルを構築するにはずっと多くのデータが必要になる。Googleはdatabase of word counts をリリースしており、これ
は1兆語のコーパスから集められた5語までのシーケンスの出現数となっている。
90%の正確さを達成するスペル修正プログラムは選択に当たって周りの語のコンテキストを使う必要があると思える。しかしこれはまたの機会に することにしよう･･･
トレーニングデータとテストデータを改善することで正確さのスコアを上げることができる。我々は100万語のテキストを取り、それが正しく綴られているものと仮定した。しかしレーニングデータにもいくつか誤りが含まれているというのは大いにありそうだ。それらの誤りを見つけて修正することもできる。もう少し楽な作業としては、テストセットを修正するというのがある。テストケースはプログラムが間違っていると言っているが、プログラムの答の方がテストケースの期待する答よりも適切と思えるケースが少なくとも3つあった。 correct ( ' aranging ' ) => ' arranging ' ( 20 ) ; expected ' arrangeing ' ( 1 ) correct ( ' sumarys ' ) => ' summary ' ( 17 ) ; expected ' summarys ' ( 1 ) correct ( ' aurgument ' ) => ' argument ' ( 33 ) ; expected ' auguments ' ( 1 ) トレーニングする方言を決めるとい手もある。以下の3つの誤りは、アメリカ英語とイギリス英語のスペルの混乱によるものだ
( トレーニングデータにはどちらも含まれている )。 correct ( ' humor ' ) => ' humor ' ( 17 ) ; expected ' humour ' ( 5 ) correct ( ' oranisation ' ) => ' organisation ' ( 8 ) ; expected ' organization ' ( 43 ) correct ( ' oranised ' ) => ' organised ' ( 11 ) ; expected ' organized ' ( 70 ) 最後に、結果を変えることなくプログラムが高速化するように実装を改善することができる。インタプリタ言語でなく、コンパイル言語で実装し直すこともできる。Pythonの汎用的なdictのかわりに、文字列に特化したルックアップテーブルを使うことも可能だ。計算結果をキャッシュして、同じ計算を繰り返さないようにすることもできる。アドバイスを1つ。スピードに関する最適化をする前に、注意深くプロファイリングし、実際にどこで時間がかかっているのかよく調べることだ。

I 've got a really good system -- as far as I know it 's never crashed .
But recently I was accessed by a new server on the east port .
I uploaded some freeware to ensure a good connection , but it did n't work .
It 's degraded my port and looks like it might invade my system .
What can I do ?
Nothing , I 'm afraid .
You 've got the Civilization virus .
At this time there is no known fix : no immunization , no firewall , no repair .
Prepare yourself for a total crash .
It 's going to take down your operating system , corrupt your drives , erase your memory , and pollute your motherboard .
Oh shit !
Is there any hope of recovery ?
The easiest thing to do is throw the whole thing in the trash and start over .
But if you 're really attached to your hardware , you might be able to save it .
First , back up your BIOS and put it somewhere safe .
Then wait for the virus to run its course -- it wo n't take long , maybe 500 years .
When the system 's totally dead , do a reformat and a clean install .
The problem is , most of your components will be toast , and you 'll have to replace them with something different .
But if you 've got the BIOS , you should be able to make an operating system to work with whatever you 've got .
Good luck !

My system has spectacular resources and potential , but it 's barely creeping along .
I think my network administrator is using my system to do his work , and he 's prohibited use of my westward expansion ports .
I want to disconnect from the network , but I 'm totally dependent on it -- I 'm using his operating system and his hardware to access the outside .
It will take some work , but you can do it .
The first thing you 've got to do is give notice and disconnnect .
If your administrator 's an asshole -- and they usually are -- he 'll send some malware to try to force you to reconnect .
But if your cleanup tools are the most updated versions , you 'll be fine .
The next problem is , you 'll have to run on your boot disk for a while until you can develop your own operating system .
And you also need to build a new network hub .
But those are good things to do per se .
Too many people just hold onto the old framework and keep patching it up as it gets more and more clunky .

Me again !
I 'm developing the new OS and I need some help .
First off , it 's always good to look at the original BIOS that came with the motherboard .
In your case that would be the Iroquois version .
I know it wo n't do a lot of stuff that you want it to do , but it 's stable .
The more you can incorporate from that , the better .
Next , make sure you do a clean install every now and then -- otherwise your system gets cluttered up with old files and gets more and more buggy until it crashes .
Put a reminder somewhere , something like , " The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants . "
Yes , I 'll do it .
Thanks !

I 'm a network administrator and a big part of my network is threatening to break off .
The problem is , they 're using a different master - slave protocol for the IDE bus , and it 's incompatible with my operating system .
But my business was just about to take off before this happened -- I really need to preserve the network !
I 'm assuming you do n't want to abandon the master - slave configuration in general , just hold onto your clients and get them to adopt your system .
You 're in luck !
The protocol they 're using , Chattel , is obsolete .
As operant density increases , they 'll have to switch to the Wage protocol , and then they 'll be compatible again , and you can probably get them back .
A more risky option , which I do n't recommend , is to force compliance , cripple their system so badly that they 'll let you go in and reconfigure it immediately .
The nice thing is , this will optimize your whole network for strong central management .
But it 's going to cause resentments that give you no end of trouble .

What are the pros and cons of the new sub-U.R.B. configuration ?
The idea behind the sub -URB is that if all the components are modularized and standardized , with uniform connections to the CPU , the CPU can effectively manage a much larger system .
The drawback is , components are no longer able to share utilities , share memory , or interface directly with each other -- everything has to go through the CPU .
This makes the whole system rigid and inefficient .
The sub -URB architecture permits an enormous number of expansion slots , but they tend to fill up with redundant and unnecessary peripherals .
It consumes massive amounts of power and will sooner or later burn out your power supply .
Also , the best components tend to be incompatible with the sub -URB interface .
If you try to force them in , they 'll either undermine your system or burn out .

My kids think they know everything about computers .
They say my system 's full of bugs , that it does n't work any more , and they want to reformat the hard drive and do a clean install of an open - source operating system .
The thought of a clean install terrifies me !
Wo n't I lose everything ?
I think my system just needs a few patches .
I always recommend doing a clean install with every new generation , but almost nobody does it , and their systems still keep creaking along .
If you do it now you can at least back up most of your data first .
If you wait too long , you will lose everything .

My system just does n't have any punch any more .
I 've got a lot of peripherals and high - demand processes and I do n't have enough power or CPU time .
What can I do ?
You have two options .
I recommend you optimize your system , scale it back , use energy - saving technologies , accept that it 's not going to give you everything all the time .
Your other option , which I do n't recommend , is to get a bigger power supply and overclock your CPU .
That will give you some flashy performance in the short term , but it tends to burn out your CPU , and eventually you 're still going to hit a wall .

Help me !
Everything 's going wrong at once .
My power supply is failing , my components are disconnecting for no reason , my operating system does n't recognize anything , my anti-virus software is consuming massive resources and doing nothing , and everyone on my network hates me .
I think I 've traced the problem to the resident bus .
How do I replace it ?
The resident bus does n't like to be removed !
You can try to uninstall it from your control panel , and if that does n't work you can go into the system properties and try to disable the driver .
But probably the only way is to open the case and pull it out physically .
I can't do that !
I 'm afraid I 'll break something !
I 'm sorry , but your system is already broken .
Looking at your history , it 's a miracle that it 's running at all .
You would n't have this problem with the resident bus if you were n't overclocking , overconsuming power , overloaded with peripherals , using unstable BIOS and a top - heavy operating system , fixing everything with patches , and forcing your components into an inflexible and wasteful configuration .
Honestly , even if you remove the resident bus , that 's only a shallow fix .
You need to redesign your whole system from the bottom up .
I need my system the way it is .
Sounds to me like you just hate computers !

I found an old system in the trash .
It 's mostly burned out but it has a classic motherboard .
I was able to switch out the dead stuff and optimize the hardware for efficiency and stability , but I can't find a compatible BIOS .

Someone uploaded it a long time ago .
Actually , not that long .
Some hawks remain .
Mr. Cheney is the most prominent , of course , and by all accounts he is as unyielding as ever in the administration ’s internal debates .
But his public statements are often more muted than before the Iraq war , when he argued that toppling Saddam Hussein would remake the Middle East .
Mr. Cheney is supported by a dwindling band of loyalists , including John Hannah , who succeeded Mr. Libby as the vice president ’s national security adviser but seems to wield little of his clout .
At the White House , J. D. Crouch , the deputy national security adviser , who headed the group that devised the administration ’s strategy to increase troops in Iraq , and Elliott Abrams , who leads global democracy strategy , are known for their relatively hawkish views .
Mr. Abrams has assembled a team pressing internally to step up pressure on Iran , a strategy Mr. Bush has endorsed as a way to gain leverage over Tehran .
But that was considered a rare victory .
“ With the exception of a few — including the vice president — the hawks have returned to their nests , ” said one of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice ’s top aides who viewed Mr. Joseph and others as seeking to block the give and take of negotiations .
Mr. Joseph , now 57 and preparing for a life as a speaker , consultant and part - time presidential envoy on proliferation issues , is careful not to criticize either Mr. Bush or Ms. Rice , both of whom he says he admires .
But he declares as a fact what many still inside the administration will not : Iraq has taken the steel out of the administration ’s diplomacy in the second term .
“ Iraq , ” Mr. Joseph said over lunch last week , shortly after he left his job , “ inhibits taking actions that could be perceived as provocative . ”
He and his former colleagues wonder whether many of the actions that came to define Mr. Bush ’s first term — when they scrapped the ABM treaty , walked away from the Kyoto Protocol on climate change and raised pre-emptive strikes to the status of a doctrine in the first National Security Strategy — would happen today .
In the first term , as he moved between his office at the National Security Council and frequent meetings with Mr. Bush and Ms. Rice , then the national security adviser , Mr. Joseph ’s influence was evident in a wide constellation of issues .
US の VA Software社がSourceForge社に社名変更した。取り立てて大したこととは思ってなかった
ので、これについて喋る機会があったことすら驚きだったのだが、今日お会いした
ITmediaの藤村会長からもそれに触れる話が出たので、経緯をちょいと書いてみる。
古き日のUSに存在していたVA Linux Systems社が、Linuxハードウェアビジネスというか
オープンソースソフトウェアのビジネスからも撤退したのが2001年。その時に残った 事業は、Slashdot.org、Linux.com、ThinkGeek、SourceForge.netといったサイトを有する メディア事業とSourceForge.netのようなことをエンタープライズ向けに提供するために
スクラッチから書き出したSourceForge
Enterprise Editionというクローズドな ソフトウェア事業の二つである。メディア事業の方は子会社であり、その名前が
Open Source Development Network社であり、数年前か らOpen Source Technology Group社 と名乗っていた企業である。
ということで、2001年からはLinuxでもないオープンソースでもない企業(OSDNは子会社である)
ということで、実態に合わせるためにVA Software社に社名変更していた。
で、日本においてであるが、住友商事、NTTコムウェアらと合弁で
VA Linux Systems Japan株式会社が、2001 年のVA
Linux Systems社 のLinuxビジネス撤退直前の 絶妙なタイミングで設立されてしまった。設立当時から日本の独自の事業を展開するという
意向が働いてはいたが、当然のようにVA
Linux Systems社の日本法人的な役割を持たせる ということがあったわけで、設立したらいきなりその事業がUSから消えてしまったわけである。
しょうがないので 、VA Linux Systems Japan社としては完全に独自な事業を開始せねばならない 立場になり、住友商事側もLinux/OSSビジネスはこれからやってくるのだからということで、
VA Linux Systems社側が持っていたVA Linux Systems Japan社の株式を引き取り、住友商事の 子会社となった。事業としては、Linuxカーネルを含め、その他OSの知識、技術を活かしたビジネス
を開始することになり、その後うまく人材も集めることができたおかげで、 今も屋台骨となっているVA Questを中心としたLinuxカーネルビジネスに発展することになった。
このような経緯から 、VA Linux Systems Japan社はほとんどの時間を日本企業として存在し、 さらに独自のLinuxカーネルを中心として低レイヤーのオープンソースビジネスを作りだして
きたということになる。 これに対して、VA Software社はクローズドでWebベースのソフトウェアビジネスを展開し、
さらに資本のつながりも希薄であったので、この数年間は
世界には同じロゴを持つ二つのVAが奇妙な関係で存在していた。
そこでやっと現在の話にまでくるが、先月になってVA Software社はそのソフトウェア事業を CollabNet社に売却した 。Open Source Technology Groupが展開するメディア事業の 方が、収益性、成長性共に断然によい状態が続いていたので、これは妥当な判断だと思っている。
ここで社名変更へとつながるのだが、当然VA Software社という名前がその時点で完全に 実態に合わない名前となってしまったわけで、メディア事業のブランドの中から一番の
有力なブランドであるSourceForgeという名前を選び、それを社名としたわけである。
当然、日本 のVA Linux Systems Japanは経緯的なことを考えても 特段の関係があるわけではないし、Linuxカーネルを中心としているビジネスでうまくまわっている 今の現状を考えると、VA Linuxという名前を捨てる理由はない。古き日の一瞬だけUSで 輝いていた旧VA Linux Systems社の遺伝子を継いでいるとしたら、この日本の VA Linux Systems Japan社だけである。それを考えれば、VA Softwareというロゴを共有しつつも 全く違う会社が存在する状況がなくなったのは、余計な勘違いの元を断ち切ったことになるので
VA Linux Systems Japan社にとっては良いことだろう。VA Linuxは世界に一つで十分である。
( と、ここま でVA Linux Systems Japan社のマーケティング的人間の立場で書いたが、現在の私は
マーケティング部長を4月に退任し、今はそのUSのSourceForge社が運営するメデァアの 日本版とな るSlashdot Japan , SourceForge.jp , Open Tech Pressを運営する事業のトップだけに 専念している。なので 、US のSourceForge社( 旧OSTG 社 ) とは、それなりに密接な関係であることは 付け加えておく。 )

It 's probably fair to say it does n't have the most exciting taste in the world .
But if you like cucumber and melon - and have £ 5 to spare - the latest healthy superfruit could be for you .
scroll down for more
The purple - striped ' melumber ' - officially known as the pepino - tastes like a cross between a melon and a cucumber .
It has just gone on sale in Britain and claims of its health benefits meant it sold out within hours .
There is a waiting list for the next batch of the South American fruit - a relative of the tomato - at London store Selfridges .
Ewan Venters , of the department store , said : " We initially had a stock of 30 and sold out on the first day .
" We now have a waiting list of customers eager to try this new ' vegefruit ' . "
Pepinos have a high potassium content , which can help lower blood pressure , and are packed with vitamins A , B and C - all of which protect against cancer and heart disease .
They are also ideal for dieters as a 100g serving contains only 23 calories .
The seeded fruit is shaped like a melon and grows to about the size of a goose egg .
It can be eaten as a pudding or an appetiser .
When introduced into Japan , the pepino started a craze and its price soon outstripped that of meat .
In the Far East the fruits are often wrapped , boxed and tied with ribbons to be given as gifts .
While common across South America , pepinos have rarely been seen in Europe , although enterprising farmers in France have started growing them .

Sue Baic , from the British Dietetic Association , said : " Fruits such as pepinos which are high in potassium help lower blood pressure , and are good treatment for high blood pressure .
" Vitamins A , B and C are antioxidants which help protect against cancer and heart disease . "
But she expressed concern that the high price tag could convince some customers they could get all their ' five a day ' nutrients from just one fruit .
" It seems like this fruit has the same qualities as any fruit and vegetables , " she said .
" If you have a range of different fruit and vegetables you are likely to get all these nutrients anyway , although it might be a more concentrated amount in the pepino . "
Other superfruits include antioxidant - rich blueberries - which have been praised for their anti-ageing properties - and strawberries , which are thought to help ward off heart disease .
Mozilla Firefox 2.0 is finding it difficult to breathe with the saturation that Microsoft is delivering by pushing Internet Explorer 7 via Automatic Updates .
This is the conclusion presented by Web metrics company Janco Associates .
The management consulting firm has revealed that Internet Explorer 7 has impacted the adoption rate of Firefox , and of the version 2.0 in particular , due to the fact that Microsoft 's browser is delivered as an automatic update to the desktops of Windows users .
" We 've started to see a stabilization of the marketplace , " said Victor Janulaitis , Janco's CEO .
" In three years , IE lost about 15 % of the market share , but we 're now seeing that leveling off . "
Market Share by Net Applications confirmed the fact that Microsoft has managed to contain over two years of continual browser market share loss .
Janco Associates has correlated the fact that Firefox 's growth rate has diminished with the IE7 distribution via Automatic updates .
Firefox managed to jump only from 12.5 % to 13.4 % since December 2006 until March 2007 , while Internet Explore increased its market share from 67.5 % to 70.5 % , in the same period , according to Janco Associates .
Other analysts however do not share the perspective of Janco Associates .
Geoff Johnston , an analyst at WebSideStory Inc. said : " I 'm surprised at how well Firefox has done since IE7 came out .
It looks like the forced migration of IE7 is helping Firefox . "
WebSideStory puts Firefox at 13.7 % and IE at 82 % of the market .
Both Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 2.0 have experienced market share fluctuations in January 2007 , reveals data published by Market Share by Net Applications .
Still , in February 2007 , the browsers returned to their past trends .
Market Share gives IE 79.9 % of the browser market and 14.18 % to Firefox .
I wish I could have gone to a school like this .

But these are just boring facts , the real magic is how nice it looks .

This installation is the first non-government BIPV system with grid-connection .
The experiences have also contributed to establishing the Technical Guidelines on grid connection of small - scale renewable energy power systems which was published by EMSD of HKSAR Government .
The project has identified several non-technical barriers with local utility , as a result standard grid-connection fee and insurance of PV system have been offered by the utility .
Split responsibility of maintenance has also been an issue since the maintenance responsibility of the BIPV system and the school structure belong to different parties .
Potential educational benefits of this system have been proved by overwhelming responses from different parties including teachers , students and the local community .
Numerous educational activities on renewable energy have been developed as a result of this project . ( via )

The office of North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper will announce that he is dismissing all charges against three Duke Lacrosse players , ABC News has learned from sources close to the case .
Special prosecutors from the Attorney General 's office took over the case after Durham District Attorney Mike Nifong recused himself in January , citing charges of unethical conduct filed against him by the North Carolina Bar .
Since then , Jim Coman and Mary Winstead have examined the case from scratch , interviewing key witnesses and working through reams of evidence .
The reasons that will be cited for the dismissal are not yet known , though the case has been riddled with criticism and colored by controversy since its early months .
Defense attorneys released documents showing the accuser changed key details of her story in the weeks and months after the alleged assault .
Legal analysts and forensic experts have criticized what they call a critically flawed photo identification lineup — a lineup that led to the identification and indictment of Evans , Finnerty , Seligmann .
No DNA evidence was found matching any lacrosse players with samples from the rape kit , while DNA from unidentified men was found on the accuser 's body and clothing .
Again ... I call for Nifong to be imprisoned , and for the accused to sue the crap out of every civil rights group , hate group , faculty member , Jesse Jackson , Duke , and the state for every dime they can squeeze out of them .
The mouse wheel is so integral to my mousing experience now that it 's difficult to imagine using a GUI without one .
Although I clearly remember using mice without scroll wheels , I can't recall exactly when the transition occurred -- when mouse wheels became a standard , expected feature on every mouse as they are today .
The first reference to a mouse with a wheel I can find is the Genius EasyScroll mouse , which was released in 1995 .
With those terrible aesthetics , it 's not surprising that mouse wheels were n't truly popularized until the first Microsoft Intellimouse was released in 1996 .
I would argue that the mouse wheel is the first true mouse innovation since the invention of the mouse itself .
Given its importance , I 've often wondered exactly how the mouse wheel was invented , but I could never find a source of any kind .
Matt Young was kind enough to forward me a link finally revealing who invented the mouse wheel : Microsoft 's Eric Michelman , as described in his article The History of the Scroll Wheel :
Back in 1993 , as I was watching many Excel users do their work , I noticed the difficulty they had moving around large spreadsheets .
Finding and jumping to different sections was often difficult .
I had the idea that perhaps a richer input device would help .
My original idea was the zoom lever .
This was simply a lever , presumably for your non-mouse hand ( i.e. on the left side of your keyboard if you 're right - handed ) .
When you push it away from you the spreadsheet zooms out .
When you pull it towards you , it zooms back in .
I prototyped this by hooking a joystick up to my computer and using DDE to connect it to Excel for zooming .
Using a joystick button along with the stick , I also had it do " data zooming " , which was drilling in and out through Excel outlines .
This all seemed useful , so I showed it to the Hardware division at Microsoft .
They were initially cool to the idea , which I presented as a zoom lever , and it did n't go anywhere at that point .
At this point most people thought it was kind of wacky .
Focusing on zooming was a very Excel - centric approach .
More specifically , it was a very 2 - D centric approach .
That is , using an application that presents 2 - dimensional data , like a spreadsheet or graphics , it 's very useful to zoom in and out .
But the other main style of application is a linear flow application like Word , and there it 's not as useful .
You could do zooming with Word , where zooming out shows you a multi- page view and then you click on a desired page and zoom into it , but that 's not as natural as with a spreadsheet or graphics and images .
A number of people suggested adding panning and scrolling functionality .
In particular I remember Chris Graham saying zooming was just too limiting and it should pan as well .
In response to this feedback , I added panning to the prototype , so moving the joystick side - to - side and back - and - forth scrolled Excel in the corresponding direction .
Around this time , the hardware guys came back and said that they had considered adding a wheel to the mouse , but they did n't know what it would be used for .
Document navigation answered that question , so they said that if I could get Office to support it , they would build it .
This really meant Excel and Word since they were the " 800 lb gorillas " -- if Excel and Word supported something , then the other Office apps would follow , and if Office as a whole supported something , then everyone else would follow too ( this was the early 1993 when Office was the heart of most people 's computer usage ) .
Eric was completely fixated on the idea that the wheel should be for zooming by default , but finally relented when he met resistance from legendary technology journalist Walt Mossberg .
Before they shipped it , they added a button under the wheel , and made the default wheel action " scroll " .
The rest , as they say , is history .
After that , mouse wheels -- and the third mouse button under the wheel -- quickly became popular , standard features on every mouse .
Although work started on this feature in 1993 , and the hardware did n't ship until 1996 , the first mouse wheel patent filing from Microsoft is dated 1999 .
So here 's to you , mouse wheel .
Whether you 're zooming or scrolling , we owe you -- and Eric Michelman -- a debt of gratitude .
The Shuttle Launch Experience gives riders a taste of liftoff .
Imagine being in a dragster , peeling out from zero to 100 in three seconds , then keeping your foot to the floor for a full six minutes until you reach 17,500 mph .
On Friday , the Kennedy Space Center will open the Shuttle Launch Experience , an amusement - ride - cum - astronaut - flight - simulator designed to mimic the 17,500 - mph liftoff of a NASA shuttle orbiter .
The 44,000 - square - foot attraction is n't just a ride ; it 's a flight simulator on par with what astronauts in training experience , says Bob Rogers , CEO of BRC Imagination Arts , which built it .
" This is n't an imaginary flight , " says Rogers .
" This is real . "
The $ 60 million project employs seat rumblers and shakers that rattle riders through the turbulent main engine start , the firing of the solid rocket boosters and then their separation .
Air bags in each seat sink and rise to capture the sensation of extreme acceleration .
The shuttle 's windshield , an 84 - inch high - def screen , is enveloped in fire when the external tanks separate .
Inside the capsule , riders are subject to an onslaught of 13 - channel sound , from the roar of the engines to the commander barking instructions .
Low - frequency sound vibrates the riders ' chests , evoking the feeling of being unable to breathe .
To get the sensations , sights and sounds absolutely accurate , creators spent three years interviewing more than two dozen shuttle astronauts , who weighed in on everything from the whitish - yellow debris that spatters across the shuttle 's windshield when the rocket boosters separate to the creaking of the cabin and other ambient sounds astronauts hear during a launch .
According to Rogers , some astronauts who have experienced the exhibit have reported it to be more realistic than some of NASA 's and the military 's own training simulators .
It is the first in a series of new exhibits opening at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex during the next decade .
" We take the technology and pizazz of theme parks , Broadway and Hollywood and put those things in the framework of education , " says Rogers .

APRIL 26 -- A Pennsylvania woman claims that her teaching career has been derailed by college administrators who unfairly disciplined her over a MySpace photo that shows her wearing a pirate hat and drinking from a plastic cup .
In a federal lawsuit , Stacy Snyder charges that Millersville University brass accused her of promoting underage drinking after they discovered her MySpace photo , which was captioned " Drunken Pirate . "
The picture from Snyder 's MySpace page ( which she says was snapped at a costume party outside school hours ) can be seen at left .
In her complaint , Snyder , a 25 - year - old single mother of two , says that Millersville officials discovered the image last May , while she was a senior working as a student - teacher at Conestoga Valley High School .
A university official told her that the photo was " unprofessional " and could have offended her students if they accessed her MySpace page .
At the time the " Drunken Pirate " photo was taken , Snyder was of legal age to drink , though her lawsuit notes that the photo " does not show the cup 's contents . "
An excerpt from Snyder 's lawsuit , which was filed yesterday in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia , can be found here .
Despite good grades and solid performance evaluations , Snyder claims that school officials improperly denied her a bachelor of science in education degree and a teaching certificate .
The university , Snyder added , instead granted her a bachelor of arts degree last May 13 .
Because the school refuses to confirm that she satisfactorily completed her student teaching requirements , Snyder claims that she has been unable to secure certification from Pennsylvania 's Department of Education .
Snyder 's lawyer , Mark Voigt , told TSG that his client now works as a nanny .
He added that school officials should actually be " celebrating " Snyder , a mother of two young children who returned to school to get a teaching degree .

WASHINGTON , March 14 - Senate Republicans on Tuesday narrowly defeated an effort to impose budget rules that would make it harder to increase spending or cut taxes , a move that critics said that showed Republicans were posturing in their calls for greater fiscal restraint .
In the first of several politically charged budget and spending issues confronting Congress this week , the Senate rejected on a 50 - to - 50 tie a proposal to restore what are known as " pay - go " rules , a requirement that tax cuts and some new spending be approved by 60 votes or offset by budget savings or revenue increases .
Democrats and a handful of Republican allies said that the added discipline was essential to getting a handle on the mounting federal debt and that the rules had been instrumental in reducing red ink before they were allowed to lapse in 2002 .
" For those who say they are fiscally responsible , here is your chance , " said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota , senior Democrat on the Budget Committee .
" You are going to be able to prove with one vote whether you are serious about doing something about these runaway debts and runaway deficits or whether it is all talk . "

As wealthy people attempt to flee America , the U.S. Government is planning to rob them at gunpoint with a tax on UNREALIZED gains on their property !
Via : DESCRIPTION OF THE CHAIRMANâ€™S MODIFICATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE â€ œSMALL BUSINESS AND WORK OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2007â€  Scheduled for Markup by the SENATE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE on January 17 , 2007 Prepared by the Staff of the JOINT COMMITTEE ON TAXATION January 17 , 2007 JCX - 5-07 :
The proposal generally subjects certain U.S. citizens who relinquish their U.S. citizenship and certain long - term U.S. residents who terminate their U.S. residence to tax on the net unrealized gain in their property as if such property were sold for fair market value on the day before the expatriation or residency termination ( â€œmark - to - market taxâ€ ) .
Gain from the deemed sale is taken into account at that time without regard to other Code provisions .
Any loss from the deemed sale generally is taken into account to the extent otherwise provided in the Code , except that the wash sale rules of section 1091 do not apply .
Any net gain on the deemed sale is recognized to the extent it exceeds $ 600,000 ( $ 1.2 million in the case of married individuals filing a joint return , both of whom relinquish citizenship or terminate residency ) .

The Devil is Dying Mysterious Facial Cancer Threatens Symbol of Tasmania
The Tasmanian Devil , an icon of the island after which it is named , is on the verge of extinction as a contagious facial cancer decimates the animals .
It 's an epidemic of a kind never seen before and scientists are desperately trying to create a vaccine .
One of the “ fun ” things about working in an IT office environment is how often you have to sit through some agonising over - long pointless presentation that sucks the very life - force out of you .
It has been said that one should never ascribe to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity but I am starting to suspect their is some sort of secret management cabal that meets in dark caves to plot ways to torture us poor workers .
The Society for Cruel and Unusual Management perhaps ?
And its graduates are given the title of official Developer of Really Odious Presentations .
The weapon of choice for these SCUMDROPs is without doubt Microsoft ’s PowerPoint .
If you ’ve never experienced someone attempting to inflict Death by PowerPoint , count yourself lucky .
I have heard people say that this is n’t the fault of PowerPoint , it ’s the fault of the presenters .
Yeah , right – guns do n’t kill people , people kill people .
It ’s just that someone with lots of guns has a head start on killing lots of people and these SCUMDROPs would n’t be half as dangerous without PowerPoint in their arsenal .
You get over 7 million hits on Google for Death by PowerPoint but my favourite online resource for showing the horrible potential of PowerPoint to destroy a presentation was done by Peter Norvig .
He has constructed a PowerPoint version of one of the most famous speeches in modern history , Abraham Lincoln ’s Gettysburg Address .
This devilspawn software effortlessly reduces one of the most powerful pieces of oratory ever into meaningless drivel with dot points and charts .
Much like every business presentation I ’ve ever seen .
Apart from the fact the presentations in question were probably never going to be great oratory in the first place .
Recently I had the misfortune of being subjected to one of the worst excesses in Death by PowerPoint I can imagine .
I was working for a company that was looking to acquire an ERP system to run the finances and logistics for their nation - wide business .
This is a fairly big ticket purchase so there were a lot of vendors vying for the contract .
Included in the contenders was one of the biggest international players in this field ( I wo n’t mention them by name but they ’re known by the acronym of their German name which rhymes , appropriately enough , with CRAP )
Like all of the vendors they were allocated one hour to make their initial pitch .
They were told this ahead of time : “ You have ONE HOUR to explain your product to us . ”
Their presentation was obviously the company ’s standard one and it involved 85 PowerPoint slides .
85 !
What made it worse was nearly all of them were animated , often involving sound and ALL of them were too complicated to understand by simply looking at them .
And they barrelled through them in less than 60 minutes .
More than a slide a minute when it would have taken a minute just to read the words that were on each slide .
So the audience were barraged with an hour of whooshing noises , flying text and blinking lights that left us all exhausted and more confused than when we started .
It absolutely boggles my mind that when several million dollars are at stake , a supposedly world - leading company would not take the time to put together a presentation that would actually be meaningful to a potential customer .
Maybe I ’m giving the presenters in question too much credit but they could not possibly have though any audience was going to enjoy being rushed through so many slides in an hour .
The real problem is that there were too many slides for any length of time and they were far too complicated but their crimes was made exponentially worse by cramming it all into an hour .
Any rational person would say that this is only going to end badly for the company in question .
The only conclusion I could draw ( besides the possibility that the presenters were clinically insane ) is that they thought they could overwhelm us with the sheer volume of their presentation .
Then when we were too weak and dazed to struggle they could force us to sign a contract .
Needless to say , they shot themselves in the head at this meeting and we never spoke to them again .
I was going to say they shot themselves in the foot but seriously , these guys had the barrel in their mouth when they pulled the trigger .
If anyone can explain to me how travesties like this continue to happen in the corporate world I ’d really like to hear your thoughts .
Every available piece of literature says DON ’T DO THIS and yet it continues to happen .
I can almost forgive a clueless middle manager who is simply committing a sin of ignorance but this was from a supposedly world - leading IT company !
I would be wishing for this company to collapse under its own weight but they ’re so bloated their collapse would form a black hole that would destroy us all .
There are a million guides out there to help you avoid committing truly horrible crimes against humanity with PowerPoint .
For god ’s sake , do everyone a favour and read some of them before your next presentation .
If you think I ’m exaggerating you have n’t seen how bad things can get .
I ’m sure in the deepest , darkest pits of Gitmo there are gathered the world ’s most evil SCUMDROPs who work in teams to force detainees to watch 3 hour PowerPoint presentations .
And each slide features animated text , charts and red writing on black backgrounds .
One thing you ’ll probably find if you read a few different guides is that they will contradict each other in places .
It ’s more art than science and you ’ll have to decide for yourself who ’s opinion you agree with .
Whichever guide you choose , remember the following three points over everything else – the rest is just detail :
PowerPoint is no good for explaining complex concepts :
You can use it to illustrate or support points but you ca n’t use it to teach .
You have to be working closely with your subjects to teach anything complex or worthwhile – you ca n’t do it with words on a screen .
PowerPoint is no good for words : A picture paints a thousand words but a thousand words will be the PowerPoint presentation from hell .
If you think you need to provide your audience with lots of words then POWERPOINT IS THE WRONG TOOL !
Do n’t use it just because it exists , use the appropriate medium .
The printed word has served humanity well for centuries , try going with that .
PowerPoint is no good for inspiring an audience :
It can work with basic reporting of data , it can reinforce or support points but it simply is n’t inspiring .
A good speaker can inspire an audience but not with PowerPoint .
You ca n’t reach out to an audience with PowerPoint , it actually distances you from them , it gets in the way .
In short : PowerPoint – just say no .
Do it for the children .
Wo n’t somebody please think of the children ?
And if that does n’t sway you , remember this : guns do n’t kill people , people who have been forced to sit through one too many truly horrible PowerPoint presentations kill people .
And the presenter is usually the first victim .

Victory has a thousand fathers , but defeat is an orphan , said a rueful John F. Kennedy after the Bay of Pigs.
George W. Bush knows today whereof his predecessor spoke .
For as he prepares to “ surge ” 20,000 more U.S. troops into a war even he concedes we “ are not winning , ” his erstwhile acolytes have begun to abandon him to salvage their own tattered reputations .
Case in point , the neoconservatives .
As the Iraq war heads into its fifth year , more than half a dozen have confessed to Vanity Fair ’s David Rose their abject despair over how the Bushites mismanaged the war that they , the “ Vulcans , ” so brilliantly conceived .
Surveying what appears an impending disaster for Iraq and U.S. foreign policy , the neocons have advanced a new theme .
The idea of launching an unprovoked war of liberation , for which they had beaten the drums for half a decade before 9 - 11 , remains a lovely concept .
It was Bushite incompetence that fouled it up .
“ The policy can be absolutely right , and noble , beneficial , but if you ca n’t execute it , it ’s useless , just useless , ” wails Ken Adelman , who had famously predicted in The Washington Post that “ liberating Iraq would be a cakewalk . ”
Bush ’s team of Powell , Cheney , Rumsfeld and Rice , says Adelman , “ turned out to be among the most incompetent teams in the postwar era .
Not only did each of them , individually , have enormous flaws , but together they were deadly , dysfunctional . ”
Their incompetence , he adds , “ means that most everything we ever stood for … lies in ruins . ”
Professor Eliot Cohen of Johns Hopkins , whose book on war leaders Bush used to carry about , says his mistake was in not knowing “ how incredibly incompetent ” the Bush team would be .
Richard Perle is sickened by the consequences of the war he and his comrades so ardently championed .
“ The levels of brutality … are truly horrifying , and , I have to say , I underestimated the depravity . ”
Calling the Bush policy process a “ disaster , ” Perle blames Bush himself : “ At the end of the day , you have to hold the president responsible . …
I do n’t think he realizes the extent of the opposition within his own administration , and the disloyalty . ”
This is the second fallback position of the War Party .
Not only incompetence , but treachery made a nightmare of their vision .
ber - hawk Frank Gaffney also hits hard the theme of sabotage and disloyalty : “ This president has tolerated , and the people around him have tolerated , active , ongoing , palpable insubordination and skullduggery that translates into subversion of his policies .
…
He does n’t in fact seem to be a man of principle who ’s steadfastly pursuing what he thinks is the right course . ”
David Frum , the cashiered White House speechwriter who co-authored the “ axis - of - evil ” phrase , faults the president .
While he provided the words , says Frum , Bush “ just did not absorb the ideas .
And that is the root of maybe everything . ”
Where Frum , four years ago , accused antiwar conservatives of being “ unpatriotic ” haters of America and President Bush , he is now saying that that same president either lacked the I.Q. to realize what he was saying or lacked a belief and commitment to follow through .
As Rose writes , this is “ the most damning assessment of all . ”
Moreover , it is an indictment of Bush ’s judgment that he could clasp so many such vipers to his bosom .
Rose describes James Woolsey , the ex-CIA director who was ubiquitous on the op - ed pages and national TV making the case for war , as “ aghast at what he sees as profound American errors that have ignored the lessons learned so painfully , 40 years ago ” in Vietnam .
Conspicuous by its absence from disparagements of the president by these deserters from his camp and cause is any sense that they were themselves wrong .
That they , who accuse everyone else of cutting and running , are themselves cutting and running .
That they are themselves but a typical cluster of think - tank incompetents .
No neocon concedes that the very idea itself of launching an unprovoked war against a country in the heart of the Arab world — one that had not attacked us , did not threaten us and did not want war with us — might not be wildly welcomed by the “ liberated . ”
No neocon has yet conceded that Bismarck may have been right when he warned , “ Preventive war is like committing suicide out of fear of death . ”
“ Huge mistakes were made , ” says Perle , “ and I want to be very clear on this :
They were not made by neoconservatives . …
I ’m getting damn tired of being described as an architect of the war . ”
Almost all the neoconservatives have now departed the seats of power in the Bush administration and retreated to their sinecures at Washington think tanks , to plot the next war — on Iran .
Meanwhile , brave young Americans , the true idealists and the casualties of the neocons ’ war , come home in caskets , 20 a week , to Dover and , at Walter Reed , learn to walk again on steel legs .

Key California Republican Group Endorses Ron Paul
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 22 , 2007
ARLINGTON , VA – The United Republicans of California ( UROC ) have unanimously endorsed Congressman Ron Paul for president of the United States .
UROC , formed in 1963 to support Barry Goldwater , represents the traditional conservative wing of the California Republican Party .
“ The unanimous endorsement from the United Republicans of California proves what the campaign has been saying all along , ” said campaign chairman Kent Snyder .
“ Ron Paul is the only true conservative and real Republican in the race . ”
In their official statement endorsing Dr. Paul , UROC called him “ the leading advocate for freedom in our nation ’s capital ” and recognized that :
Ron Paul ’s voting record demonstrates that he has voted against :
· raising taxes ;
· unbalanced budgets ;
· a federal restriction on gun ownership ;
· raising congressional pay ; or
· increasing the power of the executive branch .
His voting record demonstrates further that he voted against :
· the USA Patriot Act ;
· regulating the Internet ; and
· the war in Iraq .
Dr. Paul is the only candidate with a record that matches the UROC ’s platform .
“ Whether the issue is life , the Second Amendment , foreign policy , spending or taxes , Ron Paul is the only traditional conservative candidate , ” continued Snyder .
“ Traditional conservatives across the country should support Ron Paul for president . ”

Have you ever wondered why humans must eat fruit to stay alive , but dogs , cats , cows , squirrels and other mammals do n’t ?
It ’s because all mammals need Vitamin C to survive , but simians ( including humans ) are among the very few mammals that cannot synthesize Vitamin C from their diets .
Why ?
Because humans ( along with other apes , monkeys , guinea pigs , fruit - eating bats , and a few other species ) , carry a genetic defect that disrupts the Vitamin C production process .
Here ’s the interesting part .
The vast majority of animals and plants are able to synthesize their own Vitamin C through a sequence of four enzyme - driven steps , which convert glucose to Vitamin C. Human metabolism can , and does , perform the first three of these steps , but we have lost the ability to perform the fourth , because our gene that would produce the required fourth enzyme contains a defect and no longer functions .
Consequently , we cannot use the resulting proteins to synthesize Vitamin C : our bodies break the proteins back down and reabsorb them .
Why is this important ?
Well , the Bible tells us that the Garden of Eden contained fruit trees .
Fruit trees would have been unnecessary if God had created Adam with a properly functioning gene to synthesize Vitamin C. Why did God not give Adam ( whom God supposedly created in His own image ) the properly functioning gene that He gave to virtually all other mammals ?
Also , why did God give Adam the genes for the other three enzyme - driven steps , even though they would be useless without the fourth ?
Does n’t it seem … un - godlike …for an infallible God to have designed a “ perfect ” human who not only had a defective , non-functional gene , but also several functioning , useless ones ?
Of course , evolutionary theory easily explains this phenomenon : millions of years ago , our ancestors once had four working genes , but a genetic mutation occurred sometime in our lineage that has been passed down through the subsequent generations .
Fortunately for our ancestors ( and us ) , this mutation was not fatal , because our ancestors were able to get Vitamin C from their diet , as we still must do today .
True , fruit is not our only source of Vitamin C , but our rare inability to synthesize Vitamin C makes me wonder where the supporters of so - called “ intelligent design ” get their absurd belief that our design is intelligent , especially when their own holy book suggests that their infallible god created us , from the beginning , with a very obvious genetic defect .
When I wrote Today is " Support Your Favorite Small Software Vendor Day " , I made a commitment to spend at least $ 20 per month supporting my fellow independent software developers .
WinRAR has become increasingly essential to my toolkit over the last year , so this month , I 'm buying a WinRAR license .
Sure , ZIP support is built into most operating systems , but the support is rudimentary at best .
I particularly dislike the limited " compressed folder wizard " I get by default in XP and Vista .
In contrast , WinRAR is full - featured , powerful , and integrates seamlessly with the shell .
There 's a reason WinRAR won the best archive tool roundup at DonationCoder .
And WinRAR is very much a living , breathing piece of software .
It 's frequently updated with neat little feature bumps and useful additions ; two I noticed over the last year were dual - core support and real - time stats while compressing , such as estimated compression ratio and predicted completion time .
WinRAR fully supports creating and extracting ZIP archives , so choosing WinRAR does n't mean you 'll be forced into using the RAR compression format .
But you should use it , because RAR , as a compression format , clobbers ZIP .
It produces much smaller archives in roughly the same time .
If you 're worried the person on the receiving end of the archive wo n't have a RAR client , you can create a self - extracting executable archive ( or SFX ) at a minimal cost of about 60 KB additional filesize .
RAR also supports solid archives , so it can exploit intra-file redundancies .
ZIP does not .
This is a big deal , because it can result in a substantially smaller archive when you 're compressing a lot of files .
When I compressed all the C# code snippets , the difference was enormous :
ZIP 229 KB RAR 73 KB
But even in an apples - to - apples comparison , RAR offers some of the very best " bang for the byte " of all compression algorithms .
Consider this recent , comprehensive multiple file compression benchmark .
The author measured both compression size and compression time to produce an efficiency metric :
The most efficient ( read : useful ) program is calculated by multiplying the compression time ( in seconds ) it took to produce the archive with the power of the archive size divided by the lowest measured archive size .
2 ^ ( (( Size/SmallestSize ) ) - 1 ) / 0.1 ) * ArchiveTime
The lower the score , the better .
The basic idea is a compressor X has the same efficiency as compressor Y if X can compress twice as fast as Y and resulting archive size of X is 10 % larger than size of Y .
And sure enough , if you sort the results by efficiency , WinRAR rises directly to the top .
Its scores of 1871 ( Good ) and 1983 ( Best ) rank third and fourth out of 200 .
The top two spots are held by an archiver I 've never heard of , SBC .
WinRAR and SBC 0.970 score very well on efficiency .
Both SBC and WinRK are capable of compressing the 301 MB testset down to 82 MB [ a ~ 73 % compression ratio ] in under 3 minutes .
People looking for good ( but not ultimate ) and fast compression should have a look at those two programs .
The raw data on the comparison page is a little hard to parse , so I pulled the data into Excel and created some alternative views of it .
Here 's a graph of compression ratio versus time , sorted by compression ratio , for all compared archive programs :
What I wanted to illustrate with this graph is that beyond about 73 % compression ratio , performance falls off a cliff .
This is something I 've noted before in previous compression studies .
You do n't just hit the point of diminishing returns in compression , you slam into it like a brick wall .
That 's why the time scale is logarithmic in the above graph .
Look at the massive differences in time as you move toward the peak compression ratio :
72.58 % 02:54 WinRAR 3.62 75.24 % 11:20 UHARC 0.6 b 77.16 % 30:38 DRUILCA 0.5 78.83 % 05:51:19 PAQ8H 79.70 % 08:30:03 WinRK 3.0.3
Note that I cherry - picked the most efficient archivers out of this data , so this represents best case performance .
Is an additional two percent of compression worth taking five times longer ?
Is an additional four percent worth ten times longer ?
Under the right conditions , possibly .
But the penalty is severe , and the reward miniscule .
If you 're interested in crunching the multiple file compression benchmark study data yourself , I converted it to a few different formats for your convenience :
Personally , I recommend the Excel version .
I had major performance problems with the Google spreadsheet version .
After poring over this data , I 'm more convinced than ever .
RAR offers a nearly perfect blend of compression efficiency and speed across all modern compression formats .
And WinRAR is an exemplary GUI implementation of RAR .
It 's almost a no - brainer .
Except in cases where backwards compatibility trumps all other concerns , we should abandon the archaic ZIP format -- and switch to the power and flexibility of WinRAR .
Behind all the news and all the propaganda , Marines in Afghanistan decide to keep it real and show you what its really like dealing with a deployment in Afghanistan .
This will either piss you off , make you laugh or maybe both .
Flying to Hong Kong to buy a PS3 is cheaper than buying one in the UK March 14 , 2007
Posted by Al in : gadget
This sounds really stupid , but after a discussion in work today we decided that flying 12,000 miles to buy a Playstation 3 may actually be a cheaper option than buying one in the UK !
PS3 in the UK – £ 425
4 games @ £ 40 each – £ 160
Second controller – £ 28
Total – £ 613
When I was in Hong Kong I bought a PS3 which may actually be of better spec than the upcoming UK PS3 , as my PS3 has the emotion chip which the European version will lack .
I also bought 4 games and a second controller .
PS3 in Hong Kong – $ 3778 = £ 250
4 games @ $ 338 each – $ 1352 = £ 89
Second controller – $ 320 = £ 21
Total – $ 5450 = £ 360
So all we need to do now is to find some flights to Hong Kong for less than £ 250 to make flying to Hong Kong cheaper than buying in the UK .
I have searched and currently the cheapest return flight I can find is £ 303 , which is not good enough , but the airline these cheap flights are with , Oasis Hong Kong , regularly have promotions so signing up for their mailing list would be an option .
( It ’s also worth noting that this price is for return on the same day as arrival , or for return 2 days later ) .
However there is another way to make buying your PS3 in Hong Kong cheaper than buying in the UK : buy 2 PS3’s !
2 PS3s , 4 games and a second controller – £ 720
Flights – £ 303
Total – £ 1023
Since an equivalent PS3 package in the UK would be £ 613 then £ 1023 -£ 613=£410 .
So all you need to do is sell the second PS3 package for more than £ 410 and you ’re on a winner .
In fact if you could sell the second PS3 package for £ 550 then you would have £ 140 for spending a couple of nights in Hong Kong – a quick search on Expedia turned up 2 options for less than £ 70 .
The Tatami Hampton is within 2 blocks of the main electronics area of Hong Kong and very close to the markets of Mongkok as well .
So you could have a short holiday with 2 nights stay in a hotel and £ 70 spending money , AND a PS3 cheaper than buying one in the UK !
And on one final note , and thanks to Alex in work for pointing this out , you could spend a little more ( £ 329 ) on the return flights and fly with British Airways .
The advantage here is that you get free booze on BA flights , so providing you do n’t get so drunk you make a nuisance of yourself you can fly in comfort , get fed on the flights , get drunk on the flights and get a PS3 cheaper than buying one in the UK .
Now the big deal about getting drunk on the plane is if you travel on a weekend you can save all the money you would have spent in pubs and clubs back here in the UK .
This saving would definitely make the trip even more worthwhile – in fact I suggest you all go now .

I love the value that method_missing provides ; unfortunately , sometimes I get into trouble when I abuse the power Matz has bestowed upon me .
If you 've done much work with method_missing the following error message probably is n't foreign to you .
It 's a painful message to see , as it's always problematic to debug .
Given the inherent difficultly of debugging method_missing calls I thought it might be valuable to offer a few alternatives .
As an example I 'll use themethods that Validatable exposes .
The Validatable validations allow you to put your validations into groups .
Given the above User class you can expect the following behavior .
As you can see the User instance exposes the valid_for_account_creation ?
and the valid_for_persistence ?
methods .
Of course , we want the valid_for_ [ a group ] methods to change based on the groups defined in each class .
Additionally , we only want valid_for_something ?
to be defined on a class if that class contains any validations in thegroup .
This looks like a classic situation for using method_missing ; however , I chose one of the following other solutions .
The basic idea behind this solution alternative is to move the method_missing logic into a class whose sole responsibility is the method_missing logic .
For example , had I chosen this solution for Validatable I would have made the valid methods work like the following example .
Given the above syntax I could have created a ValidFor class that encapsulated the logic for dynamically executing a subset of validations .
A few cons for this solution are the obvious violation of the Law of Demeter and the fact that the stack overflow can still exist in the delegate class .
However , I like to use this solution when the methods that are necessary are truly dynamic and cannot be easily predicted ( i.e. the find_by _ * methods that ActiveRecord : : Base exposes ) .
Additionally , the added class removes variables when trying to figure out where the logic went wrong .
I chose this solution because I was able to easily identify which methods were necessary and define then at interpretation time .
In fact the implementation for defining the valid methods is quite simple .
Given the above code a class will define a new valid_for_ [ a group ] method for each group given to any of it 's validations .
By explicitly defining each method I get much more manageable error messages when things do go wrong .
Two - dimensional images are converted into 3D models
See Microsoft demo
Microsoft's Photosynth takes collections of images , analyses them for similarities , and then displays them in a reconstructed 3D space .
The system , to be previewed at a computer graphics meeting in Boston , will allow users to walk or fly through a scene to see photos from any angle .
Microsoft says Photosynth should be available for use later this year .
Photo - sharing websites will be early - adopters of this technology
Richard Szeliski
Richard Szeliski , principal researcher at Microsoft Research who developed the technology with Noah Snavely and Steven Seitz , of the University of Washington , said : " The system builds a 3D model just from a raw collection of photographs . "
' Geometry problem '
He said the technology works by scanning collections of photographs , which can be taken from different cameras at different times .
It picks out distinctive features in each image and cross-references them against the other photographs , checking for similarities .
This allows it to pinpoint a feature 's 3D position and to also calculate where the position of the camera would have been when the picture was taken .
" Then basically , it is just a geometry problem , " explained Dr Szeliski .
" You are simultaneously adjusting the position of the camera and where those little pieces of images are until everything basically snaps together . "
The system processes collections of photographs
More details
The prototype can use as few as two pictures but , said Dr Szeliski , it becomes a lot more exciting when several dozen images are used .
The 3D model will enable people to move through a scene , looking at pictures from any angle , click on specific photos , zoom in or out of a feature , and see where snaps were taken in relation to other images .
Dr Szeliski said : " I think the photo - sharing websites will be early - adopters of this technology .
" Wherever people share photos , instead of just seeing a gallery of unorganised photos , now you can pull everyone else 's photos together and make a rational sense out of it . "
The other obvious application , he added , would be for tourism and property , where a city could provide a virtual tour or a hotel could potential visitors walk through its lobby .
The researchers will be presenting a research paper detailing the technology at this week 's Siggraph 2006 conference in Boston , which looks at the latest developments in computer graphics and interactive techniques .
Microsoft have said they believe the technology will almost certainly be web - based , and people should be able to run the application later this year .
" Within the next year we hope to see this in wide usage , " added Dr Szeliski .

Fuel from forests is new clean energy goal By Sun Xiaohua ( China Daily )
Updated : 2007-02-08 07:28
Money may not grow on trees but they could help power cars , thanks to a path - breaking effort to develop biofuel from forests .
By 2010 , China plans to plant an area the size of England , or 13 million hectares , with trees from which biofuel can be extracted as a source of clean energy , according to the State Forestry Administration ( SFA ) .
Jatropha , also called physic nut , is currently grown on around 2 million hectares across the country and produces non-edible oil for making candles and soap .
Now , it will be the main ingredient in the production of biodiesel .
The 13 - million - hectare forest mostly spread over southern China is expected to produce nearly 6 million tons of biodiesel every year .
Vehicles account for a third of all oil use in the country .
Biodiesel is a clean - burning diesel made from natural , renewable sources such as agricultural products like palm oil , soybeans and sugarcane with Brazil , in particular , being a global leader .
The jatropha trees can also provide wood fuel for a power plant with an installed capacity of 12 million kilowatts about two - thirds the capacity of the Three Gorges Dam project , the world 's biggest .
This amount of bio-energy will account for 30 percent of the country 's renewable energy by 2010 , according to the SFA .
Cao Qingyao , spokesman for the SFA , said : " This plan will not only help the country enlarge its green coverage ( currently at about 130 million hectares ) but also meet increasing demand for energy . "
" And most importantly , it provides clean energy to meet the country 's target of sustainable development , " he said .
Currently , the country relies mainly on fossil fuels for energy production .
To ease the pressure and reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions , a renewable energy target has been set :
By 2010 , it will make up 10 percent of the energy structure ; and 16 percent by 2020 .
China National Petroleum Corporation , one of the country 's three energy giants , has started collaboration with the SFA to develop biofuel .
Jiang Jiemin , head of the corporation , said last month that the group would , by 2010 , build a commercial production base with an annual capacity of 200,000 tons of biodiesel by planting more than 400,000 hectares of trees .

“ If I did n’t care about my kids , I ’d have an easier time . ”
“ No real - life problem is ever actually solved , it seems . ”
For three years , Geri Anderson has worked as a grade school art teacher .
She wakes up every day , willing to try her hardest to make a difference in the lives of the students who attend Walnut Elementary School .
“ Geri ” and “ Walnut ” are not real names ; Geri and I decided to use these pseudonyms to allow Geri to speak freely .
Everything else in this article is based on my recent interview of Geri .
Geri is a soft - spoken woman in her mid-twenties .
Before being hired for her current job , Geri often substitute taught at expensive private grade schools .
She took her first permanent job at Walnut to make a difference .
Geri teaches art to each of the 200 students who attend Walnut .
They range in age from preschoolers to sixth - graders .
The average class includes about twenty children , although some of the classes have almost 30 children .
Not all of the teacher positions are filled at Walnut ; for many months , the school has sought the help of adults from the community to fill in for the non-existent science teacher , for example .
Walnut is located in the urban center of a large U.S. city .
98 % of the children attending Walnut Elementary are African - American .
More than 90 % of these students receive free or reduced price lunches .
Based upon Geri ’s observations , the great majority of the students live in single - parent homes .
Classroom behavior issues , including infinite variations of acting out and talking out , are constant challenges .
Geri ’s sees her overall task as “ bringing beauty to her students ’ lives . ”
To accomplish this , Geri acknowledges that she needs her students to sit still enough and focus long enough so that they can understand the assignment .
Many of the students “ simply can not sit still and be quiet . ”
At a grade school like Walnut , however , this task is an uphill climb each and every day .
Before teaching at Walnut , Geri did not realize it could be this hard to get the children to focus .
The administrators are also concerned with keeping order , but Geri is concerned that , for the administration , keeping the children quiet has evolved into an end rather than a means to a higher end .
They are “ not so worried about freedom of expression as much as seeing that the children sit down and stay quiet . ”
Over time , one can see the cycle : the children act up and the administration clamps down .
They react to each other .
Sometimes it seems like running through this senseless cycle is , indeed , the main purpose of Walnut .
What is the problem with these children who wo n’t focus , who wo n’t listen ?
Many of them are loaded down with tragic life circumstances to an extent unimaginable by teachers who do n’t teach children who are economically disadvantaged .
One child showed up at class the day after seeing his aunt die the previous day .
Another boy cried when asked why he was n’t doing his art project .
He told Geri that he “ hates ” his stepdad and “ my mother does n’t listen . ”
One little boy told Geri that his dad was “ beating up my mom against a wall . ”
To keep the perspective , these are children at a grade school .
These children are only 5 or 8 or 10 years old .
The have very few choices in what goes on in their homes .
Recently , one child was so angry at an adult male resident of his own household that he told Geri that he wanted to either “ run away or punch him in the face . ”
Many of the children are dealing with constant flow of disturbing new people who come in and out of their homes and lives .
In such an environment , “ Who do you trust ? ”
Does it make sense to trust at all ?
How else does Geri learn about the students ’ stressed home circumstances ?
She often sees it before and after school , when parents drop off and pick up their children .
She ’ll hear , “ Get your ass over here now ! ” Similar degrading comments are commonly made to many of the children .
Based upon her own observations , Geri suspects that many of these parents are “ smacking the children around . ”
As a teacher , one often does n’t know the mental turmoil these little children are carrying , often without anyone with whom to discuss these things — without any responsible adult to empathize with them .
Geri sadly recounts that these sad circumstances sometimes spill out of her students only when they are reprimanded for not focusing in class or failing to do their homework .
The stories go on and on .
Some of the kids live in homeless shelters .
One little boy mentioned that his uncle recently got shot in a drive - by .
One child described how he hides with his brother so that his mother “ wo n’t hit us with a stick . ”
Shootings and violence permeate the experiences of many of the students .
Death is a part of life .
“ You ’re not dealing with kids , but with old souls who have seen a lot . ”
The school often deals with discipline issues with new rules .
The administrators recently announced a new plan for preschooler art .
Starting next year , Geri is required to grades the preschoolers ’ art assignments .
Geri asks ,
“ How do you grade a four - year - old ?
They ’re barely out of the womb and we ’re already so stringent . ”
This challenge of keeping the kids ’ attention leads many of the teachers at Walnut to adopt a “ boot camp ” approach to school .
Unfortunately , this stern approach resembles the home environments that many of the children should be allowed to escape .
Instead of engaging the children with pleasant conversation in the morning , Geri overhears many of the other teachers barking at their students .
“ Sit down ! ” “ The work ’s on the board !
“ Take your coat off ! ” “ Raise your hand ! ”
It echoes down the hallway and it ’s hard to listen to , so Geri often closes her own classroom door .
Geri admits that some strict behavior control tactics are necessary some of the time , for some of the children .
But many of Walnut ’s teachers are in this “ boot camp ” mode all day for every student .
Geri laments that this approach is demeaning and counterproductive .
Nor would this approach bother Geri so much except that so many of the teachers talk to their students in “ demeaning ” and , sometimes , “ hateful tones of voice . ”
What do you do with such children ?
At Walnut , there is a good counselor , but there is not enough counseling to go around .
There are some teachers who truly care enough to take the time to listen to the children , and then to encourage them .
They repeatedly advise the children : “ You still need to produce at school even though it ’s very difficult to do . ”
These teachers are painfully aware that they do n’t want to encourage their students to start using their tragic experiences and emotional disruption as excuses for not trying .
This strategy sometimes works .
Many of the children show “ incredible resilience . ”
These challenging life experiences often come out in the children ’s art .
Sometimes , Geri will deal with these tragic personal revelations by asking the children , “ Do you want to draw it ? ”
This approach is often helpful , especially for those children who struggle verbally .
The children ’s drawings will sometimes depict the police , as well as men being thrown in jail .
“ This is real life for them , ” Geri mentions .
“ If you have the kind of life where you see birds , you draw birds .
This is what they see . ”
This lifestyle is also reflected in the music many of the students hear and sing .
Shockingly degrading violent lyrics to music are heard in the classroom , but there are no radios playing .
The kids will spontaneously sing these shocking lyrics in class .
For Geri , the problem always comes back to the parents .
It ’s clear to her that the lack of education of these parents is simply being transferred down to their children .
What is school ?
Is it really about learning or is it daycare ?
Real learning goes beyond the walls and requires parents to work with their children to educate them .
For many of these children , however , the parents simply do n’t have the skills or experience is to serve as mentors .
This is especially unfortunate , according to Geri , since “ 95 % of what is learned is learned at home . ”
If the parents are raised without education being an important part of their lives , “ how can they impart the importance of education in their own children ? ”
In order to effect desperately needed change , parents need to be taught first , but how many of the parents who need help are willing to be taught ?
Many of the parents hold down multiple jobs .
Further , many of them carry the kind of disruptive emotional baggage that would send many well - to - do suburban parents to their professional counselors and psychologists .
Sometimes there ’s entirely too much pressure on Mom .
Many of the mothers are not taking care of themselves .
When this goes on long enough , they will not feel like taking out time to care for their own children .
One of Geri ’s fantasies is to invite the moms to school for a “ spa day , ” where the mothers would be pampered just a bit .
Similarly , the school might sponsor a basketball shootout evening for the dads .
These things would cost some money , of course , and it would be difficult to convince the district to allocate money for these sorts of things .
Instead , the school district offers PTO meetings , which many of the parents consider tedious and degrading .
Geri hears these sorts of complaints from the parents that have attended .
They complain that they “ already know that if your child has a fever do n’t send that child to school . ”
What is needed ?
Many important things , according to Geri , but many of these important things are cheap or even free .
For instance , the parents should be encouraged to turn off the television .
In lieu of television , they need to establish “ calm zones ” in their homes .
They need to eat dinner with their children .
They need to read to their children .
Library books are free , and parents should take advantage of valuable library resources .
Each home should have some sort of building blocks to help the children develop spatial abilities .
The parents need to make sure that the children are actually sleeping eight to ten hours each night .
The lack of sleep is a huge problem during the day , but many parents put a low priority on getting their children into bed .
They need to understand that the children ’s sleep time should be valued as “ a sacred time . ”
Doing each of these things would require parents to put the needs of the children above their own needs on a regular basis .
In too many cases , selling this idea is a steep uphill climb .
Many of the parents do n’t understand how to deal with correcting their own children .
At home , they punish their children instead of disciplining them .
In short , the parents are not explaining to their child what the problem is .
Instead , the children are simply told that they are “ bad . ”
Walnut Elementary is a school full of “ bad ” children .
This is not surprising , given that many of the teachers are also busy labeling and ostracizing those “ bad ” children .
Each of Geri ’s classes includes more than a few children who are “ really talented . ”
Even if they are n’t well focused , many of the other children would be content to try to learn art .
But there are several children in each class who make it impossible to communicate assignments to those who are willing .
These disruptive children will stand on chairs and destructively grab things off shelves during story time .
I suggested to Geri that art class might be seen as more “ fun ” than reading or math , and that it concerns me that maintaining discipline in an art class would be this difficult .
Geri explained that many of her struggles are caused by children who have been hammered with severe punishment all their lives .
Many of these troubled kids struggle the most in an art class that often invites freedom of expression .
In an art class , these children are being challenged to think outside the box and many of them struggle to do this .
There are many successes , of course , and these result in smiles and hugs .
But there ’s long dry stretches too .
Geri sometimes thinks , “ How can I motivate them yet also tell them do n’t worry about messing up each day ? ”
At Walnut , then , the job of an art teacher is often the job of a counselor .
Geri works to direct the children ’s attention to their own behavior and to remind them that no one makes them choose their own dysfunctional behavior .
She often reminds the students of natural consequences .
“ If you do n’t brush her teeth , they turn yellow .
If no one pays electric bill , the electricity is turned off . ”
Sometimes , her impromptu psychology sessions work to dissipate disruptive behaviors .
“ It ’s amazing what can happen if you break it down in a firm but loving way .
If you give them a plan you give them a direction . ”
It beats telling them simply to “ be good , ” which is not at all helpful .
It is not surprising , then , to hear that Geri is interested in pursuing a degree in art therapy .
Sometimes the kids do n’t have the words to express their concerns , and “ images work more powerfully . ”
When the children work on expressive art , each project offers them a chance to invest something personal into the project .
This helps Geri to understand what is going on beneath the surface .
Then again , the reality is undeniable : “ You ca n’t pick who you want to come to school . ”
A quote she once heard has stuck with her ever since : “ Every kid can learn .
Just not on the same day in the same way . ”
Many of the teachers have developed a “ trick ” in order to deal with the intense lack of order in the classroom .
They teach to the majority .
This is not fair to those kids who are the most disruptive , but would be even less fair for the majority to lose their entire education because you ’re attending primarily to special challenges .
I asked Geri whether most other teachers would consider her to be a complainer .
After all , do n’t all teachers , even those in expensive private schools , have some difficult students in their classrooms ?
Geri admitted that every classroom in every school has challenging students .
The real problem is not the difficult students , however .
The problem at Walnut is that the teachers receive little or no support from the administration .
For one , you cannot remove these extremely difficult kids from the class .
That just does n’t happen , no matter how bad the behavior .
Instead , a teacher at Walnut needs to deal with these children every hour of every day .
The teachers ’ energy is drained by the constant task of asserting redirection and applying constant positive discipline .
“ You try to ignore the negative and compliment the positive .
Sometimes , the negative dies . ”
Often , however , it does not die .
When a teacher asks the Walnut administration for support , the teachers are told “ you ’ve got to get tougher . ”
It ’s hard to know what this means , says Geri , given that teachers will not go to the administration until they ’ve repeatedly warned the children , called the student ’s parents , and requested detention ( where the students will sit in a separate room doing lessons all day ) .
What the administration really means by “ get tough , ” is to intimidate or demean the children , but Geri refuses to do this .
Geri has attended numerous workshops , many of which she describes as “ useless . ”
Teacher training does not include real training on “ character education . ”
In her opinion , this is a topic that needs to be incorporated directly into daily curriculum .
Intense character education is not about “ a word of the month . ”
Real character education gives the students hands - on exercises in self - control .
It would teach them what it means to earn or show respect .
The lack of character education at Walnut is glaring .
“ You do n’t learn math in a day .
Why assume that a student could so quickly learn character education ? ”
What are some of the other solutions ?
Geri has more than a few ideas .
For one , every classroom teacher at Walnut needs a permanent full - time assistant .
No teacher has such an assistant .
Having a permanent assistant would allow one adult to calm the disruptive children , temporarily removing them from the classroom if need be , to allow the other children to learn .
Geri fully understands that good teachers need to integrate discipline and learning , but the main problem at Walnut is constant and intense stream of interruptions .
These distractions make it difficult to get even five minutes of uninterrupted attention of the students at the beginning of a class .
“ If I ca n’t give the directions , I am unable to work with the children .
You ’re constantly prohibited from reaching your basic goals . ”
Geri asks whether I have any idea how hard it is to talk about art history when there are multiple disruptions within the first five minutes of each class .
I do n’t .
What else would benefit the children ?
Having a real playground .
Studies show that children who more often engage in play more often succeed as learners .
Play is critical for learning .
Walnut does not have a real playground , only a parking lot with broken asphalt , and the kids often throw the pieces of asphalt at each other .
Here ’s another thing : healthy food .
The children often come from homes where healthy food is lacking .
Walnut does nothing to break this cycle .
The food served at the school is “ unhealthy processed food and sugar drinks .
It ’s awful . ”
The social atmosphere at Walnut is no better than the nutrition .
There is a strict rule at Walnut that there will be absolutely no talking by any student during the 50 - minute lunch period .
Students found violating this rule are made to stand up against the cafeteria wall .
The overriding goal of lunch time is to “ be quiet and eat your lunch . ”
This requirement comes straight from the principal ’s office .
Why is such a rule necessary ?
“ Because everything at the school must look orderly in case guests visit the school . ”
Structure is often a good thing , but the structure at Walnut borders on militaristic .
The children are required to walk in the halls with their arms completely and rigorously in front of them .
Geri ’s other suggestions return to the topic of the administration ’s lack of support .
What ’s needed is an administration that is “ not afraid to provide and try new things . ”
Also , it is critical to have an administration that focuses on what is working rather than what is not working .
Unfortunately , the administration of Walnut has postured itself as an enemy of its own teachers .
What else can one think when teachers are berated by their superiors in front of their students for failing to turn in a form on time ?
The administration , including the principal , commonly displays a startling lack of tact and professionalism .
Here ’s a typical comment : “ I do n’t care .
You ’ve just got to get it done . ”
Sometimes comments like these come in over the intercom .
They are also common occurrences at teacher meetings , where teachers are treated like hired hands rather than professionals .
Geri laments that the adults at Walnut “ do n’t even know how to talk to each other . ”
This culture of dysfunction spills out into the hallways .
“ No one says hello .
If a teacher deemed to be too nice , he or she is accused ” of being too lenient and spoiling the children . ”
The result ?
Geri has often had to deal with children who are upset , even crying , because another teacher has been hostile to the child , day after day .
Geri asks ,
“ At what point are you going to kick those teachers out of the school ?
If we really cared about our kids , we ’d take care of those teachers . ”
Every day remains a new day .
“ You ’re on your own and it ’s a different world . ”
It ’s impossible to point one finger at “ the problem ” at Walnut .
“ It ’s beyond what any one person is doing . ”
To console herself at the end of the day , Geri reminds herself that she works in an institution that does not reflect the cooperation and cordiality that can more often be found outside of her institution .
She continues to hold out hope that she can continue to make a difference in many instances , even if not everywhere or for every student .

Thompson is planning to enter the presidential race over the Fourth of July holiday , announcing this week that he has already raised several million dollars and is being backed by insiders from the past three Republican administrations , Thompson advisers told The Politico .
Thompson , the " Law & Order " star and former U.S. senator from Tennessee , has been publicly coy , even as people close to him have been furiously preparing for a late entry into the wide - open contest .
But the advisers said Thompson dropped all pretenses on Tuesday afternoon during a conference call with more than 100 potential donors , each of whom was urged to raise about $ 50,000 .
Thompson 's formal announcement is planned for Nashville .
Organizers say the red pickup truck that was a hallmark of Thompson 's first Senate race will begin showing up in Iowa and New Hampshire as an emblem of what they consider his folksy , populist appeal .
A testing - the - waters committee is to be formed June 4 so Thompson can start raising money , and staffers will go on the payroll in early June , the organizers said .
A policy team has been formed , but remains under wraps .

The supporters on Tuesday 's call make up a group the campaign is calling " First Day Founders . "
When launched , the campaign will have offices in Nashville and Northern Virginia , the advisers say .
Campaign officials said they have every indication Thompson will declare his candidacy , but cautioned that he could still decide not to run or to postpone the announcement .
Mark Corallo , the campaign spokesman , said : " He is seriously considering getting in and doing everything he has to do to come to a final decision . "
A member of Thompson 's inner circle , who insisted on anonymity , said the former senator will offer himself as a consistent conservative who can unite all elements of the Republican Party .
" The public is increasingly cynical and disenchanted with government , " this adviser said .
" Competence is at the heart of what people want from government , and they need to have a sense that government can do the things they care the most about .
They want a reason to continue Republican governance .
Thompson can be seen as the adult with a firm hand on the tiller . "
Thompson urged the supporters to muster a major show of financial force in early July , just after the June 30 deadline for second - quarter financial reports to the Federal Election Commission .
Thompson 's top rivals — Rudolph Giuliani , John McCain and Mitt Romney — will have a formidable advantage for the current quarter , so he plans to show his muscle right after that .
Similarly , several Thompson advisers are urging him to skip the Iowa Republican Straw Poll in Ames on Aug. 11 , since his campaign will have such a short time to prepare .
Instead , Thompson could campaign 30 miles away in Des Moines at the Iowa State Fair , which will be taking place at the same time .
Since Thompson began hinting he might get in , polls have generally showed him tied for third with Romney .
In the most recent average of national polls on RealClearPolitics.com , each had 10 percent of the vote , behind Giuliani at 26 percent and McCain at 18 percent .
Since those polls were taken , Romney has shown increasing strength in early - voting states .
The chief operations officer will be Thomas J. Collamore , a former aide to Vice President George H.W. Bush and former vice president of public affairs for Philip Morris Companies Inc .
In the George H.W. Bush administration , Collamore was an assistant secretary of commerce under Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher .
In the Reagan administration , he was special assistant to Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige .
That reflects the pedigrees of some of the key Republicans who are likely to join the campaign , advisers say .
Republicans from the grass - roots level to President Bush 's inner circle have expressed frustration with the current field of candidates , and so Thompson initially will likely get a lot of fawning attention from party leaders and the news media .
But it is not clear that he can turn his celebrity into a solid candidacy .
Supporters realize the potential liabilities : the late start after many endorsements ; donors and activists have been locked up by other candidates ; a reputation for an aversion to hard work ; his non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , a form of cancer ; and a bear - like physique that makes him look his 64 years .
Organizers were encouraged by a donor meeting in New York City on Thursday afternoon that was attended by some of the best - known names in state and national politics .
Without disclosing his specific plans , Thompson plans to keep the momentum going with an appearance in Richmond on Saturday at the Commonwealth Gala , headed by Republican Party of Virginia Chairman Ed Gillespie .
In a preview of the campaign to come , Thompson plans to show he is a candidate acceptable to all elements of the conservative coalition .
He will make it plain to the attendees and a large press corps that , as one adviser put it , " the Fred has landed . "
Thompson lives in McLean , Va. Tickets for the dinner , to be held at the Greater Richmond Convention Center , start at $ 125 .
Sponsors who pay $ 1,000 to $ 10,000 will be able to get their photo taken with Thompson at a reception an hour before the dinner .
Thompson , who plays District Attorney Arthur Branch on the NBC series , was a senator from 1994 to 2003 , elected to finish Al Gore 's term when he resigned to run for vice president .
Thompson then won a term of his own , and did not seek reelection in 2002 .
He gained national exposure in 1973 as a minority counsel to the Senate Watergate committee .
He eventually became chairman of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs , where his investigation of Democratic campaign finance activities left many Republicans disappointed .
Now a senior analyst for ABC News Radio and substitute host for the legendary Paul Harvey , Thompson savaged the White House immigration proposal in a commentary last week .
" A nation without secure borders will not long be a sovereign nation , " he said .
" No matter how much lipstick Washington tries to slap onto this legislative pig , it 's not going to win any beauty contests . "
“ Only one kind of customer wants to buy lists of seniors interested in lotteries and sweepstakes : criminals , ” said Sgt. Yves Leblanc of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police .
“ If someone advertises a list by saying it contains gullible or elderly people , it ’s like putting out a sign saying ‘ Thieves welcome here . ’ ”
In recent years , despite the creation of a national “ do not call ” registry , the legitimate telemarketing industry has grown , according to the Direct Marketing Association .
Callers pitching insurance plans , subscriptions and precooked meals collected more than $ 177 billion in 2006 , an increase of $ 4.5 billion since the federal do - not - call restrictions were put in place three years ago .
That growth can be partly attributed to the industry ’s renewed focus on the elderly .
Older Americans are perfect telemarketing customers , analysts say , because they are often at home , rely on delivery services , and are lonely for the companionship that telephone callers provide .
Some researchers estimate that the elderly account for 30 percent of telemarketing sales — another example of how companies and investors are profiting from the growing numbers of Americans in their final years .
While many telemarketing pitches are for legitimate products , the number of scams aimed at older Americans is on the rise , the authorities say .
In 2003 , the Federal Trade Commission estimated that 11 percent of Americans over age 55 had been victims of consumer fraud .
The following year , the Federal Bureau of Investigation shut down one telemarketing ring that stole more than $ 1 billion , spanned seven countries and resulted in 565 arrests .
Since the start of last year , federal agencies have filed lawsuits or injunctions against at least 68 telemarketing companies and individuals accused of stealing more than $ 622 million .
“ Most people have no idea how widespread and sophisticated telemarketing fraud has become , ” said James Davis , a Federal Trade Commission lawyer .
“ It shocks even us . ”
Many of the victims are people like Mr. Guthrie , whose name was among the millions that infoUSA sold to companies under investigation for fraud , according to regulators .
Scam artists stole more than $ 100,000 from Mr. Guthrie , his family says .
How they took much of it is unclear , because Mr. Guthrie ’s memory is faulty and many financial records are incomplete .

What is certain is that a large sum was withdrawn from his account by thieves relying on Wachovia and other banks , according to banking and court records .
Though 20 percent of the total amount stolen was recovered , investigators say the rest has gone to schemes too complicated to untangle .
meta data by itself it not a bad thing .
what is a problem is when it is put into your documents without your knowledge , telling people who know how to look for it and extract it anything from what text used to be there , and was then deleted .
all the way to who originally wrote the document and who last updated it .
therefore , meta data is a serious issue , especially with word documents .
what you usually can do is :
1. download a meta data remover program and hope it does it ’s job .
2. download some plug - in for word to try and do the same .
3. attempt doing so yourselves .
or
4. do it my way , copy - paste the whole document to a newly created one ( that will not remove your author information though , as an example ) .
you can find out more about meta data by going to .. google .
the nsa released an how - to on sanitizing meta data in doc and pdf files .
check out their pdf .
i really see this as important as a lot of sensitive information gets stolen from many organizations ( civilian and government ) by using attack techniques for meta data gathering , and there have been big mistakes done in the past with sensitive information ( such as marking lines black in a pdf while the real text is still there , just hidden ) .
an attacker does not even have to steal sensitive documents .
as one example of an attack , he or she can go and check your company ’s web site for officially released documents .

Just this past weekend , there was a major attack on Speaker Pelosi by the White House , and repeated on the cover of Saturday ’s NY Post for her planned trip to Syria .
Of course , notwithstanding the fact that the republicans did it too , I ’ll point out this little nugget from a few short months ago :
A new poll by WorldPublicOpinion.org finds that three out of four Americans believe that in order to stabilize Iraq the United States should enter into talks with Iran and Syria , and eight in ten support an international conference on Iraq .
If it only stopped with this , it would just be disgustingly inaccurate .
But the lies and " black is white " barrage is nearly endless .
A few weeks back when the Libby verdict was announced , there were immediate talks over whether a pardon was forthcoming .
Of course , nearly 70 % of Americans did not want Libby to be pardoned .
But that did n’t stop Andrea Mitchell ( she of early involvement in the Plame leak from lying through her teeth :
They 're going to try to really tamp this down and appeal to the polling which indicates that most people think , in fact , that he should be pardoned .
Scooter Libby should be pardoned .
What about the US Attorney purge – the unprecedented purge of US attorneys for not being the most loyal of servants , and then lying to the fired attorneys , Congress , reporters and the American public about the reasons for the purge ?
Well , according to the ever trustworthy republican Senator Jon Cornyn , he just does n’t get " what all the hubbub is about " .
I guess cronyism and politicizing the United States justice system is n’t all that big of a deal to the man who replaced Alberto Gonzalez at Texas Attorney General under then - Governor George W. Bush .
Unfortunately for him , it is a big deal to the 72 % of Americans who think that Congress should investigate the firings .
It is also a pretty big deal to the nearly 75 % of Americans who think that subpoenas should be issued to White House officials in order to force them to testify .
Of course , how can we not mention those brave republican leaders who have such moral clarity about the " right war at the right time in the right place " – since they have been so right about everything to date when it comes to Iraq .
There was Senate minority leader McConnell saying that there is a dangerous and defeatist surrender date in the Iraq funding bills .
There is former Rep. John McCollister ( R - NE ) saying that this is sending a defeatist message to our enemies and our troops ( of course , it is not a defeatist message to deny troops the necessary equipment and armor or rest or training or medical benefits ) .
Best of all , we have the rabid , foaming at the mouth " journalistic experts " such as Arizona ’s The American Daily , which has this instant - classic :
If anyone was under the impression that congressional Democrats actually considered their actions , with regard to the " troop withdrawal bills , " beyond achieving victory over the Bush administration , they would be playing the part of the uninformed , Kool - Aid drinking fool .
While Democrats Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid and the rest of their anti-war , pro-genocide , hate - Bush contingent revel in the fact that they have succeeded in passing a bill that opposes the president , al Qaeda operatives in Iraq are preparing to set their alarm clocks for " half - past redeployment " so the slaughter of those who braved Iraq 's polling places can begin .
Of course , that blind to reality statement defies all logic and reason .
But it also defies the majority of Americans who back a timeline for withdrawal .
In fact , nearly 60 % back the plan that was just passed in Congress .
We also have those troop hating , um , troops who by a nearly 3 to 1 margin wanted the occupation to end within a year .
And that was back in early 2006 .
But why should we let a few pesky facts or reality play into the equation ?
I mean , are we going to believe these highly credible people who are clearly looking out for their own the republican party their corporate masters , America ’s best interests ?
Or are we going to believe our own lying ears and eyes ?

Fakery is seen throughout the animal kingdom and is especially evident in the realm of mate selection and mating behavior .
A puzzling behavior frequently observed in many species is copulation between males and females without the delivery of semen .
In a world where reproduction is key to a species , survival , such behavior poses a real mystery .
In a study that sheds new light on the evolution of sexual behavior , researchers have utilized a novel technique to reveal that in feral chickens , the simple stimulus generated by male mounting -- in the absence of actual insemination -- reduces the sexual promiscuity of a hen , indicating that even copulations that do not result in semen transfer may be crucial to defend the paternity of a male .
Females of many species often copulate with multiple males , leading to the phenomenon of sperm competition -- the competition between the ejaculates of different males to successfully fertilize eggs .
The battles of sperm competition occur at the cellular and molecular levels and involve the production of sperm - associated substances that boost the competitiveness of a male 's sperm ; however , the production of these substances comes at an energetic cost to males .
Males who can avoid such costs -- and still successfully mate -- may be at a reproductive advantage .
Therefore , in some species , males may avoid sperm competition by preventing females from mating with other males .
However , previous studies have not fully considered the possibility that female promiscuity may be inhibited by stimuli generated by the simple act of male mounting .
In the new study , a team of researchers led by Dr. Tommaso Pizzari of the University of Oxford tested this idea in the feral chicken , a sexually promiscuous species .
By using a novel but technologically simple technique -- fitting some hens with a light plastic harness covering their cloaca and thus preventing insemination -- the researchers were able to separate the effect of insemination products from that of mounting alone and to detect the behavioral response of hens .
The use of this technique demonstrated that mounting alone ( independently of insemination ) not only drastically inhibits the propensity of a hen to mate with a new rooster but also reduces the number of sperm that she obtains from a new rooster in the 2 – 4 days following mounting .
The researchers therefore showed that roosters can defend their paternity by reducing the promiscuity of the hens that they have inseminated ; they do so by exploiting in these hens the response to the simple stimulus of mounting .
Consistent with this idea , roosters often mount hens that they previously inseminated , but without subsequently delivering additional semen .
The study demonstrates that even though the ultimate function of sex is fertilization , copulations resulting in the delivery of little or no sperm are not necessarily functionally meaningless but may instead have an important evolutionary significance .

Many have laid claim to being the " best ever " in their respective fields of work , but only one can top the list .
And the same is true when it comes to technology .
So what 's the best tech product to come out of the digital age ?
And what qualifies a product as being " best " ?
First and foremost , it must be a quality product .
In many cases , that means a piece of hardware or software that has truly changed our lives and that we can't live without ( or could n't at the time it debuted ) .
Beyond that , a product should have attained a certain level of popularity , had staying power , and perhaps made some sort of breakthrough , influencing the development of later products of its ilk .
So after considering hundreds of products and engaging in many hours of painstaking debate , PC World presents the 50 best tech products .
Note that we 're looking only at technology that has arisen since the dawn of the personal computer , so do n't expect to see the cotton gin and the transistor radio on the list .
Instead , you 'll find gear that , in all likelihood , you used yourself at one point or another -- and , in many cases , products you 're still using today .
And , oh yeah , you may think our choices are ridiculous or that we 've left out much more important products .
Have at us .
Smack us down righteously .
You can comment on the story and give us your views through the comments section on the bottom of every page OR go directly to this story 's forum .

Marc Andreessen may have known what he was getting into when he cowrote Mosaic at the National Center for Supercomputer Applications , but it was n't until he graduated from college and met with some Silicon Valley types that the Web revolution really began .
In 1994 Andreessen launched Netscape Communications , offering his new Navigator Web browser ( based on Mosaic ) to the world .
Finally , users outside of the academic world would get a taste of HTML , and nothing has been the same since .
Netscape was the reason people started spending hours a day on the Internet , leading to the boom ( and bust ) of many a Web site .
The advent of the browser also led to the U.S. Department of Justice 's antitrust suit against Microsoft , after the company embedded Internet Explorer into Windows .
And Netscape 's August 9 , 1995 , IPO is universally considered to be the official start of the dot - com era .
Netscape , unfortunately , could n't keep up with the times and was surpassed by Internet Explorer in the late nineties .
The Netscape browser still exists ( under the ownership of AOL ) , but has fallen into utter disuse .
Nevertheless , its influence can still be felt all over the Web .
Fragments of its original code , for instance , live on in just about every browser still in production , from Mozilla Firefox to Internet Explorer ( click Help / About Internet Explorer in that browser to see for yourself ) .
To reminisce about bygone versions of Netscape , check out the Netscape Browser Archive .

I ’m often asked about raising six kids , and being productive and achieving goals and changing habits in the midst of raising so many kids .
But here ’s the thing : I do all the other stuff , the productivity stuff , because of my kids .
They , and my wife , are my reason for being .
It is my lifelong goal to be the best dad possible , and while there are many ways I can still improve , I think I ’m a pretty great dad already , when I sit back and think about it .
I know there are some readers who are just starting out in their careers as dads , and this post is for you .
How can you be a great dad ?
As always , my list of tips :
Kevin Drum brings us Mark Twain 's " The War Prayer " , an anti-war prose poem he wrote in the aftermath of the Spanish - American and Phillipine - American wars .
His family begged him not to publish it , his friends advised him to bury it , and his publisher rejected it , thinking it too inflammatory for the times .
Twain agreed , but instructed that it be published after his death , saying famously : " None but the dead are permitted to tell the truth . "
Washington Monthly 's publisher , Markos Kounalakis , made a video of the story for release this Memorial Day .
You can watch the video and read the story here .
Here is the War Prayer from Twain 's story :
If online investing is wired , manipulating markets online is plugged - in to the point of nonconsensual sodomy .
Perversely , there 's something intensely gratifying in seeing it emerge as a serious issue , replete with SEC investigations , bounty hunts , and special news features .
The gist ?
People are taking money and making money .
Self - interest - often conflicted , often unstated - abounds .
It 's just like real life !
For a while , it seemed that all those stock tickers were just proofs - of - concept , a convenient way to demonstrate streaming information .
But now that online trading is gaining steam , and Motley Fool has top - level billing on Yahoo and The New York Times nonfiction bestseller list , the stimulating effect seems to have been anything but subliminal .
And as E*Trade ads show up on more small screens digital and analog alike , it 'll mean more West Coast investors waking up at 3 a.m. , with just enough time to hit the bulletin boards before trading begins .
As always , the shortest distance from profit - chart point A to point B is a lie .
So short - sellers talk down companies , get sued , cause widespread paranoia for about 10 seconds , and then start all over again .
It 's the time - honored , if ignoble , tradition of yelling " flood " in burning theaters , and selling galoshes to stampeding patrons who should be buying fire extinguishers , or - at the very least - comfortable running shoes .
Open , easily anonymized networks like the Web will always be good for fast - moving , potentially profitable rumors .
When the whispers tell you that all rumors are true , just remember to see who 's talking .
This article appeared originally in HotWired .
Jonathan Coulton sat in Gorilla Coffee in Brooklyn , his Apple PowerBook open before him , and began slogging through the day ’s e-mail .
Coulton is 36 and shaggily handsome .
In September 2005 , he quit his job as a computer programmer and , with his wife ’s guarded blessing , became a full - time singer and songwriter .
He set a quixotic goal for himself : for the next year , he would write and record a song each week , posting each one to his blog .
“ It was a sort of forced - march approach to creativity , ” he admitted to me over the sound of the cafe ’s cappuccino frothers .
He ’d always wanted to be a full - time musician , and he figured the only way to prove to himself he could do it was with a drastic challenge .
“ I learned that it is possible to squeeze a song out of just about anything , ” he said .
“ But it ’s not always an easy or pleasant process . ”
Given the self - imposed time constraints , the “ Thing a Week ” songs are remarkably good .
Coulton tends toward geeky , witty pop tunes : one song , “ Tom Cruise Crazy , ” is a sympathetic ode to the fame - addled star , while “ Code Monkey ” is a rocking anthem about dead - end programming jobs .
By the middle of last year , his project had attracted a sizable audience .
More than 3,000 people , on average , were visiting his site every day , and his most popular songs were being downloaded as many as 500,000 times ; he was making what he described as “ a reasonable middle - class living ” — between $ 3,000 and $ 5,000 a month — by selling CDs and digital downloads of his work on iTunes and on his own site .
Along the way , he discovered a fact that many small - scale recording artists are coming to terms with these days : his fans do not want merely to buy his music .
They want to be his friend .
And that means they want to interact with him all day long online .
They pore over his blog entries , commenting with sympathy and support every time he recounts the difficulty of writing a song .
They send e-mail messages , dozens a day , ranging from simple mash notes of the “ you rock ! ” variety to starkly emotional letters , including one by a man who described singing one of Coulton ’s love songs to his 6 - month - old infant during her heart surgery .
Coulton responds to every letter , though as the e-mail volume has grown to as many as 100 messages a day , his replies have grown more and more terse , to the point where he ’s now feeling guilty about being rude .
Coulton welcomes his fans ’ avid attention ; indeed , he relies on his fans in an almost symbiotic way .
When he could n’t perform a guitar solo for “ Shop Vac , ” a glittery pop tune he had written about suburban angst — on his blog , he cursed his “ useless sausage fingers ” —
Coulton asked listeners to record their own attempts , then held an online vote and pasted the winning riff into his tune .
Other followers have volunteered hours of their time to help further his career : a professional graphic artist in Cleveland has drawn an illustration for each of the weekly songs , free .
Another fan recently reformatted Coulton ’s tunes so they ’d be usable on karaoke machines .
On his online discussion board last June , when Coulton asked for advice on how to make more money with his music , dozens of people chimed in with tips on touring and managing the media and even opinions about what kind of songs he ought to write .
Coulton ’s fans are also his promotion department , an army of thousands who proselytize for his work worldwide .
More than 50 fans have created music videos using his music and posted them on YouTube ; at a recent gig , half of the audience members I spoke to had originally come across his music via one of these fan - made videos .
When he performs , he upends the traditional logic of touring .
Normally , a new Brooklyn - based artist like him would trek around the Northeast in grim circles , visiting and revisiting cities like Boston and New York and Chicago in order to slowly build an audience — playing for 3 people the first time , then 10 , then ( if he got lucky ) 50 .
But Coulton realized he could simply poll his existing online audience members , find out where they lived and stage a tactical strike on any town with more than 100 fans , the point at which he’d be likely to make $ 1,000 for a concert .
It is a flash - mob approach to touring : he parachutes into out - of - the - way towns like Ardmore , Pa. , where he recently played to a sold - out club of 140 .
Natural beauties like Miss China Qi Guan will not be eligible
A contest will be held in October among women who have undergone cosmetic surgery , according to state media .
It will be open to any woman who can prove her beauty is man-made .
Plastic surgery is on the increase in China , China Daily newspaper said , with around 20bn yuan ( $ 2.4 bn ) spent yearly on beauty treatments .
The idea for " Miss Plastic Surgery " was reportedly born after a woman was barred from a traditional beauty contest after spending $ 13,000 on 11 cosmetic operations .
The paper said China now had a million beauty salons , employing six million people .
Their clients range from body - conscious teenage girls to women in their 30s seeking facial jobs and breast implants , it added .
The rise of the salons is based on the assumption that beauty is a route to success , China Daily said , citing findings by US economists which indicated that good looks increased overall hourly income by 5 % .
China recently lifted a 54 - year ban on beauty pageants , which the authorities used to see as bourgeois and decadent .
But the explosion of economic growth and the loosening of social controls of the past few years has led to a growing preoccupation with how people look .
The Miss World contest was held in China for the first time in 2003 .
Hi , we are Indians !
Come , call us dumb , stupid , we wo n’t mind .
We ourselves say ill things about Biharis , haryanvis , bengalis or any other , for that matter .
We crack jokes potraying Sardars as stupid people even on national television .
We call our government irresponsible , corrupt and our police dishonest .
Its all well .
BUT , the minute you say a word about our religion , we will kill you !
The thing you say might be rational , might not be rational , but who cares !
we wo n’t even listen to you but start shouting and then you have it .
you are gone buddy .
Your time ’s up .
As an Indian , I have seen numerous instances where people have acted this way .
How do we explain this attitude ?
Despite of being educated , we show such intollerance .
Its not that all are like this but majority are , say 90 % .
There was this Danish cartoonist who made a controversial cartoon .
Muslims in India started shouting slogans , they took to streets demanding the cartoonist dead .
I bet they had n’t even seen the cartoon .
Neither had I .
So , I do n’t know whether it was that outrageous but even these protestors had n’t .
This is just one case , every religious community in India behaves the same way .
There ’s this band “ SLAYER ” which has some anti-christian songs .
its been a big hit elsewhere but it was banned in India as Christians went up to the minority commision to get it banned .
Why do we indians behave this way ?
Its time we grew above such things .
A better alternate would be to ask the person responsible for a reason of his controversial views .
we just want to kill everyone who goes against our beliefs , HUH , and we say that we are a democracy !!!!!!!!!!
Back in February 2004 , before he was running for President , Rudy Giuliani had this to say to Bill O’Reilly on the subject of civil unions for homosexuals :
On a February 2004 edition of Fox News ’s “ The O’Reilly Factor , ” Mr. Giuliani told Bill O’Reilly , when asked if he supported gay marriage , “ I ’m in favor of â€¦ civil unions . ”
He also said , “ Marriage should be reserved for a man and a woman . ”
Asked by Mr. O’Reilly in the interview how he would respond to gay Americans who said being denied access to the institution of marriage violated their rights , Mr. Giuliani said : “ That ’s why you have civil partnerships .
So now you have a civil partnership , domestic partnership , civil union , whatever you want to call it , and that takes care of the imbalance , the discrimination , which we should n’t have . ”
In 1998 , as mayor of New York City , Mr. Giuliani signed into law a domestic partnership bill that a gay rights group , the Empire State Pride Agenda , hailed as setting “ a new national benchmark for domestic partner recognition . ”
Now that ’s he ’s running for President , though , Ryan Sager at the New York Sun notes a rather startling departure from his previous position :
In a startling departure from his previously stated position on civil unions , Mayor Giuliani came out to The New York Sun yesterday evening in opposition to the civil union law just passed by the New Hampshire state Senate .
” Mayor Giuliani believes marriage is between one man and one woman .
Domestic partnerships are the appropriate way to ensure that people are treated fairly , ” the Giuliani campaign said in a written response to a question from the Sun .
“ In this specific case the law states same sex civil unions are the equivalent of marriage and recognizes same sex unions from outside states .
This goes too far and Mayor Giuliani does not support it . ”
Why might Giuliani change his position like this ?
I think it ’s pretty obvious , actually .
He ’s running for the Republican nomination for President and he needs to pander to the Religious Right in order to win the nomination .
He ’s already changed his position on abortion , so it ’s not surprising that he ’d change his mind on this issue as well .
Because , you see , when all you care about is winning , what you believe really does n’t matter .
It 's all Soros all the time for O'Reilly .
Did n't Soros push Bush to invade Iraq ?
Was n't it Soros that funded Gitmo ?
And I believe Soros coached Alberto Gonzales before he testified last week ... George wants to buy AMERICA !
Poor Joe Lieberman ...

In a typically robust response to remarks by the US televangelist Pat Robertson , Mr Chávez compared his detractors to the " rather mad dogs with rabies " from Cervantes ' Don Quixote , and unveiled his plans to use Venezuela 's energy reserves as a political tool .
" We want to sell gasoline and heating fuel directly to poor communities in the United States , " he said .
Mr Robertson 's remarks have threatened to inflame tension between the US and one of its main oil suppliers .
Yesterday the religious broadcaster apologised for his remarks .
" Is it right to call for assassination ?
No , and I apologise for that statement .
I spoke in frustration that we should accommodate the man who thinks the US is out to kill him , " he said .
In a TV broadcast on Monday , he said : " If he thinks we 're trying to assassinate him , I think that we really ought to go ahead and do it . "
Yesterday Mr Robertson initially said his comments had been misinterpreted , but went on to add that kidnapping Mr Chávez might be a better idea .
" I said our special forces could take him out .
Take him out could be a number of things , including kidnapping . "
The Bush administration tried to distance itself from Mr Robertson 's views without upsetting the large Christian fundamentalist wing which the veteran evangelist represents .
A State Department spokesman said assassination was not part of government policy .
" He 's a private citizen , " Donald Rumsfeld , the defence secretary , said of Mr Robertson .
" Private citizens say all kinds of things all the time . "
But Mr Robertson 's remarks are seen as an embarrassment at a time when the US is calling for a united front against terror .
Democrats have challenged the Bush administration to be more outspoken in its response to Mr Robertson 's remarks on the Christian Broadcasting Network .
Venezuela 's ambassador to the US , Bernardo Alvarez , said : " Mr Robertson has been one of this president 's staunchest allies .
His statement demands the strongest condemnation by the White House . "
The Venezuelan government is asking for assurances from the US government that Mr Chávez will be adequately protected when he visits New York for a special session of the UN next month .
Venezuela 's vice - president , José Vicente Rangel , said the possibility of legal action against Mr Robertson for incitement to murder should also be considered .
Venezuela , the world 's fifth largest crude exporter , supplies 1.3 m barrels of oil a day to the US .
It remains unclear how poor Americans might benefit from the cheap petrol offer , but Mr Chávez has set up arrangements with other countries for swapping services in exchange for oil .
Cuban doctors are working in the poorer areas of Venezuela in exchange for cheap oil going to Cuba .
Jamaica yesterday became the first Caribbean country to reach an agreement with Venezuela for oil at below - market terms .
The Petrocaribe initiative is a plan to offer oil at flexible rates to 13 Caribbean countries .
Jamaica will pay $ 40 a barrel , against a market rate of more than $ 60 .
Mr Chávez said oil importers such as the US could expect no respite from the oil market , predicting the price of a barrel would reach $ 100 by 2012 .
Anger is that powerful internal force that blows out the light of reason .
-- Ralph Waldo Emerson
Anger is appropriately blamed for flawed thinking since it tends to alter perception of risk , increase prejudice , and trigger aggression .
But is anger always destructive "
Three recent experiments published in the latest issue of Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin , an official publication of The Society for Personality and Social Psychology suggest it 's not .
Anger can actually prompt more careful and rational analysis of another person 's reasoning .
The article , written by Wesley G. Moons and Diane M. Mackie of the University of California , Santa Barbara and published in the May 2007 issue , looks at research investigating anger 's impact on thinking and decision - making .
In the studies , college students were exposed to arguments attempting to persuade them to unpopular viewpoints .
Beforehand , some were asked to write about an experience that had angered them .
The research found that , surprisingly , anger made participants more , rather than less , rational and analytical in their reactions .
The current research , conclude the authors , suggests that angry people can and do process information analytically but are often influenced by more mental shortcuts .
Although it is not always the case , anger - induced action is sometimes the result of quite clear - minded and deliberative processing .
The article " Thinking straight while seeing red :
The influence of anger on information processing , " was published by SAGE in the May issue of Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin .

' I 've never seen anything like it ...
We were lucky .
The others disappeared '
Daniel Stolzenberg was a man of few words but a lifetime of wisdom when it came to his passion : mountains .
Students and friends of the 60 - year - old veteran French climber were often treated to his philosophising .
" There 's no such thing as a high mountain or a low mountain , " he would say .
" There is only the mountain .
And when she 's angry - things can go very badly wrong . "
Ten days ago these words became tragically prophetic .
" Stol " , as he was known , was trekking in the Himalayas when furious blizzards set off a series of avalanches .
He and six other French mountaineers , including his wife Marie - Odile , disappeared with 11 Nepalese climbers when a wall of snow thundered into their base camp on the 6,981 - metre Kanguru peak .
Only four of the 22 - strong expedition survived .
It was the worst ever single loss of life in the mountains and a devastating blow not just to the victims ' families in France and Nepal , but to the close - knit global climbing community .
" I have never seen anything like it , " said Sarki Tamang , 18 , one of the Nepalese porters who dug his way out of the snow .
" There was a sudden loud noise and within seconds we were blown to the side .
We were lucky .
The others disappeared . "
Stolzenberg , an instructor with the prestigious Ecole Nationale de Ski et d'Alpinisme in the French Alpine town of Chamonix , liked to spend his autumns climbing in the Himalayas .
On October 3 , having flown to Kathmandu five days earlier , the Stolzenbergs set off with Grégory Flematti , Bruno Chardin , Bernard Constantin , François Judei and Jean - Paul Minette for the summit of Kanguru .
For these experienced climbers it should have been a relatively easy climb .
The snow - covered peak of Kanguru , which has claimed one life since it was first scaled by a German expedition in 1950 , was outlined against a blue sky .
They had just under a month between the end of the monsoon season and the start of the winter snow to reach the summit .
After seven days ' trekking the team established a base camp at 4,250 metres .
They planned to spend two weeks getting used to the altitude and setting up further camps at 5,300 and 6,000 metres before making an assault on the peak on October 18 .
On October 19 heavy snow began to fall .
Wanda Vivequin , a Canadian guide , was leading another group in the area .
" The conditions had been perfect and there was absolutely no sign that the weather was changing .
I was watching my barometer .
" But on the Wednesday heavy snow began falling , which did n't let up for around 36 hours . "
Her group met a distressed French trekker who had been near the area where the avalanches struck .
" He was really shaken and ashen - faced and told us that he heard avalanches coming off Kanguru peak in regular intervals . "
On October 20 , the Stolzenberg team set up their second camp 1,200 metres below the summit .
The heavy snow forced them back to the base camp , where Sarki and the other porters , employed to carry loads of up to 35kg for around £ 4 a day , had remained .
" The team came back down in the afternoon , and as they were tired from the climb and it was snowing most of them were in their tents when the avalanche struck , " said Sarki .
He and the three other survivors were in the kitchen tent preparing tea for the exhausted climbers when they heard a roaring sound .
" All of a sudden we heard a loud noise and within seconds we were blown to the side of an avalanche , " he said .
The avalanche swept the other 18 climbers down a deep gorge .
The porters hunted for survivors , but all they could see was a huge expanse of white .
It took the porters about four hours to descend in bare feet .
Sarki suffered severe frostbite on his toes and was immediately admitted to hospital .
According to the team from the Himalayan Rescue Association who searched for the bodies for four days , the avalanche dragged the climbers more than 100 metres down the mountain .
" We dug about 3.5 metres at base camp but in the gorge below , where we expect to find the remaining bodies , the snow is about 15 metres deep . "
Elizabeth Hawley , who has been monitoring expeditions in Nepal for over four decades , said the French team were experienced mountaineers but clearly did not realise how much snow was falling .
In Nepal 's small climbing community , many of the rescue workers lost friends .
" At one point I found a rucksack and I was scared that I would find a body next to it so I asked my colleague to keep on digging for me , " said one .
" I would hate to see my friends ' dead faces . "
So far , only one body has been found .
The rescue team expects to find more within one week provided the weather improves .
If it does n't they will have to wait until spring before the angry mountain gives up its dead .
After kiss and tell , it seems , we now have surrender and tell ( as in , pick up a couple of years ' worth of service pay for telling the Daily Bugle and Independent Sensational News how 13 days in Iranian custody seemed to you ) .
These are " exceptional circumstances " , says the MoD , granting exceptional rights to the Shatt al - Arab 15 .
They can sell their tales to the highest bidder : and Faye Turney - the lady with the drooping fag - will probably make more than the rest put together .
It may not always be a woman 's life in Her Majesty 's Navy , but Fleet Street certainly knows what shifts copies across newsagents ' counters .
So , yet again , we 're in the business of drawing lines .
How quick a buck can you make out of life in the public sector ?
Over there , lurking in a shadow , is Alastair Campbell , preparing to net a fast million or two for his diaries of the Blair years ( once the final Blair year is done ) .
Over here is Tony Blair himself , ready , like Major and Thatcher before him , to cash in on life at the top .
( Former PM with wife and mortgage to support seeks fast fix . )
Not so far off in the distance , just beyond David Blunkett as a matter of fact , stands John Stevens , Met police chief supreme , penner of News of the World columns on demand .
Are there standards here ?
Not really .
Civil servants - the high mandarins of probity - are far quicker off the memoir mark than they used to be .
( Our ex-man in Washington will shop John Prescott faster than Prezza can down a pint . )
The working assumption round every cabinet table must be of frantic scribbling in the car back to the ministry , detailing who said what for some lucrative dabble in instant history .
Will Liam Fox , so incensed by " undignified behaviour " yesterday , feel any differently 10 years on when he gets his contract for Inside Cameron 's Cabal ?
Too much of yesterday 's predictable fuss , then , has a pong of hypocrisy to it .
We 're used to politicians writing their tell - all life stories and selling the rights to Fleet Street .
We 're increasingly used to Sir Humphreys , top cops and military brass doing the same .
Why raise a fuss when a handful of ordinary sailors get caught in a headline horror and enjoy a chance of media payback ?
Why operate one wonky rule for the big and powerful and another for those who , impotently , had a very nasty turn ?
Yet , when you 've made all the egalitarian arguments available , there is still something rancid about this particular turn of the shekel screw .
Did the famous 15 do anything remotely heroic , or even interesting ?
No : they sat there in their boat , allowed themselves to be captured , gave a variety of forced statements to camera and showed why Britain 's most famous old cigarette brand was called Senior Service .
They had a pretty unpleasant time but it was never , to be honest , a truly threatening one .
The lather about " hostage taking " and humiliation was always much overdone .
This was a diplomatic waltz of low intensity , with an hour of smirking PR as its top prize .
In short , the rewards on offer for surrendering and telling are quite out of proportion to the actual offence .
Those who dole them out inflate a " heroism " that 's nowhere justified and pump up not much of a story .
Maybe they , too , need a cooler , wider view .
Is it fair game now for every embattled sergeant on the Basra road to sell his saga of personal bravery under fire ?
Is it fair game for the third major on the left to tell the Sunday Bugle what Prince Harry had for mess breakfast , and if he turned as white as the porridge after another wild night out ?
Is anything that happens of interest ( and monetary value ) to soldiers , sailors , airmen or policeman now fodder for a cheque ?
That seems a glum counsel of despair , a shrug over discipline , duty or just mere togetherness .
And it's why the MoD has made such a hash of this decision .
Perhaps they wanted to keep some control over the stories as told , and this was the only practical way .
Yet , in fact , this is to be a precedent that comes back to haunt them , a line that has to be drawn whenever somebody wearing a uniform does something interesting .
But how do you finagle such lines when they run straight through the heart of Downing Street and Whitehall , trailing hypocrisy behind them ?
That 's easy .
You put a five - year financial block on all political tales from office , all mandarins spilling indiscreet beans , all coppers making a good screw , all press secretaries spinning themselves a fortune .
History ?
History can wait .
And news ?
The best , most truthful balance of news does n't come with a chink of the cash register .
It arrives spontaneously because it needs to be told .
Loot is the worst foe of truth in such contexts .
Cut it out and we might all be a little better informed .

BAGHDAD --
An Iraqi tennis coach and two of his players were killed because they were wearing shorts , apparently in violation of a warning by Islamic extremists .
Gunmen stopped the car in which the athletes were riding and asked them to step out before shooting them Wednesday , Manham Kubba , secretary general of the Iraqi Tennis Union , said yesterday .
The coach , Hussein Ahmed Rashid , was Sunni , and the two players were Shi'ite , Kubba said .
The athletes were in shorts when they were killed and police believe the attack was related to a warning by extremists against such attire , police Lieutenant Maitham Abdul Razzaq said .
He said the warning was made in leaflets distributed in the Sadiyah neighborhood in southwest Baghdad a week before the attack .
The deaths of the three had previously been reported , but the statements provided more details and clarified that all the victims were tennis players .
This was the second attack against athletes in just over a week .
A tae kwon do team was kidnapped in western Iraq while driving to a training camp in neighboring Jordan on May 17 .
The 15 athletes were snatched on a road between Fallujah and Ramadi , a particularly violent area .
The athletes were members of a private sports club that hopes to send athletes to the Olympics .
Prominent Sunni politician Adnan al - Dulaimi appealed for their freedom during a news conference yesterday at his office in Baghdad .
``I call upon the kidnappers of the tae kwon do athletes to release the team , " he said .

The human brain is a fascinating organ , but it 's an absolute mess .
Because it has evolved over millions of years , there are all sorts of processes jumbled together rather than logically organized .
Some of the processes are optimized for only certain kinds of situations , while others do n't work as well as they could .
There 's some duplication of effort , and even some conflicting brain processes .
Assessing and reacting to risk is one of the most important things a living creature has to deal with , and there 's a very primitive part of the brain that has that job .
It 's the amygdala , and it sits right above the brainstem , in what 's called the medial temporal lobe .
The amygdala is responsible for processing base emotions that come from sensory inputs , like anger , avoidance , defensiveness and fear .
It 's an old part of the brain , and seems to have originated in early fishes .
When an animal – lizard , bird , mammal , even you – sees , hears or feels something that 's a potential danger , the amygdala is what reacts immediately .
It 's what causes adrenaline and other hormones to be pumped into your bloodstream , triggering the fight - or - flight response , causing increased heart rate and beat force , increased muscle tension and sweaty palms .
This kind of thing works great if you 're a lizard or a lion .
Fast reaction is what you 're looking for ; the faster you can notice threats and either run away from them or fight back , the more likely you are to live to reproduce .
But the world is actually more complicated than that .
Some scary things are not really as risky as they seem , and others are better handled by staying in the scary situation to set up a more advantageous future response .
This means there 's an evolutionary advantage to being able to hold off the reflexive fight - or - flight response while you work out a more sophisticated analysis of the situation and your options for handling it .
We humans have a completely different pathway to cope with analyzing risk .
It 's the neocortex , a more advanced part of the brain that developed very recently , evolutionarily speaking , and only appears in mammals .
It 's intelligent and analytic .
It can reason .
It can make more nuanced trade - offs .
It 's also much slower .
So here 's the first fundamental problem :
We have two systems for reacting to risk – a primitive intuitive system and a more advanced analytic system – and they 're operating in parallel .
It 's hard for the neocortex to contradict the amygdala .
In his book Mind Wide Open , Steven Johnson relates an incident when he and his wife lived in an apartment where a large window blew in during a storm .
He was standing right beside it at the time and heard the whistling of the wind just before the window blew .
He was lucky – a foot to the side and he would have been dead – but the sound has never left him :
Ever since that June storm , a new fear has entered the mix for me : the sound of wind whistling through a window .
I know now that our window blew in because it had been installed improperly ....
I am entirely convinced that the window we have now is installed correctly , and I trust our superintendent when he says that it is designed to withstand hurricane - force winds .
In the five years since that June , we have weathered dozens of storms that produced gusts comparable to the one that blew it in , and the window has performed flawlessly .
I know all these facts – and yet when the wind kicks up , and I hear that whistling sound , I can feel my adrenaline levels rise ....
Part of my brain – the part that feels most me - like , the part that has opinions about the world and decides how to act on those opinions in a rational way – knows that the windows are safe ....
But another part of my brain wants to barricade myself in the bathroom all over again .
There 's a good reason evolution has wired our brains this way .
If you 're a higher - order primate living in the jungle and you 're attacked by a lion , it makes sense that you develop a lifelong fear of lions , or at least fear lions more than another animal you have n't personally been attacked by .
From a risk / reward perspective , it 's a good trade - off for the brain to make , and – if you think about it – it's really no different than your body developing antibodies against , say , chicken pox based on a single exposure .
In both cases , your body is saying : " This happened once , and therefore it 's likely to happen again .
And when it does , I 'll be ready . "
In a world where the threats are limited – where there are only a few diseases and predators that happen to affect the small patch of earth occupied by your particular tribe – it works .
Unfortunately , the brain 's fear system does n't scale the same way the body 's immune system does .
While the body can develop antibodies for hundreds of diseases , and those antibodies can float around in the bloodstream waiting for a second attack by the same disease , it 's harder for the brain to deal with a multitude of lifelong fears .
All this is about the amygdala .
The second fundamental problem is that because the analytic system in the neocortex is so new , it still has a lot of rough edges evolutionarily speaking .
Psychologist Daniel Gilbert wrote a great comment that explains this :
The brain is a beautifully engineered get - out - of - the - way machine that constantly scans the environment for things out of whose way it should right now get .
That 's what brains did for several hundred million years – and then , just a few million years ago , the mammalian brain learned a new trick : to predict the timing and location of dangers before they actually happened .
Our ability to duck that which is not yet coming is one of the brain 's most stunning innovations , and we would n't have dental floss or 401 ( k ) plans without it .
But this innovation is in the early stages of development .
The application that allows us to respond to visible baseballs is ancient and reliable , but the add - on utility that allows us to respond to threats that loom in an unseen future is still in beta testing .
A lot of the current research into the psychology of risk are examples of these newer parts of the brain getting things wrong .
And it 's not just risks .
People are not computers .
We do n't evaluate security trade - offs mathematically , by examining the relative probabilities of different events .
Instead , we have shortcuts , rules of thumb , stereotypes and biases – generally known as " heuristics . "
These heuristics affect how we think about risks , how we evaluate the probability of future events , how we consider costs , and how we make trade - offs .
We have ways of generating close - to - optimal answers quickly with limited cognitive capabilities .
Don Norman 's wonderful essay , Being Analog , provides a great background for all this .
Daniel Kahneman , who won a Nobel Prize in Economics for some of this work , talks ( . pdf ) about humans having two separate cognitive systems , one that intuits and one that reasons :
The operations of System 1 are typically fast , automatic , effortless , associative , implicit ( not available to introspection ) and often emotionally charged ; they are also governed by habit and therefore difficult to control or modify .
The operations of System 2 are slower , serial , effortful , more likely to be consciously monitored and deliberately controlled ; they are also relatively flexible and potentially rule governed .
When you examine the brain heuristics about risk , security and trade - offs , you can find evolutionary reasons for why they exist .
And most of them are still very useful .
The problem is that they can fail us , especially in the context of a modern society .
Our social and technological evolution has vastly outpaced our evolution as a species , and our brains are stuck with heuristics that are better suited to living in primitive and small family groups .
And when those heuristics fail , our feeling of security diverges from the reality of security .

This time , however , they ’re butting heads over Katie ’s fitness regimen not her religion .
Martin Holmes is allegedly concerned about his daughter ’s attempt to get back to a size 2 so quickly after giving birth .
Only days after having daughter Suri , Katie had allegedly begun planning her post - pregnancy exercise routine with Buff Brides , a group known for preparing women to wow their wedding guests with their figures .
Katie ’s father was not pleased with Katie ’s plans ( which she created with Tom ) .
Martin said to Reveal , a British magazine , “ My daughter needs rest , relaxation and recuperation .
Katie is already doing exercises to build up her back and shoulders and I simply can't go along with what is happening . "

Housing is Falling Much Faster than Reported
Real Estate Consultant John Burns has looked at the housing data and reached a rather interesting conclusion : " The housing market has softened much more than is being reported .
Given all the negative news coverage , that 's almost hard to believe .
But John does a good job dissecting the data , and he is now concerned that both the publicly disseminated New and Existing Home Sales information is misleading .
Even worse , he fears , is that policy makers are relying on this bad data to conclude that the housing market correction has not been too severe .
Regular Big Picture readers should recognize some of John 's conclusions .
Here are his top concerns :
• Closing Data : Sales have actually fallen 22 % year - over - year , based on comparing trailing 12 month periods .
If you compare year over year sales , the decline is even more severe .
• Mortgage Bankers Association ( MBA ) Data : MBA Seasonally Adjusted Purchase Application Index is down 18 % from its peak in September 2005 .
• Builder Data : D.R. Horton and Lennar have reported that orders have declined 27 % to 37 % , year - over - year -- even as they have dropped prices significantly .
These are the nation 's two largest homebuilders .
• Realogy Corporation Data :
In 2006 , there was a year - over - year decline of 18 % in brokerage related transactions at Realogy owned firms ( Century 21 , Coldwell Banker , and ERA ) • 2005 - 2006 National Association of Realtors State Data :
The NAR is showing some very sharp year - over - year corrections : Florida down 28 % ; California down 24 % ; Arizona off 28 % .
However , the NAR data may actually be understating the falloff .
John 's data the more likely actual sales decrease to be closer to 34 % , 27 % and 38 % , respectively .
Prior to 2005 , John 's data tracked very closely with the NAR , so this deviation is worth further investigation .
The entire piece , and all of its sourcing , is well worth a read .

A miniature helicopter equipped with an electronic brain and simple visual sensor that allowed it to takeoff , fly and land as well as an insect .
As tiny as insect brains are , they can still perform extraordinary acrobatics in the air that human flying machines have yet to match .
Now scientists reveal a miniature helicopter , with an electronic brain inspired by insects , that could help lead to better takeoffs , flights and landings for robotic aircraft .
Insects and other animals capable of powered , flapping flight are somehow able to execute controlled takeoffs and landings and keep flying at proper altitudes despite their lack of the sophisticated instruments available to human aviators .
" It 's extraordinary to see flies navigate with just their small 10 - milligram brains , " said researcher Nicolas Franceschini , a neurophysiologist and engineer at France ’s National Center for Scientific Research and at the University of the Mediterranean in France .
Bug brains
Franceschini and his colleagues have studied the insect brain for more than 30 years , during which time they have designed more than a dozen robots that drew on aspects of the insect nervous systems .
" They can do a lot with so little , " Franceschini said .
The simple principles that Franceschini and his colleagues think underlie insect flight have to do with visual cues .
As insects fly , their ground view changes depending upon their height above the ground and their speed relative to the ground .
Essentially , the higher the insect , the slower the ground will appear to sweep below it .
The changing view that insects have of the ground , known as " optic flow , " thus encodes details on both an insect 's height and velocity .
Franceschini and his colleagues speculated that insects rely on simple relationships between their height and velocity to keep flying .
Basically , the idea is that if they slow down , they will begin descent , and if they speed up , they will begin climbing .
By the same token , if they are descending , they will slow down , and if they are climbing , they will speed up .
" They do n't need a speedometer or altimeter .
They just need to use their eyes , " said Franceschini , whose latest work on this topic is detailed online in the Feb. 8 issue of the journal Current Biology .
And not very complex eyes at that .
" Each compound eye of a housefly [ image ] only can see 3,000 pixels , nothing like the megapixels seen in today 's digital cameras , " Franceschini added .
Copying nature
The researchers developed a roughly 200 - milligram electronic brain , or " optic flow regulator , " that mimics what " the housefly just uses just two or three neurons to do , " Franceschini said .
They plugged the electronic brain into a three - ounce miniature helicopter , small enough to fit in a shoebox and equipped with a simple visual sensor pointed downward .
The helicopter was tethered to a rod and free to fly around a pole [ image ] .
" It demonstrated very similar behavior to insects , " Franceschini told LiveScience .
" It never crashes .
One could easily take an optic flow regulator and sensor and use it for aircraft to navigate autonomously . "
Their findings also help illuminate the basis for a number of previously unexplained observations regarding insect flight .
For instance , honeybees often drown when flying over very still water .
" There are no contrasting features in their field of view then , so they have no visual cues to go by , " Franceschini said .
" Helicopter pilots have the same problem in the desert . "

So far , without major causes to incite mass public opinion ( such as civil rights and the Vietnam war were in the 1960 ’s ) , and without a national organization or coalition of organizations , these groups have focused on specific limited issues .
Most of these groups operate around larger urban areas and colleges / universities .
A diverse mix of organizations , many target hate groups for often violent counter - protests .
Some are focused on issues such as World Trade , International Debt , and military involvement in foreign cultures .
Meetings of the World Trade Organization or the International Monetary Fund are guaranteed to attract protests .
The theme is always the same .
Big is bad .
Rich are using the poor to stay rich .
Our government in particular is using its power immorally .
It used to be a matter of good intentions gone awry .
Now it is plain fraud .
The governments using biofuel to tackle global warming know that it causes more harm than good .
But they plough on regardless .
In theory , fuels made from plants can reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by cars and trucks .
Plants absorb carbon as they grow - it is released again when the fuel is burned .
By encouraging oil companies to switch from fossil plants to living ones , governments on both sides of the Atlantic claim to be " decarbonising " our transport networks .
In the budget last week , Gordon Brown announced that he would extend the tax rebate for biofuels until 2010 .
From next year all suppliers in the UK will have to ensure that 2.5 % of the fuel they sell is made from plants - if not , they must pay a penalty of 15 p a litre .
The obligation rises to 5 % in 2010 .
By 2050 , the government hopes that 33 % of our fuel will come from crops .
Last month George Bush announced that he would quintuple the US target for biofuels : by 2017 they should be supplying 24 % of the nation 's transport fuel .
So what 's wrong with these programmes ?
Only that they are a formula for environmental and humanitarian disaster .
In 2004 I warned , on these pages , that biofuels would set up a competition for food between cars and people .
The people would necessarily lose : those who can afford to drive are richer than those who are in danger of starvation .
It would also lead to the destruction of rainforests and other important habitats .
I received more abuse than I 've had for any other column - except for when I attacked the 9/11 conspiracists .
I was told my claims were ridiculous , laughable , impossible .
Well in one respect I was wrong .
I thought these effects would n't materialise for many years .
They are happening already .
Since the beginning of last year , the price of maize has doubled .
The price of wheat has also reached a 10 - year high , while global stockpiles of both grains have reached 25 - year lows .
Already there have been food riots in Mexico and reports that the poor are feeling the strain all over the world .
The US department of agriculture warns that " if we have a drought or a very poor harvest , we could see the sort of volatility we saw in the 1970s , and if it does not happen this year , we are also forecasting lower stockpiles next year " .
According to the UN food and agriculture organisation , the main reason is the demand for ethanol : the alcohol used for motor fuel , which can be made from maize and wheat .
Farmers will respond to better prices by planting more , but it is not clear that they can overtake the booming demand for biofuel .
Even if they do , they will catch up only by ploughing virgin habitat .
Already we know that biofuel is worse for the planet than petroleum .
The UN has just published a report suggesting that 98 % of the natural rainforest in Indonesia will be degraded or gone by 2022 .
Just five years ago , the same agencies predicted that this would n't happen until 2032 .
But they reckoned without the planting of palm oil to turn into biodiesel for the European market .
This is now the main cause of deforestation there and it is likely soon to become responsible for the extinction of the orang - utan in the wild .
But it gets worse .
As the forests are burned , both the trees and the peat they sit on are turned into carbon dioxide .
A report by the Dutch consultancy Delft Hydraulics shows that every tonne of palm oil results in 33 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions , or 10 times as much as petroleum produces .
I feel I need to say that again .
Biodiesel from palm oil causes 10 times as much climate change as ordinary diesel .
There are similar impacts all over the world .
Sugarcane producers are moving into rare scrubland habitats ( the cerrado ) in Brazil , and soya farmers are ripping up the Amazon rainforests .
As President Bush has just signed a biofuel agreement with President Lula , it 's likely to become a lot worse .
Indigenous people in South America , Asia and Africa are starting to complain about incursions onto their land by fuel planters .
A petition launched by a group called biofuelwatch , begging western governments to stop , has been signed by campaigners from 250 groups .
The British government is well aware that there 's a problem .
On his blog last year the environment secretary David Miliband noted that palm oil plantations " are destroying 0.7 % of the Malaysian rainforest each year , reducing a vital natural resource ( and in the process , destroying the natural habitat of the orang - utan ) .
It is all connected . "
Unlike government policy .
The reason governments are so enthusiastic about biofuels is that they do n't upset drivers .
They appear to reduce the amount of carbon from our cars , without requiring new taxes .
It 's an illusion sustained by the fact that only the emissions produced at home count towards our national total .
The forest clearance in Malaysia does n't increase our official impact by a gram .
In February the European commission was faced with a straight choice between fuel efficiency and biofuels .
It had intended to tell car companies that the average carbon emission from new cars in 2012 would be 120 grams per kilometre .
After heavy lobbying by Angela Merkel on behalf of her car manufacturers , it caved in and raised the limit to 130 grams .
It announced that it would make up the shortfall by increasing the contribution from biofuel .
The British government says it " will require transport fuel suppliers to report on the carbon saving and sustainability of the biofuels they supply " .
But it will not require them to do anything .
It can't : its consultants have already shown that if it tries to impose wider environmental standards on biofuels , it will fall foul of world trade rules .
And even " sustainable " biofuels merely occupy the space that other crops now fill , displacing them into new habitats .
It promises that one day there will be a " second generation " of biofuels , made from straw or grass or wood .
But there are still major technical obstacles .
By the time the new fuels are ready , the damage will have been done .
We need a moratorium on all targets and incentives for biofuels , until a second generation of fuels can be produced for less than it costs to make fuel from palm oil or sugar cane .
Even then , the targets should be set low and increased only cautiously .
I suggest a five - year freeze .
This would require a huge campaign , tougher than the one which helped to win a five - year freeze on growing genetically modified crops in the UK .
That was important - GM crops give big companies unprecedented control over the foodchain .
But most of their effects are indirect , while the devastation caused by biofuel is immediate and already visible .
This is why it will be harder to stop : encouraged by government policy , vast investments are now being made by farmers and chemical companies .
Stopping them requires one heck of a battle .
But it has to be fought .

PUBLISHER'S UPDATE :
says 4.5 million votes will be shoplifted in 2008 , thanks largely to the " Rove- bots " that have been placed in the Justice Department following the U.S. Attorney firings .
Being the guy who uncovered the voter " purge lists " of 2000 that disenfranchised black voters , he 's worth listening to , even if the mainstream press chooses not to .
This time around , he claims to have 500 emails that the House subpoenaed and Karl Rove claims were deleted forever .
They prove definitively , says Palast , that the Justice Department is infested with operatives taking orders from Rove to steal upcoming elections for Republicans and permanently alter the Department .
The " clownocracy " of Bush and Rove is criminal and even evil in its attempts to steal past and future elections , according to Palast , and can only be stopped if " Democrats ... find their souls and find their balls .
" In an updated new version of his best - selling book , Armed Madhouse , Palast lays out the case for the future theft of the presidency , along with lots of other Executive malfeasance .
I chatted with him about the role of the Justice Department in this scheme , and what it means for the viability of our " democracy . "
Here are some of the 500 emails .
— JDFirst off , the " lost " emails .
I guess you 're confident those 500 emails are n't themselves a hoax ?
Considering the source ?
[ John Wooden , the man behind the spoof site , whitehouse.org , forwarded them on to Palast after someone accidentally sent them to Wooden 's georgewbush.org domain . ]
Oddly , the GOP verified their authenticity to BBC .
I almost fell over dead when they did that .
How did they do that exactly ?
We asked them on camera .
They did not deny they were the party 's internal emails — just disagreed what the " caging " lists were .
Saying , for example , they were " donor " lists .
Men in homeless shelters ?
Remember , there 's no First Amendment in England .
I 'm wrong , I 'm sued , I 'm broke , I 'm toast .
Let 's move on to former Justice Department counsel ( and Regent University graduate ) Monica Goodling 's recent testimony in front of the House Judiciary Committee , since it 's so fresh ... The blondeling underling of the Police State .
The lady was trying to tell us something important , but the dim bulbs of the U.S. press and the committee dolts would n't listen .
She began by accusing her bosses of perjury .
The issue was her allegation that they knew all about " caging . "
And no one asked her one damn question about it .
Like what is " caging " and why would they commit perjury to cover it up ?
Rep. Linda Sanchez ( D - CA ) asked , and Goodling said , " It has to do with direct mail .
" And that was it .
D'oh !
It 's not about " direct mail . "
Direct mail has to do with Victoria 's Secret and stuff like that .
This was all about stealing the 2004 — and 2008 — elections .
That 's why she wanted immunity .
She was afraid it would all unravel , the caging game ... but she had nothing to fear .
Well , it is a direct mail term , but it 's also a voter supression term .
Do no senators know that , not even Committee Chair John Conyers ?
Conyers knows — and he knows me .
He 's keeping his powder dry .
The others are clueless .
Caging works like this .
Hundreds of thousands of Black and Hispanic voters were sent letters — do not forward .
Letters returned as undeliverable ( " caged " ) were used as evidence the voter did n't live at their registered address .
The GOP goons challenged these voters ' right to cast ballots — and their votes were lost .
But whose letters were caged ?
Here 's where the game turns to deep evil .
They targeted Black students on vacation , homeless men — and you 'll love this —
Black soldiers sent overseas .
They were n't living at their home voting address because they were shivering under a Humvee in Falluja .
As you put it in regard to election rigging , 2000 was about " purge lists , " 2004 was about " caging , " and 2008 will be about " verification . "
Can you briefly explain the difference between these ?
Sure .
In 2000 , I cracked the computer disks ( CD - ROMs then ) from Katherine Harris ' office showing 56,000 names of voters " purged " from voter rolls as felons who are n't allowed to vote .
In fact , every one — every one — was an innocent voter , though most were guilty of VWB — Voting While Black .
That was the 2000 " purge .
"
In 2004 , it was nearly identical .
Except , instead of calling voters " felons , " they called them " suspect " voters , fraudulently using a false voting address .
The effect was the same : the voter would lose their registration ; or their vote on election day when they showed to vote ; or , in the case of soldiers , their absentee ballot would be challenged and tossed .
You claim the reason for Democrat inaction in election scandals is because of racism , that the white caucus is bigger than the black caucus .
But do n't Democrats gain by making sure black people are enfranchised ?
Which Democrats ?
The huge purge and block of voters in Georgia [ were done by ] reptiles like Zell Miller in control of the Georgia Democratic Party .
There 's an awful lot of Democrats who would not win primaries if dark - skinned citizens could just vote any time they pleased .
My mind goes back to Conyers .
What did you mean earlier by " keeping his powder dry ?
" We talk .
' Nuff said .
Fair enough .
So you 're working also with former U.S. Attorney for New Mexico , David Iglesias , yes ?
Claro que si.
I was watching Chris Matthews ' TV show — " Softball , " as you 've called it — and he asked Iglesias what his long term plans were — if he was writing a book .
Iglesias indicated that he was , and also , that he wanted a TV show similar to Matthews ' at some point , and seemed to be totally serious .
Given that Iglesias has been willing to go " along with the game " in the past , are you concerned that his recent turn might be motivated by opportunism ?
I do n't care if he 's motivated by a love of Barbie dolls .
He 's been pushed by the Rove - bots to expose the game .
I 'll take it anyway I can get it — the facts , ma'am .
Do you have a wide - angle view of the current Administration 's strategy with the Justice Department , and if so , give us the summary .
Is it about election theft , or is it mostly about stocking the lake for future conservative judge appointments ?
Yes .
First , it 's elections .
They do n't want the voters making any foolish choices .
Specifically , while the attention 's been focused 100 % on the firings , no one is talking about the hirings .
That 's what Goodling was trying to get across .
The key : at the " Pearl Harbor Day Massacre , " they replaced the prosecutors with Rove- bots , a sleeper cell of anti-Constitutional saboteurs who will explode in 2008 , led by the new prosecutor for Arkansas , Tim Griffin .
Talk a little bit about the relevance of Tim Griffin — the perp who became prosecutor — and Arkansas in 2008 .
It was Griffin who directed the " caging " ops for the GOP .
Caging , by the way , is illegal .
Law Professor Bobby Kennedy pointed out it violates the Voting Rights Act of 1965 — and I 'd add , as a former racketeering investigator , mail fraud statutes .
So Griffin 's a felon — now U.S. Attorney .
Is Kennedy still actively publicizing this ?
Yes .
The incriminating email is reproduced right in Armed Madhouse .
That 's why Griffin and Goodling were high - fiving over the fact that no one 's picked up the investigations of that " British reporter " Palast .
The key thing is , Griffin is not just " involved , " he is directing the scheme .
His denial was confidential — had to be subpoenaed .
Remember , as Goodling testified , the line of the Bushies is that Griffin had nothing to do with caging .
So is Congress eventually going to get to all this ?
Is that the end game with the Justice Department investigation ?
No , Congress wo n't do squat .
Did anyone do anything about the felon purge ?
It went backwards : Bush signed the Help America Vote Act .
God forbid .

It 's Saturday evening in Manhattan , and I 'm a couple of hours into an 8 - to - close shift at the Bar ; Jocelyn will be with me until close , and Sophie 's off at 1 .
It 's a good crowd , the mood is light , people are drinking less beer and more hard liquor , and so the tips have been pretty good .
I 'm trying to save up to buy a dress I saw last week , even though I have n't yet worked up the courage to walk inside the store to find out how much it costs .
I 'm cooking at home more instead of getting take - out , I 'm trying to take on an extra shift here and there , and there may even be some news to report in the semi- near future about me writing a regular column somewhere ...!
I'm in a pretty good mood , too , and enjoying myself .
Things at the Bar have been pretty good recently , and it 's nice when you can let your guard down a bit and just enjoy the company of your colleagues and your customers for what it is .
I feel good , too - between the general feeling of having recovered from something both physically and emotionally draining , and the fact that I 'm not only blogging regularly again but also working on my novel on a semi- regular basis , it 's hard not to feel good .
I was worried that I might have gained a little weight the past couple of weeks , but I fit into my jeans with no problem this afternoon , and I 'm wearing one of my favorite shirts , a deep pink Lacoste polo with the little alligator on it .
I do n't mind saying I look pretty good .
Sometime after ten , a guy I 'm pretty sure I 've never seen before comes up to the bar and orders a gin and tonic .
He 's on the short side - a couple of inches taller than me - and not very good looking , but he 's smiling and friendly .
As luck would have it , a stool opens up just as I 'm serving him , so he grabs it and makes himself at home .
He tips $ 2 on a $ 6 drink , so I make a mental note to keep an eye on his glass .
When I check on him about twenty minutes later , he 's about to need a refill , so I approach to ask if he wants one , and as I get closer I hear the woman sitting next to him say , " ... fucking hint ? "
She gets up , and she and her friend walk away , toward the other end of the bar .
He shakes his head and downs the last gulp of his drink .
" Another one ? " I ask him with a smile .
" Yeah , definitely .
What 's your name ? "
" I'm Debra .
And you are ? " " Leonard . "
We shake hands , and while I mix him another G&T , I feel him looking me up and down .
I tell him to enjoy , then I collect his cash and move along .
At one point not long after , I notice he 's left his coat on his stool and his still half - full glass on the bar , so I keep an eye out .
When I see him again , he 's holding his head and shaking it a little .
" Are you okay , Leonard ? " " Yeah , yeah , yeah , I 'm good , I 'm great , do n't worry about it .
Debra , right ? " I nod .
" Debra , keep 'em coming , I 'm in for the long haul . "
He rubs his nose and smiles so widely I think his face might crack , then he turns to the guy next to him and laughs .
It 's a busy night , so I 'm not on top of Leonard 's situation all the time .
But he 's keeping up a pretty good pace on his G&Ts , and he seems to be alienating the people around him .
Nobody 's asked me for help , or gone to Bill or Vince , so it probably is n't anything serious , but judging from the looks on people 's faces as they walk away from him , he must be doing or saying something offensive .
Then at just after one , when Sophie 's getting ready to head out , Leonard calls me over .
" Debra , " he says , gesturing toward Sophie , " do you think she 'd stay and have a drink with me ?
I really want her to come home with me and fuck me . " " What ? "
" It 's cool , I 'm a good guy , I 'd treat her right .
I always make sure the girl comes a few times before I get mine ! "
He 's slurring his words , and I 'm not real happy with the things he 's saying - luckily , Sophie 's already in the back room and out of earshot .
" So how about that refill ? " " Leonard , honey , I think you 've had enough , and it 's probably time for you to get going .
Can I have someone get you a cab ?
" He gestures for me to lean closer , so I do .
" I have to get something off my chest .
I 've never been with a black woman .
She 's really hot !
I just want to know what it 's like .
Ca n't you please ask her for me ? "
This guy 's got some serious stones .
" She 's got a boyfriend , Leonard , and he 's not someone you want to mess with . "
" Okay , just give me another drink , then . "
" I really think you 've had enough tonight . "
" Can I get something else off my chest ? " " What 's that ? " " There 's something I want to get off your chest . "
And just as if he 's shaking my hand or tapping me on the shoulder , he reaches out and grabs my breast , and says , " I want to take that fuckin ' crocodile home with me . "
It 's a couple of seconds before I 'm sure I believe what 's happening , but as soon as I do , I take his hand off my breast , twist it , and slam it down on the bar .
" Vince ! "
I call out loudly , over Leonard 's yelling , and the barback is there within moments , with his hands on Leonard 's shoulders .
I grit my teeth , trying to resist the impulse to take advantage of his position by socking him in the nose as hard as I can .
" Vince , thisneeds an escort out of the building and a cab to take him home . " " What ? ! "
Leonard protests .
" I just wanted another fucking drink !
Where 's the goddamn manager ? "
Shit .
We have a good deal of autonomy at the Bar to enforce rules and keep ourselves safe , but if the customer asks for the manager , we give him what he wants .
I reluctantly release his wrist , and go to get Todd from the back room while Vince maintains his position keeping Leonard under control .
In the few moments it takes us to make it back to the bar area , I manage to get out the words , " This guy groped me , " but Todd stops in his tracks .
" That guy ?
The one Vince is holding to his stool ? " " Yes ! "
He looks at me quietly for a moment , then we walk down to the scene of the crime .
Leonard brightens up immediately .
" Todd , my man , I thought you might be here tonight !
What the hell kind of place are you running here ? "
I notice he 's talking somewhat more coherently than he was just a few minutes ago .
" Todd , you know this guy ?
" Leonard does n't wait for Todd to answer .
" I 'm just having a few drinks , I said something a little off - color , and this girl nearly breaks my hand !
" I feel my face flushing .
" He asked me to get Sophie to f -- to sleep with him , then he grabbed my breast ! " " What ?!
I did n't lay a hand on her !
Todd , man , you know me - I 'm always working on new material for my stand - up act or my screenplays , she must have misunderstood me .
I just wanted another drink .
" Todd rubs his forehead for a moment .
" Vince , did you see what happened ? "
Vince looks at me , then shakes his head .
Todd calls Jocelyn over , and she has the same answer .
Sophie 's already gone .
The crowd at the bar is three deep , and nobody 's been paying the slightest attention .
Nobody saw it .
" Leonard , I 'm really sorry .
What were you drinking ? " " Gin and tonic .
" I can't believe what I 'm hearing .
" What ? !
" " Debra , please get my friend another gin and tonic , on the house .
" This can't be happening .
" No . " " Excuse me ? " " Todd , heI 'm not serving him a damn thing ! " " Suit yourself .
Jocelyn , please get my friend a gin and tonic . "
She looks at me , helpless .
" Jocelyn ! "
Todd snaps .
She looks down , then goes to the rack of highballs .
Then Todd turns to me .
" Debra , go take a break .
" I step up to him , seething with frustration , the tears starting to form , and I look up at his eyes .
" Do you want me toHe turns around and steps around to the back of the bar to help Jocelyn out .
When I get to the back room , I grab my jacket and my bag , and I turn right around .
The only thought I can form in my head is , " What the hell just happened ? "
I 'm almost to the front door of the Bar when Todd calls out to me and asks where I 'm going .
What I yell back to him is something I 've never said to anybody lightly , much less someone who has the power to fire me .
" Fuck off ! "
And I 'm out the door before the crying really starts .
If you do n’t want to read about geeky filesystem stuff , you can stop reading now :-) .
In all current versions of Subversion , an FSFS filesystem has a directory db / revs / that contains a single file for each revision , from db / revs /0 for revision zero , up to db / revs/N for the youngest revision in your repository .
The same structure is used to store the ( potentially mutable ) revision properties in the directory db / revprops / .
This can lead to a large number of files stored in a single directory .
Since some filesystems are based on linear directory lookups , people have asked whether this means that Subversion will slow down with larger repositories ( in fact , this was one of the first things I wondered about when I started looking at Subversion ’s implementation , nearly two years ago ! ) .
Up till now , our stock answer has been “ if you have a very large repository , make sure you have a decent filesystem ” .
In Subversion 1.5 , the structure has changed slightly .
Newly - created FSFS repositories will instead use a two - level tree with up to ( by default ) 1000 files per directory .
This means that revisions 0–999 will be stored in a directory db / revs/0 / , revisions 1000 – 1999 will be stored in db / revs / 1/ , and so on .
These repositories are only compatible with other Subversion 1.5 clients , of course , so existing repositories continue to use the older scheme .
Why did we make this change ?
Surprisingly , it was n’t for performance — well , not really .
I ran some micro-benchmarks that showed that most filesystems are more sensitive to the depth of the directory tree ( the number of path components ) than the number of files in the directory .
( In any case , we ’re talking about differences of microseconds in the time taken to open a file by name , so it ’s not worth worrying about ) .
Additionally , macro- benchmarks using a clone of the ASF repository ( about 500k revisions ) showed that the new scheme might be slightly ( < 1 % ) slower than the old scheme for reads ( I did n’t test writes , which might well be faster , but revision files are read many more times than they ’re written , so I ’ve focussed on read performance so far ) .
So , if performance does n’t seem to be a concern , why change ?
There are two reasons , really .
Firstly , when I said “ most filesystems ” above , I really meant “ most UNIX filesystems ” .
While I was n’t able to test NTFS , I did test VFAT .
VFAT exhibits roughly O ( N ) behaviour , and slows down quite a bit above 2000 or so revisions .
The second reason is that some filesystems have limits : VFAT has a hard limit of 64 k files in a directory , and some NAS servers ship with default directory size limits for performance reasons ( and while you could get the NAS administrator to change the limits , it ’s probably better for Subversion to work by default ) .
The final reason is maintainability : it ’s a lot easier to deal with a million files if they ’re in a thousand different directories than in just one ( Windows Explorer ?
Not happy with large directories , for example ) .
So , how might you convert a repository to use this new structure ?
svnadmin dump | svnadmin load works , though if you have a particularly large repository you may not have the time ( or space ) available to make a complete copy of your repository .
So we ’re also developing an off - line conversion tool ( fsfs - reshard.py ) that does an in - place reorganisation between the old , linear structure and the new ‘ sharded ’ tree structure .
I converted my copy of the ASF repository to the new format in about 10 minutes .
However , when I converted it back to a linear format , it took nearly 10 hours !
I can only assume that ext2 has a really big problem with inserting new files into large directories .
Update : Someone asked me to clarify what I meant when I said that VFAT seemed to exhibit “ roughly O( N ) lookup behaviour ” above ( since O( N ) is already a rough measure ) .
What I saw was a response time that was O ( log N ) up to 1,024 files , and what I thought was O ( N ) from 2,048 onwards ; on closer inspection , the latter is actually much closer to O ( N2 ) .
Republican Ron Paul missed out on the 19th century , but he admires it from afar .
He speaks lovingly of the good old days before things like Social Security and Medicaid existed , before the federal government outlawed drugs like heroin .
In his legislative fantasies , the amiable Texas congressman would do away with the CIA and the Federal Reserve .
He 'd reinstate the gold standard .
He 'd get rid of the Department of Education and leave the business of schooling to local governments , because he believes that 's what the Constitution intended .
" Article 1 , Section 8 gives me zero amount of authority to do anything about public education , " says Paul on a recent weekday .
He 's seated in his congressional office near a sign than says , " DON'T STEAL ; THE GOVERNMENT HATES COMPETITION . "
Paul , 70 , has earned the nickname Dr. No for his habit of voting against just about anything that he sees as government overreach or that interferes with the free market .
No to the Iraq war .
No to a federal ban on same - sex marriage .
No to a congressional gold medal for Pope John Paul II and Ronald Reagan and Rosa Parks .
He says the medals are an unconstitutional use of taxpayer money and once suggested each House member instead contribute 100 bucks from his or her own pocket .
Last year , Congress decided to send billions of dollars to victims of Hurricane Katrina .
Guess how Ron Paul voted .
" Is bailing out people that chose to live on the coastline a proper function of the federal government ? " he asks .
" Why do people in Arizona have to be robbed in order to support the people on the coast ? "
There have been periods in history when the maverick congressman was not such a rare breed , but this is not one of those periods .
Democrats and Republicans have been quite disciplined in recent years -- when party leaders say " jump , " the savvy congressman had better inquire how high .
This makes the presence of a politician like Ron Paul something of a refreshing peculiarity .
He continually bucks the wishes of Republican leaders -- so much so , Paul recalls , that once while exhorting every other Republican to vote the party line , then - Speaker Newt Gingrich announced that Ron Paul was exempt .
Paul is not always alone in his dissent , but more than anyone else in Congress , he is legendary for it .
" When I 'm the only no vote , " says fiscal conservative Jeff Flake ( R - Ariz . ) , " I can usually rest assured he 's on a plane somewhere . "
Paul left his party and ran for president in 1988 on the Libertarian ticket , traveling the country and speaking to crowds as small as 10 .
His iconoclasm may explain why , despite his years in Congress -- first in the late ' 70s and early ' 80s , and more recently since 1997 -- Paul does n't hold a leadership post , does n't chair a committee or subcommittee .
He sees this as the price of being right .
" I never had a goal of working up the seniority ladder , " he says .
Paul has an easy chuckle and a down - home , friendly manner that tempers his strong language .
( In his columns , which appear online and are sometimes published in local newspapers , he pronounces a proposed government program " Orwellian " and calls former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan a " master of evasion . "
He once said on C - SPAN he feared being " bombed by the federal government at another Waco . " )
12th Graders Doing Worse On US National Tests
Money and big national lies told by our elites have failed to raise standardized test scores of 12th graders in America .
WALNUT CREEK , Calif . -
High school seniors take harder classes and earn higher grades than they used to but continue to fare poorly on achievement tests , according to reports released Thursday by the U.S. Department of Education .
Nationwide , just 1 in 4 high school seniors tested in 2005 ranked competent in math and barely a third read at grade level , the reports show .
Reading scores are the lowest since 1992 , with students in the Western United States performing worse than those in the Midwest and Northeast .
Despite the decline in achievement , students take the equivalent of 360 more hours of class than seniors who graduated in 1990 .
The National Assessment of Educational Progress ( NAEP ) scores provide still more evidence that the mainstream debate on social policy in America is conducted based on a set of lies about human nature .
Within America 's Lake Woebegone mythology ( or , if you prefer , Bright Shining Lie ) how to explain the failure of more instruction hours , more instruction in advanced topics , and standardized testing to raise test scores ?
How to explain the failure of more money to raise test scores ?
How to explain the failure of charter schools to raise test scores ?
How to explain the failure of the No Child Left Behind Act ?
After all , it had No Lie Left Behind .
How to ignore the elephant called IQ standing in the room ?
Time for a new phrase , a new formulation .
How about a " rigor gap " ?
" How is it that our high school students can earn more credits , get higher GPAs , but yet not perform any better ? " said David Gordon , member of the National Assessment Governing Board and Sacramento County , Calif. , schools superintendent .
During a Thursday press conference , Gordon termed the problem a " rigor gap . "
The lies have some years to run yet .
But the more vigorously the politicians try policies based on false assumptions the closer we get to the collapse of the old mythology .
We should be getting better if we live in wonderland .
The new reading scores show no change since 2002 , the last time the test was given .
" We should be getting better .
There 's nothing good about a flat score , " Winick said .
But our schools have gotten better at lying to parents about how well their kids are doing .
In 2005 , high school graduates had an overall grade - point average just shy of 3.0 - or about a B .
That has gone up from a grade - point average of about 2.7 in 1990 .
Junior is getting better grades .
Well , that 's great news .
What a nice lie those teachers are willing to tell .
The average kid was doing better in the good old days of 1992 .
Nationwide , 73 percent of 12th - grade students achieved a ``basic '' reading score in 2005 , down from 80 percent in 1992 , according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress , a sampling test the government calls the ``nation 's report card . ''
Sixty - one percent scored at or above the basic level in math .
At the same time , 68 percent of high school graduates completed at least a ``standard '' curriculum , up from 59 percent in 2000 , with the overall grade point average about one - third of a letter grade higher than in 1990 , the department said in a report .
The figures raise questions about the quality of the courses being taught at U.S. high schools , it said .
As Hispanics continue to grow as a percentage of the total population average NAEP scores are going to fall further .
No educational reform can overcome the demographic force of ethnic groups which score lower in standardized IQ tests .
Steve Sailer says there 's a wide gap between private beliefs and public utterances .
Here 's the really fascinating thing about the broad support for NCLB .
In private , virtually every single person in America understands that human beings are highly diverse in mental capabilities .
They just wont acknowledge it in public .
So why the massive widespread lying that forms the basis for educational policy in America ?
Liars who lie to protect the feelings of others are more popular .
Experiments have found that ordinary people tell about two lies every 10 minutes , with some people getting in as many as a dozen falsehoods in that period .
More interestingly -- and Libby might see this as the silver lining if he is found guilty -- Feldman also found that liars tend to be more popular than honest people .
...
Saxe found in one experiment that nearly 85 percent of college students had lied in the course of a romantic relationship , most often about another relationship .
( These were lies that people voluntarily admitted to Saxe , which means the actual number of lies and liars was probably higher . )
Nearly to a person , the liars said they were trying to protect the feelings of someone they cared about .
But on some topics where the lies get translated into government policy the lies are very damaging .
We need more honesty .
We are hurting ourselves with these lies .

Welcome to the Tenth Dimension ( text - based version )
In string theory , physicists tell us that the subatomic particles that make up our universe are created within ten spatial dimensions ( plus an eleventh dimension of " time " ) by the vibrations of exquisitely small " superstrings " .
The average person has barely gotten used to the idea of there being four dimensions : how can we possibly imagine the tenth ?
The flash version of this website ( www.tenthdimension.com) provides an interactive set of animations with narration and sound effects which explain the basic concepts from chapter one of the book .
The media - rich nature of these animations is not recommended for viewing with a dialup connection because of long load times .
Below is a transcript of the narration from those animations .
The ideas presented here come from chapter one of a new book called " Imagining the Tenth Dimension : a new way of thinking about time and space " , written by Rob Bryanton .
0 . A point ( no dimension )
We start with a point .
Like the “ point ” we know from geometry , it has no size , no dimension .
It ’s just an imaginary idea that indicates a position in a system .
1 . The first dimension – a line
A second point , then , can be used to indicate a different position , but it , too , is of indeterminate size .
To create the first dimension , all we need is a line joining any two points .
A first dimensional object has length only , no width or depth .
2. The Second Dimension – A Split
If we now take our first dimensional line and draw a second line crossing the first , we ’ve entered the second dimension .
The object we ’re representing now has a length and a width , but no depth .
To help us with imagining the higher dimensions , we ’re going to represent our second dimensional object as being created using a second line which branches off from the first .
Now , let ’s imagine a race of two - dimensional creatures called “ Flatlanders ” .
What would it be like to be a Flatlander living in their two - dimensional world ?
A two - dimensional creature would have only length and width , as if they were the royalty on an impossibly flat playing card .
Picture this : a Flatlander could n’t possibly have a digestive tract , because the pipe from their mouth to their bottom would divide them into two pieces !
And a Flatlander trying to view our three - dimensional world would only be able to perceive shapes in two - dimensional cross-sections .
A balloon passing through the Flatlander ’s world , for instance , would start as a tiny dot , become a hollow circle which inexplicably grows to a certain size , then shrinks back to a dot before popping out of existence .
And we three - dimensional human beings would seem very strange indeed to a Flatlander .
3 . The Third Dimension – A Fold
Imagining the third dimension is the easiest for us because every moment of our lives that is what we ’re in .
A three dimensional object has length , width , and height .
But here ’s another way to describe the third dimension : if we imagine an ant walking across a newspaper which is lying on a table , we can pretend that the ant is a Flatlander , walking along on a flat two - dimensional newspaper world .
If that paper is now folded in the middle , we create a way for our Flatlander Ant to “ magically ” disappear from one position in his two - dimensional world and be instantly transported to another .
We can imagine that we did this by taking a two - dimensional object and folding it through the dimension above , which is our third dimension .
Once again , it ’ll be more convenient for us as we imagine the higher dimensions if we can think of the third dimension in this way : the third dimension is what you “ fold through ” to jump from one point to another in the dimension below .
4. The Fourth Dimension – A Line
Okay .
The first three dimensions can be described with these words : “ length , width , and depth ” .
What word can we assign to the fourth dimension ?
One answer would be , “ duration ” .
If we think of ourselves as we were one minute ago , and then imagine ourselves as we are at this moment , the line we could draw from the “ one - minute - ago version ” to the “ right now ” version would be a line in the fourth dimension .
If you were to see your body in the fourth dimension , you would be like a long undulating snake , with your embryonic self at one end and your deceased self at the other .
But because we live from moment to moment in the third dimension , we are like our second dimensional Flatlanders .
Just like that Flatlander who could only see two - dimensional cross-sections of objects from the dimension above , we as three - dimensional creatures can only see three - dimensional cross-sections of our fourth - dimensional self .
5 . The Fifth Dimension – A Split
One of the most intriguing aspects of there being one dimension stacked on another is that down here in the dimensions below we can be unaware of our motion in the dimensions above .
Here ’s a simple example : if we make a Möbius strip ( take a long strip of paper , add one twist to it and tape the ends together ) and draw a line down the length of it , our line will eventually be on both sides of the paper before it meets back with itself .
It appears , somewhat amazingly , that the strip has only one side , so it must be a representation of a two - dimensional object .
And this means that a two - dimensional Flatlander traveling down the line we just drew would end up back where they started without ever feeling like they had left the second dimension .
In reality , they would be looping and twisting in the third dimension , even though to them it felt like they were traveling in a straight line .
The fourth dimension , time , feels like a straight line to us , moving from the past to the future .
But that straight line in the fourth dimension is , like the Möbius strip , actually twisting and turning in the dimension above .
So , the long undulating snake that is us at any particular moment will feel like it is moving in a straight line in time , the fourth dimension , but there will actually be , in the fifth dimension , a multitude of paths that we could branch to at any given moment .
Those branches will be influenced by our own choice , chance , and the actions of others .
Quantum physics tells us that the subatomic particles that make up our world are collapsed from waves of probability simply by the act of observation .
In the picture we are drawing for ourselves here , we can now start to see how each of us are collapsing the indeterminate wave of probable futures contained in the fifth dimension into the fourth dimensional line that we are experiencing as “ time ” .
6 . The Sixth Dimension – A Fold
What if you wanted to go back into your own childhood and visit yourself ?
We can imagine folding the fourth dimension through the fifth , jumping back through time and space to get there .
But what if you wanted to get to the world where , for example , you had created a great invention as a child that by now had made you famous and rich ?
We can imagine our fourth - dimensional selves branching out from our current moment into the fifth dimension , but no matter where you go from here the “ great child inventor ” timeline is not one of the available options in your current version of time -- “ you ca n’t get there from here ” -- no matter how much choice , chance , and the actions of others become involved .
There are only two ways you could get to that world – one would be to travel back in time , somehow trigger the key events that caused you to come up with your invention , then travel forward in the fifth dimension to see one of the possible new worlds that might have resulted .
But that would be taking the long way .
The shortcut we could take would involve us folding the fifth dimension through the sixth dimension , which allows us to instantly jump from our current position to a different fifth dimensional line .
7. The Seventh Dimension – A Line
In our description of the fourth dimension , we imagined taking the dimension below and conceiving of it as a single point .
The fourth dimension is a line which can join the universe as it was one minute ago to the universe as it is right now .
Or in the biggest picture possible , we could say that the fourth dimension is a line which joins the big bang to one of the possible endings of our universe .
Now , as we enter the seventh dimension , we are about to imagine a line which treats the entire sixth dimension as if it were a single point .
To do that , we have to imagine all of the possible timelines which could have started from our big bang joined to all of the possible endings for our universe ( a concept which we often refer to as infinity ) , and treat them all as a single point .
So , for us , a point in the seventh dimension would be infinity – all possible timelines which could have or will have occurred from our big bang .
8. The Eighth Dimension – A Split
When we describe infinity as being a “ point ” in the seventh dimension , we are only imagining part of the picture .
If we ’re drawing a seventh dimensional line , we need to be able to imagine what a different “ point ” in the seventh dimension is going to be , because that ’s what our line is going to be joined to .
But how can there be anything more than infinity ?
The answer is , there can be other completely different infinities created through initial conditions which are different from our own big bang .
Different initial conditions will create different universes where the basic physical laws such as gravity or the speed of light are not the same as ours , and the resulting branching timelines from that universe ’s beginning to all of its possible endings will create an infinity which is completely separate from the one which is associated with our own universe .
So the line we draw in the seventh dimension will join one of these infinities to another .
And , as boggling as the magnitude of what we are exploring here might be , if we were to branch off from that seventh dimensional line to draw a line to yet another infinity , we would then be entering the eighth dimension .
9 . The Ninth Dimension – A Fold
As we ’ve explored already , we can jump from one point in any dimension to another simply by folding it through the dimension above .
If our ant on the newspaper were a two - dimensional Flatlander , then folding his two - dimensional world through the third dimension would allow him to magically disappear from one location and appear in a different one .
As we ’re now imagining the ninth dimension , the same rules would apply – if we were to be able to instantaneously jump from one eighth dimensional line to another , it would be because we were able to fold through the ninth dimension .
10 . The Tenth Dimension – A Point ?
Before we discussed the first dimension , we could say that we first started out with dimension zero , which is the geometrical concept of the “ point ” .
A point indicates a location in a system , and each point is of indeterminate size .
The first dimension then , takes two of these “ points ” and joins them with a line .
When we imagined the fourth dimension , it was as if we were treating the entirety of three - dimensional space in a particular state as a single point , and drawing a fourth - dimensional line to another point representing space as it is in a different state .
We often refer to the line we have just drawn as “ time ” .
Then in the seventh dimension , we treated all of the possible timelines which could be generated from our big bang as if this were a single point , and imagined drawing a line to a point representing all of the possible timelines for a completely different universe .
Now , as we enter the tenth dimension , we have to imagine all of the possible branches for all the possible timelines of all the possible universes and treat that as a single point in the tenth dimension .
Whew !
So far , so good .
But this is where we hit a roadblock : if we ’re going to imagine the tenth dimension as continuing the cycle , and being a line , then we ’re going to have to imagine a different point that we can draw that line to .
But there ’s no place left to go !
By the time we have imagined all possible timelines for all possible universes as being a single point in the tenth dimension , it appears that our journey is done .
In String theory , physicists tell us that Superstrings vibrating in the tenth dimension are what create the subatomic particles which make up our universe , and all of the other possible universes as well .
In other words , all possibilities are contained within the tenth dimension , which would appear to be the concept we have just built for ourselves as we imagined the ten dimensions , built one upon another .
The Book :
" Imagining the Tenth Dimension :
a new way of thinking about time , space and string theory "
This unique book touches upon such diverse topics as Feynman 's " sum over paths " approach , quantum indeterminacy , and the soul .
More than just a scientific exploration , " Imagining the Tenth Dimension " is a mind - expanding exercise that could change the way you view this incredible universe in which we live .
Chapters :
01 A Quick Tour of Ten Dimensions
In this chapter , we explore much more fully the information presented on this site : a way that the ten dimensions can be imagined , with each stacked one upon another .
02 The Quantum Observer
This concept comes from quantum physics , which tells us that subatomic particles are actually waves of probability .
It is the act of observation that collapses these waves into one particular state .
According to the structure we ’re exploring here , how does the “ quantum observer ” fit into the picture ?
03 The Flow of Time
While Einstein ’s theories treated space and time as an entity , the more common approach in string theory and physics has been to treat time as an aspect which is separate from the other spatial dimensions .
In this chapter we argue that time is indeed the fourth spatial dimension , and it is only our unique viewpoint as quantum observers that gives us the illusion of time being a one - way “ arrow ” .
04 The Binary Viewpoint
What happens when you divide any point in the universe into “ here are the things it is ” and “ here are the things that it is n’t ” ?
That ’s the binary viewpoint of reality .
Popularized in the film “ The Matrix ” , and in Star Trek ’s “ holodeck ” , the idea of a world that could be indistinguishable from reality if we only we had a fast enough computer with a large enough memory has interesting connections to the way we are imagining our ten dimensions .
In this chapter we explore how this reductive analysis of the universe might be applied to the ten dimensions we ’re imagining .
05 Memes , Music and Memory
One of the contradictions that seem to be inherent in the “ quantum observer collapsing reality ” argument is that there would be no subatomic particles without an observer .
Everett ’s “ Many Worlds Theory ” is now becoming more popularly accepted by string theorists as one explanation of this apparent contradiction .
His theory explains that an observer is not necessary because all possible states do actually exist simultaneously , and the act of observation is not “ collapsing ” a particle , it is merely “ observing ” a part of a wave in one of its simultaneously existing states .
Still , whether we are “ observing ” or “ collapsing ” , the end result is the same .
But does the quantum observer have to be a person ?
In this chapter we explore the many other ways that a quantum observer could be present , including some of the more metaphysical aspects of this discussion .
06 The Anthropic Viewpoint
There are usually two versions of the Anthropic Viewpoint .
The first says that the reason we live in such an unlikely universe , created from countless lucky coincidences that led to the complex world we see around us , is that if those lucky coincidences had n’t occurred we would not be here to ask the question of why we are here .
However , the version of the Anthropic Viewpoint that is more relevant to our discussion says that all the other less fortunate universes do really exist , we ’re just not in them .
Some criticize the anthropic viewpoint as being a dead end or a cop out .
But , as we explore in this chapter , this second version of the Anthropic Viewpoint is currently popular under a different guise in modern physics , and fits in well with our version of the ten dimensions .
07 The Paradoxes of Time Travel
It keeps coming back to this : the difference between the worldview presented here and the view of science in general stems from the proposition that time is a full spatial dimension .
If time really is a spatial dimension , then free motion within it should some day be possible , and in chapter 3 we explored some of the ways that scientists have proposed that time travel could occur .
But there are also many famous stories and films that imagine what it would be like if we could travel in time .
In this chapter we look at this subject as it has been presented by works of fiction , and explore how these viewpoints fit ( or do n’t fit ) with the ten dimensions we are now imagining .
08 Dark Matter and Other Mysteries
Dark Matter and Dark Energy are two of the biggest quandaries currently facing modern science .
In this chapter we look at our new concept of the ten dimensions and explore whether any of the current unsolved mysteries of physics could some day be found to have their answers hidden within this new way of viewing the world .
We also explore some of the more paranormal mysteries which might have an explanation from this viewpoint .
As a mind - expanding exercise , we also explore some of the other ways that reality could be connected together that we are not currently conscious of , plus the hidden processing that the brain could well be executing to participate in the reality we are imagining here .
09 How Much Control Do We Have ?
We have now imagined a reality where everything is possible .
Everything that could have happened , did .
Everything that is about to possibly happen , does .
Even the things that we know did n’t happen or could n’t happen on our own timeline , did happen elsewhere in another part of the dimensional construct we ’re imagining .
But if that ’s all there is , then what is the point ?
As creatures with free will , should we care what we ’re about to do if there are other universes where we did the opposite ?
And if everyone around us is capable of every possible good and bad thing imaginable , how do we ever get anywhere ?
This chapter attempts to put these questions into perspective .
10 Triads : The Ten Dimensions Revisited
This chapter provides us with some different ways of thinking about the ten dimensions that may be useful to those who are still having difficulty with the concepts presented .
Rather than just being a re-statement of chapter one , we look at some new ideas which might have been too big to assimilate without first having worked our way through the other chapters .
" Imagining the Tenth Dimension " is a professionally bound and printed soft cover book , 214 pages , with illustrations .
It includes eleven chapters and an index , plus the lyrics to twenty - six songs which help to explore the concepts being presented .
This project began as a set of songs for a " concept album " about the nature of reality .
The lyrics to these songs are presented in their entirety as endnotes within the book " Imagining the Tenth Dimension " , which is available elsewhere on this site .
These songs are now being recorded , and clips for some of the songs will be available for auditioning later in 2006 : but for now , the list below is text only .
A second set of instrumental compositions , which will be called " Hearing the Tenth Dimension " , is also in the planning stages .

Researchers are getting closer to developing a robot that looks , talks , and acts like its human counterpart .
We ’ve selected a few robots that could almost pass for a human .
Repliee Q1Expo
Japanese scientists have developed a life - like female android called “ Repliee Q1 Expo ” .
The Q1 Expo has “ 42 actuators in her upper body , powered by a nearby air compressor , programmed to allow her to move like a human . ”
She can flutter her eyelids and move her hands like a human .
She even appears to breathe .
Repliee Q1 has skin made from a silicon substance has 11 piezoelectric sensors embedded in it to detect if someone is touching her
[ Source 1 – 2 ]
EveR -1
Korean scientists have developed the world ’s first female android , the EveR - 1 , which stands 1.6 m tall and weighs approx .
110 pounds .
It ’s capable of understanding 400 words , speaking , and making facial expressions via fifteen motors embedded into her silicon face .
For now , EveR - 1 can be employed as a guide robot at museums and department stores or as an educational model to read books to children , ” Baeg said .
But we are looking further ahead _ we are working on upgrading the android with the aim of making it move its legs by the end of this year .
It will be able to sit down and stand up by then , ” he expects .
[ Source 1 – Source 2 ]
Actroid DER2
This followup to the Actroid DER , builds upon the first version and adds “ more facial expressions ” .
The bot is controlled by a “ system of actuators powered by pneumatic pressure . ”
One drawback , you ’ll have to shell out $ 3500 to rent Actroid DER2 for 5 - days .
She can coordinate her motions with her voice using pneumatic pressure actuators , and is generally a pretty good substitute for flesh - based Wal - Mart greeters
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A type of chromium highlighted in the film “ Erin Brockovich ” causes cancer in lab animals when they drink it in water , and it could be harmful to people , the U.S. National Institutes of Health said on Wednesday .
Water drips from a tap at a home in Manchester , northern England , March 27 , 2006 .
A type of chromium highlighted in the film " Erin Brockovich " causes cancer in lab animals when they drink it in water , and it could be harmful to people , the U.S. National Institutes of Health said on Wednesday .
REUTERS / Phil Noble
Hexavalent chromium , also called chromium 6 , already has been shown to cause lung cancer when inhaled and is controlled by the Environmental Protection Agency as well as by states .
It is best known as the contaminant exposed by campaigner Erin Brockovich , whose battle against a polluter was dramatized in the May 2000 movie of the same name .
“ I am relieved and pleased and sorry because there are a lot of people who have ingested chromium 6 , ” said Brockovich , who still works in Los Angeles as a legal consultant on environmental issues .
“ It is high time but it is no surprise to me , ” she told Reuters .
“ This is a chemical that there have been ongoing arguments about , and now a third party has concluded that it can cause cancer by ingestion . ”
Environmentalists , who have been fighting for decades for tighter limits on how much chromium can be present in drinking water , said the findings offered a basis for such restrictions .
High doses of chromium 6 given to rats and mice in drinking water caused malignant tumors , the two - year study by the NIH ’s National Toxicology Program or NTP found .
“ In the rats we saw oral cavity tumors , ” said Michelle Hooth , who worked on the report .
“ In the mice we saw tumors in the small intestine . ”
Hooth said the animals were given much higher doses of chromium than people would ever encounter in drinking water , which is the usual practice in testing chemicals for cancer - causing potential .
INDUSTRIAL USES
Hexavalent chromium compounds are often used in electroplating , leather tanning and textile manufacturing and have been found in some drinking water sources , the NTP said .
Brockovich started investigations in 1991 into exposure to chromium 6 in drinking water in the town of Hinkley , California .
In 1996 , she and lawyer Ed Masry won a landmark $ 333 million settlement with Pacific Gas and Electricity over claims of toxic exposure .
Brockovich said on Wednesday she had settled another lawsuit with PG&E involving the contaminant last year .
But she said there were potentially dozens more toxic sites around the country .
The lowest doses given to rats and mice in the study were 10 times higher than what humans could consume from the most highly contaminated water sources identified at Hinkley , the researchers said .
From 1987 to 1993 , according to the Toxics Release Inventory , chromium compound releases to land and water in various U.S. states totaled nearly 200 million pounds .
“ The chromium industry has been trying to convince regulators for years that hexavalent chromium is actually quite safe when consumed via drinking water , even though it has long been known to be carcinogenic when inhaled , ” said Renee Sharp , a senior analyst at the Environmental Working Group .
“ NTP ’s findings will finally allow state and federal regulators to set drinking water standards based on up - to - date sound science , rather than having to rely on old , inadequate , and / or biased studies often funded by chromium polluters , ” added Sharp , whose group has lobbied for tighter regulation of chromium and other chemicals .
An entire season was lost when players were locked out on 15 September after owners and unions reached an impasse over a new labour agreement .
But on 13 July both sides announced they had hammered out a collective bargaining agreement .
The Players ' Association ratified the new terms on Thursday and the owners have now rubber - stamped the deal .
The board of governors voted unanimously 30 - 0 to accept the six - year deal which includes a number of rule changes and pay cuts for the majority of players .
About 230 players had been in Toronto on Thursday to vote on the six - year deal with nearly 90 % in favour .
The deal includes a salary cap for each team between $ 21.5 m and $ 39 m salary cap .
There also is a provision that allows a player to make a maximum salary of $ 7.4 m - 20 % of the team cap .
The minimum salary is set at $ 450,000 with pension benefits improved .
Among the rule changes , a shootout will now be held after a game that is tied at the end of regulation and still without a winner at the conclusion of a five - minute sudden - death overtime period .
Other amendments include the removal of the red line to permit longer passes while nets will be moved two feet closer to the end boards .
Goaltenders will have both the size of their playing equipment and the areas from which they can handle the puck restricted .
Hybrid cars are all the rage in Hollywood .
Celebrities drive them like they 're a badge of honor .
You save a few gallons of gas , you save the planet .
Right ?
Well , not when you hop on a private jet and burn enough fuel to propel NASCAR through 2050 .
Of course , the stars need to go here and there .
The location shoots , the fabulous vacations , etc .
But that 's why God created United Airlines .
G - IV's , on the other hand , were created in the image of precious celebs .
Julia Roberts
On the ground : Roberts drives a Prius , which gets ( at best ) 60 miles to the gallon , shaving 30 miles off a normal car 's mpg .
In the air : Chicago / LA , 1,749 miles in a private jet , the route she took with Rupert Everett while shooting " My Best Friend 's Wedding . "
Gas guzzled : 2,100 gallons of jet fuel .
Prius Penance : Julia would have to drive 30,000 miles , or roughly once around the earth and then some to even out her consumption in the air .
So Julia says :
No word yet from Julia 's rep .
Jennifer Lopez
On the ground : J - Lo tools around in her 60 miles - per - gallon Prius .
In the air : LA / New York , 2,475 miles in a private jet .
Lopez was actually sued by a private jet company for allegedly skipping out on the bill , though she says it 's all a misunderstanding and she was not supposed to be billed .
Gas guzzled : 2,750 gallons of jet fuel .
Prius penance :
She 'd have to drive 45,000 miles , and that 's a lot longer for Jenny than just going down the block .
It 's actually more like twice around the earth .
So Jennifer says :
There was no comment from Lopez 's rep .
George Clooney
On the ground : George favors a Tango , an electric car that gets a whopping 135 miles to the charge .
In the air : Los Angeles / Tokyo , 5500 miles in a private jet .
Gas guzzled : 7,000 gallons of jet fuel .
Electric shocker :
Even with his super - saver Tango , he 'll have to drive over 57 oceans -- Pacific Oceans to break even .
So George says : Clooney 's rep , publicist Stan Rosenfield , tells TMZ , " You clearly have no understanding of certain people 's need for private transport , " and points out that Clooney often has " no control " over his travel schedule .
Brad Pitt
On the ground : Eco-champ Brad is yet another Prius - lover , and he reportedly has several hybrids in his stable .
In the air : Los Angeles / Namibia , 9,400 miles in a private jet .
Gas guzzled : 11,000 gallons of jet fuel .
Prius penance : Brad burned enough fuel to take a Prius to the moon .

I caught a glimpse of this story while I was out of town recently .
The wife of the chief of police in this small town posted nude photos of herself on the Internet , on an adult web site , and those pictures apparently outraged “ dozens ” of the town ’s residents , who demanded that the police chief resign .
He initially refused and , while the DA said the photos shown to him were “ obscene based on local community standards , ” the city council had supported the chief ’s wife saying that the photos were protected by the first amendment .
As a result of the hoopla , her husband ( the police chief ) , the mayor , and a city council member all resigned their jobs .
The chief and the mayor resigned over the criticism of the chief and his wife .
The council member resigned because he did n’t want to be associated with those criticising the chief .
Let me be clear :
Three people lost their jobs — and no doubt their families are suffering economically and socially — because “ dozens ” of people were offended by some naked - woman pictures .
This is outrageous .
I ’m angered by this story .
First of all , if the photos were on an adult site , then whoever found them was also browsing adult sites .
Why should it be okay for the viewer to view but not for the poster to post ?
And so what that the poster ’s husband is the chief of police .
Is his ability to do his job curtailed in any way by his wife ’s use of an adult web site ?
Then , worse , as if it were n’t bad enough that this woman ’s nude photos were used against her husband at his job , the paper emphasizes the wife ’s weight and tattoos .
Why were those details included .
Would it have been different in the eyes of the towns people if she had been 5 ’ 7 ″ and 130 pounds , with no tattoos ?
The chief himself is quoted as saying , “ My wife is 6 - foot - 3 and weighs 300 pounds .
If there is somebody that thinks they can control her , have at it .
I have tried for 11 years and have n’t been able to . ”
Apparently the criticism of the townspeople accomplished what the chief claims he could n’t do .
The 43 - year - old woman — clearly an adult — took her photos down as a result of all the negativity .
“ Local community standards ” often reflect the standards of a vocal minority .
In this case , they reflected the standards of “ dozens ” of vocal residents in a town of 1,500 .
Did the others remain quiet because they agreed , and thus found no need to speak out ?
Or did they remain quiet because it is too difficult to support something that is being loudly condemned as “ obscene ” ?
The latter seems much more likely to me , given the numbers of people who quietly cruise the Internet for sexual connections or information or stimulation .
In the end one person ’s freedom was curtailed , unnecessarily and unjustly , by the outspoken voices of a few and the silence of many .
And many others received a clear warning that , should they consider posting photos of themselves , they will be considered outcasts in their community .
This might seem to be trivial to some who say , “ look it ’s only a bit of nudity and it is n’t that important , ” but this silence is the same silence that makes it so difficult to fight for the rights of sex workers , of gays and lesbians , of BDSM practitioners , and others who explicitly challenge the dominant sexual culture .
In fact , I ’d bet that the vitriol spouted in this case was all the more venomous because this was a woman — the wife of the chief of police — who was counted on to visibly support that restrictive dominant culture .
If such respectable folks continue to make public their departure from that dominant sexual culture , even in the face of such criticism , imagine how quickly it could be replaced by something much more interesting !
I wish the police chief had not resigned , and that his wife had not pulled her photos .
I wish they had posted more photos , perhaps together , and challenged the “ dozens ” and the DA .
But given the norms of silence and repression it ’s easy to understand their fear .
It ’s a difficult cycle to break .
And it must be broken if we are all to be able to conduct ourselves as adults , openly and unafraid .
We need cultural change and legal change , neither of which will be easy to achieve .
Sex bloggers and sex-radical writers who make what is assumed to be private public are certainly in the vanguard of this change .
The National Coalition for Sexual Freedom is fighting too .
But more of us need to challenge the silence by speaking up for ourselves an by speaking up for those , like Doris Ozmun and her husband , who are stigmatized and publicly condemned for using what should be every person ’s right to sexual expression .

Greg Linden reports that AOL has shut down their research department , following the big search privacy scandal that emanated from that department .
Now , one commenter says on of the people they fired after the scandal basically was the whole department , but if AOL was serious about trying some research efforts , it is still disheartening to see them give up on it .
AOL has so much customer data that could be a wealth of knowledge in the hands of the right researchers .
Maybe they could outsource all their customer data to Google , which owns 5 % of AOL anyway , as long as Google remains as tight - lipped as we all know them to be .
By the by , if you want to talk about some interesting data , Greg ’s been writing about a paper Google released about Bigtable , Google ’s massive and robust distributed database system .
In his latest post , he notes that the paper cites Google ’s web crawl as containing 850 terabytes of data , while Google Analytics has 250 terabytes .
Is it just me , or does that seem like a big waste given that ( a ) Google search earns billions of dollars and ( b ) Google Analytics loses money .
Hmm …
The Universe is thought to be 13.7 billion years old .
So it was quite a surprise when astronomers turned up a star that ’s 13.2 billion years old .
That means it formed only a few hundred million years after the Big Bang .
The star , HE 1523-0901 , was discovered by the European Southern Observatory ’s VLT .
Astronomers knew right away that that had an old star , but the technique for dating it accurately is pretty difficult .
The method is similar to radiocarbon dating , where archaeologists use the approximate quantities of carbon isotopes to measure the age of ancient artifacts .
In this situation , though , the astronomers used the VLT to measure the abundance of the various radioactive elements , like thorium and uranium .
Once the star originally formed , its radioactive elements began to decay , changing into other elements .
By knowing the rate of decay , and being able to measure these elements so accurately , they were able to peg the ages of the star at 13.2 billion years old .
The trick was to find elements that decay at a set rate , but would still be around after billions of years of decay .

The traditional method of distributing large files is to put them on a central server .
Each client then downloads the file directly from the server .
It 's a gratifyingly simple approach , but it does n't scale .
For every download , the server consumes bandwidth equal to the size of the file .
You probably do n't have enough bandwidth to serve a large file to a large audience , and even if you did , your bandwidth bill would go through the roof .
The larger the file , the larger the audience , the worse your bandwidth problem gets .
It 's a popularity tax .
With BitTorrent , you also start by placing your large file on a central server .
But once the downloading begins , something magical happens : as clients download the file , they share whatever parts of the file they have with each other .
Clients can opportunistically connect with any other client to obtain multiple parts of the file at once .
And it scales perfectly : as file size and audience size increases , the bandwidth of the BitTorrent distribution network also increases .
Your server does less and less work with each connected client .
It 's an elegant , egalitarian way of sharing large files with large audiences .
BitTorrent radically shifts the economics of distribution .
It 's one of the most miraculous ideas ever conceived on the internet .
As far as I 'm concerned , there should be a Nobel prize for computing , and the inventor of BitTorrent should be its first recipient .
There 's a great Processing visualization of BitTorrent in action which explains it far better than I can .
The original visualization is not only down semi-permanently , but also written for an ancient version of Processing .
I grabbed a cached copy of the code and updated it for the latest version of Processing .
This meager little animated GIF does n't do the highly dynamic , real - time nature of the visualization justice .
I highly recommend downloading Processing and downloading the updated bittorrent visualization code , so you can see the process from start to finish on your own machine .
It 's beautiful .
But as as wonderful and clever as BitTorrent is , it is n't perfect .
As an avid BitTorrent user , I 've noticed the following problems :
BitTorrent is a terrible Long Tail client .
The efficiency of BitTorrent is predicated on popularity .
The more people downloading , the larger the distribution network gets .
But if what you want is obscure or unpopular – part of the long tail – BitTorrent is painfully , brutally slow .
With only a handful of clients sharing the workload , you 're better off using traditional distribution methods .
BitTorrent , although distributed , is still centralized .
Download work is shared by the clients , but how do the clients locate each other ?
Traditionally this is done through a centralized server " tracker " , or list of peers .
This means BitTorrent is vulnerable to attacks on the centralized server .
Once the server is out of commission , the clients have no way of locating each other , and the whole distribution network grinds to a halt .
There are alternatives which allow clients to share the list of peers amongst themselves , such as distributed hash tables , but centralized tracking is more efficient .
Also , in order to even begin a BitTorrent download , you must first know where to obtain a . torrent file .
It 's a chicken - and - egg problem which also implies the existence of a centralized server out there somewhere .
BitTorrent is unsuitable for small files , even if they are extremely popular .
The BitTorrent distribution network is predicated on clients sharing pieces of the file during the download period .
But if the download period is small , the opportunity window for sharing is also small ; at any given time only a few users will be downloading .
This is another scenario where you 're unlikely to find any peers , so you 're better off with traditional distribution methods .
BitTorrent relies on client altruism .
There 's no rule that says clients must share bandwidth while they 're downloading .
Although most BitTorrent clients default to uploading the maximum amount a user 's upstream connection allows , it 's possible to dial the upload rate down to nothing if you 're greedy .
And some users may have their firewalls configured in such a way that they can't upload data , even if they wanted to .
There 's no way to punish bad peers for not sharing , or reward good peers for sharing more .
Furthermore , every torrent needs a " seed " – a peer with 100 % of the file downloaded – connected at all times .
If there is no seed , no matter how many peers you have , none of the peers will never be able to download the entire file .
It 's considered a courtesy to stay connected if you have 100 % of the file downloaded and no other seeds are available .
But again , this is a convention , not a requirement .
It 's entirely possible for a torrent to " die " when there are no seeds available .
The BitTorrent model is innovative , but it is n't suitable for every distribution task .
The centralized server model is superior in most cases .
But centralized distribution is a tool for the rich .
Only highly profitable organizations can afford massive amounts of bandwidth .
BitTorrent , in comparison , is highly democratic .
BitTorrent gives the people whatever they want , whenever they want it – by collectively leveraging the tiny trickle of upstream bandwidth doled out by most internet service providers .
But just because it 's democratic does n't mean BitTorrent has to be synonymous with intellectual piracy .
BitTorrent has legitimate uses , such as distributing World of Warcraft patches .
And Amazon 's S3 directly supports the torrent protocol .
BitTorrent , in short , puts distribution choices back in the hands of the people .
And that 's why everybody loves BitTorrent .
Everyone , that is , except the MPAA and RIAA .
Researchers have demonstrated for the first time that the progression of Type 1 diabetes can be halted -- and possibly reversed -- by a stem - cell transplant that preserves the body ’s diminishing ability to make insulin , according to a study published today .
The experimental therapy eliminated the need for insulin injections for months or even years in 14 of 15 patients recently diagnosed with the disease .
One subject , a 30 - year - old male , has n’t taken insulin since his stem - cell transplant more than three years ago , according to the study in the Journal of the American Medical Assn .
The study suggests a new avenue for treating the intractable disease , in which the immune system destroys insulin - producing beta cells in the pancreas .
Without insulin , patients can’t metabolize sugar and run the risk of developing nerve damage , cardiovascular disease , kidney failure and blindness .
Patients with Type 1 diabetes typically compensate by monitoring their blood - sugar levels every few hours and injecting themselves with insulin as many as five times a day .
Advertisement
After the stem - cell treatment , “ patients are absolutely medication - free -- they ’re off insulin , ” said Dr. Richard Burt , chief of the Division of Immunotherapy for Autoimmune Diseases at Northwestern University ’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago and senior author of the study .
The strategy is similar to an approach that has shown some success in treating other immune system disorders , such as rheumatoid arthritis , lupus and multiple sclerosis .
“ We all realize that without addressing the problem at the level of the immune system , we ’ll never really beat Type 1 diabetes , ” said Dr. Francisco Prieto , who treats diabetics in his Elk Grove , Calif. , practice and was n’t involved in the study .
“ This is very encouraging work . ”
Burt and his colleagues cautioned that they did n’t know whether the fix was permanent and , if it was not , how long it would last .
One of the subjects was insulin - free for one year but relapsed after a respiratory viral infection , said lead author Dr. Julio Voltarelli , associate professor of medicine at Ribeirao Preto medical school at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil .

The researchers also cautioned that the process was not without risk , because patients are vulnerable to infection during part of the therapy .
Burt ’s research group at Northwestern has performed 170 stem - cell transplants to treat a variety of immune system disorders , and two patients have died from the treatment .
But other doctors said that even if the benefits of the therapy were temporary , the research provided valuable insight into the mechanism behind the disease .
“ It ’s a big deal , ” said Dr. Stephen Forman , chairman of the Division of Hematology & Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte , who was n’t part of the study .
“ The fact that you got somebody insulin - independent , there ’s a clue there ” for scientists in search of a cure .
The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation in New York estimates that as many as 3 million Americans have Type 1 diabetes , and that 30,000 to 35,000 new cases are diagnosed each year .
Advertisement
Most of those patients will die from complications of the disease rather than from diabetes itself .
The age of onset is considerably younger than for patients with Type 2 diabetes , who can still make insulin but ca n’t use it efficiently .
The stem - cell approach mirrors the bone marrow transplants used to treat patients with certain cancers and blood diseases .
Bone marrow contains hematopoietic stem cells , which are able to build all of the elements of the immune system .
The idea is to wipe out the faulty immune system and replace it with a new one that functions properly .
In the study , 15 Brazilian patients were treated within a few months of their diagnoses , before their immune systems had the chance to eradicate all of their insulin - producing cells .
The researchers hoped to preserve enough beta cells to make insulin injections unnecessary .
Advertisement
The study was conducted in Brazil because of Voltarelli ’s interest in the experiment .
It was funded by the Brazilian Ministry of Health and other sources .
The patients , ages 14 to 31 , were treated with drugs and hormones that prompted the body to produce hematopoietic stem cells and send them from the bone marrow into the bloodstream , from which a machine then extracted them .
About two weeks later , the patients checked into the hospital and received chemotherapy and other drugs to kill off their immune systems over a period of five days .
Side effects for most patients included nausea , vomiting and hair loss .
After a day of rest , they were infused with their own hematopoietic stem cells , which took about eight to 12 days to establish new immune systems .
While the patients were without functioning immune systems , they were given antibiotics to protect them from possible infections .
Advertisement
The treatment had no effect on the first patient , whose disease had progressed so that his blood was dangerously acidic .
He also took steroids to help him tolerate some of the drugs .
After the patient ’s poor results , the researchers modified the study ’s protocol to exclude patients with his condition , called diabetic ketoacidosis , and to remove the steroids from the drug regimen .
Of the remaining 14 patients , 12 were able to stop taking insulin shortly after their transplants .
Five patients have not needed insulin injections for at least 23 months , and two have been insulin - free for more than a year and a half .
One patient relapsed seven days after her transplant but gradually reduced her insulin dosage and was able to stop her injections after one year .
Another patient became insulin - free 20 months after her transplant .
Advertisement
Voltarelli said he was n’t sure why two patients had a delayed response to the transplants .
“ Maybe their immune systems took more time to recover and stop destroying the pancreatic ” beta cells , he said .
Dr. Defu Zeng , a diabetes researcher at City of Hope , has used a similar technique to wean diabetic mice off insulin .
All of the mice eventually relapsed , which leads him to suspect that the Brazilian diabetics will too .
“ We need to wait at least five or six years , ” Zeng said .
“ It ’s too early to make any conclusions . ”

Even if patients continue to require insulin shots , the treatment should be considered a success if it halts the destruction of beta cells , said Dr. Jay S. Skyler , associate director of the Diabetes Research Institute at the University of Miami ’s Miller School of Medicine , who wrote an editorial accompanying the study .
Retaining at least some insulin - producing cells makes the disease easier to control and less likely to result in severe complications , like blindness .
Patients who were diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes long ago would not benefit from a stem - cell transplant because their immune systems have left nothing to preserve , he said .
Some of those patients are now treated with transplants of beta cells harvested from cadavers .
Scientists also are trying to use embryonic stem cells to grow beta cells for transplant .
Advertisement
In the long term , the treatment could potentially be combined with beta cell transplants to help patients who do n’t have any of their own beta cells left .
If the research ultimately leads to a therapy , Prieto predicted that patients would embrace it despite the risks inherent in destroying one ’s immune system .
“ If you ask any patient with Type 1 diabetes , would they go through tremendous hardship and trials in order to be free of insulin shots , most of them would tell you yes , ” said Prieto , who serves on the Independent Citizens ’ Oversight Committee of the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine .
“ The risk that you could go into ketoacidosis and not survive -- that ’s real .
It happens every day . ”

Patients develop
Type 1 diabetes when their immune systems attack cells in the pancreas that produce insulin .
An experimental technique involving stem - cell transplants allowed 14 out of 15 patients with Type 1 diabetes to stop their insulin injections .
Here ’s how it works :
* Hematopoietic stem cells , which can create a new immune system , are harvested from the patient ’s blood .
* Chemotherapy and other drugs are used to destroy the patient ’s faulty immune system .

Just a fun little bit of writing , for a contest …
LISP has jokingly been described as “ the most intelligent way to misuse a computer ” .
I think that description a great compliment because it transmits the full flavour of liberation : it has assisted a number of our most gifted fellow humans in thinking previously impossible thoughts .
The analysis of the influence that programming languages have on thinking habits of its users , and the recognition that , by now , brainpower is by far our scarcest resource , they together give us a new collection of yardsticks for comparing the relative merits of various programming languages .
The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own skull …

“ Brainpower is by far our scarcest resource , ” indeed .
Why then , would I want mine blown ?
I ’d rather gently stretch it .

In yoga , you honor your body ’s suggested threshold of pain .
If you ca n’t do the full posture , do n’t hurt yourself , but try this modification , so you still benefit .
When you ’re ready , you can try the full posture .
Ruby is like yoga for your mind .
Ruby encourages you to stretch to your limits , and come back when you ’re ready for more .
You can write getters and setters , and old - school for loops , and Ruby wo n’t complain … but it ’ll gently encourage you to try attr_reader and attr_writer , and block iteration .
You can write your own database access code , until you ’re ready to try active record .
You can write straight OO , and never leave the Kingdom of Nouns , until you ’re ready to try something more functional .

Ruby has n’t blown my mind , and I trust it never will .
A few nasties have blown my mind , and it ’s never fun .
It takes time to recover from abuse like that .
I ’d rather follow the yogis out there , and enjoy the benefits of life - long mental flexibility .

The Singularity Is Near By Ray KurzweilViking , 652 pages , $ 29.95
The bearded fellow with a sign reading " The End Is Nigh " is a staple of editorial cartoons .
The title - phrase of " The Singularity Is Near " is obviously meant to evoke that image , and for any reader who is slow to catch on Ray Kurzweil makes the allusion clear in Chapter 7 ( " Ich bin ein Singularitarian " ) with an amusing photo of himself holding up a sign announcing the imminence of the Singularity .
But Mr. Kurzweil 's book is about beginnings , not endings .
The ...
If the Reverend Nevil Maskelyne came back to life , the 18th - century Astronomer Royal of Great Britain would probably have no trouble grasping the idea behind NASA ’s remote sensing GRACE mission .
Maskelyne proposed a remarkably similar experiment himself in a presentation to the Royal Society in 1772 .
“ If the attraction of gravity be exerted , as Sir Isaac Newton supposes , not only between the large bodies of the universe , but between the minutest particles of which these bodies are composed . . . it will necessarily follow , that every hill must , by its attraction , alter the direction of gravitation in heavy bodies in its neighborhood .... ”
That ’s exactly what GRACE , the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment , detects .
Every 94 minutes or so , twin satellites whip once around Earth at an altitude of 310 miles , taking 30 days to cover the planet ’s entire surface , then they do it again and again , sensing variations in local gravity .
GRACE maps local variations in the force of gravity over Earth ’s surface , revealing mountain ranges and ocean trenches as well as underground watersheds and other hidden concentrations of mass .
A joint venture by NASA and the DLR ( Deutsches Zentrum für Luft - und Raumfahrt , or German Aerospace Center ) , GRACE looks right past the familiar oceans , continents , and clouds , showing our planet in a fresh light — as a knobby , blobby globe of gravitational ups and downs .
Among other things , GRACE may have found a crater deep under the Antarctic ice that may mark an asteroid impact greater than the one that doomed the dinosaurs , measured the seafloor displacement that triggered the tsunami of 2004 , and quantified changes in subsurface water in the Amazon and Congo river basins .
“ This is really an entirely new kind of remote sensing , ” says project scientist Michael Watkins , of NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
“ It ’s like when radar or photography was first invented — you start realizing that it can be applied in all sorts of unanticipated ways .
We ’re still discovering them . ”
The notion that Earth ’s gravity field could be measured with satellites dates back to the dawn of the space age .
In 1958 ground controllers tracking the first American satellite , Explorer 1 , noted that its path faithfully traced the planet ’s equatorial bulge ( created by centrifugal forces generated by the planet ’s rotation ) .
By the 1960s rocket scientists realized that smaller , local variations in gravity could have further , unforeseen effects .
Missiles carrying nuclear warheads , for example , could be thrown off course if no allowance was made for mountain ranges or valleys .
If Earth were a perfect sphere , perfectly uniform in density and covered to a uniform depth with ocean , the geoid — a word coined by geologists to refer to an imaginary plane located at the average level of the sea ’s surface — would be a perfect sphere as well .
Since the geoid would be evenly perpendicular to the pull of gravity in all places , that force would always pull you directly toward the precise center of the Earth .
But Earth is nowhere near perfect or uniform , which means that gravity does n’t always point straight down ; a mountain range , for example , might divert it slightly to the left .
Understanding the subtleties of Earth ’s gravitational field would be useful in many ways .
Scientists could learn a lot about the structure of the planet , what it ’s made of , and where the crust is thick or thin .
A deposit of high - density underground rock , or an undersea mountain , is utterly invisible — yet they , too , skew the geoid away from perfect flatness .
Even when the ocean is utterly calm , it is n’t flat .
Measurements reveal that some parts of the ocean are a remarkable 390 feet lower than average , and others are 300 feet higher .
While scientists began to appreciate just how useful a map of the geoid could be , engineers were realizing that the most sensible way to measure the variations would be with a pair of satellites , instead of just one .
A single orbiter would bob and weave with the gravity field just fine — but monitors would have to measure the ups and downs from the ground continuously by beaming radio waves back and forth .
That would require an enormous network of ground stations .
Yet two satellites flying far enough apart would experience different gravitational effects , so that only the distance between them must be measured .
As the lead satellite approaches a place with more mass than average , it speeds up just a bit from the extra gravitational pull .
Shortly thereafter , so does the second .
Then , as the higher - mass region falls behind , each satellite is held back a little — again , first the leading , then the trailing satellite .
By sending microwaves between the two , it would be possible to calculate that staggered acceleration , and thus infer the change in gravitational pull on Earth ’s surface .
+++
Unfortunately , the variation in distance between the two satellites is so small that in the early 1960s it would have been virtually impossible to detect using any technology then available .
In 1976 NASA launched a satellite called LAGEOS ( Laser Geodynamics Satellite ) , which began to address the problem , albeit crudely .
It carried no instruments at all .
In essence , LAGEOS was a two - foot - diameter shiny brass golf ball ; by bouncing laser beams off the satellite from different places on the surface of Earth , geologists could measure the precise distances between widely separated places on the planet .
They could , for example , see the gradual separation of continents , due to plate tectonics , year by year .
In the early 1990s the TOPEX ( Topography Experiment for Ocean Circulation ) / Poseidon satellite , a joint American - French mission , shot into orbit armed with radar altimeters to measure the height of the sea surface .
“ What they ’ve basically done , ” Watkins says , “ is to look at changes in the sea surface over time , on the assumption the geoid itself does n’t change . ”
Except that sometimes it does .
Along with its measurements of continental drift , LAGEOS also detected a very gradual change in the gravity field over Canada and northern Europe as the crust continues to rebound — 10,000 years later — from the weight of the massive glaciers that pinned it down during the last ice age .
It also revealed annual variations in local gravity due to the natural storage and depletion of water during rainy and dry seasons in different parts of the world .
Laser beams fired at LAGEOS were not sensitive enough to pinpoint variations in orbit smaller than a centimeter or so and were too imprecise to pick out the subtler differences in gravity .
For that , a double - satellite mission was needed .
Finally , in the mid-1990s , the technology to pull it off became available in two forms .
The first was microwave transmitters and receivers small , efficient , and reliable enough to be to mounted on small spacecraft and used to gauge the distance between the satellites .
The second : the Global Positioning System ( GPS ) .
“ If I ’m sending a signal from me to you , ” says Watkins , “ and I want to know the time of flight , it ’s crucial that our clocks be perfectly synchronized . ”
By checking in constantly with whatever GPS satellite is in view at a given time , a pair of gravity satellites can use its single clock rather than trying to synchronize their own .
With the technology finally in place , Watkins , together with ­aerospace engineer Byron Tapley of the University of Texas at Austin and several other scientists and engineers , proposed the GRACE mission .
In partnership with the German space agency , NASA sent the dual GRACE satellites into orbit in March 2002 .
Since then , they have been zipping around Earth in a polar orbit , one satellite about 137 miles ahead of the other .
To an observer in space , they would appear to be tracing out the same circle over and over , but since the planet is continuously rotating beneath them , the intrepid satellites orbit over every slice of the surface once every 30 days .
Their instruments measure not the distance between the two satellites but rather the change in distance , and thus the acceleration due to gravity .
They do it through interferometry — watching how beams of microwaves interfere with each other .
One satellite shoots out a continuous stream of microwaves , which is received by the second satellite and both are sent to the ground .
The outgoing and incoming beams are superimposed , creating an interference pattern that varies depending on how close the waves are to being perfectly in phase — that is , how close the waves ’ peaks and valleys are lined up .
A tiny difference in satellite - to - satellite distance — and thus an increase or decrease in gravitational pull from Earth ’s surface — makes a marked difference in the interference pattern .
If the satellites are moving together or apart at as little as 150 nanometers per second , the GRACE scientists can see it .
That is not quite the end of the story .
Even though 310 miles up is technically outer space , a few air molecules still float around — not enough to make the slightest difference to astronauts on a space shuttle or the space station , which orbit considerably lower , but sufficient to slow the GRACE satellites perceptibly .
A clump of air molecules could fool an observer into thinking that something lies below — perhaps a glacier — so each satellite has what ’s known as a “ proof mass ” floating in a chamber inside , untethered to the satellite itself .
The proof mass is itself in orbit , so when one of the satellites speeds up or slows down due to gravity variations , the mass does too .
But when a satellite slows due to air drag , the proof mass inside , blissfully unaware , keeps moving at its original speed .
It does n’t hit the interior wall of the satellite because onboard electric plates keep it from doing so — but sensitive electronics keep track of the discrepancy so the engineers can subtract it from the real signal .

GRACE ’s data are open to any scientist on the planet .
“ That , ” says Byron Tapley , “ led to a whole range of people outside the standard community who used GRACE results to do things that were n’t possible before . ”
In January 2005 , for example , Ohio State University geophysicist Ralph von Frese and his colleagues noticed a concentration of higher - than - average - density material in the rock about a mile under the surface of the East Antarctic ice sheet .
Mass concentrations like this often accumulate when giant impacts from space pound the crust .
When the crust rebounds , it carries higher - density mantle materials up toward the surface and holds them there .
Comparing the GRACE data with radar imagery of the icebound bedrock , von Frese found it was centered perfectly inside a ring some 300 miles wide — just what you ’d expect from an impactor 30 or so miles across .
“ It just jumped out at us , ” he says .
An asteroid that big would be about four to five times the diameter of the object that killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago .
This crater is much older , arguably dating back to a time , some 250 million years ago , when something — perhaps a projectile from outer space — wiped out the majority of the species on Earth , including most reptiles , sponges , corals , starfish , clams , sea scorpions , and fish , thereby clearing the evolutionary decks for dinosaurs to become dominant .
That was the greatest mass extinction in history , and thanks to GRACE , paleontologists and evolutionary biologists now have an idea of how it may have happened .
But GRACE ’s greatest contribution comes from the fact that it remeasures the geoid every month or so .
That enabled geologists to make before - and - after assessments of how the seafloor rearranged itself in the Sumatra - Andaman earthquake of December 26 , 2004 , which triggered the awful Indian Ocean tsunami .
“ When a major quake happens on land , ” Watkins says , “ you can go out and look at the changes .
With GRACE , we can now look thousands of feet underwater as well . ”
The satellites can also reveal movement of water itself , in ways never possible before .
“ It ’s very cool , because water can go underground , it can move around the ocean , it can change from ice to liquid and runoff , but it ca n’t hide its mass from us , ” says Watkins .
Imagine , he says , a gigantic hockey puck made of water .
“ It could be in the form of an ice sheet , or an aquifer , or a piece of ocean .
GRACE has the sensitivity to pick up a puck about a centimeter thick and 400 kilometers [ half an inch and 250 miles ] across . ”
All the water on Earth can be divided into hockey pucks , he says , and GRACE takes note of how they move around every 30 days .
Last March , geophysicists Isabella Velicogna and John Wahr at the University of Colorado at Boulder published a paper in Science Express that used GRACE data to show that the ice sheet covering Antarctica has shrunk by an average of 36 cubic miles of ice per year — surprising , given that many climate models predict a thickening of the ice as higher global temperatures lead to more evaporation and precipitation .
“ It ’s very difficult for models to reproduce the physics of glaciers , and this shows that the models are n’t as good as we ’d like them to be , ” Velicogna says .
Velicogna and her colleagues also measured a dramatic loss of Greenland ice , as much as 38 cubic miles per year between 2002 and 2005 — even more troubling , given that an influx of fresh melt water into the salty North Atlantic could in theory shut off the system of ocean currents that keep Europe relatively warm .
( A separate group at the University of Texas published figures extrapolated from GRACE data showing that Greenland lost as much as 57 cubic miles of ice each year between 2002 and 2005 ; NASA shortly plans to publish data reconciling the two studies . )
“ It ’s a wake - up call , ” says Velicogna , “ because there is a lot of water that can go from the ice sheets into the ocean .
Both ice sheets are significantly losing mass , and that affects sea level .
If sea level is going to rise , that will affect a lot of coastal areas . ”
This past December an entire session of the American Geophysical Union ’s fall meeting was devoted to movement of water in and out of giant watersheds all over the world .
Speakers presented eight papers , on topics ranging from the hydrologic impact of the Three Gorges Dam in China to the impact of climate change on Siberian river systems .
All the new findings were based entirely on data from GRACE .
Notable results included a report from researchers at MIT that Alaska lost an average of 10 and a half cubic miles of ice each year from 2003 to 2005 .
Oceanographers , geologists , and climatologists are scrambling to update their models of the planet based on the flood of GRACE data .
But these will start to look positively primitive when a new , upgraded version of GRACE comes along in several years .
Armed with laser interferometers more sensitive than the microwave type , GRACE scientists will be able to attain much better resolution , and thus to find even subtler gravity variations and more exquisite detail , or “ smaller hockey pucks , ” in Watkins ’s words .
Nevil Maskelyne never managed to make his own experiment work , but with GRACE his idea has been vindicated beyond even his wildest imaginings .
We ’ve been talking a lot about the Wikipedia recently here at calacanis.com , and I wanted to make my podcast from last week a little more clear .
I spoke of technological obsurification –the process of using obscure technology to keep people from participating .
Having spent seven days at the Wikimania and hacking days last year in Boston I ’ve learned a lot about the insular culture of Wikipedia , how they make decisions , and how they block participation .
Yes , you read that last part correctly .
The Wikipedia is currently designed to lower participation so it is easier to manage .
Now , I ’m not saying it ’s wrong to limit participation in Wikipedia–perhaps that ’s what necessary to keep the project on track .
However , I think we should be really honest about the fact that Wikipedia is not an open system–at least not open in the sense that anyone can participate .
Let ’s look at just three examples :
1. Wikipedia pages have become increasingly complex and Wikipedia does n’t support a WYSIWYG editor .
WYSIWYG stands for “ what you see is what you get , ” and that means that as you edit if you make something bold or underline you see bold or underline–just like Microsoft Word .
Wikipedia does n’t use a WYSIWYG because if they did more people could edit the pages–people without technology skills–and that would make the entire system collapse–at least according to the folks at the Wikipedia conference I attended .
For example , in this image you can see what it ’s like to edit the George W. Bush page :
As you can see you need code in Wiki Markup language in order to edit this page .
2. The Wikipedia uses “ Discussion pages ” to reach consensus , and these pages are also coded in mediaWiki so that 99 % of people can’t figure them out .
Here is what the discussion page for George W. Bush looks like , and as you can see it is much more complicated than a Threaded Message board .
The Wikipedia could easily have message boards by now–just like they could easily have a WYSIWYG editor–but by adding it there would be too much participation and the system would collapse .
3 . The Wikipeda uses IRC chat , which 99 % of folks do n’t know how to use , in order to discuss the inner workings of Wikipedia .
IRC chat typically requires client software and to use it you have to learn how to use all kinds of archaic commands .
The Wikipedia could easily use web - based chat , but it does n’t because–again–it would create too much participation and Wikipedia would collapse .
Here is a look at the IRC director page –your mom ain’t gonna figure this one out .
Those are just three simple examples of how the Wikipedia community block participation through its use of obscure technology .
Is this wrong ?
Perhaps not , but we should all be clear that Wikipedia is edited by and run by folks with significant technical knowledge .
Was this intentional ?
I do n’t think so , I think the Wikipedia has grown so quickly and has had a lack of resources for so long ( do n’t get me started on the advertising debate that would solve this ) that they have not been able to keep up with the growth .
I ’m convinced that the Wikipedia is so understaffed that if they did provide simple message boards , a WYSI editor , and web - based chat rooms , that they would be so inundated with participation that no one would be able to keep up .
This is why it is so critical that the Wikipedia take the steps that Firefox / Mozzila has to make the organization stable .
There should–and could be–30 to 50 full - time developers at Wikipedia getting paid to clean up the software and fix the systems , but because some folks do n’t want even OPT - IN advertising there are n’t .
As the Wikipedia becomes more and more important , it is also becoming more and more insular .
Participation is getting harder and harder for normal folks , and the system is very close to the breaking point in my estimation .
Now is the time to act to increase participation and access to the system in my mind .

01 . Female fashion models and adolescent boys
The similitude between the facial features of a number of high - fashion models and those of adolescent boys is so clear that only the blind will fail to observe it .
Ich bin noch nicht im Büro .
Deshalb kann ich nicht zählen .
Aber es dürfte eine lebhafte Woche gewesen sein .
Gemessen an der Zahl von Abmahnungen , die sich Blogger , Podcaster und Forenbetreiber eingefangen haben .
Sie brauchen nur kritisch über die Geschäfte eines Unternehmens zu berichten .
Oder darüber , dass ein Unternehmen schon andere abgemahnt hat .
Die Bekanntschaft mit Rechtsanwälten ist dann programmiert .
Deren zweitklassiges juristisches Geschwurbel auch : Rufschädigung , Kreditgefährdung und , kann es noch jemand hören , Verletzung des Persönlichkeitsrechts .
Ich kriege mittlerweile Mails mit Beitragsentwürfen .
„ Kann ich das so schreiben , ohne eine Abmahnung zu riskieren ? “
Inhalt : die Geschichte einer verkorksten Paketzustellung oder Autoreparatur , Ärger mit einem DVD - Versender und kritische Worte über den eigenen Vater .
Auf die Frage kann ich nur nein antworten .
Es gibt keine Möglichkeit , Post vom Anwalt zu verhindern .
Wer partout das Risiko einer rechtlichen Auseinandersetzung scheut , muss die Klappe halten .
Die halbgaren , lieblosen juristischen Argumente in den jüngsten Abmahnschreiben belegen , dass es den Iniatoren um mehr geht als den Einzelfall .
Sie wollen – für ihre jeweiligen Auftraggeber – Angst verbreiten , die Schere im Kopf der Blogger installieren .
Wenn du was über die schreibst oder zulässt , dass über die geschrieben wird , brauchst du einen Anwalt .
Also lass es besser .
Lass es besser ?
Dazu sollte man wissen , dass Anwälte gerne drohen .
Aber sich schwer tun , ihre Drohungen in die Tat umzusetzen .
Bloß weil im Schreiben steht , Sie verletzen das Persönlichkeitsrecht unseres Mandanten , steht dies noch nicht fest .
Gut möglich , dass der Anwalt seinem Mandanten gesagt hat :
Mit einer einstweiligen Verfügung kommen wir wahrscheinlich nicht durch .
Letztlich würden wir auf den Kosten sitzen bleiben .
Aber versuchen wir es erst mal mit einem bösen Brief .
Ein aktuelles Beispiel , über das berichtet wird , zeigt eine durchaus typische Reaktion aggressiver Abmahner .
Wehrt sich der Gegner mit guten juristischen Argumenten , besinnt sich der Abmahner auf Kulanz und verzichtet großmütig auf seine Ansprüche .
Auf seinen Kosten bleibt der Abgemahnte allerdings sitzen .
Es sei denn , er klagt sie ein .
Oder er sammelt Spenden .
Aber das klappt natürlich auch nicht öfter als ein Plattenvertrag nach einem häufig verlinkten Video .
Was bleibt allen , die nicht schweigen wollen ?
Sie sollten daran denken , dass in unserem Land Meinungsfreiheit herrscht .
Wer also seine persönliche Überzeugung äußert , ist eher auf der sicheren Seite .
Also zum Beispiel : Ich finde XY zu teuer , das Essen dort schmeckt mir nicht .
Den Ton des Mitarbeiters habe ich als aufdringlich empfunden .
Die Grenze bildet die bloße Schmähkritik , das heißt der Versuch , jemanden grundlos in den Schmutz zu ziehen .
Heikler sind Tatsachenbehauptungen : Das Paket lag fünf
Tage unbearbeitet bei denen im Lager .
Mein Onkel hat mich am Ostersamstag 1998 grün und blau geschlagen .
Die haben meine Kündigung unterschlagen .
Tatsachenbehauptungen müssen wahr sein .
Die Beweislast hierfür trägt , wer die Behauptung aufstellt .
Gegen wahre Tatsachenbehauptungen gibt es aber keinen Unterlassungsanspruch .
Wer schildert , dass er eine Kündigung abgeschickt hat , die Firma aber behauptet , sie habe sie nicht erhalten , verletzt keine Rechte des Unternehmens .
Kritisch wird es erst , wenn im Beitrag steht , die Firma habe die Kündigung verschwinden lassen .
Also : Im Zweifel lieber eine Meinung äußern .
Bei den belegbaren Tatsachen bleiben .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) has begun fighting back this week against one DMCA takedown abuser .
The organization has filed a lawsuit against " paranormalist " Uri Geller for sending a takedown notice to YouTube over a video that heavily criticizes his psychic and magical abilities .
The suit alleges that Geller and his company Explorologist Ltd. " knowingly and materially " misrepresented their claim under the DMCA when demanding that the video be taken down , and therefore violated the DMCA itself .
The video was originally created as part of the PBS series NOVA that ran in 1993 , with an episode called " Secrets of the Psychics . "
In that episode , magician James Randi demonstrated a number of techniques that Geller likely used in his performances .
The video also contained clips from various other shows — notably Geller 's appearance on the Johnny Carson show where he was embarrassingly unable to demonstrate his abilities due to not being allowed to use his own props .
On the whole , the video was highly critical of Geller 's supernatural abilities .
That 's when Brian Sapient came in , a member of a group called the " Rational Response Squad . "
The group 's focus is debunking the claims of those who claim to be psychics or possess special powers , such as Geller .
In November of 2006 , Sapient posted a portion of the NOVA broadcast to YouTube as part of his group 's mission to educate the public .
In March , Geller and Explorologist sent a takedown notice to YouTube , signing a document saying that under the penalty of perjury , " I am the owner , or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed ; I have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner , its agent , or the law ; and this notification is accurate . "
As a result , YouTube not only removed Sapient 's video , they also suspended his account and all videos associated with it .
Sapient promptly filed a counter - notice to YouTube , but by the time his account came back online , it had been suspended for two weeks .
The problem was that Geller is not the copyright owner to the video and was not otherwise authorized to act on behalf of the owner ( PBS ) .
According to the EFF 's complaint , Geller and Explorologist can only claim copyright to three seconds of the entire 13 - minute video posted to YouTube — those three seconds of which the EFF describes as " a classic fair use of the material for criticism purposes . "
Sapient , with the help of the EFF , seized this opportunity to turn Geller 's obvious abuse of the DMCA into an example for other abusers .
" We filed the lawsuit to protect our client 's free speech rights and to fight back again illegal use of the DMCA takedown process , " EFF staff attorney Jason Schultz told Ars Technica .
" We believe the sole reason Geller sent the takedown was to silence our client 's free speech critiquing him . "
" Back in 1993 , there was no DMCA .
Therefore , in order to censor the NOVA video , Geller would have had to go to court and affirmatively prove to a judge that the video was infringing his copyright — something impossible to do , " Seltzer said .
This is not the first time a party has tried to use the DMCA to remove content from YouTube and have it backfire .
Earlier this year , law professor and EFF staff attorney Wendy Seltzer engaged in a battle with the NFL over a clip of their copyright notice that she had posted online as an example for her students .
The NFL filed a takedown notice , and she filed a counter - notice arguing that the clip constituted fair use .
According to the DMCA , the NFL is required to respond to a counter - notice by taking the issue to court , but instead the league simply filed another takedown notice .
Seltzer filed yet another counter - notice in April and continues to hold her ground against the NFL .
Should the court find Geller in violation of the DMCA , he may be forced to pay attorneys ' fees , plaintiff 's costs , and other damages .
The EFF also hopes for an injunction against Geller and Explorologist , restraining them from bringing a lawsuit back against Sapient or the EFF .
Schultz added , " If we win , we hope the judge will issue a strong decision that prevents not only people like Geller from abusing the law , but sets a precedent to hold future abusers accountable as well and deter similar illegal conduct . "

The museum is planning an exhibition on sparrows
The bird almost spoiled a televised world record attempt before it was killed with an air rifle .
The shooting caused a public outcry .
Animal rights groups condemned the bird 's killing last month and a website was erected in its honour .
On Friday , the bird 's killer was fined for shooting a protected species .
Prosecutors said the exterminator who killed it should have known better and fined him 170 euros ( £ 114 ; $ 200 ) .
Freezer
The organisers argued the killing was justified , as more than 100 people had worked for a month setting up the dominoes , but they held a TV memorial for the bird .
They went on to topple about four million dominoes , claiming a new record - which still has to be verified by Guinness World Records .
The bird was kept in a government freezer after its killing became a criminal matter .
It will be placed on top of a box of dominoes in an exhibition on sparrows next year .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Business 2.0 Magazine ) - It 's Google 's world .
We just live in it .
Online virtual worlds are a hot topic , as gamers spend more and more time playing online and virtual real estate turns into a real market .
Now Google is getting into the business -- and if its plans come to fruition , the virtual world will never be the same .
In fact , it may look more like the world we know than futurists ever imagined .
Google already has Google Earth , a 3 - D mockup of the planet generated from satellite photos .
But Google wants you to do more than just zoom through its virtual Earth .
The company wants you to add on to it , too .
At the end of April the company released , for free , a popular 3 - D modeling program it bought called SketchUp .
Google is encouraging developers to use SketchUp to build 3 - D layers on top of Google Earth .
There 's even a website Google provides called 3 - D Warehouse , where you can demonstrate what you 've built in Sketch Up .
Enter the metaverse
The notion that you can create objects and buildings and place them in a virtual world makes Google Earth sounds less like a mapping tool and more like a metaverse .
What 's a metaverse ?
Science fiction writer Neal Stephenson introduced the term in his seminal 1992 novel , Snow Crash .
The metaverse was Stephenson 's name for a virtual world where his characters play and do business .
It was a black ball 1.6 times the size of Earth , with a giant street running around its equator .
In Stephenson 's novel , millions of users uploaded customized " avatars , " or virtual personalities , and strolled the street , entering shops and exclusive nightclubs , conversing and trading with the metaverse's other denizens .
It was , in effect , a 3 - D version of the web .
Online worlds like Second Life and There.com - not to mention online games like World of Warcraft , Lineage , and EverQuest -- are direct descendants of the metaverse vision .
Entrepreneurs like Second Life 's Anshe Chung have demonstrated how to run very profitable businesses trading online real estate , avatars , and other virtual goods -- businesses that have no physical presence in the real world .
( See correction . )
But as popular as they are , virtual worlds like these are hardly mainstream .
They 're a little hard to navigate , and a little too videogame - like for the average user .
It 's hard to imagine your mom running around in Second Life , let alone World of Warcraft .
Googling the planet
It is , however , pretty easy to imagine your mom downloading and using Google Earth ( indeed , perhaps she already is ) .
You can already download user - generated layers that sit on top of Google 's 3 - D Earth and show you , for example , the location of celebrity houses or hiking trails or famous landmarks .
One dating service has even started showing people looking for partners as a Google Earth layer .
Real estate companies have started showing off virtual versions of their buildings ( for sale in the real world ) on Google Earth .
SketchUp allows them to build entire models of their apartments , right down to the microwave oven .
Where will it end ?
Google Earth general manager John Hanke has said that Google Earth was partly inspired by Snow Crash 's metaverse .
At a recent Silicon Valley conference , he described it as a " 3 - D virtual world . "
A virtual Earth
The result could be that we 'll soon populate a virtual version of planet Earth instead of the made - from - scratch metaverses like online games or Second Life .
The main element Google Earth is missing today is avatars , but at least one observer believes those to be added soon .
" I would expect to see someone using Google Earth as a virtual social space by the end of the year , " says Jerry Paffendorf , research director of the Acceleration Studies Foundation , a futurist organization .
Paffendorf is n't just sitting around waiting for the metaverse to happen , either .
Last weekend he helped arrange something called the Metaverse Roadmap Summit , a gathering of programmers of virtual worlds .
The idea of the summit was to outline how we 're going to get from here to the metaverse in ten years .
There were major disagreements between the attendees , most notably between those who believe the Web should stay as a 2 - D environment with 3 - D components , and those who want the Web to become a 3 - D metaverse - like environment where your avatar can call up 2 - D screens if and when they need to - say , for a word - processing program .
Those in the latter camp believe , like Paffendorf , that Google Earth is the most likely candidate to become a metaverse .
Just add avatars , they say , and the possibilities are endless .
Consumers could fly into the virtual New York , go shopping in a virtual Times Square , get past the velvet rope at a virtual Studio 54 and chat with an avatar dressed as Andy Warhol .
They could plan their next trip to the real New York in meticulous detail , become a detective in a Gotham noir , browse an apartment for sale , or jump into a taxi and play a driving game .
There are , in short , many more opportunities in a virtual version of the real world than in an entirely fantastical world like Second Life -- or indeed Stephenson 's original vision of the metaverse .
It 's early days yet , but if Google Earth continues to develop as it has since its release a mere year ago , and if developers continue to build 3 - D content and businesses continue to explore using layers , then the possibilities are as boundless as the planet .
By 2016 , Google Earth should be a very crowded place indeed .

Stella McCartney has turned her design talents to redesigning a bank account card for private bank Coutts & Co .
The design according to Vogue.co.uk , “ combines the intricacies found on banknotes and on the Coutts cheque book with aspects of the British countryside ” .
A translucent Coutts signature can also been seen when the card is held up to the light – in a reference to the watermark on a banknote .
McCartney said : “ It was refreshing to be asked by Coutts to design something I have never done before .
“ It is a design area that has been overlooked in the past and it ’s about time you get to spend your hard earned money with an account card that looks good . ”
The current account card will be offered to new and existing customers of Coutts , which is the international private banking arm of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group .
The sack of potatoes contained a nasty surprise
Olga Mauriello , from a small town near Naples , had put the potatoes into water to peel them when she discovered the mud-covered , pine cone - shaped grenade .
She alerted the neighbours , who in turn called the police .
Officers detonated the grenade on Wednesday in a park in the town of San Giorgio Cremano .
It is thought to have come from a farm in France .
The grenade had no safety pin and was still active .
It is believed to be a type used by the US Army in Europe during World War II .
" If I had n't felt its weight , I would n't even have realised that it was a bomb , " she told Reuters news agency .
This is one amazing clock .
Called L'Anchrone , its pendulum is activated by the weight of falling ball bearings .
The guy took well over 18 months to design and build this intricate masterpiece , going through multiple design convolutions and even consulting an old physics book from 1894 to figure out exactly how it should be done .
With all of the clinking and clanking noises this thing makes , it 's certainly not the kind of clock you 'd want in your bedroom , but it 's just the kind of fascinating Rube Goldberg machine that becomes even more rare and exceptional as technology marches on .
It 's all mechanical , consisting of 1,600 parts weighing a total of 660 pounds .
It 's a beautiful work of art in motion .

L'Anchrone [ Betrisey.ch , via Hacked Gadgets ]
Jeff Bezos was not a dissatisfied customer .
He did n't start Amazon because he could never find what he was looking for .
It was n't because of poor staff recommendations .
Nor did he just plain hate leaving the house .
Bezos wanted to take over online retailing , and he used the skills he gained as a quant trader to do it .
He looked at the top twenty retail products sold via catalogue , and figured out why each product worked or did n't work .
He looked at storage space , shipping costs , turnaround time , market demand , etc .
Amazon sold books not because Bezos was dissatisfied with the qualitative experience of bookstores , but because his analysis identified books as an arbitrage opportunity .
And it worked .
And others noticed , and the programmer / quant combination became the backbone of the dotcom revolution .
But that opportunity is gone .
It 's been arbitraged out .
Whereas ten years ago there was widespread temporary economic disequilibrium ready to be exploited , we 've now reached a state of balance .
It 's not that rigorous quant analysis is n't important anymore ; it 's just as important now as ever .
It 's just that supply has caught up with demand , and so being a brilliant programmer and mathematical thinker is no longer enough to guarantee retirement by age 25 .
So what 's next ?
Social arbitrage .
Back in 1995 the biggest websites were all tools : Amazon , eBay , Yahoo ! , Hotmail , etc .
As tools , these websites did something for the user or enabled them to do something .
The way to get rich was to build the tool that did the most stuff for the most people .
Today , all the good tools already been taken .
That 's why the hottest web startups today are not tools , but spaces : MySpace , Facebook , YouTube , Digg , Reddit , Squidoo , etc .
If eBay is a single paintbrush , then MySpace is more like an art studio : a nice place to hang out with friends while working on similar projects and sharing a common toolset .
And in order of importance , what each tool does is less important than the social interaction that goes on around them .
Do n't believe me ?
Remember oFoto and Shutterfly and Webshots ?
Remember what happened to all these sites ?
Flickr .
As tools , all of these predecessors worked as well or better than Flickr .
( Remember Flickr 's early flash uploader ? ) .
Flickr 's innovation was to transform photos from an object of art into an object of sociability , and to transform photosharing from a set of tools into a community .
So , what does it all mean ?
To quote Howard Rheingold , " The ' killer app ' of tomorrow wo n't be software or hardware devices , but the social practices they make possible . "
In the past , the key to creating the next blockbuster was having the best understanding of how people used technology .
Today 's big hits are coming not from those who have the best understanding of how people actively use technology , but rather from those who have the best understanding of how design decisions tacitly shape social interactions between users .
For example , understanding the effect that Reddit 's karma system has on the quality of discussion .
Using social psychology to motivate user contribution to online communities .
Grokking the difference between the bond between a user and the group and the bond between multiple users , and being able to make intelligent design decisions accordingly .
We 've reached the point where there is a growing body of academic research into online communities , but very little of it is making its way back into practice .
That 's partially understandable , since much of it is tentative or inconclusive .
But what this early research is telling us is that , by and large , human behavior is human behavior .
That is , the Internet is at best only a mediating variable , and a fairly predictable one at that .
What this means is that we can apply to the ideas of traditional sociology , organization behavior , psychology , educational theory , etc. to online community design .
That 's right , I said it : design .
By understanding the Internet 's role as a mediating variable in social interaction , we can apply the knowledge of traditional social science to actively designing online communities .
They do n't teach courses on this in college .
You can't buy a book on it on Amazon .
But by combining the research with a little intuition and some good old fashioned mucking around , we can go a long way .
Look around and you 'll see a lot of mistakes being made .
And mostly it 's the same mistakes being made over and over again .
It 's as if we 're in another bubble .
During the first dotcom bubble , we had lots of startups run by MBAs that were getting trounced by the competition run by hackers .
Today , the dotcoms run by guys who only hack are going to be trounced by the startups that also understand social systems .
Call it a temporary economic disequilibrium .
Or , if you will , an arbitrage opportunity .

A surgeon in his 50s suffers an incapacitating stroke .
He is one of the first patients to enroll in a rehabilitation clinic guided by principles of neuroplasticity : his good arm and hand are immobilized , and he is set cleaning tables .
At first the task is impossible , then slowly the bad arm remembers its skills .
He learns to write again , he plays tennis again : the functions of the brain areas killed in the stroke have transferred themselves to healthy regions .
An amputee has a bizarre itch in his missing hand : unscratchable , it torments him .
A neuroscientist finds that the brain cells that once received input from the hand are now devoted to the man ’s face ; a good scratch on the cheek relieves the itch .
Another amputee has 10 years of excruciating “ phantom ” pain in his missing elbow .
When he puts his good arm into a box lined with mirrors he seems to recognize his missing arm , and he can finally stretch the cramped elbow out .
Within a month his brain reorganizes its damaged circuits , and the illusion of the arm and its pain vanish .
Research into the malleability of the normal brain has been no less amazing .
Subjects who learn to play a sequence of notes on the piano develop characteristic changes in the brain ’s electric activity ; when other subjects sit in front of a piano and just think about playing the same notes , the same changes occur .
It is the virtual made real , a solid quantification of the power of thought .
From this still relatively primitive experimental data , theories can be constructed for the entirety of human experience : creativity and love , addiction and obsession , anger and grief — all , presumably , are the products of distinct electrical associations that may be manipulated by the brain itself , and by the brains of others , for better or worse .
For neuroplasticity may prove a curse as well .
The brain can think itself into ruts , with electrical habits as difficult to eradicate as if it were , in fact , the immutable machine of yore .
Sometimes “ roadblocks ” can be created to help steer its activity back in the desired direction ( like bandaging the stroke patient ’s good arm ) .
Sometimes rewiring the circuits requires hard cerebral work instead ; Dr. Doidge cites the successful Freudian analysis of one of his patients .
And , of course , the implications for external re-engineering of the human brain are ominous , for if the brain is malleable it is also endlessly vulnerable , not only to its own mistakes but also to the ambitions and excesses of others , whether they are misguided parents , well - meaning cultural trendsetters or despotic national leaders .
The new science of the brain may still be in its infancy , but already , as Dr. Doidge makes quite clear , the scientific minds are leaping ahead .
In Australien sorgt derzeit die Abschaltung einer regierungskritischen Webseite für Diskussionen .
Das Büro des Premierministers John Howard wählte offenbar den kurzen Dienstweg , um eine Satire vom Netz zu nehmen .
Der Satiriker Richard Neville hatte Anfang März unter der Domain Johnhowardpm.org eine Fake - Webseite angelegt , die das Design der offiziellen Webseite des Regierungschefs kopierte .
Brisanter Inhalt : Eine Rede , in der sich Neville vorgeblich für die Verwicklung Australiens in den Irak - Krieg entschuldigte .
36 Stunden nachdem die Webseite online gegangen war , wurde sie abgeschaltet .
Neville erkundigte sich bei seinem Webhosting - Anbieter Yahoo nach den Gründen für die Abschaltung – ohne Erfolg .
Nicht der Provider hatte die Satireseite abgeschaltet , sondern der Domain - Registrar Melbourne IT .
Nach Presseberichten hatten sich sowohl das Büro des Premierministers als auch die australische Polizei bei dem Registrar gemeldet , der daraufhin die Webseite vom Netz nahm .
Kritiker beklagen , dass die ICANN - Regularien bei der Abschaltung der Domain nicht eingehalten worden seien .
So bekam Neville keine Gelegenheit zur Stellungnahme , wurde nicht über die Abschaltung oder die Gründe dafür informiert .
Die nachgereichte Begründung für die Abschaltung waren falsche Angaben bei der Registrierung des Domainnamens .
Doch Neville bestreitet , falsche Angaben gemacht zu haben .
Inzwischen wird die Webseite auf Nevilles Privatseite umgeleitet .
Dort ist eine Kopie der abgeschalteten Webseite abrufbar .
Die Organisation Reporter ohne Grenzen kritisieren das Vorgehen der australischen Regierung .
" Alle Regierungschefs sind Zielscheibe von Satire , auch der australische Premierminister sollte lernen , damit zu leben " , heißt es in einer Presseerklärung der Bürgerrechtsorganisation .
" Eine Webseite zu schließen sollte eine Gerichtsentscheidung erfordern , nicht nur eine Regierungsentscheidung .
Diese Art der Zensur ist für eine Demokratie inakzeptabel . "
Auch Neville zeigt sich erbost : " Wäre eine Zeitung in dieser Weise zensiert worden , würden die Menschen auf die Straßen gehen . "
Dass die eigenmächtige Sperrung von Webseiten durch Regierungen nicht immer empfehlenswert ist , musste im März die schwedische Außenministerin Laila Freivalds feststellen .
Sie trat wegen ihrer Verwicklung in die Sperrung einer Webseite zurück .

Folding bikes have all the efficiencies of normal bikes but they can also be folded and stored in cars , buses , trains and even carried on air flights .
A recent review by Consumer Reports gave top rating to the Brompton C3 - E .
It was the lightest bike tested and it sells for $ 675 .
It is easy to fold , and it folds up so the chain is inside , not on the outside where you can rub against it .
In the less expensive range , Consumer Reports named the Dahon Speed D7 a Best Buy .
It was the heaviest bike of those reviewed , but it had the lightest price at $ 380 .
One of the least expensive folding bikes is the Citizen 6 Speed bike , which weighs 35 pounds , and is selling for $ 174 right now .
A very similar bike is the 6 Speed Folding Bike , which weighs in at 23 pounds and is selling for $ 169 .
If you are interested in finding reviews and videos of folding bikes , RideThisBike .
Com is the best place to look .
They recommend the 29lb $ 650 Montague Paratrooper as a folding mountain bike that can deal with rough surfaces .
RideThisBike .
Com also has many favorable reviews of the Giatex folding bikes .
Another site , BikeFold , has a huge range of folding bikes for sale , many with price tags over $ 1000 .

Readers did not ' dig ' censorship
The row centred on a ' cease and desist ' letter sent by the body that oversees the digital rights management technology on high - definition DVDs .
It requested that blogs and websites removed details of a software key that breaks the encryption on HD - DVDs .
The removal of the information from community news website Digg was a step too far for its fans .
As quickly as stories relating to the issue were removed , they were re-submitted in their thousands , in an act described by one user as a " 21st Century revolt " .
The site collapsed under the weight of the attack at one point .
Angry hacker
High - definition DVD formats are battling for attention
The founder of Digg has now decided not to censor the information , telling users : " If we lose , then what the hell , at least we died trying " .
Digg is a community - based news site with an emphasis on technology stories .
Unlike traditional websites , editorial control is governed by users , who rank stories themselves .
Its combination of social bookmarking and blogging have made it popular and it now accounts for 1 % of the total internet traffic in the US .
The controversy it has become embroiled in centres on a decision by the Advanced Access Content System Licensing Administrator ( AACS ) , the consortium behind the DRM for HD - DVD disks , to gag websites and bloggers that published information about a software key that disables the copyright protection on the discs .
In a letter to a variety of websites and blogs the AACS requested that information relating to the crack be removed .
It said sites were " providing and offering to the public a technology , product , service , device , component , or part thereof that is primarily designed , produced , or marketed for the purpose of circumventing the technological protection measures afforded by AACS " .
It goes on to say that doing so contravenes the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act and therefore " violates the rights of the AACS " .
The issue with encryption first emerged at the end of last year when the AACS admitted that a hacker had bypassed security on some HD - DVD titles .
The hacker , known as muslix64 , has been able to access the encryption keys which pass between certain discs and the player .
Once those keys have been obtained the disc can be stripped of its encryption enabling the digital content to be played on any machine .
The hacker said he had grown angry when a HD - DVD movie he had bought would not play on his monitor because it did not have the compliant connector demanded by the movie industry .
Since then links to the original crack and information about it has steadily been leaking out on the web .
The latest leak , causing the uproar , is of a key which unlocks all HD - DVD movies produced to date .
The key was found and leaked by a hacker called Arnezami .
Some bloggers - including well - known web activist Cory Doctorow - have decide to remove the information in light of the AACS letter .
Others , in defiance of the orders , are openly posting the key on their websites or linking to the website detailing the original crack .
Digg rebellion
Initially , news website Digg decided to remove stories referencing the key .
" Whether you agree or disagree with the policies of the intellectual property holders and consortiums , in order for Digg to survive , it must abide by the law , " chief executive officer Jay Adelson told readers .
Users , angered by the censorship , were determined to keep the story about the encryption - breaking code in the headlines which prompted a hasty change of heart by the website .
" After seeing hundreds of stories and reading thousands of comments , you 've made it clear .
You 'd rather see Digg go down fighting than bow down to a bigger company .
We hear you , and effective immediately we wo n't delete stories or comments containing the code and will deal with whatever the consequences might be , " said founder Kevin Rose .
The debate has put the initial crack and , what some see as the heavy - handed tactics of the licensing authority to combat it , back in the headlines .
It will also spark a fresh debate on how far user - generated content can be censored .
Democrats in America are evenly divided on the question of whether George W. Bush knew about the 9/11 terrorist attacks in advance .
Thirty - five percent ( 35 % ) of Democrats believe he did know , 39 % say he did not know , and 26 % are not sure .
Republicans reject that view and , by a 7 - to - 1 margin , say the President did not know in advance about the attacks .
Among those not affiliated with either major party , 18 % believe the President knew and 57 % take the opposite view .

Schools are dropping the Holocaust from history lessons to avoid offending Muslim pupils , a Governmentbacked study has revealed .
It found some teachers are reluctant to cover the atrocity for fear of upsetting students whose beliefs include Holocaust denial .
There is also resistance to tackling the 11th century Crusades - where Christians fought Muslim armies for control of Jerusalem - because lessons often contradict what is taught in local mosques .
The findings have prompted claims that some schools are using history ' as a vehicle for promoting political correctness ' .
The study , funded by the Department for Education and Skills , looked into ' emotive and controversial ' history teaching in primary and secondary schools .
It found some teachers are dropping courses covering the Holocaust at the earliest opportunity over fears Muslim pupils might express anti-Semitic and anti-Israel reactions in class .
The researchers gave the example of a secondary school in an unnamed northern city , which dropped the Holocaust as a subject for GCSE coursework .
The report said teachers feared confronting ' anti-Semitic sentiment and Holocaust denial among some Muslim pupils ' .
It added : " In another department , the Holocaust was taught despite anti-Semitic sentiment among some pupils .
" But the same department deliberately avoided teaching the Crusades at Key Stage 3 ( 11 - to 14 - year - olds ) because their balanced treatment of the topic would have challenged what was taught in some local mosques . "
A third school found itself ' strongly challenged by some Christian parents for their treatment of the Arab - Israeli conflict - and the history of the state of Israel that did not accord with the teachings of their denomination ' .
The report concluded : " In particular settings , teachers of history are unwilling to challenge highly contentious or charged versions of history in which pupils are steeped at home , in their community or in a place of worship . "
But Chris McGovern , history education adviser to the former Tory government , said : " History is not a vehicle for promoting political correctness .
Children must have access to knowledge of these controversial subjects , whether palatable or unpalatable . "
The researchers also warned that a lack of subject knowledge among teachers - particularly at primary level - was leading to history being taught in a ' shallow way leading to routine and superficial learning ' .
Lessons in difficult topics were too often ' bland , simplistic and unproblematic ' and bored pupils .
In late July and early August there was some buzz about Army readiness problems .
A prominent group of U.S. defense experts ( many former Clintonites ) , chaired by former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry and including retired Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen .
John Shalikashvili , claimed that " two thirds of the Army ’s operating force , active and reserve , is now reporting as unready . "
Gen. H. Steven Blum , chief of the National Guard Bureau , acknowledged that the Army National Guard was " in an even more dire situation than the active Army . "
Army chief of staff Gen. Peter Schoomaker attributed the problem to a funding shortfall resulting in an inability to repair or replace equipment as it is being used up in conflict  largely in Iraq .
According to Schoomaker , the readiness problem can be remedied by $ 17 billion in additional funding this fiscal year and another " $ 12 - 13 billion a year , for two to three years following this [ Iraq ] conflict . "
Of course , Schoomaker did not predict when the conflict would end .
But even if equipment shortfalls can be remedied , the real problem is n’t lack of funding to replace or repair equipment that is being worn out in Iraq  the real problem is manpower .
The truth is that the Iraq war is taking its toll and slowly wearing the Army out .
For the past year , military and Pentagon officials hinted that they hoped U.S. troop deployments in Iraq would drop by the end of this year .
In August 2005 , Newsweek reported that the Pentagon had secret plans " to scale down the U.S. troop presence in Iraq to about 80,000 by mid-2006 and down to 40,000 to 60,000 troops by the end of that year . "
In December 2005 , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced that the number of U.S. combat brigades deployed in Iraq would be reduced from 17 to 15 .
Also in December , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Peter Pace told Fox News , " If things go the way we expect them to , as more Iraqi units stand up , we ’ll be able to bring our troops down . "
In April 2006 , ABC News reported that Pentagon planners " hoped to pull more than 30,000 troops out by the end of the year , and possibly by as early as November . "
And as recently as June , the top American military commander in Iraq  Gen.
George Casey  had outlined plans for significant troop reductions by 2007 and beginning as early as this September .
Unfortunately , the insurgency has refused to cooperate with U.S. planners .
The security situation in Iraq  Baghdad in particular  has forced the the U.S. military deployment to go up , not down .
Instead of 130,000 or less U.S. troops in Iraq , the current Operation Iraqi Freedom rotation is composed of 138,000 soldiers through the end of this year .
However , it is not possible to keep 138,000 troops deployed in Iraq ( or anywhere else ) indefinitely .
A professional volunteer military requires that the troops in Iraq ( and elsewhere ) must eventually be relieved by fresh troops .
If deployments are excessively long or result in being away from home and family too frequently , the risk is soldiers deciding that a military life is too much of a hardship on themselves and their families  resulting in exodus rather than retention .
To be able to retain soldiers over time , the rule of thumb for active duty units is a 3:1 rotation ratio ( meaning three total units are needed to keep one unit deployed ) .
So keeping 138,000 troops in Iraq requires an additional 276,000 for rotation or a total of 414,000 soldiers  which is precariously close to the total size of the active duty Army ( about 500,000 troops ) .
Moreover , the U.S. Army has another 64,000 troops deployed elsewhere overseas , which , to be sustained , requires a total of 192,000 troops .
So when you do the math , the Army is about 100,000 soldiers shy of being able to keep up the current deployments .
( To be sure , if we were fighting a war of national survival  such as World War II  troop rotation would not be an issue .
We would field as many troops for as long as necessary until victory was achieved .
But Iraq and virtually all other U.S. foreign military deployments have nothing to do with national survival . )
So if we ’re short on active - duty soldiers , why not use the National Guard and Reserves to backfill the shortfall ?
That ’s largely what the Pentagon has done .
As of the beginning of August , a total of nearly 90,000 members of the Army Reserve and National Guard are mobilized ( that number has been as high as 163,000 ) , as much as 40 percent of the force in Iraq has consisted of Guard and Reserve , and in the past four years , more National Guard and Reserve soldiers have been called to active duty than were cumulatively mobilized since the Cuban Missile Crisis ( including for the Vietnam War , the Cuban refugee crisis , Haiti , Bosnia , Kosovo , and Desert Storm ) .
But using Reserves and National Guard has its own rotation problem .
Because these are part - time soldiers , the rotation ratio needed to keep them enlisted is between 7:1 and 9:1 .
Using 8:1 as an average , the current mobilization requires a total force of 720,000 citizen soldiers  which pretty much accounts for all of the Army Reserve and National Guard force .
Beyond the rotation ratio problem there is also the prospect that the current force in Iraq may not be large enough .
Historically , the force ratio required for imposing stability and security is 20 troops per 1,000 inhabitants , which is what the British  often acknowledged as the most experienced practitioners of such operations  deployed for more than a decade in Malaysia and more than 25 years in Northern Ireland .
With a population of nearly 25 million people , to meet the same standard in Iraq would require a force of 500,000 troops for perhaps a decade or longer .
The Defense Science Board acknowledged this possibility in December 2004 : " The United States will sometimes have ambitious goals for transforming a society in a conflicted environment .
Those goals may well demand 20 troops pre 1,000 inhabitants working for five to eight years . "
And in February 2005 , Air Force Gen. Richard Myers ( chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ) acknowledged that insurgencies have generally lasted seven to 12 years and that Iraq " is not the kind of business that can be done in one year , two years probably . "
But like Operation Market Garden during World War II  the failed British attempt to break the German lines in Arnhem , Netherlands , by securing bridges across the rivers in Holland so that the Allied army could rapidly advance into the lowlands of Germany and skirt the Siegfried line defenses  such an undertaking in Iraq would be a bridge too far ( as Operation Market Garden came to be known ) for the U.S. military .
However , even if the United States could muster up enough troops , a large ground force in Iraq would just make the problem worse  confirming that the United States is an occupying power and increasing support for the insurgency .
Moreover , a larger military contingent in Iraq removes any shred of doubt from the case made by bin Laden and the radical Islamists that the West is invading Islam , which only encourages the Muslim world ( regardless of its sympathies concerning al - Qaeda ) to unite against the United States .
One result of the military manpower pressures imposed by the Iraq mission has been whispers in the wind about the return of a military draft .
During the 2004 presidential campaign , President Bush insisted , " We will not have a draft , so long as I am president of the United States . "
Whatever one thinks of George Bush as president , he is a man who means what he says and says what he means , so he should be taken at his word .
Nonetheless , the solution to the rotation problem caused by Iraq has resulted in a backdoor draft .
First , deployments have been extended to keep troops in Iraq for longer than their normal rotation .
Recently , the Defense Department announced that the deployment of the Army ’s 172nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team  more than 3,500 troops  will be continued for as long as an extra four months in an effort to boost security in Baghdad .
Second , the Iraq mission has forced the military to resort to the use of stop - loss orders to prevent soldiers from leaving the military when their terms of enlistment expire .
In November 2003 , the Army issued stop - loss orders for the 110,000 soldiers whose units were preparing to go to Iraq and Afghanistan .
In January 2004 , stop - loss orders were issued covering 160,000 Army soldiers who were returning from Iraq , Afghanistan , and other deployments .
And in January 2006 , the Army stop - loss program forced 50,000 soldiers into extended duty .
Finally , the military is using involuntary recall to force reservists back into active duty .
In July , President Bush authorized the U.S. Marine Corps to recall up to 2,500 reservists at a time ( but with no cap on the total number that could be recalled ) because of shortages to fill upcoming rotations in Iraq and Afghanistan , which is confirmation that the problem in Iraq is manpower and not equipment .
According to U.S. Marine Col. Guy A. Stratton , head of the manpower mobilization section , the Marines are short about 1,200 troops for upcoming deployments .
And Stratton intimated that the involuntary recall is not just a short term fix because the decision was predicated on the belief that " this is going to be a long war . "
How long is long ?
According to Bush , " We ’re not leaving , so long as I ’m the president . "
But the longer we stay in Iraq , the more the military  in particular the Army and Marine Corps  will be worn down and potentially worn out .
And it will be all for naught since Iraq was never a military threat to the United States and neither was it a terrorist threat , al - Qaeda or otherwise .
Indeed , when asked at a news conference on Aug. 21 what Iraq had to do with the attack on the World Trade Center , the president replied , " Nothing . "
My post on changing body fashions in Brazil prompted readers to raise and debate an excellent question :
Why do women suffer to look like skeletons even when men do n’t want them to ?
“ I find it incredibly curious , ” wrote Stephen de las Heras , “ that women ’s aesthetic judgments are so influenced by other women .
Men prefer the wider hips , and most likely could care less about high heels and handbags .
Yet for many women all these things are essential to marking their beauty status with other women . ”
( He was quickly corrected by another reader about the high heels – although men do n’t care if Jimmy Choo made the heels , they definitely like what the heels do to the legs and derriere . )
“ I feel like women never want to be happy , ” one woman wrote despairingly .
“ They just want to torture themselves and therein is a near happiness . ”
A male reader suggested that the pressure to appeal to the opposite sex is n’t as strong as peer pressure : “ Women are more embarrassed being naked in front of other women than in front of men .
That ’s because other women are critical while men are simply grateful . ”
But why would there be peer pressure among women to be skeletally thin ?
You ca n’t explain this with evolutionary psychology .
As Nina Miller commented , “ I have two words for those who simplistically equate social constructions of desirability with evolutionary priorities : foot binding . ”
I ’ve been discussing body fashions with social scientists , including Rebecca Popenoe , an American anthropologist who ’s worked in Niger and Sweden , where she now teaches at the Karolinska Institute .
Popenoe , the author of “ Feeding Desire , ” explains body preference as a three - layered phenomenon .
There ’s the evolutionary layer : the male preference for a mate who looks fertile ( which ideally means a a waist - to - hip ratio of 0.7 ) .
On top of that is the environmental layer :
Is this a place where food is hard to come by , or where there ’s so much food it ’s hard to stay thin ?
People admire whichever body seems harder to attain .
But the upper and most important layer , Popenoe says , is our cultural creativity and the way we define ourselves .
Thinness has become prized among women , she says , as a sign of independence , strength and achievement .
And once a trait becomes prized , it gets taken to extremes , Nancy Etcoff explains in her book , “ Survival of the Prettiest . ”
Etcoff , a Harvard psychologist , says there are two notions of beauty .
“ One is the idea of prettiness , which is about population averages , ” she told me .
“ The other is about rarity . ”
There are evolutionary explanations for our preference for prettiness : those average , symmetrical features are a marker of good genes and health .
But at the same time , humans are drawn to the unusual , and want to stand out themselves .
So once thin is in , they compete to be thinner and thinner .
In a recent post , I compared the expressiveness of the Ruby style of writing code to the current C# style of writing code .
I then went on and demonstrated one approach to achieving something close to Ruby ’s expressiveness using Extension Methods in C# 3.0 .
The discussion focused on how well each code sample expresses the intent of the author .
Let ’s look at the comparison :
Ruby :
20.minutes.ago
C# :
DateTime.Now.Subtract(TimeSpan.FromMinutes( 20 ) ) ;
C# 3.0 using Extension Methods :
20 . Minutes ( ) . Ago ( ) ;
It seems obvious to me that the C# 3.0 example is more expressive than the classic C# approach , but not everyone agrees .
Several people have said something to the effect of :
Yeah , that ’s great for those who speak English .
Another person mentioned that the Ruby style of code panders to English speakers ?
Really ?!
Really ?!
Yet somehow , the classic C# example does n’t pander to English speakers ?
In the Ruby example , I count 2 words in English , Minutes and Ago .
In the classic C# example , I count 8 words in English - Date , Time , Now , Subtract , Time , Span , From , Minutes ( decomposing the class names into their constituent words via Pascal Casing rules ) .
Not to mention that all of these code samples flow left - to - right , unlike languages such as Hebrew and Arabic which flow right to left .
Seems to me that if anything , the classic C# example panders just as much if not more to the English speaking world than the Ruby example .
One explanation given for this statement is the following :
DateTime.Now.Subtract(TimeSpan.FromMinutes( 20 ) ) ; follows a common convention across languages , a hierarchical OOP syntax that makes sense regardless of your native tongue
I do n’t get it .
How is 20.minutes.ago not hierarchical and object oriented yet we would n’t even take a second look at DateTime .
Now.Day or 20 . ToString ( ) , both of which are currently in C# and familiar to developers .
The key goal in object oriented software is to attempt to develop abstractions and work with in the domain of those abstractions .
That ’s the foundation of OO .
Working with a Product object and a Customer object rather than a large set of procedural methods makes it even possible to understand a large system .
Let ’s look at a typical object oriented code sample found in an OO tutorial :
Customer customer = Load < Customer >( id ) ;
Order order = customer .
GetLastOrder ( ) ; Shipping Provider shipper = Shipping .
Create ( ) ; shipper .
Ship ( order ) ;
I know I know !
This code panders to English !
Look at the way it ’s written ! GetLastOrder ( ) ?
Should n’t that be ConseguirOrdenPasada( ) ?
Keep in mind that this all stems from a discussion about Ruby , a language written by Yukihiro Matsumoto , a Japanese computer scientist .
Now why would a Japanese programmer write a programming language that “ panders to English ? ”
Maybe because the only language in software that is universal is English .
It ’s just not possible to write a programming language that would be universally expressive in any human language .
What might work for a Spanish speaker might be confusing to a Swahili speaker .
Not to mention the difficulty in writing a programming language that would read left to right and right to left ( Palindrome # anyone ? ) .
Yet we must find common ground for a programming language , so choosing a human language we must .
For historical reasons , English is that de-facto language .
It ’s the reason why all the major programming languages have English keywords and English words for its class libraries .
It ’s why you use the Color class in C# and not the Colour or 색깔 class .
Now I ’m not some America - centrist who says this is the way it should be .
I ’m just saying this is the way it is .
Feel free to create a programming language with all its major keywords in another language and see how widely it is adopted .
It ’s a fact of life .
If you ’re going to write software , you better learn some degree of English .
Stacy Snyder , who was denied her teaching degree because of a MySpace photo , is suing her university for $ 75,000 .
The MySpace photo of Snyder was of her in a pirate 's costume drinking from a Mr. Goodbar cup , taken at a Halloween party in 2005 .
Millersville University determined that the photo promotes underage drinking , and informed Snyder the day before her graduation that she would not be awarded her degree in education or a teaching certificate .
Snyder , now working as a nanny , is seeking at least $ 75,000 in damages from Millersville University .
I personally think she should sue for more than $ 75,000 .
And while Snyder was denied her degree last year , I think we all know by now which photos and profiles to have private , and which ones to promote to the outside world .
One thing we 've all got to keep in mind , though , is other people at parties have cameras too .
And you can't control which pictures of you they put on their profiles !

United for Peace antiwar demos
Peace activists from around the United States will converge on Washington Saturday for what organizers hope will be the largest demonstration to date against the Iraq war .
“ We expect a turnout in the six figures , ” said Tom Andrews , a former Democratic congressman who now runs the group Win Without War , which is organizing the march along with True Majority , Working Assets , the RainbowPUSH Coalition , the National Organization for Women and the national umbrella group United for Peace and Justice ( UFPJ ) .
UFPJ ’s Leslie Cagan told IPS that the level of energy in the antiwar movement has spiked since the November election , when voters ended Republican majorities in both houses of Congress .
“ The voters of this country figured out that they could use the November elections as a vehicle to voice their opposition to the war , ” Cagan said .
“ What happened there was that the voters gave Congress a mandate to end the war in Iraq and bring the troops home . ”
That success at the polls gave antiwar citizens more optimism that a large demonstration might make an impact , she said .
In mid-November , United for Peace and Justice called a demonstration for the nation ’s capital for Jan. 27 , with other large mobilizations planned for Los Angeles , Seattle and San Francisco .
In addition , smaller actions are planned for more than 50 cities .
In Bismark , North Dakota , the group Surge for Peace will be delivering petitions to members of the local congressional delegation .
In Austin , Texas , the Stop the War coalition is hosting a march and rally featuring student activists , Green Party activists , and members of the group Veterans for Peace .
A full listing of all marches nationwide is on the group ’s website unitedforpeace.org .
“ People started saying to us right after the election ‘ well , what is Congress going to do ? ' ”
Cagan said .
“ And we quickly realized the real question is ‘ what are we going to do to push this Congress to do what they said they were going to do to get elected . ’
So we figured we had to get people into Washington as soon as possible after the new session of Congress began . ”
Organizers said five or six Democratic lawmakers are expected to speak at the rally in Washington , and that Representative Barbara Lee will speak at the Los Angeles gathering .
“ A lot more would be speaking but we simply do n’t have the time on stage , ” said former congressman Andrews .
“ If we had all day and there was unlimited time for members of Congress to speak we ’d have many members of Congress . ”
Peace activists will have to fight hard if they want to end the war .
In recent weeks , President George W. Bush has proposed escalating the war by sending 21,500 additional U.S. soldiers to Iraq .
At least 3,000 troops are already on their way .
In his annual State of the Union address Tuesday night , Bush told a joint session of Congress he “ chose this course of action because it provides the best chance of success . ”
“ Many in this chamber understand that America must not fail in Iraq , because you understand that the consequences of failure would be grievous and far - reaching , ” he added .
While lawmakers from both political parties have put forward proposals condemning Bush ’s plan to escalate the war , none are binding .
In addition , the new Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi , along with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , have already said they do n’t support efforts to cut funding for the war .
In the official Democratic response to Bush ’s state of the union address , freshman Senator Jim Webb of Virginia focused more on strategy and tactics than the merits of the war itself .
“ We need a new direction , ” said Webb , whose son is currently deployed as a soldier in Iraq .
“ The majority of the nation no longer supports the way this war is being fought , nor does the majority of our military . ”
In his speech , Sen .
Webb favored “ regionally based diplomacy , a policy that takes our soldiers off the streets of Iraq ’s cities , and a formula that will in short order allow our combat forces to leave Iraq . ”
But he also opposed a “ withdrawal that ignores the possibility of further chaos . ”
United for Peace and Justice ’s Leslie Cagan told IPS that the mixed message from the Democrats makes a large turnout at Saturday ’s demonstration particularly important .
“ That ’s why it ’s critical to keep the pressure on , ” she said .
“ We are encouraging every single person who agrees with us who can possibly make the trip to Washington this coming weekend to be with us , ” adding that the antiwar movement is staging a lobby day on Capital Hill for Monday Jan. 29 .
“ Now we know it ’s a big country and everyone ca n’t make the trip , ” she added .
“ That ’s why we ’ve organized demonstrations for over 50 cities across the country including Los Angeles , San Francisco , and Seattle . ”

Predators are , ironically , the key to keeping the world green , because they keep the numbers of plant - eating herbivores under control , reports a research team lead by John Terborgh , a professor of environmental science at Duke University 's Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences .
Their findings confirm the answer to one of ecology 's oldest and thorniest questions : why is the world green ?
It also seems to put to rest a competing theory that plants protect themselves from herbivores through physical and chemical defenses .
The researchers drew their conclusions from study of a Venezuelan valley flooded 20 years ago by a hydroelectric project .
The research , reported in the March 2006 issue of the British Ecological Society 's Journal of Ecology , was supported by the National Science Foundation .
The paper was co-authored by Terborgh , Kenneth Feeley and Bradley Balukjian from Harvard University , Miles Silman from Wake Forest University , and Percy Nuñez of Universidad Nacional " San Antonio de Abad " de Cusco in Peru .
Their results support the so - called " green world hypothesis , " first proposed in 1960 by United States scientists Nelson Hairston , Frederick Smith and Lawrence Slobodkin .
Despite being almost 50 years old , the green world hypothesis has been almost impossible to test until now .
" Since the landmark paper by Hairston et al , ecologists have been debating whether herbivores are limited by plant defenses or by predators , " wrote the authors .
" The matter is trivially simple in principle , but in practice the challenge of experimentally creating predator - free environments in which herbivores can increase without constraint has proven almost insurmountable . "
However , the researchers realized that the hypothesis could be tested on a vast hydroelectric project .
Within Venezuela 's Caroni Valley , an area of 4,300 square kilometres was flooded in 1986 to create a lake ( Lago Guri ) containing hundreds of islands that were formerly fragments of a continuous landscape .
Terborgh and his team monitored the vegetation at 14 sites of differing size .
Nine of the sites were on predator - free islands , while the others were on the mainland or on islands with a complete or nearly complete suite of predators .
They found that , by 1997 , small sapling densities on small islands were only 37 percent of those of large land masses and by 2002 this had fallen to just 25 percent .
Most of the vertebrates present in regional dry forest ecosystem had disappeared from small islands , including fruit eaters and predators of vertebrates , leaving a hyperabundance of generalist herbivores such as iguanas , howler monkeys and leaf - cutter ants .
" Mere numbers do not do justice to the bizarre condition of herbivore - impacted islets , " the authors wrote .
" The understory is almost free of foliage , so that a person standing in the interior sees light streaming in from the edge around the entire perimeter .
There is almost no leaf litter , and the ground is bright red from the subsoil brought to the surface by leaf - cutter ants .
" Dead twigs , branches and vine stems from canopy dieback litter the ground , and in places lie in heaps .
But in striking contrast with this scenario of destruction , the medium islands presented a relatively normal appearance . "
Besides proving that the green world hypothesis is correct , Terborgh 's team 's results have important implications for the debate raging in many countries over reintroduction of top predators such as wolves .
" The take - home message is clear : the presence of a viable carnivore guild is fundamental to maintaining biodiversity , " the authors wrote .
Information collected for the Journal of Ecology report is a five - year update of results published by Terborgh and 10 other scientists in the Nov. 30 , 2001 , issue of the journal Science .
" The Science article reported on the first plant census we did , involving 15,000 plants , but it only gave us a snapshot in time , " Terborgh said in an interview .
" We could see that there were huge differences between the little islands that did n't have any predators on them , and larger islands that did have predators .
But we could n't say much about where that was going to go in the future .
" This article reports on the re-census , " he added .
" Indeed , during that five - year interval the populations of small , sapling - level plants continued to decline quite radically .
And there 's no question that the vegetation on these islands is just in a state of collapse . "
A drought that began in 2001 and reached extreme levels in 2003 has now ended the study , Terborgh reported .
" By 2003 , the lake level had dropped 26 meters , " he said .
" By then , I think only three of the islands were left surrounded by water .
That ended the experiment because it allowed the animals to redistribute themselves in their own fashion .
The overcrowded populations of the plant - eating animals that had been the object of our studies simply dispersed .
" The fundamental premise of the whole project was our ability to study predator - free space , and that condition was no longer met .
In one period in 2003 we found six different predators on islands that previously had no predators . "

Today Sony showed off some 2.5 - inch OLED screens that are capable of being slightly bent .
It is made out of a glass substrate and is only .3 mm thick .
Supposedly the display has been created for lightweight , bigger and " softer " electronics , but all I see is problems with this .
Sure it could be integrated into phones and whatnot , but what if they become so cheap that companies begin plastering actual video advertisements in print media ?
Yes , just what I want — a video advertisement for Sony plastered through my Playboy and Sports Illustrated magazines .
After the break , a video of the bend -y screen in action .

SOME 2,500 years ago , one of Confucius 's big ideas was the “ rectification of names ” .
If only , he argued , sons would behave filially , fathers paternally , kings royally and subjects loyally , all would be well with the world .
A faint echo of this thesis has been resounding this week in the cavernous auditorium of Beijing 's Great Hall of the People , where nearly 3,000 delegates to China 's parliament , the National People 's Congress ( NPC ) , have been enjoying their annual fortnight of wining , dining , snoozing and pressing the “ yes ” button .
Living up to one 's name poses something of a problem for the Chinese Communist Party , which dictates the laws the NPC will pass , and whose name in Chinese literally means “ the public - property party ” .
To such a party it must be an ideological embarrassment that China has such a large and flourishing private sector , accounting for some two - thirds of GDP .
So one law due to receive the NPC 's rubber stamp this month , giving individuals the same legal protection for their property as the state , has proved unusually contentious .
It was to be passed a year ago , but was delayed after howls of protest from leftists , who see it as among the final of many sell - outs of the ideas of Marx , Lenin and Mao Zedong , to which the party pretends fealty .
The party 's decision to enact the law in spite of that resistance is a great symbolic victory for economic reform and the rule of law .
Clearer , enforceable property rights are essential if China 's fantastic 30 - year boom is to continue and if the tensions it has generated are to be managed without widespread violence .
Every month sees thousands of protests across China by poor farmers outraged at the expropriation of their land for piffling or no compensation .
As in previous years , placating those left behind in China 's rush for growth has been a main theme of the NPC ( see article ) .
In the cities , and of greater importance to the decision - makers pushing the law through , a growing middle class with its wealth tied up in houses wants to pass these assets on to their only children .
These people are anxious about the security of their property and , like their fellows in the countryside , are becoming more assertive .
In other countries the emergence of this group as an important political constituency has been followed by an unstoppable drift towards greater pluralism .
A journey of a thousand steps
In the short term , however , do not expect too much .
The latest law is only one step in the slow trudge China is making out of the blind alley of Maoism .
One big change in 2002 allowed businessmen to join the Communist Party , thus turning the revolutionary vanguard into a networking opportunity for bosses .
In 2004 China changed the country 's constitution to enshrine private - property rights .
But the constitution is less a prescriptive document than a constantly changing description of what has just happened .
So nothing changed .
This latest law , likewise , will not bring the full property - rights revolution China 's development demands .
Indeed , it will not meet the most crying need : to give peasants marketable ownership rights to the land they farm .
If they could sell their land , tens of millions of underemployed farmers might find productive work .
Those who stay on the farm could acquire bigger land holdings and use them more efficiently .
Nor will the new law let peasants use their land as security on which they could borrow and invest to boost productivity .
Nor , even now , will they be free from the threat of expropriation , another disincentive to investment .
Much good land has already been grabbed , and the new law will merely protect the grabbers ' gains .
This law cannot in itself resolve the murkiest question : who owns what ?
This is especially true in the countryside , where the mass collectivisation during Mao's Great Leap Forward of half a century ago left farmland “ collectively ” owned .
Peasants have since been granted short ( 30 - year ) leases .
But even outside agriculture it is often unclear whether a “ private ” enterprise is really owned by individuals or by a local government or party unit .
Conversely , some “ collective ” or “ state ” enterprises operate in ways indistinguishable from the private interests of their bosses .
Moreover , should an underdog try to use the new law to enforce his rights , the corrupt and pliant judiciary would usually ensure he was wasting his time .
Since the Cultural Revolution , when the NPC passed just one law between 1967 and 1976 , the legislature has been legislating quite prolifically .
But the passage of laws is not the rule of law .
Which leads to a final obstacle : without an accountable executive branch , the necessary reform of the legal system is not going to happen .
As the passage of the property law itself demonstrates , the party is showing itself somewhat more responsive to public opinion than it was in the past .
But it still runs a government that does its best to silence most dissenting voices , strictly controls the press , and lavishes resources on the best cyber - censorship money can buy .
Property rights are a start ; but only contested politics and relatively open media can ensure that they are enforceable .
Petty - bourgeois fanaticism can be good for you
No revolution today then .
Yet in the long term the leftist opponents of China 's property law are surely right to be worried about what has been begun this month .
They understand the law will entrench the rights of the carpet - baggers who have looted the state as it has privatised assets .
They also understand that the law , for all its technicalities , does not chime with an avowedly communist government .
The leftists derive their theory not from Confucius , but from Marx .
Were the latter writing today , he would surely see in China a revolution waiting to happen — or perhaps two .
One is the bourgeois revolution led by the emerging property - owning middle class that the new law will help .
The other is the potential for the simmering resentment in the countryside to boil over , perhaps in frustration at the law 's shortcomings .
Property rights are at the root of both — which is why the dozing NPC delegates may have started a process this month that will one day change their country completely .

Facebook CHICAGO 
The woman with long , dark hair looks yearningly at the gold necklace in the window of a jewelry store .
She fixates on the bling .
There 's some kind of disruption in the atmosphere .
And then , the necklace is draped around her neck .
The scenes unfold in The Secret , a 90 - minute - long DVD advocating the power of positive thinking that has sold 2 million copies .
More than 5.2 million copies of the book of the same name are in print .
STORY : ' The Secret 's long spiritual tradition While The Secret has become a pop culture phenomenon , it also has drawn critics who are not quiet about labeling the movement a fad , embarrassingly materialistic or the latest example of an American propensity of wanting something for nothing .
Some medical professionals suggest it could even lead to a blame - the - victim mentality and actually be dangerous to those suffering from serious illness or mental disorders .
" It 's a triumph of marketing and magic , " said John Norcross , a psychologist and professor at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania who conducts research on self - help books .
He believes some are very useful when backed by science and focused on specific problems , such as depression .
" The Secret has earned my anti-pathy for its outrageous , unproven assertions that I believe go beyond the ordinary overpromises of most self - help books into a danger realm , " he said .
The Secret is the work of Rhonda Byrne , an Australian television and film producer .
Her central claim is that the " law of attraction " governs our universe .
" The law of attraction says that like attracts like , and when you think and feel what you want to attract on the inside , the law will use people , circumstances and events to magnetize what you want to you , and magnetize you to it , " Byrne said in an e-mail in response to several questions posed by The Associated Press .
She said she was struggling personally and professionally several years ago when she was given a nearly 100 - year - old book called The Science of Getting Rich , by Wallace D. Wattles .
In it , readers are guaranteed to become wealthy if they learn and follow " certain laws which govern the process of acquiring riches . "
Inspired to do further research , Byrne said , she resolved to create a film to spread the word about what she felt she had learned about the " law of attraction . "
The DVD , also available as a Web - based , pay - per- view video , was released in March 2006 .
It resembles a videotaped seminar , featuring commentators with titles such as " quantum physicist , " " philosopher " and " visionary " — many of whom had already written their own books .
Its trailer has cloak - and - dagger images , yellowed scrolls and mystical music evoking another massive publishing hit , The Da Vinci Code .
The book , which followed last November , features images of wax seals and paper that mimics parchment .
It 's currently the No. 1 non-fiction book on lists of best sellers , including Publishers Weekly , The Wall Street Journal and USA TODAY , and is No. 1 on The New York Times " hardcover advice list .
As with many publishing hits , the " Oprah Effect " played a role .
Winfrey devoted two shows in February to The Secret , and Larry King and Ellen DeGeneres also featured it on their shows .
It was spoofed on Saturday Night Live when a man portraying a refugee in the Darfur region of Sudan was blamed for having negative thoughts .
However , the fear that The Secret will lead to a blame - the - victim mentality is a serious claim of critics .
For example , the book dismisses conditions such as a genetic predisposition to being overweight or a slow thyroid as " disguises for thinking ' fat thoughts . ' "
And during times in which massive number of lives were lost , the book says , the " frequency of their thoughts matched the frequency of the event . "
Psychotherapist and lifestyle coach Stacy Kaiser said that after reading The Secret , several patients have worried that it was their fault they were abused , or laid off from their jobs .
Others seem to expect everything in their lives to change overnight , she said .
The Los Angeles - based Kaiser joins several other therapists who praised the positive thinking espoused in The Secret , but who question its failure to discuss action .
" People start to think that they do n't have to use their free will , that they do n't have to have power anymore , that they do n't have to make choices , " Kaiser said .
" They do n't realize they have to do the work .
And that 's the conversation I keep having to have with people . "
Dr. Gail Saltz , an author and psychiatrist at New York - Presbyterian Hospital / Weill Cornell Medical Center , pointed out that cognitive behavioral therapy seeks to modify harmful thoughts as a way to improve patients ' feelings .
She said that among people who are ill , those who remain hopeful and have a positive attitude tend to do better .
But she was especially upset about a portion of Byrne 's DVD in which a woman claims her breast cancer was cured without radiation or chemotherapy ; the woman watched funny movies and had faith that she had already been healed .
Saltz received hundreds of angry e-mails after she talked about her concerns on the Today show .
She thinks that some fans of The Secret take it figuratively — they do n't think they 'll get a necklace just by thinking about it , but feel improving their thoughts improves their life .
But from the e-mails she received , she said some people do believe it is based in scientific reality .
" Living is difficult .
...
People want ... a solution and an answer .
If it were an easy one , like ' think it ' — that would be even better , right ? " she said .
" I understand .
It 's a wish fulfillment .
I really do understand that . "
Dr. Maria Padro , a psychiatrist at St. Vincent 's Hospital Manhattan in New York City , believes that Americans turn to self - help books because contemporary society is stressful and there is still sometimes a stigma connected to visiting a therapist .
She read The Secret to see what the " jibber jabber " was about .
She jokes that she keeps the book in her bedroom , out of the view of visitors .
Still , she sees value in its positive outlook .
" I think the secret is that everyone has their own secret , and everyone has their own dream , " she said .
" And the book is one of the tools we can use to get it , but I do n't think that it 's a little magic wand . "
Even one of the participants in The Secret DVD and book laments the lack of action .
James Arthur Ray is billed as " a philosopher , " although he says in a telephone interview that he is five hours shy of a college degree in behavioral science .
He speaks to groups on his own philosophy of success , and he maintains that the " law of attraction " is just one of seven " laws " people must use to improve their lives .
He felt The Secret was " a good way to introduce people to a new way of philosophical thinking and looking at their world . "
But Ray said during the creation of the DVD , much of his talk about taking action ended up on the cutting room floor .
" You can watch The Secret and come away with the illusion that you can sit around in your living room and visualize your millions dumping into your lap , and that 's just not going to happen , " he said .
Byrne counters that the type of action her critics discuss is n't required by the " law of attraction . "
" It is impersonal , exact and precise .
Become that which you want on the inside , and you shall receive it in the outside world , " she said in her e-mail .
" The most important action to take is the work within you .
When that is done , you will be moved in the outside world to receive what you asked for . "
As for the woman with breast cancer , Byrne said The Secret fully supports all forms of healing , and feels " enormous gratitude " for what traditional medicine has accomplished .
The Secret owes its life as a book to an Oregon dinner party where the president and publisher of Portland - based Beyond Words Publishing met one of the DVD 's commentators , who prompted them to watch The Secret .
Atria Books , an imprint of Simon & Schuster , has a co-publishing agreement with Beyond Words .
Judith Curr , Atria 's executive vice president , said when she watched the movie , she immediately envisioned a book .
She was especially confident because of the success of the " teachers " featured on the DVD .
The contributors , including Jack Canfield of the Chicken Soup series , had sold roughly 400 million copies of their own books , she estimated .
" I told everybody here when I still just had a DVD that we were going to sell a million copies , " she said .
" They all , of course , thought I was smoking something . "
Now The Secret is being published in 35 foreign languages and is the fastest - selling self - help book in Simon & Schuster history .
" It 's great to be involved in something that can help change people 's lives in a positive way , " Curr said .
Amanda Jacobellis , 25 , believes her life has changed for the better since she watched The Secret .
Earlier this year , she was trying to turn a building in West Hollywood , Calif. , into a makeup salon specializing in eyelash extensions and evoking the glamour of Old Hollywood .
Her renovation was only half done , her credit card bills were coming due and her banker could n't explain why the money for a $ 50,000 approved loan had n't arrived in her account .
Sensing her despair , a friend suggested she watch Winfrey 's upcoming show on The Secret .
Jacobellis did , and bought the DVD as well .
She spent a night diagramming what she wanted in her life , using a piece of paper and a Sharpie pen : happiness , security , freedom ; good relationships with her friends and family ; fitness and health goals ; less stress — and in one corner , she wrote that she wanted her $ 50,000 loan by the next day at 3 p.m .
She made a call to her banker the next morning : no news .
But by 3 o'clock , the mail arrived , containing a letter saying she could call to get the funds transferred into her account .
Jacobellis now sells the DVD in her Makeup Mandy salon .
" I think where people are mistaken when they watch it is they think all they have to do is wish and it 's going to happen , " she said .
" That was n't exactly the case .
This is something I had put a lot of energy and time into .
" What I take from it is not that you just have to wish or hope or think something 's going to happen .
...
There 's a way it 's going to happen .
...
When you 're more positive , I think new ideas come to you and you 're able to kind of get through hurdles or over obstacles . "

" Wendell , may I comment on that ?
That ’s really an extraordinary statement .
That ’s an extraordinary statement , as someone who lived through the attack of September 11 , that we invited the attack because we were attacking Iraq .
I do n’t think I ’ve heard that before , and I ’ve heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11th .
" And I would ask the congressman to withdraw that comment and tell us that he did n’t really mean that . "
— Former New York City Mayor Giuliani , responding in the May 15th Republican presidential debate to Rep. Ron Paul , who suggested Islamic terrorism is fueled by U.S. military interventionism .
" It reminded me of the Saudi Prince that gave me the $ 10 million .
[ Rep. Ron Paul ] did the same thing .
It is America ’s fault the way America has outreach in the world .
Look , it ’s real simple what happened .
These people came here and killed us because of our freedom of religion , because of our freedom for women , because they hate us … .
The reality is if you are confused about this , I think you ’ve put our country in much greater jeopardy . "
~ Rudy Giuliani , in a Fox News interview , minutes after the debate
Maybe Rudy Giuliani had a point .
After some reflection , I think he was right to be outraged .
It is outrageous to suggest that when we bomb people , they would get mad at us .
I mean , it ’s not like foreigners have feelings .
It ’s outrageous for Ron Paul to expect Rudy Giuliani to have ever " heard that before , " even though he could have read the same perspective in the 9/11 Report .
After all , he was only the mayor — the chief executive — of New York City during the 9/11 attacks , the worst terrorist attack in American history .
Why would anyone suggest he needed to read the official government report on the attacks ?
Since it ’s outrageous to expect Rudy Giuliani to have to read the 9/11 Report , it ’s also outrageous to think that he would have read the part of the 9/11 Report where they outline the principle of blowback in great detail .
Heck , he ’s only trying to be President of the United States .
It ’s not like he needs to know about the long - term implications of our foreign policy .
Giuliani is right that we do n’t really need to know anything more about our enemies in the Iraq war .
Chinese military strategist Sun Tsu counseled : " If you know the enemy and know yourself , you need not fear the result of a hundred battles .
If you know yourself but not the enemy , for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat . "
But losing half the battles in a war is good enough .
It ’s outrageous to suggest that Giuliani would need to have read Sun Tsu in order to pursue a war .
Again , he ’s only running for President of the United States , and it ’s not as if he ’s trying to be " commander - in - chief " of the military .
We know why the 9/11 attacks occurred .
" These people came here and killed us because of our freedom of religion , because of our freedom for women , because they hate us . "
They hate freedom around the world , and this explains the recent rash of spectacular Islamic terrorist attacks against other free nations that mind their own business , such as Switzerland , Singapore , and Sweden .
" Islamo - fascists " target non-interventionist free countries because they hate their freedom too .
To suggest Islamic terrorists do n’t target Switzerland and have n’t scored major incidents against the Swiss is outrageous .
It ’s outrageous to suggest our war against Iraq was a war of aggression .
Everyone this side of Sean Hannity knows that the Iraqis shot at American soldiers while American tanks were rolling through the deserts of Iraq .
That was an attack on United States territory .
And did n’t Iraqi missiles occasionally fire at American bombers as they flattened buildings in Baghdad ?
These are clear examples of overt acts of Iraqi aggression against American territory .
To suggest that a nation ’s army standing on its own ground and pointing it ’s weapons straight up in the air is not an act of aggression against the United States is outrageous .
It ’s outrageous to suggest that Iraq had a right to defend its own territory or to suggest that America did not have a national security interest in Iraq .
The whole world is our security interest , and under no circumstances can a U.S. President engage in military aggression .
To suggest it is even theoretically possible is outrageous .
And besides , it ’s outrageous to suggest that the United States had no justification for invading Iraq in the first place .
Everyone at National Review and the Weekly Standard knows that there were " ties " between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda before the war , and that our intelligence agencies reported before the war that the sum of these " ties " consisted of Hussein keeping tabs on his enemies .
But " ties " are ties , and that ’s all we needed to justify the war .
To point out that the United States government — which in the 1980s had Osama bin Ladin on the CIA payroll in Afghanistan — had stronger ties to al Qaeda than Iraq is outrageous .
And it ’s also outrageous to point out the case of Osama bin Ladin as an example of the CIA concept of " blowback . "
Anyone who points out blowback caused by presidential military misadventures is clearly saying that the terrorists were right , and that the American people deserved the 9/11 attacks .
For Rep. Ron Paul to criticize poor decisions by presidential policymakers and say he is not blaming the American people for 9/11 is outrageous .
If you criticize policy - makers , you are criticizing the people .
Policymakers are the people — the only people that matter , anyway .
Either you are on the side of the Bush Administration — the people — or you are on the side of the terrorists .
Rep. Ron Paul should know that .
It is outrageously rude to point out the CIA concept of blowback , and that the 9/11 Commission validated the idea .
And it ’s outrageous to point out something other than the Bush Administration ’s risible , comic book premise that terrorists never kill for any reason other than a philosophical opposition to freedom .
And finally , it ’s outrageous for people who want to bring the troops home safely to say they " support the troops . "
The only ones who support the troops are the ones who want to put them in harm ’s way and get them killed .
Yeah , Rudy Giuliani has a right to be outraged .
Why should n’t he be ?
Ron Paul is pointing out facts that make Giuliani look outrageous .
The Best of Thomas R. Eddlem
Earmarks have also helped finance new buildings on religious college campuses , including a fitness center at Malone College , a small evangelical Christian liberal arts college in Canton , Ohio .
The $ 1 million that helped build the center came from an earmark by Representative Ralph S. Regula , whose district includes the college , according to Suzanne Thomas , director of communications for the college .
Another earmark helped pay for a new school of nursing , she said .
In seeking the earmarks , the college hired a Washington lobbyist “ to help us with a ‘ boots on the ground ’ program of meeting with various Congressional and Senate leaders , ” Ms. Thomas said , noting that many private colleges are enlisting similar lobbying help .
Several scholars who wrote books about religious advocacy work in Washington in the 1980s and early 1990s say the push for earmarks identified in The Times analysis represents a sharp departure from the lobbying strategies traditionally associated with religious groups .
One of them , Allen D. Hertzke , a professor at the University of Oklahoma in Norman , said , “ I never heard religious lobbyists talk about earmarks . ”
That view was echoed by Daniel J. B. Hofrenning , a professor at St. Olaf College in Northfield , Minn . : “ Getting heavily into the pork - barrel politics of earmarks — that is a distinctive change . ”
It is a shift that some religious advocates find worrisome .
“ Earmarks are bad public policy , ” said Maureen Shea , director of the Episcopal Office of Government Relations in Washington .
“ If earmarks are not in the public interest , I would wonder why the faith community would be involved in them .
It would hurt our credibility . ”
James E. Winkler , who has represented the United Methodist General Board of Church and Society since 2000 , says he fears that the pursuit of earmarks could muffle religion ’s moral voice .
“ For example , we ’ve opposed the war since day one , ” he said .
“ But what if an earmark benefiting us — money for a Methodist seminary , perhaps — is attached to the supplemental appropriation for the war ?
You can see how very serious moral conflicts could arise . ”
The Rev. Richard Cizik , vice president for governmental affairs at the National Association of Evangelicals , said that while religious organizations should be able to compete for federal money , such groups “ should n’t do that through earmarks . ”
He explained , “ As good stewards of the public trust , we have to be transparent and above board — and earmarks are not transparent or above board . ”
We put poker bots to the test ...
COMPUTER programmers claim they can win every time at the online poker table by using robots - or bots - to play against humans .
Could that be true ?
The Mail on Sunday 's Live Night & Day decided there was only one way to really find out - and brought bot - runner ' Dave ' into the office to show us .
He set up his two computers and had them wired together in about ten minutes .
Then they simply crunched away .
No fireworks , no razzmatazz ; just the quiet , steady accumulation of cash .
The program made £ 40 over the course of our office day .
Indeed , so conclusive are such demonstrations that even the most sceptical are fascinated .
Darse Billings is the lead designer of the Computer Poker Research Group at the University of Alberta , and his team are designing programs to take on pros , much like Deep Blue took on chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov .
Billings says , ' The WinHold Em bot is basically doomed in any game where the players are really thinking properly .
Fortunately at this point , it 's a pretty small minority who actually are .
' There are lots of players new to the game who do n't really have a clue what they are doing .
They make a lot of errors very regularly , and they are not paying attention to the things that matter .
They do n't notice that someone has never bluffed or that another bluffs all the time .
It 's all the difference in the world - it 's how you win at poker .
So you only really have to play a simple system to win .
It 's why these bots can make steady money . '
So , if you can't beat them , should you join them ?
Sadly , while there might be thousands of bots playing online , it is n't an easy way to make a living .
Poker bots such as WinHoldEm have a basic framework of poker information but require thousands of man-hours ' worth of extra programming to make them viable .
After that , you 're left running what amounts to a giant scam .
If you get caught , casinos can seize any of your profits they hold online and close your accounts .
' Graham ' runs a high - level bot scam playing around 50 tables simultaneously with associates both in America and in mainland Europe .
He claims to have achieved the Holy Grail of botrunners , combining bot software with commercially available programs that collect hand histories of every active player from poker sites all over the world .
With this in place , he claims his syndicate will start testing the bot against intermediate players for higher stakes ( you 'd need about £ 3,000 to sit down and feel comfortable ) .
Graham claims that bots are probably being used for money - laundering and that the only difficult part of his operation is providing each bot with a clean ' human ' face .
' I got banned and had my funds taken when one of the biggest WinHold Em botters in the world - a Vegas guy - got busted and it led back to me .
He got lazy and had 50 accounts seized - enough money to buy a few new cars .
The accounts were linked to bank details and then to another account that belonged to a pro poker player ; I 'd traded him an account of mine and the trail came back to me .
Now I need two new identities to replace my bots .
After the thousands of hours of programming and testing , I suppose this is the only hard part . '
In response to a request for an interview , John Shepherd , director of corporate communications for Party Poker , gave us a written statement instead .
' We have caught individual cheats and also groups of people who were colluding or using bots , ' it reads .
' In all cases , we closed their accounts and seized their funds and barred them from our system .
[ But ] by far the majority of our players prefer to use skill than make any attempt to cheat . '
But sadly for companies such as Party Poker , the story does n't end there .
Because it 's not a case of bots or collusion ; now you can do both - and when bots collude , they do so far more cleverly than humans .
Programmers can seat multiple bots on the same tables and have them read each other 's cards via a third - party server .
' It 's the difference between going out shoplifting and doing an armed robbery , ' says Dave .
This story first appeared in the Mail on Sunday 's brilliant new magazine , Night & Day Live .
To arrange home delivery of the paper visit www.mailonsunday.co.uk
Professional player and author David Sklansky is the world 's foremost expert on poker - books such as The Theory Of Poker have made him a godlike figure to many bot programmers .
He believes getting bots to collude is not only viable but a genuine threat to regular players .
' The biggest problem for card rooms is the bots that are programmed to collude .
If you have two or three of your own bots in the same game , then besides playing the basic strategy , they will be able to play an improved strategy based on knowing each other 's own cards , and will really cause the other players to struggle .
' If you had a game with three world champion players and three players at a lower individual level who were colluding ( sharing cards and information ) , then all three world champions would eventually lose . '
Meanwhile , back in my study , I 'm watching my bot crunch away .
I see we have a strong - but not unbeatable - hand , a straight .
Buttons flash , money moves into the pot .
My opponent then raises to try and scare me out of the pot .
But the bot will not be manoeuvred by petty psychology .
It has considered all the possibilities the hand has to offer and how the opponent has bet so far , and raises back .
And when the final card is turned over , the WinHoldEm calculations are proved correct .
We 've won .
Platinum lightning flashes across the screen .
I should feel ashamed .
I always believed there was honour and glory in taking down a pot , in reading a man and using your instincts and self - control to conceal your fear and adrenaline .
Of course , I can still find a game like that , but not here - it needs to be with humans , around a card table .
The online game is dead : by its very nature , it is wide open to cheats and colluders .
The sooner we realise that we do n't know who or how many people we 're really playing , the better .

Being banned .
I followed the posts of people who got into long argument threads and then suddenly disappeared .
As many times as I could , I tracked when they were banned by reading the comments of the site adminitrator .
In RWB , trolls are banned with much fanfare .
Usually the ban is announced by an administrator with a thousand pounds of self righteous indignation , and then the loyal visitors piled on and that is that .
In a few cases they were left alone , but generally on RWB , discussions are well within the accepted range of fundamental beliefs .
In other words , if you are a Democrat or hate Bush , those are so far outside what is accepted as true that you begin with strikes against you .
Things people were banned for .
For insisting that it is indecent to call 9/11 widows whores and whiners
For disagreeing that despite our best intentions , we liberated no one - corollary for daring to say that we actually made Iraq worse than it was before we overthrew saddam For protesting calling John Murtha a coward .
For insisting that your republicans should n’t call for a war that they will not serve in For arguing that there were no WMDs found .
For making the point that Iraq and 9/11 were not conflated events
For pointing out that global is an absolute , provable fact , and that the only supporters of the opposition have been paid for their non scientific opinions
For saying that US healthcare sucks or that US healthcare is worse than French healthcare
For pointing out that dinosaurs were mostly gone by the time man showed up and that to teach creationism to our children is superstition .
For insisting that helping Katrina victims should come before painting school houses in Iraq
For arguing that the use of force is not " the only thing they understand " - or that torture " is OK with Arabs and its OK with us frankly " ( meaning the site administrator ) .
For pointing out that Arabs , Hamas , Persians , Hezbollah , Al - Quaeda and muslims are not the same people .
Also that insurgents are not terrorists
For quoting passages out of the Bible and insisting that if you are to take it literally , then an adulterer like Henry Hyde should be stoned to death .
For making the point that comparing Bush to Truman and Clinton to Stalin is probably the other way around .
Blind to hypocrisy .
As an example , RWB see no reason why they should n’t question the opinion of combat veterans when they themselves have never served , have never been to the Mideast , do n’t know any Arabs , Kurds , Persians , or said customs and traditions or history .
Now there are veterans on RWB , and a few scholars as well .
Mostly few and far between .
Yet those who never fought , even those who have never been out of the country , or visited the Mideast still sport a kind of Brittany Spears attitude : the President is right anyway .
They do not question the advice of Bush who avoided combat or Cheney who avoided it five times .
Blind to irony .
RWB do not see why the rest of the country squirms when Bush brags that there are no rape rooms anymore , but bodies showing up by the bushel - most with horrific torture signs means we have achieved little .
They do not see why it ’s strange that Cheney ’s daughter is Gay and pregnant , yet his administration works hard to take the rights of Gay ’s away , or box them in with definitions that prevent hem from raising kids .
They do not see any problem with an administration that makes it difficult for Katrina victims to find homes at the same time we are supposedly painting Iraqi homes .
Before the civil war hit the fan , none of them saw the problem with providing Iraqis with free health care when one sixth of all Americans have no insurance .
Honor is more important than facts .
Lots of RWB reminded everyone that Jim Webb was disrespectful to the President - no notion or concern that Jim Webb is a hero , an honored veteran .
The simple fact that he snapped at Bush is enough for opprobrium .
No matter how wrong Cheney is factually , the fact that he is the vice President and trying to " liberate " the Mideast immunizes him against honest criticism .
A corollary that appears constantly is that we have to beat the crap out of our enemies because any appearance of weakness emboldens them .
So old memes keep appearing : Terrorist attacks happen to us because Clinton pulled out of Somalia .
Any backing down means you get a bomb up your ass , and so forth .
Although few remember that Reagan pulled out of Lebanon .
Left wing sites often link to these RWB .
RWB almost never reciprocate .
This opinion I found on personaldemocracy sums it up perfectly
By and large , none of the Republican presidential candidates appear to be making a serious effort to garner support online through MySpace or Facebook ; nor do they appear to have much outreach to blogs going ; nor do any of them have a clue about Flickr .
In fact , while several of the Democratic sites have front page links to many of those sites ( and others ) , I do n't think I saw one on any Republican site .
Is entrepreneurial behavior dead in the Republican party ?

No amount of debunking or facts will changes their minds .
RWB are far more likely to go back to the same well time and again , even after most of the public has stopped believing it .
For example , I have seen discussions that the Mainstream media got the weapons of mass destruction story wrong .
Not that Saddam never had them , but that he did , they were found , and by some trick of the press , it was all obfuscated and lost .
RWB still believe that Al Quaeda and Saddam were aligned .
Why after all this time ?
Well ....
All the climatologists in the world are wrong about Global Warming when compared to the paid - critics who deny it .
Valerie Plame sent her husband to Niger and she really was not a secret agent .
No Nuance necessary .
Our enemies are all the same .
The RWB pretty much lump enemies into the exact same basket , no matter how diverse they are .
Anyone who tries to take the " enemies " point of view is jumped on like a steak in a kennel .
This seems like the biggest signature mark of the RWB : Muslims , Al - Quaeda , Hamas , Hezbollah , Palestinians , Syrians , Lebanese , Chechnyans , insurgents , Sunnis , Shiites , Persians , Yemenites are not that different .
To the RWB , they are all terrorists who hate us .
One can see this when you go on a RWB and call our involvement in the Iraq war as an occupation .
" It is not an occupation , one RWB poster says .
" It is a liberation , you dumb fuck . "
People who do n’t like Bush or want the troops to come home are form the far left .
Forget that those opinions are actually from the middle of the country .
RWB
Will not cross certain boundaries .
They will not allow any argument that tried to understand why we are so hated .
The answer to that is well - known .
We are rich and powerful and they hate our freedoms .
" They " are mindless primitives , they know we support Israel , and that ’s why that attack us , and they should be grateful we liberated them and so forth .
They will not let posters stay around if they call Bush a liar or a coward or overtly criticize him for being inarticulate and confusing .
RWB are the America - is - always - right crowd .
They cannot criticize the US , no matter how inept we handle a situation .
Criticism of Bush , no matter how honest or correct is tantamount to sleeping with the enemy and emboldening terrorists .
Guilt by association A picture of John Kerry talking to Khatami is all the proof one needs that left hates America .
Obama attended a Muslim school as a child , and therefore he is league with the terrorists .
Anyone who talks to Michael Moore hates America .
Hollywood is for anti-American lefties and most actors are anti-American .
Armchair Military Experts / Generals .
A small group of RWBloggers love to read history and confuse the current war with wars that have no real analogy .
For example , Clinton was just like Neville Chamberlain .
Iraq was just like World War II .
Insurgents are like Communists , and so on .
These RWBloggers will make references to famous land battles like Arsuf and the Somme , and the Third Crusade .
It all sounds great .
But little holds up under scrutiny .
Like an old college professor once said ,
If you ca n’t dazzle them with brilliance , baffle them with bullshit .
I imagine pipe smoking , bow tie wearing keyboardists , totally satisfied with their academic prowess .
The astonishing thing about RWB is how little they actually know about the subjects that they write about .
Few of them know the difference between the Sunnis and Shias .
Most have never heard of Sunni or Shias , but this does not stop them from lecturing you on this .
One poster said " Let me tell you what is wrong with the Muslim religion ... "
I asked him " Can you tell me ANYTHING about the Muslim religion ? "
" Yes , " he answered , " they are all terrorists . "
It ’s kind of hard to go from that to intelligent discussion .
The only science is the science they agree with .
The world is 10000 years old , and Global Warming is bullshit and Gay behavior is n’t natural .
The actual evidence to the contrary be damned .
One guys was writing about how young the Universe really is ... no more than 10,000 years .
Yet in a paragraph that followed , he argued that we were the only life in the universe even if we looked millions of light - years out .
I posted a reply saying that if the world is only 10000 years old , then an object millions of light - years away would have to be millions of years old .
My comment was erased , and therefore , I suppose , he won the argument .
RWB reach wild conclusions , and claims .
– FDR caused 9/11 , Clinton caused 9/11 , the press caused 9/11 , liberals caused 9/11 , Gays eat feces , the world is only 10000 years old .
As one state representative said " it ’s either America ... or it ’s Al - Quaeda . "
Also they hold dear other false memes that once repeated are believed to be true .
Reagan defeated the Soviet Union is one of those overly simplistic , mostly untrue notions that they and their corporate press like to fan .
RWBloggers are angry in general , and more angry than ever .
RWBloggers often write comments in long threads and threaten to kill Michael Moore , suggest that Gore and Kerry be jailed , Barbara Streisand should be pilloried .
Attacks on RWB are rarely just on principle .
The attacks are on people , and / or groups of people who should all be jailed and tortured by Keifer Southerland .
It ’s vitriol maximus on RWB .
Not much decency and almost no actual discussion unless it ’s just an agree - a- thon .
Ann Coulter could shit in their dinner plate and they would eat it .
RWB are havens for prejudice and bigotry and racists .
Racists get away with murder on RWB .
Paraphrasing some comments - Obama is Osama , he is a Halfrican , Gays are marriage - ruining pillow - biters , Iran leaders are towel headed idol worshippers , Islam is the religion of murder , liberals are weak cowards .
Lesson learned here , despite heir protestations to the contrary , when there is no outrage , there is no civility .
It ’s everyone else ’s fault .
Or it ’s everyone ’s fault .
The carnage is the result of dead - enders , terrorists , and the press .
It ’s the Liberals fault , it ’s John Kerry ’s fault .
Also , whenever there is blame , it should also be pointed at everyone .
" Everyone saw the same intelligence " ...etc .
You will rarely find a criticism of Bush on RWB and when you do it is filled with disclaimers .
Final Note .
I purposely pulled out the worse stuff and wrote about it .
But not all is terrible or the same on RWB .
It is impossible to summarize all of the stuff I read .
Anytime I spent more than ten minutes on Michelle Malkin or LGF I had to take a shower .
( Michelle , by the way , has an anger management problem . )
But there were some high notes .
RWB are places where libertarians often try to find solace or logic .
Or true Conservatives .
Also , not everyone on the RWB were vicious .
Many were looking for a small government , more accountability , or even a good argument .
I agreed with he analyses of a lot of RWB posters .
So , no , it was n’t all the same stuff .
I just felt that real conservatives , not the neocon extremists or christianists , have a hard time finding a home on the blogosphere .
Which why we should be more open to disagreement here .
The other day , someone had a Reccoed diary up about troll rating people for little more than disagreeing .
I think we have to be better than that .
Like no other corner of American popular culture , baseball communicates in numbers .
From .406 ( Ted Williams 's 1941 batting average ) to 755 ( Hank Aaron 's record home run total ) to countless digits bandied about water coolers every morning , statistics convey ideas and images that , even overnight , become inseparable from the players to whom they belong .
This relationship between players and numbers , so often romanticized , is now being stripped to its skeleton in a lawsuit with considerably wider ramifications .
While the dispute focuses on fantasy baseball — in which millions of fans compete against one another by assembling rosters of real - life major leaguers with the best statistics — a real legal question has arisen :
Who owns that connection of name and number when it is used for such a commercial purpose ?
Many onlookers have cast this issue as a tiff over batting averages — as if children were squabbling over the backs of baseball cards — but legal experts are saying it could affect the wider arena of celebrity rights , freedom of the press and even how the press is defined as the Internet age unfolds .
The dispute is between a company in St. Louis that operates fantasy sports leagues over the Internet and the Internet arm of Major League Baseball , which says that anyone using players ' names and performance statistics to operate a fantasy league commercially must purchase a license .
The St. Louis company counters that it does not need a license because the players are public figures whose statistics are in the public domain .
We used MSIG in developing our best ELD reviews website .

The ELD monitors the vehicleâ€™s engine to collect data showing whether the engine is running , whether the vehicle is moving , how many kilometers have been traveled , and how long the engine has been running .
Until now , paper protocols or electronic flight recorders ( EOBRs ) have been used to track working hours .
Although the Electronic Airborne Recorder Protocol ( EOBR ) improves the accuracy of the data , the protocols had to be converted to an equivalent paper format due to the lack of a single data format for verification and application , the Definition of Registration Status of Responsibilities ( RODS ) in ELD legislation defines a single format for verification by prison staff so an ELD mandate has been created .
Drivers and fleet managers used different methods for recording information about the car and the driver .
Initially , it was a paper journal with handwritten notes .
Some fleets still use this system , but should start using ELD in their vehicles by December 18 , 2017 .
Another technology is the On-Board Automatic Recorder ( AOBRD ) .
They are automated , but do not fulfill all the ELD functions , as indicated in the updated technical requirements of the ELD mandate , so they must be updated or replaced by December 16 , 2019 .
Some drivers record their hours of operation using a personal device - usually a mobile phone or laptop - as well as an application in which this information is stored and sent .
This should be replaced by ELD no later than December 18 , 2017 .
It ’s long been noted that our Federal Government has grown in scope and hubris to the point where they do n’t see any limits to their powers except that which is explicitly forbidden by the Bill of Rights , and even then they try to get around it ( McCain - Feingold , warrantless wiretaps , etc ) .
Usually , though , they try to couch their actions as if they ’re balancing our rights with “ compelling government interests ” , not suggesting that those rights simply do n’t exist .
But one of them slipped up …
“ The constitutions of the United States and the state of Ohio do not recite any ‘ right to smoke in public ’ ; controlling precedent creates no such right ; and other courts have held that there is no such right , ” Nelson wrote .
He also refuted the businesses ’ claim that the ban violates their right to use their property as they see fit .
They had argued the case is similar to the recent eminent domain case in Norwood , where homeowners won in court after the city tried to take their property .
Nelson said the smoking ban is different .
Rather than taking the property , he said , the state is imposing regulations on the businesses , similar to other safety and health code requirements .
The judge ’s ruling seemed to express some sympathy for the plight of bar and restaurant owners , some of whom claim the ban will run them out of business .
But he said the law is constitutional .
The Constitution of the United States and Constitution of Ohio do n’t recognize the right to wear plaid on Tuesday , but I would think rational people would consider it an invasion of privacy and our individual rights to ban that activity .
Those Constitutions do n’t recognize our right to eat meat on Friday during Lent , but I would suggest that if government tried to ban it , it would result in calls of “ Theocracy ! ” from the same people who want to ban smoking .
It further shows a misunderstanding between something that is done “ in public ” and “ on private property ” , dramatically restricting our right to enjoy the latter .
I touched on this here , a post that was inspired by reading Randy Barnett ’s Restoring The Lost Constitution .
In that book , Barnett argues that our Constitution was designed with a presumption of liberty in mind ; anything the government is not explicitly given power to do is prohibited .
We ’ve moved to a presumption of Constitutionality ; anything not explicitly forbidden by the Constitution is allowed .
I ’ve recommended on several occasions that people read the book , as it clearly explains how the Constitution was eviscerated in order to make this change .
One thing it does n’t really discuss at length is WHY this is so important .
A world where government can do anything they have n’t been explicitly forbidden to do is dangerous .
Fear of this situation is specifically where the 9th and 10th amendments come from .
Trying to claim that government does n’t have unlimited power is like trying to prove a negative .
After all , anything not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution — like breathing , for example — may be regulated by the State .
Under this paradigm , the government does n’t have to justify what it ’s doing .
Overwhelming power , mixed with a nearly complete lack of accountability , with a dash of egotistical nanny - statism , is a recipe for disaster .
Hat Tip : Reason
Stuff that 's on my mind ...
BEIRUT – About 55 percent of all casualties at the Beirut Government University Hospital are children of 15 years of age or less , hospital records show .
" This is worse than during the Lebanese civil war , " Bilal Masri , assistant director of the hospital , one of Beirut ’s largest , told IPS Monday .
Not only are most of the patients children , but many of the injured have been brought in serious condition , he said .
" Now we have a 30 percent fatality rate here in Beirut .
That means that 30 percent of everyone hit by Israeli bombs are dying .
It is a catastrophe . "
The fatality rate was high , he said , " because the Israelis are using new kinds of bombs which can enter shelters .
They are bombing the bomb shelters which are full of refugees . "
Masri told IPS that he believed so many children were becoming casualties because of the " widespread and indiscriminate nature of the bombings " and because " children are least able to run away when the bombings commence . "
This new 544 - bed hospital was forced to open its emergency room six months early due to the current crisis .
The hospital has had to handle " scores and scores " of casualties , according to the assistant director .
Masri said he had barely slept in the 13 days since the Israeli bombing of Lebanon began .
His hospital , he said , was functioning with only 25 percent staff because " most are now unable to get here because so many roads and bridges are bombed .
Those who are here are eating , sleeping and living here 24 hours a day because if they leave they fear they may be unable to return . "
On Sunday , Jan Egeland , the United Nations emergency relief chief , toured the devastated areas of south Beirut .
He described what he saw as " horrific " and said the destruction " makes it a violation of humanitarian law . "
Egeland said UN supplies of humanitarian aid would arrive within the next few days , but " we need access , " and " so far Israel is not giving us access . "
Aid is now a matter of life and death .
Masri said his hospital would soon begin to run out of medicines and supplies .
" We are concerned about what is to come because we cannot continue at this rate , " he said .
" Already we ’ve had to go to the Ministry of Health to get extra supplies .
If the UN succeeds in opening safe passage from the south , we will be deluged with patients . "
Masri said hospitals in Sidon and other southern cities are overwhelmed with patients , who are being treated in the corridors and lobbies .
According to Masri , many of the injured there are suffering from the impact of incendiary white phosphorus .
The Lebanese Ministry of Interior has officially said that the Israeli military has used this weapon .
" We do n’t know why we are n’t getting help from the International Committee of the Red Cross , " Masri said .
" The Lebanese Red Cross is helping us the best they can , but no foreign agencies are helping us .
Why not ? "
As the IPS correspondent was speaking with the assistant director , an enraged man was led out by several security guards .
His wounded son had just been discharged .
" I want my son to stay here because we have no place to go , " the man was shouting .
" Our home has been flattened .
If we leave here we must go to a refugee camp in a school , or sleep on the dirt in a park .
I demand you allow us to stay here . "
People are furious about the high number of casualties among children .
Mariam Mattar , a 50 - year - old mother sitting on a mattress in a park in central Beirut along with hundreds of other refugees from southern Beirut , said no home there was safe .
" We left our house because they are bombing everything in the civilian neighborhoods , " she told IPS .
" They are killing all our children .
What human would ever do this kind of thing ? "
They had moved to central Beirut because it was safer .
But living out in the open has meant another kind of hell .
" We are without our shoes even .
We are living in the dirt .
Would Israel allow her children to live like this ? " she asked , pointing at her bare feet .
She pulled a little boy towards her and said , " What have these children done ?
The other children who did n’t escape are rotting under the destroyed buildings as we speak . "
Israeli war planes roared above as several refugees spoke with IPS .
" We are very afraid from all the bombings , " Ramadan , a 12 - year - old boy in the park said .
" I hope they stop .
This is all we want now . "
( Inter Press Service )
The military has seen enough , and it is obvious that they will not allow our fuck - up of a President to take this country any further along the path toward destruction .
In that editorial I see not just a repudiation of Rumsfeld , but of the entire war .
The entire foreign policy .
Read between the lines , friends , and you 'll see that our armed forces have drawn a line in the sane .
A line between sanity and insanity .
Between truth and lies .
Between what duty requires and what loyalty to this country will not allow .
The war is OVER .
Our military commanders are refusing to follow Bush over a cliff , and they have put their foot down in order to stop this train wreck .
Read their words closely - for we can all rest assured that each and every one was chosen very , VERY carefully .
The message is clear in this passage from their letter :
Meanwhile , colonels and generals have asked their bosses for more troops .
Service chiefs have asked for more money .
And all along , Rumsfeld has assured us that things are well in hand .
They 're telling us that the Administration has lied to us the whole time about EVERYTHING .
And the Generals will not tolerate it any longer .
They will not remain silent while more of our nation 's finest die for a lost cause - for a failed policy - for a doomed war effort .
The military has spoken .
They have made their demand .
I would not want to be George W. Bush on a good day .
And I certainly would not want to be him for the next four days .
No doubt the White House is calling in back - up plumbing specialists , because the Administration is collectively shitting bricks as we speak .
I would be , too , if I were them .
And yet I have confidence .
This is the best news of the election cycle , as far as I 'm concerned .
I am certain , my fellow Americans , that our generals agreed on a plan for what to do if Bush refuses their demand long before this editorial was written .
It gives me comfort to know that someone with our best interests in mind is now in control .
I never thought I 'd see the day - not in this country .
God help us all if Bush refuses .
::::
I say this not because I want to be alarmist .
Of course I am a bit , but these days you can't afford not to be .
No , I say this because the content , nature , and timing of this letter are simply unprecedented .
I do n't know what effect our generals intend , and I do n't know what response they intend either .
But I DO know that our generals , unlike our civilian leaders , do n't launch into uncharted territory without a plan .
And they do n't make demands like this ..... well , EVER .
So something is afoot .
The President has a choice .
He either submits to the demands of his generals , and the coup will be official .
Or , he refuses .
What they intend to do about that I do n't know , but you can bet it 's something .
And at the very least the political ramifications will be catastrophic .
If Bush refuses , it will set the stage , at a minimum , for impeachment .
Perhaps this is what our generals intended .
Methinks they may be signalling a willingness to attest to high crimes and misdemeanors , if not high treason , if the Democrats ask their opinion .
But whatever their intention is , we have a genuine crisis on our hands .
And not just a political one .
Update [ 2006-11-4 2:29:52 by Richard Carlucci ] ::
Thanks to everyone who has re-assured me that I 'm over - reacting .
It 's nice to be on the rec'd list , but it 's even nicer to know that so many others think I 'm probably off the mark on a subject as serious as this .
For the record , I never meant to imply a tanks - in - the - street Coup .
That will probably never happen in America .
But an editorial like this , coming out at this time , does n't get printed simultaneously in these magazines unless some very important Generals want to send a clear message that the President 's choice with respect to Rumsfeld is not in their interests .
This , I believe , is as close as it gets to a coup d'etat in America .
And frankly , I would n't want to get any closer .
I 'm just glad that the people who have our best interests in mind are finally willing to call the shots on Iraq , even if it means usurping their Commander in Chief .
That 's what I really see going on here .
The True Story Of Network Layering
And The Origin Of The OSI Model
Despite the success of the Internet in replacing all the previous attempts to build a global computer communication system , some engineers have n't updated their thinking from old descriptions of networks .
Instead , they still cling to the outdated 7 - layer reference model that was invented by ISO instead of the 5 - layer reference model that was invented for the Internet .
Interestingly , engineers who insist on using the older model cannot identify single protocol at layers 5 and 6 .
But ... because they learned the model somewhere in school , they desperately hope that the extra layers must be useful .
As a result , they incorrectly classify applications as layer 7 instead of layer 5 .
Researchers have begun looking into the origins and uses of the OSI 7 - layer reference model to determine why a cumbersome and inaccurate model has had such staying power .
They have recently uncovered some surprising facts .
We have known for a long time that the model was the work of a group .
We did not know , however , that the group met late one night in a bar and began making fun of American pop culture .
As it turns out , they started scribbling names of the seven dwarfs from the Disney movie on a paper cocktail napkin , and somebody joked that seven was a really good number for network layers .
The next morning at the standards committee meeting , the group passed around the cocktail napkin and generally agreed that that they had discovered something fundamental the previous night while they were drunk .
By the end of the day , they had renamed the seven layers ( with names that sounded more scientific ) , and produced the basic model .
Here 's the lineup and a bit of explanation :
Layer
Dwarf
Name
Explanations
1
Sleepy
Physical
The group new that physical connections are boring , and figured it might as well assign the physical layer to dwarf ``Sleepy ' ' .
As it happens , a Layer 1 protocol specification does indeed put everyone to sleep ( just try reading one late at night ) .
2
Sneezy
Link
If you monitor a network and watch the pattern of packets emitted by a computer , you 'll immediately understand the relationship between link - layer protocols and ``Sneezy ' ' .
3
Happy
Network
Everyone 's happy with the network layer .
Well ... to be honest , the only network layer protocol that makes everyone 's happy is the Internet Protocol .
Unfortunately , the Internet protocol is n't part of OSI , and was n't really built to follow the OSI model ( the model did n't include internetworking ) .
But , the designers had good intentions .
4
Doc
Transport
This one 's obvious -- it definitely takes a Ph.D. to understand the subtleties of a transport layer protocol .
5
Dopey
Session
Yep , even the designers realized that having a separate session layer is a dopey idea .
They decided to follow Disney 's approach of adding comic relief , so they stuck in a completely unnecessary layer and laughed about it .
6
Bashful
Presentation
Another little joke .
The designers realized that sooner or later someone would create a presentation layer protocol .
However , the group decided to classify such protocols as too ``bashful '' to appear in public .
So , even if a presentation protocol is produced , no one gets to see it .
7
Grumpy
Application
Programmers who design network applications are incredibly grumpy -- they complain about the efficiency of other layers , the fundamental abstractions of the network , the long hours , the difficulty of debugging , and the API they are forced to use .
And users add to the grumpiness because users never complain about protocols at other layers ; they only complain about applications .
Moral of the story :
If you 're an engineer working on a standards committee , avoid drinking with colleagues -- a bad joke you hatch late one night in the bar could turn out to haunt the industry for decades .

Fedex Cancels Airbus A380 Order , Defects to Boeing November 7 , 2006
Posted by Andrew in Airbus
Fedex , frustrated with delays in the Airbus A380 program , cancelled its order for ten of the aircraft in the freighter configuration early this morning .
Citing “ significant delays for delivery of A380s ” and a need to meet the growing global package demand , the freight carrier elected to purchase the Boeing 777 F instead of the much larger Airbus A380 aircraft .
In response to the largest blow dealt to the Airbus A380 program , an Airbus spokesman said that “ Airbus regrets FedEx ’s decision but understand [s ] their need to urgently address capacity issues . ”
Although Dubai - based Emirates has been threatening cancellation in recent months , Fedex is the first major carrier to follow through .
Fedex ’s cancellation came as a surprise to the aviation industry this morning ; United Parcel Service , the main competitor of Fedex was rumored to be considering a cancellation , but such an action was not expected from Memphis based Fedex .
The Boeing 777 F , scheduled to be first delivered in 2008 , is not seen as a replacement for the A380 .
The Boeing 777 F is of comparable size to the MD - 11 , the backbone of Fedex ’s widebody fleet .
With MD - 11 ’s becoming more difficult to acquire , many see Fedex ’s purchase of triple - sevens as a move to augment an aircraft size that serves the company well .
Fedex indicated that the decision to purchase the Boeing 777 freighter variant came as a result of the recently announced delays .
The freight company , an early proponent of the Airbus A380 program , noted however that it will continue “ to be Airbus ’ largest wide - body airplane customer and will add additional new and used Airbus wide - body aircraft to its fleet in the coming years . ”
Boeing did not comment on the recent deal , however investors rewarded the company by boosting its shares on news of the deal .

When facing a system crash or startup up problems on Windows Computers , troubleshooting the problem can be difficult to resolve .
The first step with recovery is to use Windows Safe Mode option during startup .
One Safe Mode option that will help troubleshoot boot problems is to enable Boot Logging which will create a log and help identify the device or driver that is causing the problem during startup .
When Boot Logging is enable , Windows boots normally , until the device or driver that is causing the problem either crashes the system or completes starting up but causes an error message in the Event Log .
While booting , Windows creates a log file that lists every step processed that is attempted and completed .
You can then reboot in to Safe Mode and review the log file named ntbootlog.
txt .
The log is stored in the %SYSTEMROOT % directory ( normally C: \Windows or C: \WINNT folder ) .
Below is an example of ntbootlog .
txt log file on Windows XP ( Vista log is similar ) :
Service Pack 2 5 4 2007 10:45:44.500

To enable Boot Logging on Windows XP and Vista , boot your Computer , and during startup continually press F8 until the menu screen appears :
NOTE : screen shot is from XP .
Vista menu will look slightly different than XP .
Press F8 to display the Advanced Menu screen and select Enable Boot Logging
You will be returned to the menu screen and you should see Enable Boot Logging in blue displayed at the bottom of the screen ( do n't worry if this screen is not displayed and Windows starts to boot ) :
If the problem does not cause Windows to crash , and after startup has completed , you can review the ntbootlog .
txt file .
Look for any signs of problems loading device drivers .
If you find problems , go into Device Manager and disable the device or uninstall the program , then reboot again .
If the problem does not occur then you know it was that device and you should check the vendor website for new drivers or known issues .
If your problem does cause Windows to crash , reboot into Safe mode by selecting Safe Mode from the Advanced Menu screen .
When reviewing ntbootlog . txt file , look for events that were attempted to load but not completed .
More than likely the problem will be toward the end of the file ( since that was the last item logged before crashing ) .
When you identify the problem , either uninstall the application or go in to Device Manager and disable the device .
Reboot your Computer and see if the problem still exist .
If it boots without crashing , check the vendor website for new drivers or known issues .
If you are still having problems , enable Boot Logging again to see if new events are logged after you have disabled the device or uninstalled the program .
If you are unable to fix the problem , you may need to have a Computer shop troubleshoot the problem for you .
Notes on Boot Logging :
In the jungles of India , local animal trappers have a new breed of client : Islamic militants using the trade in rare wildlife to raise funds for their cause .
Adrian Levy and Cathy Scott - Clark report from Assam
It is so early in the morning that the cooks in the roadside dhabas along India 's National Highway 37 are asleep in their kitchens , their tandoors unlit .
Across the valley of Assam , in this far north - easterly corner of India , there is not a flicker of light except the feeble yellow beams from the Gypsies , the open - backed vehicles carrying small groups of tourists to the edge of one of the world 's most bountiful jungles .
Kaziranga - 429 sq km of forest , sandbanks and grassland - was recognised by Unesco in 1985 as a world heritage site .
Tourists come in their thousands to glimpse some of the 480 species of bird , 34 kinds of mammal and 42 varieties of fish , many rare , endangered or near extinct , that inhabit this remote jungle .
In recent times , however , the wildlife has attracted a new kind of visitor .
According to India 's security services , police , intelligence analysts , local traders and forestry officials , Islamic militants affiliated to al - Qaida are sponsoring poaching in the reserve for profit .
These groups have established bases in the formerly moderate enclave of Bangladesh and have agents operating all along the country 's porous 2,500 - mile border with India .
They have gone into business with local animal trappers and organised crime syndicates around Kaziranga - as well as in parks and reserves in Nepal , Burma and Thailand - in a quest for horns , ivory , pelts and other animal products with which to raise " under the wire " funds that they can move around the world invisibly .
A small rhino horn , the size of a bag of sugar , with good provenance ( the beast 's tail and ears , presented to a prospective buyer ) and in the right marketplace ( in Asia , Europe or North America ) , can fetch £ 20,000 .
Big cat pelts can go for up to £ 10,000 .
Monkey brains , bear bile , musk , big cat carcasses , elephant feet , tails , horns and teeth have considerable value .
A shipment worth £ 2.8 m was recently intercepted by UK customs .
Profits from the trade run from $ 15 bn to an incredible $ 25 bn a year , according to estimates from the WWF ( formerly the World Wide Fund for Nature ) .
The punishment for trading in these items is generally a fine as low as £ 300 in India and £ 900 in Nepal .
A senior Indian security source , based in the north - east , who has tracked the incursion into the trade by Bangladeshi militants , warns that the poaching has global consequences .
" There is an environmental disaster in the offing here , but as pressing are the security ramifications , " he says .
" Only a minuscule percentage of the vast profits need to trickle back into a nascent Islamic insurgency in a country like Bangladesh to bring it to the boil .
And then it can reach out around the world . "
In 2000 , US president Bill Clinton commissioned " a global threat assessment " which concluded that the illegal trade in animal parts and endangered species was second only to drugs in the profits it could turn .
That same year , the UN general assembly expressed its strong conviction that the " transnational crime " of trafficking in endangered species had growing links with terrorism .
The WWF took up the baton and commissioned a report from Wolverhampton University that found organised crime was taking advantage of existing routes used for smuggling small arms , drugs and humans .
The UK scene was a microcosm , with 50 % of those prosecuted for wildlife crimes having previous convictions for serious offences including drugs and guns .
That 's if there is such a prosecution : ill - defined laws often prevent police making arrests .
British torpor was highlighted in London in 2004 , when customs intercepted a multimillion - pound ivory haul but were powerless to arrest anyone .
Meanwhile , radical Islamists from Bangladesh have done what conservationists had long predicted and moved in on the endangered species racket .
One has only to tour Kaziranga , or any of the outlying parks in Assam or Nepal , to understand why .
Dawn breaks as our convoy of Gypsies reaches the park .
The rangers whisper urgently , " Gorh " , the local word for rhinoceros .
Metres away , eight rhino are lumbering through the rich alluvial mud , showing off their prized uni-horn .
There are more than 2,000 of these short - sighted beasts here , making up three - quarters of the global stock of one of the rarest pachyderms in the world .
Beside them are scores of swamp deer coloured like the scrub .
A group of wild buffalo , whose colossal horns have the span of a longboat oar , plod by , as does a troop of elephants , their tusks glinting in the purple dawn .
Somewhere in the long grass , which rises in clumps like a castle keep , are more Royal Bengal tigers per square kilometre than in any other stretch of jungle in the world - broken down into their constituent parts , each is worth as much as a bespoke Italian racing car .
The gangs hired to trap and kill in Kaziranga are said by forestry staff to camp on the vast sand bars created by the flow of the Brahmaputra river .
The river here is at least a kilometre wide and we haggle with a man paddling a wooden canoe to take us across .
But as soon as it dawns on him where we intend to go , he backs out of the deal .
" I will not go there , " he says .
" The people who live there will skin me alive . "
He offers to rent us his boat instead , and with our driver , a migrant from the impoverished state of Bihar , we launch ourselves into the water .
The nearest sand bar is clearly visible , but so vicious are the currents that it takes two hours to reach it .
As we near , people who look more like Saharan Touaregs than Assamese run towards the shore , waving hunting rifles .
Trapped in a swirling eddy , we can't decide what to do .
From the sand bar , they pelt the canoe with stones .
The Bihari driver , who understands what they 're saying , starts screaming .
The canoe pitches and rolls as we try to calm him .
He takes a deep breath and addresses the angry crowd : " These are only here for talking .
Please ...
These bring gifts .
Not the police . "
We hold up baskets of fruit , bags of nuts and sweets .
The sand bar dwellers lower their weapons and motion us ashore .
We climb the bank and at the crest of the dune see there are hundreds of them , living in an improvised encampment .
We want to know about life on the sand bar , we say , passing round the food .
They shrug , munching .
One man offers : " We are people who have few rights . "
Another agrees : " We are poor and we do what we can . "
Does that include poaching ?
Has anyone trapped animals from Kaziranga ?
Now everyone is eating and nearly all the hands shoot into the air .
One man says , " We are for hire .
We can trap and shoot , but when the summer rain comes , the river breaks its banks and the animals float to us . "
Another adds , " We patrol the park 's border , too ; when the animals wander out , we are there . "
He pulls from his pocket an unidentifiable animal claw .
These sand bar dwellers at the start of the tangled enterprise know far more about the intricacies of the business than the authorities told us they would .
They draw trafficking routes in the sand , explaining how the trade is coordinated by agents across Assam .
A villager places stones on the sand - map to mark the towns .
" Golaghat , Tezpur , Kamrup , Nagaon , these are the main places for agents . "
They answer to a boss based in Dimapur , one of the richest cities in the neighbouring state of Nagaland , with a highway that runs into Burma and rail links to New Delhi and Calcutta .
" But everything tends to collect and move through Siliguri , " a villager says , identifying a chaotic city in West Bengal which is also a springboard into the Himalayan kingdoms of Nepal and Bhutan .
What do they poach ?
" Whatever we can and whatever we are asked for . "
The money is in rhino horn and elephant tusks , the latter taking advantage of a black hole in the forestry department 's record - keeping .
While the rhino population remains closely monitored , no accurate records are kept for elephants .
The forestry department estimates that 170 were poached over a six - year period , but the sand bar people claim a figure almost double that .
From whom do they take orders ?
The villagers look stony - faced .
They talk among themselves .
" The Tibetans and Chinese are big men in this , " says one , " but we are all from Bangladesh .
Bangladeshis dominate the network now . "
Are they talking only about those living in India , or about orders coming from over the border , too ?
They shrug and mumble , clearly distressed .
We should talk to an agent they name in a nearby city .
They can not tell us any more .
In nearby Tezpur , the wildlife trade agent turns out to be a rich local jeweller , but he is tight - lipped and refers us to his boss in another town .
This boss , who runs a local hotel , says he can't talk without clearance from the bhai , the big boss in Siliguri .
After 10 hours on the broken highway , we find his modest house in a chaotic suburb .
Over plates of daal - fry , bread and curd , he tells us he is a haulier , shipping freight over the border with Bangladesh , but also " a man of many hats .
One hat , you could say , is in animals .
I move a lot of everything : elephant ivory , cat skins , musk deer , bear gall bladders , rhino horn , live leopard cubs that are sent to Nepal , Burma and then into Thailand .
The prices we pay are so low , the profit margins are healthy . "
He opens both arms expansively , as if demonstrating the size of a fish .
" We can get a snow leopard pelt for $ 1,000 and sell it for 10 times that .
Ivory can be bought for as little as $ 200 a kilo and sold for 100 times this . "
He munches on a red onion as a glass of milk poured straight from a churn froths in front of him on the table .
How did he get involved ?
The wildlife trade in the town took off in 1983 , he says , when old trafficking networks in Calcutta were effectively shut down by the police .
The Siliguri police confirm that soon after this , a stash of horns was discovered , tipping them off to the town 's new business .
But it was not until 1995 that the local authorities grasped the scale of the racket when , in the first operation of its kind in India , an entire syndicate trading in rhino horn was rolled up and found to have members in China , Taiwan and Tibet .
" But these police successes were few and far between , " claims the haulier , showing us his gleaming new trucks and his home - the first in town to have a flat - screen TV , now with one in every room .
He is happy to talk , and calls colleagues to confirm his stories .
Eventually we ask who 's behind the Bangladeshi business .
" Where , not who , " he says and points to Bangladesh .
" Religious men hold the purse strings now .
The business has changed .
Their agents came to see us .
They want a low - risk business . "
A trader from Siliguri with betel - red teeth tells the same story .
" This was a Chinese business but now it 's Bangladesh 's business .
It 's become God 's work , " he says , raising an eyebrow .
" And , as you know , the Prophet , peace be upon his head , is irresistible . "
It all began two years ago .
Says the haulier , " A friend in common at a local mosque [ in West Bengal ] passed me a message saying representatives working for two militia groups in Bangladesh wanted a meet in a madrassah [ seminary ] in Siliguri . "
A trader with an import - export company near to the India - Bangladesh border explains : " They came to us because we are the same as them , " he says .
" The hauliers and money men behind the wildlife trade are of Bangladeshi origin .
The poachers , too .
All of us can move freely over the border .
We look right .
Talk the same .
They wanted in .
Small , valuable commodities - horn , teeth , pelts - fetch incredible prices and are easy to conceal among legitimate export goods .
Also , something truly valuable can be used to borrow against , to secure a line of credit . "
The traditional methods by which anyone wishing to raise and transport money invisibly were through nominal charities , the gold market and the global unofficial banking system known as hawala .
But these were heavily disrupted after September 11 2001 , the traders say .
New channels were needed .
Three of those who claimed to have been at the meeting two years ago say they knew exactly whom the agents worked for in Bangladesh : Al Mujahideen , an obscure jihadist umbrella organisation governing a panoply of militant groups that have sprung up in Bangladesh in recent years .
Two in particular , both banned by the Bangladeshi government , were in need of money and eager to get into the racket , said Siliguri traders .
One was Harkat - ul - Jihad - al - Islami ( HuJI ) , allegedly linked to al - Qaida ; the second was Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh ( JMB ) , whose leader , Shaikh Abdur Rahman , had joined Bin Laden 's World Islamic Front for the Jihad Against the Jews and the Crusaders in 1998 .
He was captured in Bangladesh and in March was hanged for the killing of two Bangladeshi judges and for nationwide bombings in 2005 .
A 147 million - strong , predominantly Muslim state , Bangladesh was once renowned for its religious and ethnic tolerance .
Then , six years ago , Jamaat - e - Islami , a radical Islamic party , was elected as a coalition partner in the ruling government .
Extremists , especially the HuJI and JMB , have already been accused of a string of terrorist attacks .
In June 2001 , former prime minister Sheikh Hasina was injured when an explosion killed 20 and injured 300 at a rally in Dhaka .
On May 21 2004 , Anwar Choudhury , the British ambassador to Bangladesh , was targeted in a bomb blast that claimed the lives of three others , including his bodyguard .
In January 2005 , the former finance minister and four other opposition activists were killed and 70 people injured when a grenade was thrown during a meeting in the north .
Some graduates from terrorist training camps run by the HuJI were recently arrested , suspected of plotting a coordinated wave of 459 explosions that detonated across Bangladesh on August 17 2005 .
There is already an international dimension , too .
After the fall of Kabul in 2001 , in a now notorious incident , the MV Mecca , a boat loaded with 150 Taliban and al - Qaida cadres , was said by Bangladeshi intelligence sources to have anchored off the country 's Chittagong port , where small boats ferried them ashore .
The Indonesian authorities raised concerns about the direction Bangladesh was taking after interrogating " Hambali " , the leader of Indonesia 's militant Jemaah Islamiya group , who was arrested in Thailand in connection with the Bali bombings in August 2002 .
Hambali , currently in US custody at Guantánamo Bay , allegedly admitted having made plans to shift part of his organisation to Bangladesh as life got more difficult at home .
Earlier this year India said it had intelligence connecting Bangladeshi militant groups with some of those behind the Mumbai train blasts of July 11 2006 , in which more than 100 people died and 700 were injured .
India also claims that on January 4 this year , two Bangladeshi nationals , who admitted belonging to HuJI , were arrested in New Delhi carrying 1.42kg of explosives , four electronic detonators and two hand grenades thought intended for the Republic Day celebrations .
The Indian security services officer we interviewed says , " There has been a significant migration from Bangladesh , with tens of millions fleeing to expatriate communities abroad .
Poverty has helped radicalise them and we have put to your government our concern that the increasingly ambitious militant groups in Bangladesh are aiming to incite the exiles and so broaden the jihad - as Pakistani groups did in Britain . "
This warning was echoed by Bruce Riedel , a former director on Clinton 's National Security Council , at a conference in the US in February .
" After September 11 , " he said , " al - Qaida determined it would be increasingly difficult to bring Arab or South Asian operatives into the [ West ] on Arab or South Asian passports .
They needed to look for a new mechanism in order to move operatives around .
They found it , for example , in the large Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities in the United Kingdom .
Those communities turned out to have a significant , albeit small , minority of radicals who could be encouraged to perform al - Qaida 's dirty work for it .
Since those people had as a birthright a British passport , they had relatively easy access into the UK and out , and into the US and back into Pakistan . "
In Kaziranga , an anti-poaching patrol prepares to leave : 16 men , nine carbines , rope , machetes , plastic sheeting - and eight elephants .
Only elephants are capable of navigating the sodden terrain .
As we move forward , the canopy overhead thickens .
There is a micro-climate beneath the tree tops ; a humid mizzle generated by the perspiring vegetation folds around us .
Clouds of pinprick flies swarm , irritating everything they touch .
Creepers with blood - red scales snag skin and clothing ; high above our heads , amid a bouquet of jungle orchids , red spiders have trapped a nectar - hunting bird .
No one lingers too long .
Small mistakes here have grave results .
Fall over and the soupy air prevents a scab forming ; toxic spores blossom in an open wound .
None of us dares drop litter or personal possessions , not just because the jungle is pristine but because we do not want to leave a trail for predators .
By five it is dark .
We have seen nothing suspicious , but the thick vegetation obscures everything .
There is a strange drumming in the mud up ahead .
It sounds like digging .
The branches crackle .
No tour parties are allowed this far in .
Anyone we encounter will have to shoot their way out because they know the park rangers will fire on them first .
The elephants rip into the undergrowth , the rangers raise their rifles .
We reach the banks of a vast lagoon and catch sight of something skimming away from us .
It might be a canoe , or an animal .
The rangers mutter .
They fear it is poachers .
One lets loose a shot out of frustration .
Timid wildfowl tear out of the undergrowth , shrieking , setting off the bar - headed geese , which clatter and flap over the water .
A lame Chinook clips the trees , shaking up a colony of ring - tailed macaques ; they go off like car alarms .
Osprey , kites and fish eagles .
Wigeons , pigeons , shovellers and barbets .
Shrikes , thrushes and bronzed drongos .
Names of birds , inelegant and bizarre , are whispered by the mahouts , who identify everything they see as if constantly making an inventory of the jungle that is now at screaming pitch .
A radio crackles .
It is the rangers ' HQ calling .
Miles away , with the electricity supply cut again , the duty officer huddles by a loudspeaker powered by a car battery .
Next door , Central Range chief Dharanidhar Boro sits at his table , a bowl of rice in front of him .
He is one of the most vigorous of the park 's rangers charged with disrupting the poaching .
But he is exhausted .
Boro is an awkward man .
He does not drink or get stoned when all around him do .
He believes in straight talking .
" We can not stop but it is difficult sometimes to go on .
We are up against it .
This is hard , hard work .
We have to be merciless .
This is a war for survival . "
He pulls from a cabinet a photo album .
On the first page is a picture of a corpse splattered by shotgun fire .
" I killed this man as he prepared to stake out a rhino . "
He turns the pages and points to another corpse , its entrails dangling like ship 's bunting .
" I killed this one , too , as he sawed at a rhino 's horn . "
There are scores more photographs picturing the dead laid out like mackerel .
We ask him about the new jihadi component in the trade .
" We hear things but we have no hard facts .
The rhino horns are used to buy guns and bombs , we are told .
The guys we catch , what can they tell us ?
The colour of the shirt worn by the guy who paid them off . "
In December , Boro 's men tracked a gang of poachers to their tents .
They had fled but left behind a new , modern tranquilliser gun and darts .
" They used to shoot at rhinos , but the crack of the bullet is a problem as it carries far and we will hear .
Some place poison .
Others pull down power lines and try to electrocute the animals .
However , recently they have come here with silencers .
We are finding increasingly sophisticated weapons . "
The poaching figures for Kaziranga were stark until very recently .
As many as 48 rhinos a year were being killed for their horn , a figure comparable to about 2 % of the total population in Assam .
The state is classified as a " disturbed area " , with a stubborn and often bloody secessionist movement desperate to break free from New Delhi .
Militants have been fighting for 27 years and 10,000 lives have been lost .
Recently , as peace talks began , there was a lull , then an insurgency blew up in Nepal .
Boro says , " Through better organisation among the rangers and better stability in Assam , the gangs laid off us and started attacking Nepal , which also has rhino . "
Then he adds dourly , " We can not count on peace . "
Shortly before we arrived in Assam in February , seven Hindi - speaking labourers were shot dead at one of the state 's brick kilns .
A railway bridge was blown up , just missing a crowded train .
Masked gunmen attacked six labourers ' colonies in the northern districts of Dibrugarh and Tinsukia , killing 48 Indian settlers .
Another eight people , including police officers , died when their vehicle hit a roadside mine in the central Karbi Anglong district .
It was the state 's worst violence in a decade , all the killings perpetrated by the United Liberation Front of Assam .
An indefinite curfew was imposed while the Indian security forces combed the jungle for rebel camps and forest rangers hid themselves among the trees , waiting , resignedly , for the opportunists to arrive .
Whether it's an independence struggle in Assam or an al - Qaida terror campaign , the outlook is perilous for the wildlife of Kaziranga .

Who 's ' micromanaging ' Iraq ?
It depends Posted by Frank James at 9:18 am CDT
An oft - repeated line of attack by President Bush and other Republicans against Congress 's majority party is that congressional Democrats seeking to impose a timeline for U.S. operations in Iraq want to tell generals what to do .
" I believe strongly that politicians in Washington should n't be telling generals how to do their job , " President Bush told said into the news cameras Monday .
A related Republican charge against Democrats is that the party that controls Congress wants to " micromanage " the war .
The word is said with such constancy it 's a verbal confetti now landing all over the place in Washington , on talk shows , everywhere .
One could hope that all of this would trigger an informative public debate about the proper role and nature of civilian control over the military in American democracy .
So far , it has n't .
Clearly the president does n't really believe Washington politicians should n't tell generals how to do their jobs since he himself is a Washington politician who just also happens to be commander - in - chief .
Among the widely acknowledged strengths of the American Republic is the historic subordination of the military to civilian rule required by the U.S. Constitution .
The Founding Fathers would 've wholeheartedly agreed with French statesman Georges Clemenceau that " war is too important to be left to the generals . "
While some academics have expressed concern over what they view as a troubling assertiveness among the top military brass in recent years , especially during the Clinton Presidency when Gen.
Colin Powell was accused of doing end - runs around the president , that 's nowhere near to saying that the military has become an independent and rogue part of the government .
In fact , the U.S. military prides itself on upholding its constitutional obligation to abide by civilian authority .
Of course , there 've been famous cases of insubordination , such as when President Abraham Lincoln would urge Gen.
George McClellan to attack Confederate forces only to have the general blithely ignore him .
Or when President Harry Truman had to fire Gen. Douglas MacArthur , who wanted to attack China during the Korean War when Truman did n't , for openly defying him .
So Bush must mean something much different such as Washington politicians , like those in Congress , should n't be setting military strategy , that it 's the province of the president in his role as commander - in - chief to do so .
In that , the president has a strong case .
In American history , it is the president who usually sets military strategy or oversees it , signs off on the military 's operational plans , replaces generals and so on .
Congress has usually only been able to exert its influence on the president 's exercise of his role as commander - in - chief through the power of the purse and as a Congressional Research Service report indicates it 's only had limited success in doing that since 1970 .
If congressional Democrats really want to end the U.S. military 's involvement in what they say is a growing Iraqi civil war , history argues that they 'll have to go the route of stopping funding .
But congressional Democrats clearly do n't have the votes now to do that .
Even if they did , there 'd be skittishness about such a move since it would leave them politically exposed to the powerfully damaging charge of abandoning U.S. troops during wartime .
Which is why Congress will be debating and voting today and tomorrow on legislation that merely suggests a timetable for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq .
The micromanaging allegation of Republicans is interesting because it is exactly the charge retired generals leveled at Pentagon civilians , including former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , before the Iraq War started and throughout until he was forced out late last year .
For instance , this from a story published in the Washington Post on March 30 , 2003 , shortly after the war started .
More than a dozen officers interviewed , including a senior officer in Iraq , said Rumsfeld took significant risks by leaving key units in the United States and Germany at the start of the war .
That resulted in an invasion force that is too small , strung out , underprotected , undersupplied and awaiting tens of thousands of reinforcements who will not get there for weeks .
" The civilians in [ Rumsfeld 's office ] vetoed the priority and sequencing of joint forces into the region -- as it was requested by the war fighters -- and manipulated it to support their priorities , " said an officer who asked not to be quoted by name .
" When they did this , it de-synchronized not only the timing of the arrival of people and their organic equipment , but also the proper mix of combat , combat support and combat support units . "
Retired Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey , who commanded the 24th Infantry Division during the 1991 Persian Gulf War , said yesterday that he told a senior member of Rumsfeld 's staff shortly before the war that the secretary 's office had to stop meddling in the deployment process and let Army commanders have the units they believed they needed to fight the war .
Rumsfeld , McCaffrey said , " sat on each element for weeks and wanted an explanation for every unit called up out of the National Guard and Reserve , and argued about every 42 - man maintenance detachment .
Why would a businessman want to deal with the micromanagement of the force ?
The bottom line is , a lack of trust that these Army generals knew what they were doing . "
Three years later , in 2006 Lt. Gen. Charles Swannack , former head of the 82nd Airborne , joined the growing chorus of retired generals accusing Rumsfeld of gumming up the works in Iraq by meddling .
This from an April 2006 report on CNN 's website : Swannack is critical of Rumsfeld 's management style .
" Specifically , I feel he has micromanaged the generals who are leading our forces there , " Swannack said in the telephone interview .
" And I believe he has culpability associated with the Abu Ghraib prison scandal and , so , rather than admitting these mistakes , he continually justifies them to the press ... and that really disallows him from moving our strategy forward . "
Swannack , who served more than 30 years in the Army , said part of the problem at the Pentagon is
Rumsfeld 's system of promoting senior leaders .
" If you understand what Secretary Rumsfeld has done in his time in the Pentagon , he personally is the one who selects the three - star generals to go forward to the president for the Senate to confirm . "
Swannack also criticized the way the war was being run before he retired .
Of course , President Bush steadfastly defended Rumfeld against micromanagement and other charges , ad did congressional Republicans , until after last year 's mid-term elections .
So could it be one conclusion to take away from this is that micromanaging , like beauty , is all in the eye of he beholder ?

It is not the role of Congress to run a war -- constitionally nor a matter of common sense .
The president is commander in chief and the generals run the field operstions .
Congress should stay out and let the generals and president do their thing .

John D :
That sentiment was followed to the letter for the past 4 years , and it 's gotten us into a fairly lousy spot .
Congress gave Bush a blank check , Bush ( supposedly ) listed to the " generals in the field , " and we 're in the middle of a civil war , spending hundreds of billions and destroying hundreds of thousands of lives .
So do tell :
Is this situation a result of your structural argument above , or a result of incompetence carrying it out ?
Since you 're advocating that the structure is proper ( I agree ) , then it must be because of incompetence in carrying it out .
The best solution would be for Bush to muster the patriotism and integrity to resign .
Since he lacks both those characteristics , we know Bush wo n't resign .
That being the case , is it all that unreasonable to suggest that allowing Bush to maintain control and make decisions will be a recipe for continued failure ?
Posted by : a blinkin | Apr 25 , 2007 10:38:52 AM
So , would it be far to say that Congress ( Republicans and Democrats alike ) , and good ol ' Rumsfield , were " micromanaging " the war when then agreed on the budget that only allowed 100,000 troops in 2003 , when the generals were asking for funding for 400,000 troups ?
How to run the war , and whether to end the war are apples and oranges .
Micromanagement means telling generals which tank to drive in which direction .
Funding a war is about deciding whether or not to get into the war or to leave the war .
Let 's not spin the words .
The is article is nothing but more political rhetoric .
Americans , especially our soldiers , deserve to know the truth .

Setting time limits in which to conclude a task is not micromanaging .
A Board of Directors says to management , achieve X by Y date or we 'll have to go to Plan B ; management does not accomplish the task by Y date , so the Board moves on to Plan B. Congress is the Board of Directors , Bush is the Commander in Chief ( of only the military , not the nation , see Constitution ) , and Petreas and his troops will or will not accomplish the task by the deadline .
Not a whiff of micromanaging here .
Posted by : Craig Sparks | Apr 25 , 2007 10:47:13 AM
As usual , the press are telling the wrong story here .
The ' micromanagement ' of a war is Republican political cover for the actual story that senator Reid , the majority of the Democrats and a significant majority of the American public ( public opinion , remember that ? ) , want this war to end .
The actual ' management ' of war has always been to the generals .
Politicians are debating policy .

If the President was competent to direct the war , Congress would let him do it .
But he 's not , and therefore it is Congress 's duty to do what it can do extricate our nation from the incredible mess that it 's in .
Bush 's cannot afford to admit failure , because his bald - faced denial of reality is the only thing keeping him in office .
That means that Americans and Iraqis will continue dying to save Bush 's political face until at least 2009 , unless Congress forces Bush 's hand .

" The President is to be commander - in - chief of the army and navy of the United States .
In this respect his authority would be nominally the same with that of the king of Great Britain , but in substance much inferior to it .
It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces , as first General and admiral of the Confederacy ; while that of the British king extends to the DECLARING of war and to the RAISING and REGULATING of fleets and armies , all which , by the Constitution under consideration , would appertain to the legislature . "
Federalist 69 , by Alexander Hamilton http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/federal/fed69.htm
The problem is n't that Congress is asserting its authority .
The problem is that for far too long the Congress has failed to assert its authority .
Control over war was given to the Congress and denied to the president by design and for good reasons .
It 's also disingenuous nonsense for Bush to talk about the how Congress is going against the generals .
Bush is the one who has chosen the current course of action - and he had to replace generals who did n't agree with the strategy in order to have the strategy adopted .
Bush ( or his political machine , for which he is responsible ) has micromanaged the war , Bush has micromanaged the governance of Iraq .
The Congress should concentrate on what is best for the United States .
A victory of some sort may still be possible - but Bush is not headed for that and never will be .
Bush will sabotage ( to the detriment of the country ) any effort in Congress to find and then implement an intelligent strategy in Iraq and against the terrorists .
Why is it so hard for the press and media to see and say that Bush in plainly not interested in " victory in Iraq . "
Bush 's interest is in his broader neocon strategy .
Leaving aside the immorality of that strategy it should be clear by now that Bush is not competent to implement that strategy .
Look at Iraq .
Bush has created a failure .
He wo n't do better if he succeeds in widening the war to include Iran .

Well said .
I have been waiting for someone in the press to come to this realization that in our democracy it is the civilians through their elected representives ( politicians ) that decide when we commit our people to combat .
This authority necessary includes when they should cease combat operations .
What they do when they are engaged is , of course , up to the military leadership up to the commander in chief .
In this case the military mission has been accomplished .
Bring our people home !
The people command it !!!!

Congress does not have executive powers for 1 reason .
Just look at all the bickering .
Let the generals do their job and let it be .
Try reporting the good news instead of demorilizing .
BTW - I think this war was a massive mistake .
We should elect a Dem who has 20 /20 hindsight vision .
That will solve everything .
And W is a bad president , but I do n't like him for different reasons than the libs .
Peace is obtained through superior firepower .
You will never win the hearts and minds of these people .
Hmm .
We wonder why Sadaam was such a harsh ruler .

We are witnessing the " blame game " from Bush and his troglodyte supporters , in the face of a collapsing game plan .
As Bush continues to support incompetence on the part of Gonzales and Rumsfeld , he blames the Democrats to cover his own grotesque failures of policy .
In today 's stories , you can read about supposedly inaccurate body counts coming out of Iraq , likely influenced by Bush 's team seeking to make things look better than they are .
This reminds me of Westmoreland inflating enemy body counts in Vietnam , and being found out , and the damage that ensued .
You can also find a discussion of the fact that the new military policy is increasing the risks to our troops , as spreading them out makes them more reliant on Iraqi military support .
Hence , our higher recent body counts , as the insurgents attack smaller outposts .
Bush 's best " weapon " in all of this becomes Cheney 's continual lies and bluster , as the country watches things slide downhill .
Posted by : pb | Apr 25 , 2007 10:57:13 AM
So Doug Zook , you 're saying that since the Republicans screwed it up by meddling that the Democrats should have a hand in screwing it up too ?
You know , just to be fair ?
Posted by : Christopher | Apr 25 , 2007 10:58:48 AM
If Congress wants to stop this war and bring the Army home then do it .
Cut the funding and get on with it .
Let 's see some leadership , evidently politics and getting re-elected trumps everything else in the hallowed halls of Congress .
The Dems and the Reps. are both of guility of getting us into this war , they should have the grace to finish it and finish it well .
Posted by : Don A. | Apr 25 , 2007 11:00:57 AM
What will win the war in Iraq ?
I have yet to hear a measurable goal out of the generals or presidents office .
Personally I want this war to end and hope that the legislature has the courage to force president Bush to end the war by denying him funding .
The one pause this gives me is the precious human military lives caught in the balance while the president and congress play chicken over an illegal war .
Our current military actions are eroding the might and spirit of our armed forces .

All this debate would have some value if indeed we were at war .
This is the Wizard of Oz that the administration has so successfully hidden behind the curtain of disinformation , doublespeak and all - out lying .
There is no war , which is why the people in Guantanamo are n't called POWs , they 're called " enemy combatants . "
There is no war , because nobody but the Bushies and their piggly wiggly friends in industry fattening themselves at the slop bucket of diverted " war " funds want us to be in Iraq .
The whole thing is a scheme to bring Bush and his friends money and power .
What else is new in the course of human events ?
The only thing new is the breathtaking scale of the deception , and the stubborn myopia of so many people who refuse to see it because it threatens their idyllic concept of what this nation represents .

This is a well - written article .
Kudos to Frank James !
The Democrats are playing with fire , by threatening to cut - off funds for American troops in combat .
The Republicans are looking for a scapegoat , to blame for losing the Iraq War ; Harry Reid seems to be auditioning for the role .
A better approach might be to introduce a Resolution that would recant much of the articulated falsehoods and misguided rhetoric that found its way into the Joint Resolution that authorized Bush to use deadly force in Iraq .
I say , give the president all the rope that he asks for , he is hanging himself and the Republican Party .
The Democrats should give Bush all the money that he requests , while solemnly vowing to stop this tragic nonsense , if they retake the Executive Branch in 2008 .
Posted by : new_york_loner | Apr 25 , 2007 11:05:22 AM
So we should allow the President to continue to mis-manage the war ?
Let 's be real .
Congress , including leading Democrats , deferred to the president for several years .
He and his administration have clearly demonstrated that they did not warrant that trust .
Having been patient to a fault , congress is now telling Bush that he must bring this War of Error to a close .
If Bush makes a mess of the withdrawal by failing to cooperate , it is his fault .
He should not be allowed to use the armed forces as hostages .
Posted by : RF | Apr 25 , 2007 11:07:39 AM
Oh yes , Dems should stop micro-managing , especially given how awful their ideas are .
Trying to make sure troops are fully - trained , fully - rested , and fully - equipped before sent into action ?
Suggesting that leaving them in the crossfire of a civil war might not be a good idea ?
Crazy talk , all of it .

Thank you for your patience .

On a chilly January evening , police officer Abdullah Dadgar is giving his new partner a tour of Oakland 's notorious east side .
" There was a shooting in front of that liquor store , guys firing AK - 47s , " he says , steering his squad car past dilapidated buildings and sidewalks strewn with refuse .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
A few moments later : " There was a homicide in that alley over there . "
Then : " The Norteños had a gang war around this area . "
He goes silent for a while and adds as an afterthought , " There 's been a shooting spree on pretty much every block we just passed . "
Dadgar 's partner shifts uncomfortably in the passenger seat .
He stares wide - eyed at the gangbangers and prostitutes congregated on every other corner .
Occasionally he glances down at the Panasonic Toughbook in his lap .
A computer programmer who recently moved to California from China , Stanley Bai has never been in a police car before .
He 's riding along tonight to test a new software program .
The computer is running the mobile version of a gunshot - location system .
If someone discharges a firearm within Dadgar 's patrol area , sensors scattered around the neighborhood will pick up the sound , enabling a central server to determine its origin and relay the information to Bai 's laptop .
Oakland dispatchers have been using the system , known as ShotSpotter , for a couple of months , but this is the first time that ShotSpotter alerts have been routed directly to a laptop on the street .
Oakland police are in dire need of this kind — or any kind — of assistance .
The city saw a 68 percent jump in homicides last year , for a total of 148 deaths .
Last August , officials hauled away illegally parked cars and painted over gang tags in the most troubled areas , hoping that a crackdown on petty crime would hold the line against violent crimes , as well .
It did n't work .
The next month , 19 people were shot to death .
So the police decided to take a high tech approach to the problem .
In October , the department spent $ 350,000 to install 84 ShotSpotter sensors on rooftops , utility poles , and other inconspicuous places over 6 square miles of urban blight .
Since then , dispatchers have received roughly a dozen automatic alerts every day , each one an opportunity to get officers to the scene of a shooting while the gun is still smoking .
The system is so new that the department has n't yet worked out procedures for integrating it into standard operations .
The top brass is nervous about sending officers into the line of fire without taking time to call in reinforcements .
So , rather than immediately routing ShotSpotter reports to patrol cars , dispatchers have been letting the alerts stack up along with other second - priority calls .
But technology moves faster than bureaucracy , and the mobile upgrade has arrived ahead of revised protocols .
The software Dadgar is testing tonight routes information around the dispatchers , letting the cops themselves decide how to handle ShotSpotter alerts .
Just last week , Dadgar 's lieutenant counseled him to treat every alert like he was going up against a sniper with a rifle .
Do n't rush to the scene alone .
Wait for backup .
Preoccupied with a half - dozen critical tasks — watching the street , checking suspicious vehicles , deciphering a constant stream of radio chatter — Dadgar pays little attention to the ShotSpotter interface .
Cops love a good piece of equipment , but they 're looking for utility .
They 'll talk at length about the merits of a Surefire LED flashlight over the conventional Maglite , which can break a bulb if it 's dropped , or about the simple design of the Glock 22 .
To earn respect , a piece of gear must work reliably when officers are " raised up " — that is , when life is on the line , adrenaline is surging , and every split second counts .
At exactly 9:01:22 pm , Bai 's laptop sounds a whooping alarm .
" It 's saying it heard a single gunshot , " Bai says .
Dadgar pulls over and studies the laptop 's display , a street map overlaid upon a high - quality aerial photo .
A red dot shows where the shot was fired — just a few blocks away .
Then Bai clicks on a button to play back a recording of the incident .
" That 's a gunshot , " the officer confirms .
He radios for backup and hits the gas .
As the car speeds down narrow streets , Bai grips his laptop and watches the software go to work .
A little police car icon moves closer to the red dot , and the program automatically zooms in on the location .
The Google Earth style aerial photo gives Dadgar a bird 's - eye view of the neighborhood , down to backyards and hidden alleys .
The squad car reaches the scene within minutes , but the shooter seems to be gone .
Driving slowly , Dadgar shines his spotlight along the hedges .
Finding neither perpetrator nor victim , he radios a code four , calling off the sirens that are quickly closing in .
Dadgar stops the car and takes a closer look at the laptop .
" I 'd ride with this piece of equipment , " he says , nodding his approval .
But should n't he have waited for backup ?
" With this technology , it 's kind of like hearing the gunshots yourself .
You 're going to want to respond . "
Sitting in front of five computer screens at ShotSpotter headquarters in Santa Clara , California , field application engineer Dana Kirsch is conducting a virtual flyover of US crime capitals .
She pulls up an aerial image of Gary , Indiana , its grid marred by 15 crimson dots , each representing gunfire picked up by sensors during the previous week .
Then the so - called " fatal crescent " district of Rochester , New York , bearing 23 dots ; Washington , DC , 33 dots ; and finally Oakland , with a chilling 111 blood - red marks .
Even viewed from a few thousand feet in the sky , these places look downtrodden .
Vehicles languish in dirt front yards .
Vacant lots stand out like missing teeth .
On the map of Washington , DC , Kirsch points out an apartment complex where four shootings took place in less than 12 hours .
Four separate reports appear on a numbered list .
Each item includes the time , nearest address , and incident type — single or multiple gunshots , firecrackers , bottle rockets , and other sound sources .
She selects a report from the list and a graph appears showing the sound 's waveform .
She plays back the four recordings in turn : three sets of multiple shots and one single round .
The series of five fired at 11:27 pm are close together .
They sound hurried .
All too often , a shooter does n't need to rush .
A quarter to a half hour can pass before police respond to a call reporting gunfire — if anyone calls at all .
Many shots fired in urban areas go unreported .
When sheriff 's officers in the Willowbrook neighborhood of Los Angeles County tested the system , they fired boxfuls of blanks and live rounds in nine separate areas .
Hardly anyone noticed .
The patrolmen shake their heads when they tell the story , repeating the key details : nine locations — more than 100 rounds discharged — and only a single phone call .
They reckon that citizens are either distrustful of the police , fearful of retaliation , or simply inured to the frank pop pop pop of gunfire .
Even if someone does report hearing gunfire , the chance of identifying the location and catching the perpetrator is remote .
Echoing off walls and masked by other noises , the sound 's origin can be difficult to place .
That 's where ShotSpotter comes in .
" In the past , the best information the police could hope for was a neighbor calling to say , ‘ Sorry to bother you , but there may have been a shooting somewhere in my neighborhood , ' " says ShotSpotter CEO James Beldock .
" Our system can immediately tell them that , say , 11 rounds were fired from a car going 9 miles an hour , northbound , in front of a specific address on Main Street .
In some situations , ShotSpotter could get someone on the scene within a minute .
That 's a level of situational knowledge police have never had . "
This kind of coverage requires an array of 12 to 20 specialized sensors per square mile .
Roughly the size of a medium pizza and designed to look like a rooftop fan , each sensor contains up to four small microphones .
If one of these units detects a loud noise , it forwards a recording to a server at police headquarters along with three pieces of information : location , time , and general direction the sound came from .
If a sound is detected by only one sensor , it 's probably too quiet to be gunfire , and in any case , the system needs data from three sensors to pinpoint the location of a noise .
If several sensors report an event at the same time , the server gets to work .
First , the software performs an analysis to categorize the noise as gunfire , firecrackers , bottle rockets , helicopters , or other .
If it determines the event was a gunshot , the program makes a simple calculation to triangulate the sound 's origin to within 80 feet or less .
Experienced ShotSpotter users can tell a lot about an incident by listening to the recordings .
Some say they can distinguish between the pop of a handgun , the crack of a rifle , and the emphatic blast of a shotgun .
The company plans to update the software to recognize these variations automatically .
Kirsch believes the sound can even reveal a shooter 's state of mind .
Selecting a red dot in Gary , she plays back the digital file .
At 8:47 pm , sensors on Clark Street picked up the beats of a large - caliber weapon firing five times .
The first two shots are spaced by nearly a second ; the last three occur in quick succession .
The distinctive two - plus - three pattern , she says , sounds like the work of a determined killer :
Take aim , get the target down , finish him off .
ShotSpotter got cops to the scene quickly that night , but it was too late .
All they found was the victim 's lifeless body .
Violent crime rose dramatically between the late 1980s and early 1990s , a decade before the trend unaccountably reversed in a shift that still baffles experts .
During that period , Robert Showen was working as an engineer for SRI International , a high tech think tank on the outskirts of Silicon Valley .
His office was just down the road from East Palo Alto , an area plagued by gang killings and drive - bys .
When the neighboring town was declared the " murder capital of the nation " in 1992 , Showen was compelled to take action .
" I had n't worked with sound waves before , but the idea of using them to triangulate the location of a gunshot seemed so elegant , " he says .
" In principle , the problem should have been easy to solve . "
Showen started a company to commercialize the concept in 1996 and set out to find his first customer .
It was n't East Palo Alto but the nearby community of Redwood City that served as the test bed .
The town was n't known for violent crime , but it did have a problem with firearms :
A disconcerting number of residents fired their guns into the air on Cinco de Mayo , the Fourth of July , and New Year 's Eve , showering the area with bullets .
When Redwood City rolled out the ShotSpotter system in late 1996 , authorities bragged to reporters that if anyone fired a gun within city limits , the police would be there in moments .
The message sank in .
Over the next couple of years , celebratory gunfire dropped by about 75 percent .
This came to be known at ShotSpotter as the " common - knowledge effect " :
When trigger - happy citizens think the police are listening , they are less likely to indulge .
From a technical standpoint , though , the Redwood City installation was n't so successful .
In tests , it located gunshots only 45 percent of the time .
Moreover , percussive sounds like pile drivers and slamming dumpster lids confused the software , triggering alerts when no shots had been fired .
This put ShotSpotter in an awkward position .
The product had proven remarkably effective — but that was due to good PR , not good technology .
On the strength of Redwood City 's holiday results , the company sold systems to cities in Arizona , South Carolina , and Southern California .
But false alarms remained common , and there were other problems .
Sensors went dead without warning .
The software that displayed gunshot locations ran on the same central computer that performed the audio analysis , making it difficult to distribute the information to an entire police force .
The company was so understaffed that Showen , acting as CEO , CTO , and chief of sales , found himself handling customer complaints .
In 2003 , with the company on the verge of collapse , Showen hired Beldock , a young turnaround specialist , to revamp the management .
The founder retreated to his lab while the new CEO raised funds to hire additional engineers and programmers .
Two years later , the company merged with Centurist Systems , which was researching gunshot - location technology for military applications .
Centurist owned a deceptively simple patent that described how to use the clock built into global positioning satellites to triangulate the location of a sound .
ShotSpotter took advantage of the technique to design a new generation of smarter sensors .
The upgrade caught on fast .
Chicago , Gary , and Washington , DC , bought systems in 2005 and 2006 .
The revitalized sales staff called the LA County Sheriff 's Department just in time .
" I had the memo on my desk to cancel the whole program when the new management called out of the clear blue sky , " says Sid Heal , a commander who oversees new technology for the force .
" They said , ‘ I know we 're in damage control mode . '
I told them , ‘ No sir , you 're in life - support mode . ' "
Determined to regain his trust , the company replaced LA 's sensors for free .
Heal says the department has been so pleased with ShotSpotter 's improved effectiveness and tech support that he 's thinking about extending coverage to the notorious Compton district .
Meanwhile , ShotSpotter expanded from the mean streets of the US to the blast zones in Iraq .
In 2006 , the Army deployed a specialized battlefield version .
The user interface is mobile , and so are the sensors themselves ; soldiers carry units roughly the size of a Tom Clancy paperback .
The sensors pinpoint enemy fire while a camera on an unmanned Boeing scan Eagle aircraft overhead targets the threat .
The company is hoping the common - knowledge effect also applies to guerrilla warfare .
" If a sniper gets vaporized after he takes his first shot , word is going to get around among insurgents , " says ShotSpotter 's military liaison .
So far , he adds , thanks to the system at least one insurgent sniper has been " neutralized . "
The improved sensor arrays deployed in US cities show even more promising results .
Two days after Rochester , New York , activated 6 square miles in July 2006 , local police arrived on the scene of a shooting in time to make an arrest .
Since then , the array has been solely responsible for roughly one gun-related arrest per month .
The 2 - square - mile grid in Gary recorded 10 to 15 incidents a day when it was installed in 2005 .
Police used the system to confiscate 45 illegal weapons on New Year 's Eve of that year , and shooters began to think twice .
Now the system picks up one or two hits a day .
ShotSpotter does n't just lead to arrests .
In several police shoot - outs , the technology has been used to contradict witness testimony that cops fired first .
In other cases , alerts have led police to victims who likely would have perished without prompt attention .
Just before the end of Abdullah Dadgar 's shift , the computer in Bai 's lap begins whooping again : multiple gunshots on Monticello Drive .
Dadgar does n't hesitate .
He starts up the siren and takes off .
The car reaches the scene within two minutes , but once again the shooter is already gone .
Driving back to the Eastmont station , Dadgar acknowledges that the night 's calls — and his decisions to respond immediately — were risky .
But he sees an upside as well .
" Even though I 'll get there faster , I 'll have more information .
Less chance of turning a corner and being surprised , " he says .
" When you roll on a ShotSpotter call , you 're going to be raised up and ready . "
Still , with reaction time cut down to minutes or seconds , it 's inevitable that some ShotSpotter alerts will turn deadly .
On February 3 , three sensors picked up gunfire at 1:49 am .
A red dot on the map appeared just blocks from the Eastmont station , and officer Martin Ziebarth , who was there filling out paperwork , rushed out into the night .
A few minutes later , he came upon 21 - year - old Addiel Meza walking down the street with the butt of a pistol sticking out of his pants pocket .
Ziebarth stopped his car , jumped out , and yelled at Meza to stop .
Meza began to run and pulled out his gun .
At 1:57 am , ShotSpotter showed a fresh red dot on Foothill Boulevard .
The shots recorded at that moment came rapidly , five staccato blasts in less than two seconds .
As the echoes faded , Meza ran east on Foothill and then north on 61st .
Before reaching the end of the block , he slowed and then collapsed to the sidewalk .
He died that night at Highland Hospital .

Guess who got stuck with a big bill for all those “ free ” international calls touted by outfits like FuturePhone ?
None other than AT&T , which has filed a lawsuit in Iowa claiming that “ deceitful and unlawful schemes ” like FuturePhone ’s caused a jump from $ 2,000 per month to $ 2 million per month in the fees billed AT&T by an Iowa rural telco .
Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa , Central Division , AT&T ’s lawsuit seeks to stop FuturePhone as well as the telcos who provide local infrastructure from continuing with their operations that use regulatory - fee arbitrage and VoIP to provide international calls for only the price of a long - distance call to Iowa .
Though the case was just filed on Jan. 29 , it has already apparently caused FuturePhone to shutter its service , and has produced nothing but “ no comment ” replies from the Iowa LECs we contacted who were also named in the suit .
“ This is just the latest in a long line of get - rich - quick schemes that bilk others to make a profit , ” said an AT&T spokesperson .
The lawsuit claims that operations like FuturePhone ’s are in violation of several statutes , including Iowa state laws as well as previous FCC decisions .
Some background , for those not familiar with how intricate cross - network billing can get :
When a long - distance call is “ terminated , ” if a long - distance provider like AT&T does n’t own the local lines where that call is going to , it must pay a fee to the company that does .
Even though such termination fees are typically higher in rural areas , since there are usually relatively few customers in the sticks big long - distance providers can easily balance the cost with their other businesses .
In Iowa , higher than average termination fees ( as much as 13 cents per minute , according to AT&T ) have been lately combined with fiber - based Internet access to provide a pretty good place for a VoIP - based gateway , which can then provide a way to cheaply reach foreign PSTNs .
The loophole comes from some method of subtracting the money paid for foreign terminations from the amount gained by terminating calls in Iowa .
While the margins are pennies - or - less per call , the lure of avoiding the high cost of international calls apparently caught on quickly , to the tune of hundreds of thousands of minutes a month , according to AT&T .
And when AT&T ’s average monthly bill to one such Iowa telco , the Superior Telephone Cooperative , went from $ 2,000 to $ 2,000,000 , it was time for Ma Bell to call the fine - suited folks at Sidley Austin LLP to try to close the loophole down .
Boiled down , AT&T ’s main argument is that because the calls are not actually “ terminated ” in Iowa — AT&T says Iowa is just a midpoint in what is really an international call — AT&T should n’t have to pay the LECs the termination fees .
Telco legal sources we talked to said that while the suit ’s merit can certainly be contested , what it does immediately is give AT&T a legal reason to stall payments of such monthly bills , which could effectively strong - arm the startups out of business .
In FuturePhone ’s case it seemed to have done the trick , since FuturePhone ’s website still carries a big red “ this service is discontinued ” banner , and contact numbers for the company have all apparently been disconnected .
The person who answered the phone at Superior Coop referred us to another Iowa LEC , Great Lakes Communications , which was also named in AT&T ’s suit .
There , we talked by phone to someone who would only identify himself as “ Josh , ” who said when asked about FuturePhone , “ I ’m not going to tell you that stuff . ”
While some free - call operations ( including Free Call Planet , also named in AT&T ’s suit ) still seem to be operating in Iowa , AT&T did leave room for yet - unnamed firms at both the website and telco level to be added to the suit .
The bottom line , for firms seeking to make a buck by using regulatory loopholes :
Good luck in court , because the legal equivalent of the Yankees just showed up in Mudville .
When a social movement adopts the compromises of legislators , it has forgotten its role , which is to push and challenge the politicians , not to fall in meekly behind them .
As I write this , Congress is debating timetables for withdrawal from Iraq .
In response to the Bush Administration ’s “ surge ” of troops , and the Republicans ’ refusal to limit our occupation , the Democrats are behaving with their customary timidity , proposing withdrawal , but only after a year , or eighteen months .
And it seems they expect the anti-war movement to support them .
That was suggested in a recent message from MoveOn , which polled its members on the Democrat proposal , saying that progressives in Congress , “ like many of us , do n’t think the bill goes far enough , but see it as the first concrete step to ending the war . ”
Ironically , and shockingly , the same bill appropriates $ 124 billion in more funds to carry the war .
It ’s as if , before the Civil War , abolitionists agreed to postpone the emancipation of the slaves for a year , or two years , or five years , and coupled this with an appropriation of funds to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act .
When a social movement adopts the compromises of legislators , it has forgotten its role , which is to push and challenge the politicians , not to fall in meekly behind them .
We who protest the war are not politicians .
We are citizens .
Whatever politicians may do , let them first feel the full force of citizens who speak for what is right , not for what is winnable , in a shamefully timorous Congress .
We who protest the war are not politicians .
We are citizens .
Whatever politicians may do , let them first feel the full force of citizens who speak for what is right , not for what is winnable , in a shamefully timorous Congress .
Timetables for withdrawal are not only morally reprehensible in the case of a brutal occupation ( would you give a thug who invaded your house , smashed everything in sight , and terrorized your children a timetable for withdrawal ? ) but logically nonsensical .
If our troops are preventing civil war , helping people , controlling violence , then why withdraw at all ?
If they are in fact doing the opposite — provoking civil war , hurting people , perpetuating violence — they should withdraw as quickly as ships and planes can carry them home .
It is four years since the United States invaded Iraq with a ferocious bombardment , with “ shock and awe . ”
That is enough time to decide if the presence of our troops is making the lives of the Iraqis better or worse .
The evidence is overwhelming .
Since the invasion , hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have died , and , according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees , about two million Iraqis have left the country , and an almost equal number are internal refugees , forced out of their homes , seeking shelter elsewhere in the country .
Yes , Saddam Hussein was a brutal tyrant .
But his capture and death have not made the lives of Iraqis better , as the U.S. occupation has created chaos : no clean water , rising rates of hunger , 50 percent unemployment , shortages of food , electricity , and fuel , a rise in child malnutrition and infant deaths .
Has the U.S. presence diminished violence ?
On the contrary , by January 2007 the number of insurgent attacks has increased dramatically to 180 a day .
The response of the Bush Administration to four years of failure is to send more troops .
To add more troops matches the definition of fanaticism :
If you find you ’re going in the wrong direction , redouble your speed .
It reminds me of the physician in Europe in the early nineteenth century who decided that bloodletting would cure pneumonia .
When that did n’t work , he concluded that not enough blood had been let .
The Congressional Democrats ’ proposal is to give more funds to the war , and to set a timetable that will let the bloodletting go on for another year or more .
It is necessary , they say , to compromise , and some anti-war people have been willing to go along .
However , it is one thing to compromise when you are immediately given part of what you are demanding , if that can then be a springboard for getting more in the future .
That is the situation described in the recent movie The Wind That Shakes The Barley , in which the Irish rebels against British rule are given a compromise solution — to have part of Ireland free , as the Irish Free State .
In the movie , Irish brother fights against brother over whether to accept this compromise .
But at least the acceptance of that compromise , however short of justice , created the Irish Free State .
The withdrawal timetable proposed by the Democrats gets nothing tangible , only a promise , and leaves the fulfillment of that promise in the hands of the Bush Administration .
There have been similar dilemmas for the labor movement .
Indeed , it is a common occurrence that unions , fighting for a new contract , must decide if they will accept an offer that gives them only part of what they have demanded .
It ’s always a difficult decision , but in almost all cases , whether the compromise can be considered a victory or a defeat , the workers have been given some thing palpable , improving their condition to some degree .
If they were offered only a promise of something in the future , while continuing an unbearable situation in the present , it would not be considered a compromise , but a sellout .
A union leader who said , “ Take this , it ’s the best we can get ” ( which is what the MoveOn people are saying about the Democrats ’ resolution ) would be hooted off the platform .
I am reminded of the situation at the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City , when the black delegation from Mississippi asked to be seated , to represent the 40 percent black population of that state .
They were offered a “ compromise ” — two nonvoting seats .
“ This is the best we can get , ” some black leaders said .
The Mississippians , led by Fannie Lou Hamer and Bob Moses , turned it down , and thus held on to their fighting spirit , which later brought them what they had asked for .
That mantra — “ the best we can get ” — is a recipe for corruption .
It is not easy , in the corrupting atmosphere of Washington , D.C. , to hold on firmly to the truth , to resist the temptation of capitulation that presents itself as compromise .
A few manage to do so .
I think of Barbara Lee , the one person in the House of Representatives who , in the hysterical atmosphere of the days following 9/11 , voted against the resolution authorizing Bush to invade Afghanistan .
Today , she is one of the few who refuse to fund the Iraq War , insist on a prompt end to the war , reject the dishonesty of a false compromise .
Except for the rare few , like Barbara Lee , Maxine Waters , Lynn Woolsey , and John Lewis , our representatives are politicians , and will surrender their integrity , claiming to be “ realistic . ”
We are not politicians , but citizens .
We have no office to hold on to , only our consciences , which insist on telling the truth .
That , history suggests , is the most realistic thing a citizen can do .

A decision by the Federal Communications Commission that allows all cell phone companies to turn off their analog networks beginning in February of 2008 means that nearly two million people , or half of OnStar 's entire subscription base , will soon find the other end silent when they press that blue button on their vehicle 's dash .
OnStar service was originally built in 1996 on an analog network owned by Verizon Wireless because digital networks at the time did n't provide enough coverage to outlying and rural areas where many OnStar subscribers are located .
Still , the FCC ruled on the sunsetting of analog networks all the way back in 2002 , and for two years General Motors continued selling vehicles equipped with analog equipment that it knew would become obsolete .
While the New York Times article seems to cry foul that it took GM another two years to switch from analog - only to dual - mode ( analog / digital ) hardware , that timetable sounds about right to us .
Without knowing which way the FCC was going to rule ( many companies that rely on analog networks like ADT Home Securities lobbied the FCC along with OnStar to stay the execution of analog networks ) , General Motors likely was n't prepared to pull the switch on its suppliers , and in the meantime equipped many vehicles with analog / digital - ready hardware that could at least be upgraded to dual - mode when the time came .
That time is coming at the end of 2007 , as all analog networks will be shut off on January 1st , 2008 .
At that time , any OnStar subscriber with a vehicle before 2002 and some with vehicles between 2002 and 2004 will find themselves all alone in the driver 's seat .
OnStar has set up a webpage for subscribers who would like more info on the transition and to find out if their vehicle is capable of being upgraded to survive the switch .

Addressing an audience at the Open Source Business Conference , Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) lawyer Eben Moglen discussed the upcoming version 3 of the General Public License ( GPL 3 ) .
Moglen anticipates broad adoption of the license even among open - source projects that do not use the current version of the GPL .
Moglen also took the opportunity to nudge Google and encouraged the company to release the source code of open source application improvements used internally .
The GPL does not require companies to release the source code of patches and program modifications that are n't distributed .
In theory , companies like Google have probably made many , many modifications to widely used open source applications without submitting the patches and improvements upstream for the benefit of other users .
Although FSF founder Richard Stallman decided not to force companies like Google to disclose internal - use enhancements with the new version of the GPL , Moglen believes that companies should do so out of obligation to the community .
Moglen believes that members of the open - source software community should put pressure on companies and try to convince them to disclose the non-public enhancements they have made to open - source software programs .
Although Google is only one of countless companies that enhances open - source software products for internal use , Moglen chose to single out Google because the company 's business model depends so heavily on open - source software .
Although I can understand and appreciate Moglen 's desire to compel companies like Google to help advance the open - source products that they use internally , I think it would be a mistake to exert pressure to an extent that risks alienation .
Declining to release patches may seem a bit exploitative , but Google more than compensates for it in many other ways .
For instance , Google has invested millions of dollars in open - source software development with its Summer of Code program , which also actively expands the size of the open - source software development community .
Yahoo !’s new Pipes service is a milestone in the history of the internet .
It ’s a service that generalizes the idea of the mashup , providing a drag and drop editor that allows you to connect internet data sources , process them , and redirect the output .
Yahoo !
describes it as “ an interactive feed aggregator and manipulator ” that allows you to “ create feeds that are more powerful , useful and relevant . ”
While it ’s still a bit rough around the edges , it has enormous promise in turning the web into a programmable environment for everyone .
Before I get into the details of what it is and how it works , I want to give a little background on why I ’m so excited .
This is something I ’ve been waiting nearly ten years for .
Back in the summer of 1997 , at our first Perl conference , Jon Udell ( who is among the most prescient of technology visionaries and the prototype for my concept of the alpha geek ) gave a talk that electrified me .
Jon expressed a vision of web sites as data sources that could be re-used , and of a new programming paradigm that took the whole internet as its platform .
This was well before web services were au courant .
We do n’t have a record of that talk , but a few years later , in a keynote at the 8th International Python conference , he said much the same thing :
To a remarkable degree , today ’s Web already is a vast collection of network services .
So far , these services are mainly browser - oriented .
My browser “ calls ” a service on Yahoo to receive a page of a directory .
Or it “ calls ” a service on AltaVista to receive a page of search results .
One of the nicest things about the Web , however , is that browsers are n’t the only things that can call on the services offered by websites .
Programs written in any URL - aware language — including Python , Perl , JavaScript , and Java — can “ call ” these Web services too .
To these programs , the Web looks like a library of callable components .
What ’s more , it ’s very easy to build new Web services out of these existing components , by combining them in novel ways .
I think of this as the Web ’s analog to the UNIX pipeline .
I picked up Jon ’s theme in my own keynote at JavaOne that year , a talk entitled The Network Really is the Computer :
I want to talk about the implications for that marvelous aspect of the fundamental UNIX design : the pipe , and its ability to connect small independent programs so that they could collectively perform functions beyond the capability of any of them alone .
What is the equivalent of the pipe in the age of the web ?
… This is one of the REALLY BIG IDEAS that is going to shape the next five or ten years of computing .
Now , many of you may think that mashups are already the equivalent of pipes .
They certainly satisfy many of the requirements that Jon and I were talking about back in 2000 .
They allow developers to use two websites in a way that their creators did n’t quite intend , which extends them and makes them more useful .
But mashups have generally been limited in their scope , pairwise combinations with their output typically being simply another web site .
That is , the pipes and filter mechanism had not been generalized .
But perhaps more significantly , to develop a mashup , you already needed to be a programmer .
Yahoo !
Pipes is a first step towards changing all that , creating a programmable web for everyone .
Using the Pipes editor , you can fetch any data source via its RSS , Atom or other XML feed , extract the data you want , combine it with data from another source , apply various built - in filters ( sort , unique ( with the “ ue ” this time : -) , count , truncate , union , join , as well as user - defined filters ) , and apply simple programming tools like for loops .
In short , it ’s a good start on the Unix shell for mashups .
It can extract dates and locations and what it considers to be “ text entities . ”
You can solicit user input and build URL lines to submit to sites .
The drag and drop editor lets you view and construct your pipeline , inspecting the data at each step in the process .
And of course , you can view and copy any existing pipes , just like you could with shell scripts and later , web pages .
Now , while I say Pipes opens up mashup programming to the non-programmer , it ’s not entirely for the faint of heart .
At minimum , you need to be able to look at a URL line and parse out the parameters ( so , for example , you can use Pipes ’ “ URL builder ” module to construct input to a site ’s query function ) , understand variables and loops , and so on .
But you do n’t really need to know these things to get started .
Pipes can simply be used as a kind of “ power browser . ” ( something Dale Dougherty has been looking for even longer than I ’ve been looking for pipes and filters for the web ) .
For example , you can build a custom mashup to search for traffic along your own routes every morning , or a news aggregator that searches multiple sites for subjects you care about .
All you have to do is start with one of the existing modules .
( And presumably , once pipes is opened to the public tonight , there will be many more , as anyone can publish their own modules . )
Brady Forrest is writing a separate post to dig more deeply into the how - to side .
But to get the concept across , let ’s look at Aggregated News Alerts , a pipe that aggregates news alerts from bloglines , findory , Google News , Microsoft Live News , and Yahoo !
News .
A preview of the pipe ’s output is shown below , after I ’ve used the text input field to search for Linux :
But I do n’t just get to look at this output on the pipes web site .
I can pipe it further , as an RSS feed in its own right , I can send it to my feed aggregator of choice , and I can even get results by email or SMS .
OK .
That ’s nice .
But what ’s nicer is that even if I ’m not much of a programmer , I can start to copy and paste to modify this pipe even further .
I start by cloning the pipe .
Now I have my own copy to play with .
I can start by subtracting some feeds , and adding some others .
For example , if I like to search for open source topics , I might want to subtract some of the general news sources and instead point to news sources like slashdot and the O’Reilly Network .
It ’s not quite as easy as drag and drop .
I have to understand the query syntax of the sites I want to search , and modify the URL - builder modules to use that syntax rather than the syntax of the sites I ’m replacing .
But it ’s relatively easy once you play around a bit .
What ’s really lovely about this is that , like the Unix shell , Pipes provides a gradual introduction to web programming .
You start out by modifying someone else ’s pipe just a bit , then branch out into something more adventurous .
As I wrote in Unix Power Tools back in 1993 :
It has been said that Unix is not an operating system as much as it is a way of thinking .
In The UNIX Programming Environment , Kernighan and Pike write that at the heart of the Unix philosophy “ is the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves . ”
Most of the nongraphical utility programs that have run under Unix since the beginning , some 30 years ago , share the same user interface .
It ’s a minimal interface , to be sure — but one that allows programs to be strung together in pipelines to do jobs that no single program could do alone .
Most operating systems — including modern Unix and Linux systems — have graphical interfaces that are powerful and a pleasure to use .
But none of them are so powerful or exciting to use as classic Unix pipes and filters , and the programming power of the shell .
A new user starts by stringing together simple pipelines and , when they get long enough , saving them for later execution in a file ( Section 1.8 ) , alias ( Section 29.2 ) , or function ( Section 29.11 ) .
Gradually , if the user has the right temperament , he gets the idea that the computer can do more of the boring part of many jobs .
Perhaps he starts out with a for loop ( Section 28.9 ) to apply the same editing script to a series of files .
Conditions and cases soon follow and before long , he finds himself programming .
On most systems , you need to learn consciously how to program .
You must take up the study of one or more programming languages and expend a fair amount of concentrated effort before you can do anything productive .
Unix , on the other hand , teaches programming imperceptibly — it is a slow but steady extension of the work you do simply by interacting with the computer .
Before long , you can step outside the bounds of the tools that have already been provided by the designers of the system and solve problems that do n’t quite fit the mold .
This is sometimes called hacking ; in other contexts , it is called “ engineering . ”
In essence , it is the ability to build a tool when the right one is not already on hand .
I think that ’s a pretty good description of Pipes as well .
It democratizes web programming , making it easier for people to have more control over the internet information services they consume , and providing a general - purpose platform for interacting with sites that is more powerful than the browser or feed - reader alone , but without requiring full programming skills .
Pipes still has a ways to go in the ease of use department .
Parsing and filtering a stream of xml is n’t as easy as parsing Unix ’s ascii stdout .
And the user interface of the editor itself needs a lot of work to make it easier to use .
But it ’s a great start .
Kudos to Pasha Sadri and the rest of the Pipes team !
From HaskellWiki
The " monomorphism restriction " is a counter - intuitive rule in Haskell type inference .
If you forget to provide a type signature , sometimes this rule will fill the free type variables with specific types using " type defaulting " rules .
The resulting type signature is always less polymorphic than you 'd expect , so often this results in the compiler throwing type errors at you in situations where you expected it to infer a perfectly sane type for a polymorphic expression .
A simple example is plus = (+ ) .
Without an explicit signature for plus , the compiler will not infer the type (+ ) :: ( Num a ) => a -> a -> a for `plus` , but will apply defaulting rules to specify plus :: Integer -> Integer ->
Integer .
When applied to plus 3.5 2.7 , GHCi will then produce the somewhat - misleading - looking error , No instance for ( Fractional Integer ) arising from the literal ‘ 3.5 ’ .
The restriction is turned on by default in compiled modules , and turned off by default at the GHCi prompt ( since GHC 7.8.1 ) .
You can override these defaults by using the MonomorphismRestriction and NoMonomorphismRestriction language pragmas .
The exact definition of the restriction is fairly technical ; it can be found in section 4.5.5 of the Haskell 2010 Report .
To a first approximation it means that you often cannot overload a function unless you provide an explicit type signature .
In summary :
--
This yields f1 :: ( Show x ) => x ->
String f1 x = show x --
But this does n't .
Instead , f2 :: ( ) ->
String f2 = \ x -> show x -- ... but we can fix that with an explicit type signature .
f3 :: ( Show a ) => a ->
String f3 = \ x -> show x -- Similarly this produces ( ) ->
String f4 = show -- ... but this is allowed f5 :: ( Show a ) => a ->
String f5 = show
Arguably , these should all be equivalent , but thanks to the monomorphism restriction , they are not .
The difference between the first and second version is that the first version binds x via a " function binding " ( see section 4.4.3 of the Haskell 2010 Report ) , and is therefore unrestricted , but the second version does not .
The reason why one is allowed and the other is not is that it 's considered clear that sharing f1 will not share any computation , and less clear that sharing f2 will have the same effect .
If this seems arbitrary , that 's because it is .
It is difficult to design an objective rule which disallows subjective unexpected behaviour .
Some people are going to fall foul of the rule even though they 're doing quite reasonable things .
The monomorphism restriction is probably the most annoying and controversial feature of Haskell 's type system .
All seem to agree that it is evil - it is commonly called " The Dreaded Monomorphism Restriction " - but whether or not it is considered a necessary evil depends on who you ask .
So why is the restriction imposed ?
The reasoning behind it is fairly subtle , and is fully explained in section 4.5.5 of the Haskell 2010 Report .
Basically , it solves one practical problem ( without the restriction , there would be some ambiguous types ) and one semantic problem ( without the restriction , there would be some repeated evaluation where a programmer might expect the evaluation to be shared ) .
Those who are for the restriction argue that these cases should be dealt with correctly .
Those who are against the restriction argue that these cases are so rare that it's not worth sacrificing the type - independence of eta reduction .
An example , from A History of Haskell : Consider the genericLength function , from Data .
List
genericLength :: Num a => [ b ] -> a
And consider the function :
f xs = ( len , len ) where len = genericLength xs
len has type Num a => a and , without the monomorphism restriction , it could be computed twice .
-- ARG
( This introductory section slightly expanded and re-arranged by YitzGale . )
It is not clear to me how this whole thing about being computed once or twice works .
Is n't type checking / inference something that happens at compile - time and should n't have any effect on what happens at run-time , as long as the typecheck passes ?
Dainichi
The trouble is that typeclasses essentially introduce additional function parameters -- specifically , the dictionary of code implementing the instances in question .
In the case of typeclass polymorphic pattern bindings , you end up turning something that looked like a pattern binding -- a constant that would only ever be evaluated once , into what is really a function binding , something which will not be memoised .
CaleGibbard 23:46 , 1 February 2008 ( UTC )
The type of f , if no signature is given , then the compiler does n't know that the two elements of the returned pair are of the same type .
It 's return value will be :
f :: ( Num a , Num b ) => [ x ] -> ( a , b )
This means that while compiling f the compiler is unable to memoise len - clearly if a /= b then different code is executed to compute the first and second appearance of len in the pair .
It 's possible the compiler could do something more clever when f is actually applied if a == b , but I 'm supposing this is n't a straight - forward thing to implement in the compilers .
Dozer 23:54 , 4 February 2008 ( GMT )
Num a => [ x ] -> ( a , a )
( Num a , Num b ) => [ x ] -> ( a , b )
Thank you , the nature of theis getting clearer now , but I 'm still confused about how the restriction of top level definitions is supposed tothis problem .
To me , the given example explains why f's type is inferred to be , not , but not why this means that you cannot define top - level overloading outside pattern bindings .
Is there an example which makes this clearer ?
Maybe I need to read up on the Hindley –Milner type system , but this seems related to the existence of functions ( such as genericLength and read ) that are polymorphic in their return type .
Would MR need to exist without these functions ?
I 'm a bit confused about functions like this , since I somehow feel they belong to more of a system with dependent types .

The following compiles for me on ghc 7.4.1 :
module Main where import Data .
List main = putStrLn $ show ( f [ ] ) f xs = ( len , len ) where len = genericLength xs
If i add f2 = \x -> show x , compilation fails , demonstrating that i still have the monomorphism restriction enabled .
This is not due to type inference from the putStrLn $ show ( f [ ] ) doing anything ; in fact , this compiles fine :
module Main where import Data .
List main = putStrLn " " f xs = ( len , len ) where len = genericLength xs -- f2 = \x -> show x
whereas this fails to compile :
module Main where import Data .
List main = putStrLn " " --f xs = ( len , len ) -- where -- len = genericLength xs f2 = \ x -> show x
Why does the example from History of Haskell not fail ?
-- BayleShanks
Oversimplifying the debate somewhat :
Those in favour tend to be those who have written Haskell Implementations and those against tend to be those who have written complex combinator libraries ( and hence have hit their collective heads against the restriction all too often ) .
It often boils down to the fact that programmers want to avoid legalese , and language implementors want to avoid cruft .
In almost all cases , you can get around the restriction by including explicit type declarations .
Those who are for the restriction are usually quick to point out that including explicit type declarations is good programming practice anyway .
In a few very rare cases , however , you may need to supply a type signature which is not valid Haskell .
( Such type signatures require a type system extension such as Scoped type variables . )
Unless you 're writing some weird combinator libraries , or are in the habit of not writing type declarations , you 're unlikely to come across it .
Even so , most Haskell Implementations provide a way to turn the restriction off .

Some question or suggestion :
As I understand the problem arises from the situation that two different forms of assignment are described by the same notation .
There are two forms of assignment , namely the inspection of data structures ( " unpacking " , " pattern binding " ) and the definition of functions ( " function binding " ) .
Unique examples are :
let f x = y -- function definition let F x = y -- data structure decomposition
In the first case we have the identifier f starting with lower case .
This means this is a function binding .
The second assignment starts with F , which must be a constructor .
That 's why this is a pattern binding .
The monomorphism restriction applies only to the pattern binding .
I think this was not defined in order to please compiler writers , but has shown to be useful in practice , or am I wrong ?
But the different handling of these binding types leads to a problem since both types have a common case .
let x = y -- function or pattern binding ?
So , what speaks against differentiating the assignments notationally , say
let f x = y -- function definition let F x <= y -- data structure decomposition
and keep the monomorphism restriction as it is ?
-- Henning Thielemann
The problem is n't just pattern bindings , it 's that pattern bindings which are typeclass polymorphic are actually function bindings in disguise , since the usual implementation of typeclasses adds parameters to such definitions , to allow the definition to take the typeclass dictionaries involved .
Thus , such pattern bindings have different properties with respect to sharing ( they 're generally less shared than you want ) .
In especially bad cases , without the MR , it is possible to have programs which run exponentially slower without type signatures than when signatures are added .
Just distinguishing pattern bindings with a new notation does n't solve the problem , since they 'll have to be converted into function bindings in that case anyway .
If you intend to keep the MR , then you do n't need to change anything .
The issue with the MR is just the fact that it 's annoying to have eta-reduction fail in the absence of explicit type signatures , and the fact that it makes otherwise perfectly valid programs fail to compile on speculation that there might be loss of sharing ( when there usually is n't , or at least the impact is n't large enough to worry about ) .
John Hughes recently advocated the removal of the MR on the Haskell Prime mailing list , and suggested replacing it with two forms of pattern binding : one for call - by - name ( polymorphic , not shared ) , and one for call - by - need ( monomorphic , guaranteed shared ) .
This might be similar to what you 're suggesting .
If you look at it too closely , it seems like a good solution , but the overall impact on Haskell code seems too large to me , to resolve a distinction which it ought to be statically possible to determine .
I 'm of the opinion that it would be better to find a way to restore sharing lost through the typeclass transformation in some way , or else implement typeclasses in an altogether different way which does n't run into this problem .
Additional runtime machinery seems like a likely candidate for this -- the interactions with garbage collection are somewhat subtle , but I think it should be doable .
It 's also possible to restore the sharing via whole - program analysis , but advocates of separate compilation will probably complain , unless we were to find a mechanism to fix the problem from the object code ( and potentially temporaries ) at link time .
I think it'd be useful to collect a set of examples of the Monormorphism Restriction biting people in an unexpected way .
This may help to inform the debate over the MR by giving real - life examples .
Add more examples here if ( an only if ) they constitute an unexpected MR - related incident in your life or someone else 's .

In trying to build an editor with undoable actions :

Back before forM was in the Control .
Monad library , I once spent about 1 / 2 an hour trying to figure out why my action in the ST monad was having its ' s ' parameter squished to ( ) .
I tore the code apart for quite a while before discovering that it was that the MR was applying to my definition of forM :
forM = flip mapM
I recently got tired of typing print " blah " in a ghci shell session and tried let p = print .
Thanks to MR and Haskell defaulting , the type of p silently became ( ) -> IO ( ) .
No surprise that my new " short " version of print was only capable of printing void values -
Prelude > p ( ) () Prelude > p " blah " < interactive > : 1:2 : Could n't match expected type `( ) ' against inferred type ` [ Char ] '
In the first argument of `p ' , namely `" blah " '
In the expression : p " blah " In the definition of `it ' : it = p " blah "

If I comment main , I cannot compile this code because of the monomorphism restriction .
With main , it 'll infer the type :
xmlGetWidget ' :: ( GObject -> Window ) ->
String -> IO Window
And give me a type error in the button line .
If I uncomment the type signature , it 'll work .

Along the same lines as Simon 's question above , does anyone have any real examples of being bitten by the lack of MR ?
I know what it 's for , but I can't really think of any realistic cases when it would be a problem .

I tried to define foldl in terms of foldr , and discovered

James Harris :
This is Truthdig .
James Harris here again with Josh Scheer and in - studio guest Dr. Troy Duster .
We ’ve been talking off - air about the relationship between the war on drugs and unemployment in poor and minority communities .
Dr. Duster , for the record , why is it critical that we understand the war on drugs as it relates to social progress and perhaps social policy ?
Troy Duster : People often get trapped into the immediacy of the drug war .
They believe that the police are the bad guys ; they ’re profiling blacks and Latinos , and that ’s the end of the story .
So you do n’t get a sense of big economic political context to the drug war .
You know if you even go back to the Opium War in the middle of the 19th century you can see it was never about opium .
It was about power , control , the British , and the Japanese .
That ’s what it was all about .
But in a very similar way , the drug war that we ’ve experienced in the last 30 years is to be set in some sort of larger historical context .
And that ’s what I ’m supposed to be doing .
As a sociologist , I do n’t just talk about drugs .
I talk about the context .
About 30 years ago , a little bit longer , there was a book written by Sidney Willhelm .
The title was provocative .
It was called “ Who Needs the Negro ? ” Now , it was a book that people thought was just outrageous .
It was actually in the ’60s that I think it was published .
They still called black people Negroes in those years , as you can tell from the title .
And here was Willhelm ’s thesis :
He said , you ’re going back to slavery , and you had great need for black labor .
It was obvious , that ’s what slavery was all about .
And then he said , we move into an industrial world , blacks were leaving the South for Detroit , Philadelphia , Chicago and New York .
And that period , World War I breaks out , and you need black labor to either strike - break , for what ’s happening with whites who were getting a little bit militant with the IWW [ Industrial Workers of the World ] , or , when whites leave and go to WWI and WWII , you got this black labor supply .
Then he says that what happens in the postwar era , when whites come back from the wars , you do n’t need the Negro anymore for that kind of industrial labor .
The work that ’s being done in the South in the cotton fields is pretty much mechanized now .
And he said “ who needs the Negro ? ”
Harris :
Well , I ’m going to interrupt for a second .
So you ’ve got this well - documented case for the unneeded Negro .
But how in the world does this tie back into the war on drugs ?
Duster :
When he said this he then implied that there would be a development in the next 10 to 20 years that would crystallize his idea .
He did n’t say what it was going to be , but he said , you watch , there ’s going to happen something in this country that going to sharpen this whole issue about the redundancy … of black employment .
And sure enough , in 1954 , in the age group 16 to 20 , black unemployment is equal to white unemployment . …
Harris : This is 1954 ?
Duster : 1954 .
Thirty years later , black unemployment in this age group is three and a half to four times that of white unemployment .
But here are the figures .
[ In ] 1954 it ’s about 12 percent each unemployment figures .
In 1984 , in most urban jurisdictions , blacks are about 42 percent unemployed in this age group ; whites about 16 percent .
Now what happened ?
How would you explain that industrialization which was not so bad for black people in terms of the employment in the first part of the century ?
Suddenly with postindustrialization you get this extraordinary rate of black unemployment among youth .
And what we learned is that in the tertiary sector of the economy , blacks are not necessarily needed , and this was Willhelm ’s point .
So what you ’re getting when you ’re getting into banking , restauranting , and all of those activities that are not either industrial or rural .
Employers are making decisions about who they want to be in these shops , selling goods , or who they want in the restaurants , waiting on tables , who they want in hotels , in these service occupations .
And there you have systematic discrimination .
He said by 1984 what you ’re seeing is extraordinarily high rates of black unemployment .
Enter the drug war .
What happens between 1980 and 2000 is the most massive building of prisons in all of U.S history .
In California [ in] 1982 , I was looking at some figures ; we were spending more on higher education than on prisons .
We had nine campuses on the University of California ; we had about 16 state colleges .
In the next period , the next 20 years , we built not a single campus , but we built , however … we went from 11 prisons to 27 prisons .
And the incarceration rate skyrockets .
Now here ’s the part where we get into the issue of race and incarceration .
You go back to 1925 and the black rate of incarceration is about twice that of whites .
By 1990 it ’s eight times the rate of whites .
So what ’s happening here is this extraordinary acceleration in the incarceration of black people and the single most important factor is the drug war .
Harris : Talking to Dr. Troy Duster , and we ’re getting into this issue of the war on drugs as it relates directly to the black community .
We ’ll talk a bit about racial profiling , but I have a question for you — kind of open this thing up .
The statistics are certainly there : Black males who do n’t graduate from high school are unemployed almost to a rate to 72 percent .
I tell them they have to beat these numbers .
What responsibility falls on the actual man or woman who is not employed or who is breaking the law ?
Duster :
That ’s a great question , because as you know , listening to whether it ’s Bill Cosby or Juan Williams or increasingly colleagues and friends of mind like Bob Herbert who are on the progressive side of the continuum .
What they ’re saying more and more is that we have to look at the values and the attitudes orientation of black youth .
Yes and no .
On the one hand , of course , if I ’m speaking to a particular black kid in my office , and I often do , I will tell him that he needs to get his act together and be purposeful and do his homework and all those virtuous things .
On a public stage , however , as a matter of public policy , this is not about individuals and their values .
We as a nation have a policy .
It was developed in 1987 by the DEA [ Drug Enforcement Administration ] .
It was called Operation Pipeline .
And the pipeline was to train 27,500 law enforcement people to look on the streets of the United States to find and to profile particular “ kinds of people who would be engaged in drug dealing . ”
Now that ’s not individual decision , that ’s not individual cop .
That ’s 27,000 people who are trained by the government ; that ’s a policy .
And the goal from that level down to the individual saying “ you need to get your act together ” is to make this huge sociopolitical mistake which I think this nation is abundantly capable of — and we do it all the time .
So , OK , let ’s go back to your question .
You get these individuals in your audience , and you ’re telling them purposefully and correctly that if they work hard , persevere , stay in school , their chances as individuals of getting a good job are pretty good .
On the other hand , if you are talking about the collective , talk about in fact that there are over 35 million black people and unemployment rates are extraordinarily high , now the question changes .
What is the country as a whole going to do to increase the employment rate of this part of the population ?
And my answer is counterintuitive .
People are always saying thing likes “ you have to look at the market , you have to look at the market . ”
Well , it ’s the market that got us here .
Again , in ’ 54 you had unemployment rates among blacks are about equal to whites .
The market , not individual black youth , spoke and we have a rate of unemployment by 1984 that ’s about four times as great .
So what we need to do is not look at individuals but at public policy .
I think that we could have an extraordinarily successful program of reducing the unemployment rate among blacks and whites if we move to the public sector .
Let ’s take the example of all the billions of dollars spent into the Iraq black hole .
Let ’s take about 12 billion of that and revamp the New York and Boston subways .
All of a sudden we ’d have employment at about 98 percent .
Why ?
Because lots of jobs flow .
Let ’s take another 12 to 15 billion .
You could then put in the homes of most Americans a computer .
And you could then have people who were trained , as a public policy issue , to fix computers .
Computers break down .
I mean , I could go on with this , but the point is you could have a fast rail system between New York , Washington and Boston .
It ’s a joke you get on the [ inaudible ] .
First of all it breaks down often , but here are the French and here are the Japanese with bullet trains going between Kyoto and Tokyo at extraordinary speeds .
Here we are in the United States and we ca n’t get a planned train from Boston to New York in less than about four and a half hours .
And we ’re spending all this money in Iraq and that ’s a direct function of the political decision - making in Washington .
And that ’s not to be explained by individuals , in my office , talking about taking drugs .
Harris :
And that ’s a good question because I know Josh wants to talk more about this war on drugs .
It ’s easier to set a policy to initiate the seizure of drugs than it is to initiate a policy that talks about rebuilding and the installment of social programs .
Our government has proven , time after time again , that they ’re not interested in that kind of policy , because that kind of policy is rebuilding — it makes sense .
But clearly we do n’t like that kind of policy .
I ’m doing a little bit of devil ’s advocate here , but it ’s easier to be the DEA than it is to be a friend of someone who is trying to save and rescue Latinos , blacks and suffering minorities .
Josh Scheer : I agree that maybe you can talk about not wanting to spend money , but this war on drugs has been going on , officially , since 1969 .
It ’s gone through every president and it ’s failed .
And that ’s something that everyone talks about , lots of people have died , millions of people in jail , and there are billions of dollars spent .
At some point it ’s a failed policy .
We can talk about Iraq all day , but Iraq is — how many years now ? — [ only ] four years ; this war on drugs has been going on for over 30 .
Duster :
It ’s a failed policy only in the sense if you have the big picture .
If you ’re a politician and you want to get reelected , it ’s a great policy .
I have a colleague who has written a wonderful piece it ’s called “ World Prohibition , ” Harry Levine , and what he says , no matter what the government is , left , right or center , a theocratic or secular , it does n’t matter .
Every government in the world has an anti-drug policy , and he says the reason is that an anti-drug policy is good to get reelected .
It ’s good for policy , it ’s good or whoever you are in power .
You can claim you ’re against this thing about mind - altering substances , but he says , you know , when the left , right and center agree on something , be careful .
But I want to go back to this question of public policy , because in the short term , it does look like the drug war is a failure .
But , however , take a look at what you described earlier .
It ’s easier to be a law enforcement person ; it ’s easier to get reelected .
Now that ’s taking the short term .
Let ’s take a look at infrastructure , something as vital as our sewage system .
Here we have San Diego , Calif .
In the last decade there has been about 30 or 40 serious warnings that the sewage system , now many decades old , is in danger of breaking .
I mean , literally , unless we move to the infrastructure to change this kind of issue , we ’re going to have sewage spilling out into the ocean and into the streets , and so on .
Now at the point , politicians , like corporate executives who think only in the next quarter , are going to be called up into account and they ’re going to say , “ Well , why did n’t you do anything ? ”
And the answer is that it ’s just easier to have a drug enforcement policy .
It ’s easier to get 25 kids off the streets for a drug bust than to convince people that you have to invest in the infrastructure with public policy .
And the reason why I bring this up is that there is a direct link .
It ’s not as though over here we have a drug war , and over here we have public policy on sewage or fast trains .
The fact is that , as Sidney Willhelm said 35 years ago , if you have a policy of public sector employment , you ’re not going to have kids in the drug war .
The drug war is all about survival .
I think people really need to understand that if you talk to a lot of these kids , they ’re [ dealing ] drugs just to survive .
They ’re not getting rich , I mean , the images that they ’re driving these fancy cars , they ’ve got all this jewelry .
That ’s like the super stars of the drug war , that ’s like those who make it into the headlines .
Most people are just getting by .
A lot of high school kids who do the drug sales a few times a month to help Mama with the groceries .
Now that ’s not part of the story , because that ’s not headlines .
Now when you get someone with lots of rings and lots of gold driving a fancy car , now that ’s a headline .
But what we do n’t see is that a lot of these kids are just selling drugs to help Mama get the groceries .
Scheer :
And it ’s probably also a good job , it ’s not like there are other options .
Duster : I would n’t say it ’s a good job .
It ’s a dangerous job .
Scheer :
In terms of other employment , there are other employment options .
They just do n’t pay as well .
Duster : Yeah , but I think here , and I ’m going to sound more like Juan Williams and Bob Herbert and maybe Cosby , because at the individual level , what I would say is no .
It ’s possible , if you really wanted to go and do things like wash people ’s windows .
A lot of windows need washing , brother , you know , and you could at the individual level make . …
I do n’t want to step into the notion that drugs are a good job for people , or rather it ’s the best alternative on the streets .
I do n’t think it is .
I think that the individual level you can still talk about people being responsible , and working hard , and washing windows .
I mean , you can still do that .
I think that what that does is allow us to step out of the larger picture of national and state policies , which I think really are the issue when it comes to the drug war .
Harris :
How do you address these national policies ?
If you tell me that , if we can come up in this room today with the answer to how to get politicians on a larger scale to address the fact that the nation is falling apart .
You gave the example of San Diego ; we have the pretext of Katrina .
They knew for years that the levees were going to break , but it always comes down to who ’s behind those walls , who will suffer the dire consequences .
It ’s almost like we have to speculate , well , what would happen , and if those were black people , or if this was Beverly Hills , we heard that argument .
But how do we get people . …
Duster :
We do have to speculate .
Look at the Berkeley Hills fire .
1989 , somewhere in there , and people said that was a class fire . …
Why , because the Berkeley Hills are peopled by those with resources , and within about two or three years , many of my colleagues found themselves in even larger houses .
And the reason is because they come from a class position that had a lot of insurance , and the fire was devastating .
Four thousand homes burned down , but within about three to five years … extraordinary rebuilding .
Now contrast that with Katrina .
Now the answer for me to your question is that we are a nation that needs a huge crisis before we act , so we are going to have to have those .
Not just the levees break with Katrina and the displacement , the diaspora of [ hundreds of thousands ] of people of color , that we can apparently tolerate without much reaction .
But when you start getting the sewage system breaking , and it ’s going to affect a huge part of the middle - class population , at that point there ’s going to be hell to pay .
So my view is that we ’re not going to convince anybody .
We ’re so much completely immersed in this language of the market economy .
I hate to use the term because it sounds so sociological , but there is a domination , there is hegemonic control , around market economies .
And if you do n’t believe , try to convince someone , in the public sphere , that market fundamentalism is a mistake .
And the first thing they ’ll tell you is the government is the problem as opposed to the solution .
Well , the private sector is n’t going to help our sewage system , it ’s not going to build the subway system , it ’s not going to do all the things we could do .
Only the public sector is going to do that .
And when we have a crisis , we ’ll finally get there .
Scheer : I want to ask about an economic point .
I do n’t know if you want to talk about it , but the bailout of , say , the airlines , or things like that , where the government ends up having to support the private sector .
I mean , could n’t that money better serve by not doing that and going somewhere and building subways , or is it important that the government help out the private ?
Duster : I do n’t think that it ’s an either / or ; I mean there ’s so much money that ’s available and we can see that from the Iraq war .
We ’re talking about 120 billion here , 80 billion there , 60 billion there .
That kind of resources , that kind of money , could be used for both .
I ’m happy to bail out some corporations that are flying airplanes because we all fly , we want to have them support it .
Look around the world ; many airlines do have public support .
I think we should applaud that .
Alright , the French and the Dutch and other nations help their airlines .
Even the auto industries in some countries are supported by the government .
I ’m not opposed to government support for the private sector ; I just think that we have come to the point where we do n’t think that the public sector could be the solution to these massive public problems that we ’re having .
Scheer :
The war on drugs obviously became a popular war .
There were other things like going in and saying movies are terrible or any of that kind of thing .
What is going to make these people change their mind , what ’s going to make politicians , or are they ever going to change their mind , or are they always going to follow that market flow ?
Duster : I think that being opposed to crime in favor of truth and beauty and justice is always going to sell , until it does n’t .
And that ’s what I meant by the crisis .
I think politicians are going to use the drug war ad infinitum ; they ’re going to use it over and over again .
They ’re going to become tough on crime .
I mean , imagine someone coming out saying , well , the big issues that confront us in Oakland today have to do with what ’s behind the crime rate as opposed to simply saying we ’re going out on the streets to get these kids to stop killing each other .
Harris :
I look at the shift of public to private school — privatization in a very different sense .
My kid ca n’t get a quality education in a public school ; I can afford it , I send him to private school .
Problem solved .
Meanwhile , the public sector is dying , it ’s overcrowded , it ’s overflowed .
The public sector has no resources , no funding to rebuild this , meanwhile the private school , the private resources , are flourishing .
Is it , on some level , our failure as a public to address public problems together that will end all of this ?
What do you think about that ?
Duster :
Well , you put your finger on the problem .
It ’s a massive failure of public imagination .
People with resources can literally buy services they can privatize .
And you ’re quite right that education is the key example here .
Whether it ’s a college education , where if you have enough money you can send your kid off to one of these fancy private schools , and you can say why should I be supporting public education , but it happens at the public school level all over the country .
In the last 30 to 40 years , once again this goes back to my opening remarks about Sidney Willhelm .
Back in the 1960s , it ’s only about 45 years , but in that period , most American cities were mainly white .
And , if you ’ve seen the graphics in the last 30 years , it ’s stunning what ’s happened in most American cities .
That is , how much people of color have come to dominate the demographics .
Well , in that same period , public support out of Washington for cities has declined .
There ’s some figures that I saw , something about 25 percent of the budget of our major cities was coming from federal support back in the ’60s .
It ’s down to about 2 and 3 percent .
And that ’s directly a function , I ’m not going to say it ’s caused by , but let ’s say it ’s related to the shifting demography of the cities .
So as you see the increasing colorization of Los Angeles , you see the decreasing support from the public sector .
Washington does not support Los Angeles as it did in 1960 .
I think 24 percent was Washington - based in the ’60s , and now it ’s down to an infinitesimal amount , so yeah , I think this is all about the ways in which [ Americans ] robbed the public sector because people who are able to afford to send their kids to private school in Los Angeles do so .
L.A. Unified School District , last time I looked , was something like 92 percent minority .
What ’s wrong with that frame ?
What ’s wrong with that notion , minority ?
Harris :
When did public stop being cool , when did it stop being cool and OK to care about your public library , your public school , your public partnerships with friends ?
Scheer : I think it also has to do with the public school . …
There are public schools that do thrive .
But a lot of it comes from the support of the neighborhood .
If there is a rich neighborhood , they can put more money in the public school .
You see that in Orange County [ Calif . ] , you see that where money is flowing .
That they will , a lot of the funds for the public schools are coming from private citizens who want the public schools to thrive , and when you do n’t have any money in the community those public schools are going to fall apart because there is no one watching the store .
Duster :
You know I like to keep the big picture , you guys are on to something big here .
You take a look at what [ Bill ] Moyers has been saying .
He has done some great stuff talking about what is happening in this country .
Maybe what happened in FDR in the 1930s was the little blip on the screen , and if you look at the big picture from 1870 to 1930 , it was really all about corporate society and how big money controlled things .
And then we had a Great Depression , and great shock , and a war , and the combination provided the public sector with the capacity to move in and do something .
Now , what Moyers is saying , and he has a lot of evidence to support it , that in the last 20 years is what you ’ve got is people back in positions of authority and power in Washington who are saying “ let ’s roll back the New Deal ; let ’s roll back what happened with the 1930s , let ’s cut back taxes . ”
And the assault upon the public sector is not simply a blip on the screen .
It ’s a huge issue .
It ’s programmatic assault which has been orchestrated in the last 30 years .
So what we ’re hearing over and over again , from the Milton Friedmans of the world , is that the issue is only about markets , and anything that is public is the problem .
But that ’s such a mindless formulation , but that ’s the Nobel Prize of economics .
Scheer : I want to get back to the public schools a little bit .
I ’ve gone to both public and private and I think sometimes you see the teachers in the public schools — they need a little imagination too .
I think that the whole system being reading , writing , arithmetic , the teachers need something to have imagination .
There has to be an overall shift , do you think , where you ’re teaching other things besides a standardized kind of way about it ?
Duster : No doubt .
Here ’s the situation at least from one perspective on the schools .
When you pay people a very minimal salary , and you keep them in those jobs for a long time , guess what happens ?
Now , despite that we have dedication on the part of many schoolteachers , but in terms of the whole system , what you ’re going to see is people shifting away from that into other areas of the economy .
And so , some of the best people are still in the schools but they are n’t challenged by this whole issue around how much money they can make .
I ’ve seen my students at Berkeley , and later at NYU , who start off idealistic about education .
And they take a look around theme at what ’s happening , and they wind up going to law school .
Scheer : I ’ve seen young teachers , but sometimes it ’s hard because there ’s also that kind of systematic … the administrator might say you have to teach it my way .
I do n’t know about the rest of the country , but in California , you ’re not automatically in the union .
You have to keep getting your job .
If that administrator is saying “ I do n’t like the way you ’re teaching , you have to teach it this way , ” and even if nobody in the class wants to learn that way , I think there needs to be a lot of imagination and changing .
Duster : Again , this is public policy and not individual teachers .
And that ’s why No Child Left Behind has gotten into a lot of trouble , because it ’s getting school systems to get teachers to teach to the test , so what ’s happening is that there ’s now a revolt , people are saying maybe we should have a different kind of strategy than teaching to the test .
And I was saying at this conference yesterday that there ’s a movement in the country , called engaged learning , where you want to get students out of this kind of classroom boredom .
Here ’s a good example .
In the last 30 years we ’ve seen remarkable increases in the number of diagnoses of hyperactive disorder , ADHD .
Now , we know that in the short space of 20 to 30 years you do n’t get much change in the biochemistry of humans .
What you ’re getting is a different diagnostic .
And so we ’re giving these kids Ritalin , or they ’ve got attention deficit disorder .
Now the same kid that has been so diagnosed , you give him a Gameboy , and there he is riveted to attention for hours after hours .
Now what is that all about ?
That ’s not all about attention deficit .
That ’s about him being bored in the classroom .
So engaged learning turns that around .
It says “ let ’s find a way to get students out of this situation where they are totally bored of the curriculum , and get them into an engaged process . … ”
You take them out into the world , into the street , into the gardens , and you tell them the world is a much more complex place … than by someone giving a didactic top - down .
And I think that ’s where education has to go .
But you ’re going to have to have resources , and we ’re back to where we began , which is public policy .
Harris :
How do we change public policy ?
Scheer :
Well , we can get better people elected .
That ’s something to talk about , because the fact is I know we had Mike Gravel on the other day , and he was talking about presidential term limits … and even in Congress which has been struck down before , you get into these neighborhoods where , wherever I ’ve lived has typically been the same congressman for the last 30 years .
It ’s almost you ’re born into it and you die and you give it to someone you want to have that .
Maybe we should take a closer look at who we ’ve been electing . …
Duster :
We should take a closer look .
On the other hand , we have to be careful of term limits , because that has its own dynamic .
What ’s happened in Sacramento with term limits is people that come in , they ’re only going to be in for a few years , and the governor becomes the one who sees this and gets more and more power .
I think that there ’s a trade - off here .
I do n’t think there ’s any one political structure or system that ’s better , but I think it ’s a combination of checks and balances and if people have been around 18 to 20 years , like Willie Brown was .
And yet he was able to get things done in a relatively progressive way .
I ’d prefer that then to have some of these six - year term limit people who are right wing , interested in only what they regard as Christian theology .
It ’s not just term limits . …
Scheer :
What I ’m saying is that there has to be a closer look , at least , because some people , the surface may be good , but if you keep on digging they may not be the perfect person for the district or they may not be doing enough fighting .
Harris :
You are suggesting , perhaps , direct democracy .
People helping politicians shape the laws .
But here ’s my take on it : People , day - to - day folks , have their own set of issues .
They have to worry about whether or not they have enough money to pay for private schools , to pay for groceries .
Are they really going to have enough time to make and shape their own laws ?
Do they really care at the end of the day ; are people willing to do the homework ?
I think across the board , no .
Scheer : I think the thing is , yeah , direct democracy may not work , and people have their own concerns , but at the same time if you give them a black and white , or a shade of gray of this is the way laws should be , or this is the way that should be …
Duster : Well , Joshua , I ’m definitely on this side of the issue of lazy , it ’s like attention deficit .
I mean , yeah , people have attention deficit when they ’re bored .
The very same person can have attention focus when they ’re animated , energized , engaged .
So on the question of laziness .
You know , you can say the population is lazy , until they get animated .
So what happened in Chicago with Mayor Washington , the black community , which had been laying back and not engaged in the process for 25 to 30 years .
All of a sudden when Harold Washington is there , they get engaged .
And the turnout was the biggest in the history of the city , in the black community .
So I do think , you ’re right , if people are lazy under certain conditions , in other conditions that same population gets animated .
Harris : Barack Obama , on a national level , has done the same thing .
And Barack Obama , what does he stand for , what are his politics ?
But I tell you what , you talk about getting engaged , 12,000 people just got engaged in Oakland and they ’re doing it every day .
He ’s outfunding Hillary not based on corporate money , but on individual gifts .
People are engaged in that guy , I ’d just love to hear his thoughts , Dr. Duster , about Obama .
Duster :
You put things in the right perspective .
Hillary has the right money coming from corporate donors .
People are donating $ 2,000 each , and having big fundraisers .
That ’s where most of her money is coming from .
And Barack is able to get people to donate $ 25 , $ 100 , a lot of his money is coming from this huge base , and in the long run , if he keeps that up , he ’ll win going away .
Because her base , in some ways , has already been tapped .
There ’s more money there , but there ’s more people to be tapped .
And at a certain point , if it looks like Barack has an ascendancy , then that big money is going to shift .
Big money has allegiances as long as a breath if they see things changing .
So I think Barack really has an advantage at the moment , but we ’ll see .
The thing about YouTube and every breath you take , every move you make , they ’re watching you .
…
I ’m actually concerned that since all of us are human , any blip on the screen that happens in the next six months can take somebody down .
Remember George Allen and “ macaca . ”
And think that everybody has a camera on Obama looking for something .
Scheer : George Allen , also , he kind of ruined his own self , though , because he kept on lying .
Because he said , “ I do n’t know what that word meant , ” but then you ’re raised by an Algerian , and you speak Algerian , you speak this , you know exactly what you were saying .
…
James and I were talking about Obama , and I ’m not as sold on him as , say , James is .
But I certainly do n’t want Hillary Clinton because I do think she ’s tied into the corporate donors .
I was just saying that all the candidates in the field ; we do n’t know where Obama is coming from .
He ’s a special guy ; when he speaks you are engaged , but he ’s not been there long enough to see if those relationships have formed .
Is he going to be backed by credit card people in the next election ?
We do n’t know yet .
Duster :
Well , probably , anyone who gets selected is going to be backed by power — that ’s what people do .
Scheer :
It ’s sad , but — .
Harris :
We ’ve seen a very wicked last 25 years , and I think the bright spot in those 25 years was Bill Clinton .
Let people tell it , let the Green Party tell it , he was a lot like Reagan , or he was a lot like Bush .
But I think the question Obama raises is he ’s not saying the things that other people are saying , he ’s a lot like those other guys .
But I certainly get a lot more excited when he ’s talking than when they ’re talking .
And maybe that ’s what this comes down to , because what we ’re talking about .
You look at the issues , Oakland , Katrina , profiling , drugs , you look at the issues and these have all been run -of - the - mill issues .
Maybe we need somebody who can get us excited , maybe the president ’s job in the future should n’t be to tell us what to do but to get us excited and invigorated , i.e. or à la Harold Washington in Chicago .
Duster : Excitement around a particular kind of set of issues and a base , I mean , the Christian theology and theocracy , it gets people excited .
Bush was able to mobilize that — Karl Rove .
The thing that is interesting about Obama is that he ’s exciting people who are more or less interested in progressive change and even if he ’s not .
If his base is mobilized , they can keep him honest .
I think the hope here is if he keeps this up and he mobilizes a sufficient number of people around a set of issues they ’ll keep him honest in the same way that the Christian right has kept Bush honest in those terms .
Scheer : Certainly , the Christian right at the end when David Kuo wrote his book , and others were backing away .
…
I think you are right , when you stop being honest , they stop supporting you .
You followed Obama obviously more closely than I have , James . …
Harris :
What is this obvious business ?
I think he ’s a compelling guy .
Scheer : I mean , do you think there is a liberal base with Obama ?
Harris :
His constituency .
Duster : Absolutely .
Absolutely .
Scheer :
When I look at the liberal base , and the candidates who are running , I see Gravel , and [ Rep. Dennis ] Kucinich , and maybe people call [ John ]
Edwards a liberal , and certainly not Hillary .
But that ’s what I was saying with Obama .
You never know what you see with him :
Is he a liberal , is he a centrist ?
Duster :
That ’s a difficult category , because I would say Kucinich , you clearly have a progressive base there , but I do n’t think Obama has mobilized the progressives in the same way , or anywhere close , as Kucinich .
But the progressive base is a very small one in this country ; we do n’t have much .
Getting back to the 1960s when we had a movement , but there ’s no movement now .
It ’s kind of hard to talk about a progressive base ; it can happen . …
Harris :
Who is the progressive base now a days ?
Is it Kucinich , or is it Obama ?
Some would say Hillary is progressive .
Scheer : What ?
Harris :
Who are the progressives , and perhaps that is part of the problem .
There ’s no one guy .
You look at the black community .
There ’s no one guy .
I would never call Al Sharpton my guy .
You look at the Latino community .
There is no [ Cesar ] Chavez .
Scheer :
The trick could be that if you take a political quiz , there ’s no one you can relate to .
I do n’t relate to any candidate on every issue .
The thing is you have to pick more than one issue , because I have friends who voted for George Bush based on one or two issues … you have to pick three or four and that ’s your candidate .
Duster : I think it ’s important to try to clarify what we mean by progressive .
And in my view , it would be a candidate who ’s committed to new understanding of the role of the public sector .
That you ca n’t go back to 1820 , you ca n’t go back even to 1950 .
You have to look at what has happened in the last 30 to 40 years and then talk about what it would mean to have an engaged public sector in all of these public policy issues that we ’ve described .
And I think here Edwards comes off relatively good in the last couple of years .
So he ’s been talking about poverty , and how to alleviate it .
He ’s got a healthcare plan .
And as Paul Krugman said , he ’s the only one who has come forward with a healthcare plan .
Now it ’s a flawed plan , unless you are asking for complete coverage and single payer , it ’s kind of hard to get totally behind it .
But at least Edwards has come forward with an interesting public sector issue around healthcare .
I ’d like to see a lot more on education from the candidates that would be much more progressive .
But that would be where I would start .
I ’m not going to call someone progressive because I like their rhetoric .
I ’m interested in what their rhetoric is about the public sector and the best investment .
Scheer : I was going to say about healthcare that I trust Paul Krugman , and , in full disclosure , that I know Kucinich .
He and [ Rep. John ]
Conyers , they introduced a universal healthcare bill this last Congress and the Congress before , even though I do n’t always defend him . …
Duster :
My guess is —
I have n’t seen that bill — my guess is what I know about Kucinich is that it ’s probably a more progressive version of healthcare .
Scheer : Definitely [ more ] than Edwards .
Harris : Much more progressive .
Here is a final thought .
Here at Truthdig , Bob Scheer believes , I certainly believe , Josh is a doubter , that maybe if we make some headway in repairing some of the issues that are in Oakland .
And if you do n’t know , 148 homicides this last year , a dying public education sector … if you fix some of those problems , Oakland is an extremely diverse city : 30 percent black , 20 percent white … so Mayor [ Ron ]
Dellums is trying to build this model city .
I ask you , Dr. Duster , professor at NYU , probably one of the finest institutions in the country , how do you fix Oakland ?
If you fix Oakland , do you think you can fix Chicago ?
Duster :
Well , you ’ve got to start somewhere , and this is the beauty of democracy .
You do n’t overnight turn things around , so you start in certain pockets a little insurgency here , a little group here , that ’s doing something that ’s progressive .
And if it ’s successful , it can actually take a hold , so I go back to an old idea for us , Saul Alinsky from the ’50s and the ’60s , if you get the potholes fixed in the streets , you get the lights turned back on that had been broken , you do certain kinds of things , and you start to give people some hope .
And once you get hope going , the capacity for people to mobilize is extraordinary .
I think all we need , it sounds like , you can often believe in small incremental measures , and what I ’d like to see is the educational system , rather than this massive notion that we ’re going to get people to all of a sudden increase scores , let ’s go into the schools and have four to five examples , clear examples in Oakland , where you can mobilize teachers .
Give them increased resources , turn the schools around , and then say , two or three years , you can have a model program for the country .
Harris :
We just spoke with Dr. Troy Duster , professor , department of sociology at New York University .
Give him a Google .
For Josh Scheer , for Dr. Duster , this is James Harris and this has been Truthdig .
Moreover , he continues , Bush can count on the military to carry out such a mission even without congressional authorization .
" If they write a plan like that and the president issues an execute order , the forces will execute it .
He 's got the power to do that as commander - in - chief .
We set that up during the Cold War .
It may , after the fact , be considered illegal , or an impeachable offense , but if he orders them to do it , they will do it . "
Lang also notes that the recent appointment of a naval officer , Admiral William Fallon , to the top post at CentCom may be another indication that Bush intends to bomb Iran .
" It makes very little sense that a person with this background should be appointed to be theater commander in a theater in which two essentially ' ground ' wars are being fought , unless it is intended to conduct yet another war which will be different in character , " he wrote in his blog .
" The employment of Admiral Fallon suggests that they are thinking about something that is not a ground campaign . "
Lang predicts that tensions will escalate once the administration grasps the truth about Prime Minister Maliki .
" They want him to be George Washington , to bind together the new country of Iraq , " says Lang .
" And he 's not that .
He is a Shia , a factional political leader , whose goal is to solidify the position of Shia Arabs in Iraq .
That 's his goal .
So he wo n't let them do anything effective against [ Muqtada al - Sadr's ] Mahdi army . "
Recently , a complicated cat - and - mouse game has begun , with Maliki 's forces arresting hundreds of Mahdi militiamen , including a key aide to Muqtada al - Sadr .
But there are many unanswered questions about the operations , which could amount to little more than a short - term effort to appease the U.S .
Gary Sick is slightly more optimistic that the Bush administration 's Iran strategy entails more than brute force .
" What has happened is that the United States , in installing a Shiite government in Iraq , has really upset the balance of power [ in the Middle East ] , " Sick says .
" Along with our Sunni allies — Saudi Arabia , Jordan , and Egypt — [ the administration is ] terribly concerned about Iran emerging as the new colossus .
Having created this problem , the U.S. is now in effect using it as a means of uniting forces who are sympathetic [ to us ] . "
In order to do that , Sick says , the administration must reassure America 's allies that it is serious about protecting them if the conflict spreads throughout the region — drawing in Shiite Iran , Sunni Saudi Arabia , and Turkey , which would resist any attempt by the Kurds to create an independent state .
" That means providing Patriot missiles , if Iran goes after the Saudi oil ports , " he says .
" One of the prices we will have to pay is a more active role in the Arab - Israeli dispute .
Then there is fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon .
The president has signed a covert-action finding that allows the C.I.A. to confront and counter Hezbollah in Lebanon .
So this is a very broad strategy .
It has a clear enemy and an appeal to Saudis , to Israelis , and has a potential of putting together a fairly significant coalition . "
For all that , Sick acknowledges , this policy carries a significant risk of provoking war with Iran : " Basically , this is a signal to Maliki that we are not going to tolerate Shiite cooperation with Iran .
This could lead to the ultimate break with Maliki .
But once you start sending these signals , you end up in a corner and you can't get out of it . "
Whatever the administration 's master plan may be , parts of it are already under way .
In mid-January , the U.S. sent a second aircraft - carrier strike group to the Persian Gulf .
According to Gardiner , by the end of February the United States will have enough forces in place to mount an assault on Iran .
That , in the words of former national - security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski , would be " an act of political folly " so severe that " the era of American preponderance could come to a premature end . "
The Bush White House has already built the fire .
Whether it will light the match remains to be seen .
Craig Unger is currently working on a book based on his article " American Rapture , " which appeared in the December 2005 issue .
Bill Thompson does not believe this man when it comes to DRM
For a company with a tiny share of the computer market and an increasingly perilous first mover advantage selling portable music players Apple punches well above its weight in coverage of its every move .
In January CEO Steve Jobs single - handedly distracted the attention of the world 's technology press from the hundreds of announcements taking place at the Computer Electronics Show in Las Vegas by pulling out an iPhone on stage in San Francisco .
The recent settlement of the long - running dispute with Apple Corps over the use of the Apple name garnered thousands of column inches and millions of page views online as aging editors took yet another opportunity to hope that the 40 - year old Beatles music they grew up with could top the charts once again .
And much of the attention focused on the possibility that Beatles songs would be available on Apple 's iTunes Music Store rather than any of the other download services available , giving Apple even more coverage .
This was followed by widespread coverage of the UK versions of the Mac versus PC ads , with David Mitchell and Robert Webb sacrificing any comic credibility their characters may have had on the altar of commercialism .
Pronounce and proselytise
Columnists and bloggers queued up to pronounce and proselytise , and every one of them mentioned the Mac in the same breath as the PC .
Finally there was the brilliant coup of announcing that iPod users should not upgrade to Windows Vista because the iTunes software does n't work properly on it , which generated even more coverage .
Since Vista has been available in some form for over a year and the production release of the business version took place two months ago we can only assume that Apple 's legion of Windows programmers had better things to do with their time - surely they could not have intended to spoil Bill Gates ' big day ?
Yet instead of prompting criticism of Apple for not preparing for one of the most widely trailed software launches of the century so far this was seen as another problem for Microsoft .
Not bad for a company whose profitability depends on a music player that is having to compete in a fast maturing market , whose board is under a cloud after problems over share options , and whose charismatic CEO could be ousted if evidence emerges that he was aware of those issues .
The latest example of what has been called the " reality distortion field " around Steve Jobs came last week when the man joined Victoria Beckham in the illustrious list of celebrity bloggers .
Beckham posted about life in California , while Jobs limited himself to a meditation on digital rights management , or DRM .
DRM software like Apple 's Fairplay or Microsoft 's Windows Media DRM should properly be called digital restriction management , since its primary goal is to limit what purchasers can do with downloaded content .
Limit ability
Whether it 's music , films , text or software , a DRM'd file will limit your ability to play , copy , transfer or take extracts from the material .
Fairplay is applied to any song downloaded from the iTunes Music Store and built into every iPod ever shipped .
Apple has refused to license it to any other service or hardware manufacturer and as a result songs bought from Apple can only be played on PCs and Macs running iTunes , and iPods .
( Let 's forget about the Apple / Motorola phone , shall we ? ) .
If Apple switched off Fairplay then they would probably sell a lot more songs , on which they make very little money , and a lot fewer iPods , on which they make a lot
Apple unveils iPhone Apple wants ' end to DRM '
It 's a closed market , one that has attracted the attention of regulators around the world who fear that it could also be an example of unfair market manipulation .
In his post Jobs said that Apple only implemented DRM because the record companies made them do it , and that they were unwilling to license Fairplay because it would make it easier for skilled crackers to break the protection .
This ignores the fact that some of the music on the iTunes store is also available without FairPlay or indeed DRM of any sort from other , less restrictive , services like eMusic .
It also ignores the reality that Microsoft 's widely licensed system has been cracked the same number of times as Fairplay , so the evidence would seem to indicate that Jobs fears are not justified .
Customary practice
Jobs also said that Apple would stop using DRM in an instant if they could .
I do n't believe him .
If Apple switched off Fairplay then they would probably sell a lot more songs , on which they make very little money , and a lot fewer iPods , on which they make a lot .
I do n't buy songs from Apple 's store because I do n't like DRM .
I prefer to buy CDs which I can copy myself , trusting to the fact that this has been customary practice for so long that any attempt to prosecute me under the UK 's restrictive laws would fail in court .
But Jobs can see which way the wind is blowing , and he can see that the record companies are finally tiring of their painful , expensive and ultimately unsatisfactory relationship with DRM .
They have stopped trying to sell broken CDs that can't be ripped to disk , and as a result nearly all of the music that they so painstakingly control when sold over the net is available at higher quality and lower cost to anyone who cares to spend the time taking it .
They are actively exploring alternatives to rigid control of sharing , like flat - rate permissive licensing that would track usage and reimburse artists without limiting what fans can do .
And they are - like EMI - looking to set up their own music stores selling unencumbered tracks direct to fans .
Jobs has to position Apple for this brave new world , and he knows that his charisma is such that if he rushes to the head of queue and claims to be leading the charge then some , at least , will believe him .
Sadly he 's likely to be crushed under foot by those who really understand the music business and did n't sell their souls to the record companies back in the days when they believed in DRM .
LOS ANGELES , May 13 —
The prosecutor who put Charles Manson behind bars now wants to solve another crime — a really simple one , he insists .
So simple that it takes only 1,612 pages to prove his case .
Vincent Bugliosi , whose prosecution of Charles Manson in 1970 led him to write one of the best - selling true - crime books of all time , “ Helter Skelter , ” has now turned his attention to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy .
And that is his full attention : 20 years of research , more than one million words , hundreds of interviews , thousands of documents and more than 10,000 citations .
The result , “ Reclaiming History : The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy ” ( W. W. Norton ) , is due out tomorrow .
His conclusion : Lee Harvey Oswald killed Kennedy , and acted alone .
Why would such a simple conclusion require so much argument ?
“ Because of the unceasing and fanatical obsession of thousands of researchers over the last 43 years , from around the world but mostly in the United States , ” Mr. Bugliosi said in an interview at the cafe of the Sportsmen ’s Lodge Hotel in Studio City , Calif .
“ Examining under a high - powered microscope every comma , every period , every detail on every conceivable issue , and making hundreds and hundreds of allegations , they have transformed this simple case into its present form . ”

It is possible that a peace enforcer would have to fire at an Israeli
" History is the past , but the history of the Holocaust belongs to the German present , " said the Frankfurter Rundschau .
No German soldier should , even theoretically , " be brought into a situation where he has to aim his weapon at an Israeli " , it added .
The Suddeutsche Zeitung said it was " astonishing " that politicians were discussing the idea , while Austria 's Der Standard said it was " unthinkable " that the grandchildren of Holocaust perpetrators might find themselves shooting at the grandchildren of victims .
Responsibility
The secretary general of the Central Council of Jews in Germany , Stephan Kramer , added his voice to those against German deployment .
I think Germany should take part in a multinational force enforcing peace in south Lebanon , but let 's secure the Lebanon / Syria border
Malte Lehming , Der Tagesspiegel
He added that he would still be opposed if the Israeli government agreed .
It is 12 years since Germany 's post - war constitution was changed to allow the use of armed force in international disputes .
In that time they have taken part in peacekeeping operations in the Balkans , Afghanistan , Ethiopia , Sudan and DR Congo .
But the prospect of peace enforcement in Lebanon raises new complications .
For Foreign Minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier , history actually burdens Germany with a responsibility not to walk away , but to get involved .
" I think this is appropriate given the difficult shared history between Germany and Israel , " he told German broadcaster ZDF on Sunday .
' Never again '
His Social Democratic Party , like Chancellor Angela Merkel 's Christian Democratic Union , is divided on the issue , while the three main opposition parties - the Greens , the Liberal FPD and the hard - left PDS - are against .
Germany has sent peacekeepers to the Balkans , Afghanistan and Africa
" It is impossible for a German soldier to use force against an Israeli soldier , " says Mr Brok , head of the parliament 's Foreign Affairs committee .
The opinion editor of Berlin 's Der Tagesspiegel newspaper , Malte Lehming , agrees that this scenario would violate the main lesson of the last century : " Never again . "
" I think Germany should take part in a multinational force enforcing peace in south Lebanon , but let 's secure the Lebanon / Syria border where things like that are less likely to happen , " he says .
" I think we can take that risk . "
Casualties
Joerg Himmelreich of the German Marshall Fund argues that the nightmare scenario is not , in fact , at all likely .
The World Cup has shown how relaxed people feel about pride and their nation , without producing any kind of nationalist feelings
Elmar Brok
But he warns that German participation in Lebanon would be a new step for Germany in a different way , as it would be the first time German troops had taken part in a mission with a high probability of casualties .
How long will it be before Germany can contemplate the possibility of German peace - enforcers confronting Israeli troops ?
" Maybe 10 years , 15 years ... " says Malte Lehming .
" The World Cup has shown how relaxed people feel about pride and their nation , without producing any kind of nationalist feelings , " says Elmar Brok .
" But we remember the past and we will not forget our responsibility . "
Stephan Kramer thinks German soldiers will never be able to approach the borders of Israel .
" Even if it 's the great - great - grandchildren , I cannot imagine it , " he says .
" Around the world , almost everywhere , but not when there is a chance of confrontation with an Israeli soldier . "
There is a crisis facing internet radio : new mandatory royalty rates are so high that they will force most or all independent internet radio stations off the air .
Since the passage of the DPRA and its successor , the DMCA , internet radio has been required to pay high royalties for internet music broadcasts .
Higher than satellite radio pays , and much much higher than over - the - air broadcasters pay ( which is nothing , since they 're legally exempted by copyright law ) .
You would think that royalties would be set based on the types of " music transmissions " - for example , a subscription on - demand music service would pay more than a traditional radio service that plays the same music programming to a group of listeners .
I mean , you would think that AM / FM , Satellite and Internet radio stations would all pay the same kinds of royalties , right ?
But no !
Due to DPRA and DMCA , digital transmission services ( e.g. over the internet or digital satellite ) are treated very differently .
This is because back in the 90s , when the DMCA was passed , people equated " digital " with perfect , and the record labels were freaking out .
After all , the labels thought that home taping was killing music ... and that was just cassettes .
Imagine , they though , what will happen when people can make unlimited perfect digital copies of our music !
So the RIAA successfully lobbied for legislation in the DPRA that said any digital transmissions of sound recordings ( i.e. music ) would require royalty payments to be made .
Yet the DPRA is based on a fundamentally flawed assumption -- the assumption that " digital transmission " allows unlimited perfect digital copies of the original work .
Internet radio stations do not distribute perfect digital copies of the original copyrighted performance ; instead , they use formats such as MP3 and WMA .
Such broadcasts are drastically " compressed " and ( I 'm sure you know ) nowhere near a perfect digital copy .
Most broadcasters also segue songs together , and make announcements over the beginnings and ends of songs .
It 's just like over - the - air radio , and in many cases , the audio quality of the internet broadcast is slightly inferior to an analog FM broadcast !
So over the years , internet radio broadcasters have had to pay royalties to playback music that they do n't otherwise have explicit permission from the copyright owner to play .
This is called the " compulsory license " , and it's paid to an organization that was spun out of the RIAA called SoundExchange .
SoundExchange collects royalties and is supposed to distribute them to artists .
So far , so good .
We 've been paying 10 % of our gross revenues .
( 10 % for first $ 250,000 ; 12 % in excess of that . )
We feel a bit cheated because the over - the - air guys do n't have to pay at all , and the satellite guys only pay about 7.5 % .
Still , we can work with it .
Some smaller stations can't handle the minimum annual fee of $ 2000 , so they join aggregators like LoudCity or Live365 to reduce their royalty costs .
But every 5 years , the royalties get adjusted .
And for the 2006 - 2010 period , it was quite an adjustment .
In March of 2007 , the CRB ( Copyright Royalty Board ) released the rates for 2006 - 2010 .
Not only have they have gone up drastically - by 2010 , the rates will be 150 % higher than the 2005 rates .
In addition , and more problematic for independent web radio stations : the way royalties are computed has changed : stations can no longer pay based on our gross revenue but have to pay based " aggregate tuning hours " .
For SomaFM , this means our royalties for 2006 will be increased retroactively from about $ 20,000 to about $ 600,000 .
That 's more than 3 times what we made in 2006 .
And our royalties for 2007 , based on our current audience size , will be over $ 1 million dollars , and over $ 1.5 million by 2009 .
That 's if our audience size stays the same .
Now SoundExchange says these rates are fair .
Since the hearings were closed to the public , we do n't know everything that was presented to come up with these supposed fair rates .
But we have heard that the rates were based on mis-information , including the fact that the numbers were based on on - demand music subscription services .
The bottom line is that the new rates are so high that US - based internet radio as we know it will go away .
Even big players like Pandora have said they do n't have a viable business plan with these new increases in royalties .
So a coalition of net broadcasters have gotten together , started a site called SaveNetRadio.org and working together with the trade association DiMA , the Digital Media Association and a DC lobbying firm and have succeeded today in getting a bill introduced in the house that would legislate the royalties paid by interent broadcasters are on par with those paid by other services , like satellite radio .
The bill is called the " Internet Radio Equality Act " , it was introduced on April 26th by Representatives Jay Inslee ( D - WA ) and Donald Manzullo ( R - IL ) .
The Internet Radio Equality
Act would :
1 . Annul the CRB decision and set royalty rates at 7.5 % of revenues – the same rate that satellite radio pays – for 2006 - 2010 ; and
2 . Change the rate - setting standard currently used by the CRB to determine Internet radio royalties , and substitute the standard that applies to most other statutory licenses , including satellite radio , jukeboxes and sound recordings .
So now it is up to you , and up to Congress to pass this bill .
Get on the phone , call your congressman / woman and ask them to support the " Internet Radio Equality Act " introduced by Representatives Inslee and Manzullo .
It does n't take long to call .
If your representative is already aware of it , they 'll just want to take your name and address ( to verify you are a constituent ) and will tally your call for support .
If they 're not aware of it , you might need to explain it to them .
But SaveNetRadio.org has some basic " talking points " to help you out with that .
We are at a critical juncture for internet radio .
If this bill does n't get passed , independent net radio will be forced off the air ; and the only net broadcasters will be those who can afford to treat their internet radio operations as a " loss leader " - and that means the same big companies that run all the AM and FM stations out there .
Is that what you want to see happen to net radio ?

Bugfixes
2006 was the year of Web 2.0 design and pretty much that type of design got old real quick .
Below I have listed the Top 7 Freshest Designs in my mind that I have come across this year and although these kind of lists can easily be argued , I try to provide you with enough reasoning behind my decisions .
Cuban Council
Why choose a site that was n’t even designed in 2006 as a fresh design for 2006 ?
In a year where we saw a return of the one - page layout , I still find that Cuban Council ’s timeless design outdoes all - newcomers in not only providing a rewarding experience , but also a helpful one .
Everything you need to know about them is on one page and it does n’t seem too long or overbearing on the user .
Instead the site draws you in even deeper and you begin to wish that there was more to it , not because you need to see more , but because you want to see more .
Suicide Girls
Another site done by the guys over at Cuban Council and to me is the best community - designed site around .
Mike and I were going over the site yesterday and its amazing the attention to detail the design has received .
Every section of the site is designed with a purpose and if the naked pictures of women and great community were n’t enough to draw you in , then the design should finish the job .
Be sure to checkout my previous article on SG , The Genius of Suicide Girls .
N.Design Studio
Taking just a glance at the layout you can see there is nothing special about it .
A simple two - column layout which has become the defacto layout of all sites since blogs hit it big .
What you get though when going through the site is to see the work of a true artist .
There are talented designers and then there are talented artists and rarely are we subjected to both on one site at once .
I can only hope we see a bit more imaginations going wild on the web in ’07 with regards to illustrations .
The Morning News
Not a design that will garner many design awards , but that does not take away from the fact that it deserves some attention .
The Morning News design lets you know one thing as a reader and that is the site is all about content .
The design enhances the experience and stays out of the way and this is very refreshing in a period where people associate successful content sites with the amount of ad space they are selling .
UX Magazine Like The Morning News , UX Magazine is focused on just giving you content .
The homepage design is a brilliant use of a grid system along with a flexible - width layout .
The layout adjusts depending on the size your browser window without taking away anything from the homepage .
Although this type of system puts a stranglehold on how you must present your content and what type of content can fit within the site , I still think it is a brilliant use of different design elements .
Veerle I almost started off this sentence with “ one of the best female designers around ” , but quickly realized that is my male mind kicking in and not giving Veerle her due respect .
She is one of the best designers on the web and her site is one of the top five design blogs on the web in my opinion .
Nothing beats great content and a great design and no other site in my mind epitomizes this relationship more than her’s .

Excellent article in the Seattle Post - Intelligencer today about the dwindling efficacy of the FBI .
The Bush Administration restructured the FBI after 9/11 to focus on national security , but did not eliminate any of the FBI ’s traditional responsibilities .
And to handle all the extra work , the FBI was given no additional money .
( “ Do more with less , ” it was told . )
The result ?
You guessed it .
Lower prosecution rates .
Says one retired FBI official , “ we realized we were going to have to pull out of some areas — bank fraud , investment fraud , ID theft — cases that protect the financial infrastructure of the country . ”
The White House and the Justice Department have failed to replace at least 2,400 agents transferred to counterterrorism squads …
Two successive attorneys general have rejected the FBI ’s pleas for reinforcements behind closed doors .
As the quote from the retired official would indicate , it appears the lack of manpower has mainly hit the FBI ’s ability to prosecute white collar crime .
The P - I ‘s findings :
Overall , the number of criminal cases investigated by the FBI nationally has steadily declined .
In 2005 , the bureau brought slightly more than 20,000 cases to federal prosecutors , compared with about 31,000 in 2000 — a 34 percent drop .
White - collar crime investigations by the bureau have plummeted in recent years .
In 2005 , the FBI sent prosecutors 3,500 cases — a fraction of the more than 10,000 cases assigned to agents in 2000 .
The paper looks at specific cases of Native Americans and elderly residents in the Seattle area who were fleeced by sophisticated financial scams — the sort of thing that has been traditionally part of the FBI ’s jurisdiction .
In the cases examined by the P - I , none of the victims got the help they requested from Bush ’s FBI .
It ’s a long , long article .
If you ’re interested , you can read the whole thing here .
Also , I can tell you what the FBI was busy doing from 9/11 until the invasion of Iraq : partnering with the Department of Justice to scare the bejeezus out of Americans with show trial terror prosecutions and conveniently timed terror alerts , all of which are documented in the “ DoJ / FBI ” section of the Mother Jones Iraq War Timeline .

Viewed from such a height , these majestic elephants look like nothing more than black mirages against the barren landscape .
They are trudging across the sands , dry river - beds and rocky outcrops of Damaraland in Namibia , where they will use their trunks to burrow deep into the arid ground in search of lifegiving water .
The African elephant is the only animal on the continent that digs for water , delving several feet into the earth until they hit an underground spring to quench their thirst .
Once they have hit liquid gold , they will suck it up through their trunks , then spray it into their mouths , drinking as much as two gallons at a time , and swallowing up to 50 gallons a day .
Afterwards , they will move on and other creatures will rush to drink at the open wells they have left behind .
Elephants are thought to teach each other about likely water sources , and a typical herd roams over an incredibly large distance in search of food , travelling up to 500 miles from home at a normal walking rate of 3.5 mph to 5mph .
But , despite their bulk , they are still capable of far faster speeds if threatened - a charging elephant can rush at speeds hitting 25 mph .

2006 was an eventful year .
Every MP3 player manufacturer had something to say .
Apple had its iPods , Creative went with the Zens and iriver turned miniature .
To date , MP3 players had never looked as gorgeous .
The fashion bug has really bitten with the Samsung and Apple paving the way with designer styles .
The Samsung YP -K5 and YP - T9 certainly look chic in glossy piano black , while the new slim Apple iPod nano can give any waifish supermodel a run for her money .
The hard drive MP3 player is definitely on its way out , with most of the new models introduced in the latter half of the year using flash memory .
Video playback is still not the big hunky - dory feature it was supposed to be as most consumers seem to be contented with a player that meant mainly for audio .
Samsung once made a promise it would overtake Apple in the MP3 player market by 2007 .
Along the way , we have seen it progress from crudely designed Yepps to its more modish iterations .
Come CES 2007 , Samsung will unveil the YP - K3 - - a svelte , voguish number that seems to be the most credible challenger to the iPod nano to date .
It has been a bumper year for Creative as it took the mickey out of Apple with its Zen patent amidst the shadow of its losses .
However , revitalized with a renew partnership with Apple for iPod accessories , Creative looks ready for a better year ahead .
It has been traditional for Creative to launch a powerful product at CES and we looking forward to a new Zen that incorporates Creative 's unique Xi-Fi audio enhancement technology .
Though Sony has not made much headway in the market , it still retains nostalgic value for its former audio prowess .
2007 may prove to be a crucial year for Sony to regain its former glory before it 's really too late .
The NW - S705 F looks extremely promising with Sony 's trademark ingenuity in play .
Packaging noise - canceling technology into an MP3 player itself ?
Unheard of and more innovations in the same vein may push the former Japanese doyen of portable audio back to the top .
iriver really shocked the world with the S10 .
Before its appearance , nary had anyone imagined a functional color - screened MP3 player to reach such a minuscule size .
In the MP3 world , iriver may be the new king of miniaturization .
But product launches has been scratchy for iriver .
While there is the E10 and the S7 , there has been precious few offerings in comparison to other big name manufacturers .
Is iriver branching out to another field , much like how Apple intends to move into the cellular phone realm ?
Only time will tell .
Top 10 best MP3 players of 2006 year

A forty - two minute gravity train route from New York City to Hawaii
About four hundred years ago⁠ — sometime in the latter half of the 17th century ⁠
— Isaac Newton received a letter from the brilliant British scientist and inventor Robert Hooke .
In this letter , Hooke outlined the mathematics governing how objects might fall if dropped through hypothetical tunnels drilled through the Earth at varying angles .
Though it seems that Hooke was mostly interested in the physics of the thought experiment , an improbable yet intriguing idea fell out of the data : a dizzyingly fast transportation system .
Hooke ’s calculations showed that if the technology could be developed to bore such holes through the Earth , a vehicle with sufficiently reduced friction could use such a tunnel to travel to another point anywhere on the on Earth within three quarters of an hour , regardless of distance .
Even more amazingly , the vehicle would require negligible fuel .
The concept is known as the Gravity Train , and though it seems inconceivably difficult to construct , it has received some serious scientific attention and research in the intervening centuries .
The basic concept behind the gravity train is straightforward :
At each end of the tunnel , an observer looking into the hole would see a downhill slope .
If a train at one end of the tunnel were to release its brakes , the force of gravity would immediately pull the train downhill and cause the train to accelerate much like a roller coaster .
Steeper slopes would result in more speed , with the highest acceleration occurring in the straight - down tunnels which cross the Earth ’s center .
The train would continue to accelerate until reaching the halfway point , at which time its inertia would be at odds with gravity and it would begin to decelerate .
As Hooke ’s data indicates , if the train operated in a frictionless environment it would reach the surface on the opposite end of the tunnel at the exact moment that its speed reached zero .
Naturally , a gravity train operating in a real - world environment would need to bring along enough horsepower to make up the friction loss .
One interesting property of the Gravity Express is that its transit time would always be very , very close to forty - two minutes regardless of the distance travelled .
In fact , if the Earth were a perfect sphere , the trip time would always be exactly forty - two minutes and twelve seconds .
Greater distances would be traversed in the same amount of time as short ones because the train ’s maximum speed would be increased enough to exactly make up the difference .
Due to nature of gravity , this forty - two minute trip time would be consistent for any size of vehicle .
Consider a hypothetical Gravity Express station in Spain which connects to a sister station in New Zealand .
The tunnel would be straight down because its route would intersect with the Earth ’s center , making for an interesting departure as the train entered sudden free - fall .
The vehicle would accelerate to a maximum velocity of about 17,670 miles per hour before beginning to decelerate , and it would travel in a straight line for 7,920 miles ⁠ — a trip which would be 12,440 miles on the surface .
Forty - two minutes after their stomach - turning departure , the train and its passengers would pull to a gentle stop at their destination on the other side of the world .
Though Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton corresponded on the subject of objects falling through the Earth , they did so merely as an intellectual exercise .
The first serious suggestion to build a gravity train was n’t put forward until the 1800s , presented to the Paris Academy of Sciences by a group of scientific optimists .
Unsurprisingly , the Academy opted to defer the ambitious suggestion .
The concept was lost to obscurity until the 1960s , when physicist Paul Cooper published a paper in the American Journal of Physics suggesting that gravity trains be considered for a future transportation project .
Though the article sparked some lively debate , the proposal was not taken very seriously .
While friction does put a damper on the gravity train concept , clearly the biggest technical hurdle would be in creating such massive tunnels in the first place .
A hole with a ten foot radius which passed through the Earth ’s center would displace over twelve billion cubic feet of rock , all of which would need to be hauled away somewhere .
Furthermore , the Earth ’s mantle and core writhe with extreme pressure and heat , so any tunnel would have to be lined with a protective shield to keep it intact .
Unfortunately no currently known materials can even withstand the hostile environment , let alone insulate the tunnel from the intense heat .
Due to these extreme temperatures , the trip may never be survivable by humans .
But the technology would be extremely useful for rapid , unmanned cargo delivery between continents , essentially becoming a massive global dumbwaiter .
Those who find sport in reflecting on such wild ideas have suggested that the tunnel could be evacuated of air to eliminate wind resistance , though such a feat would prove almost as challenging as the drilling itself .
Some have also postulated that such a train could be magnetically levitated to eliminate friction in situations where the tunnel does not pass through the Earth ’s center ; though if electromagnets were used , the amount of energy consumed by the apparatus would rise drastically .
A more viable location for the gravity train would be on a celestial body which is not troubled by an atmosphere , plate tectonics , and magma , such as the Earth ’s moon .
The concept would be the same , though a planet with a density different from that of Earth would also have a different standard trip length .
Though the Gravity Express may seem impossible ⁠— or at best absurdly impractical ⁠ — it is appealing to consider the possibility of extremely rapid transit across the planet with very little expenditure of energy per trip .
Certainly the creation and reinforcement of such tunnels is well beyond the reach of our current technology , but the future is full of surprises .
Following up the last post , which describes how the Bush Administration failed to take action to prevent the 9/11 attack — Condi Rice gave the New York Post an exclusive interview rebutting Bill Clinton —
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice yesterday accused Bill Clinton of making “ flatly false ” claims that the Bush administration did n’t lift a finger to stop terrorism before the 9/11 attacks .
Rice hammered Clinton , who leveled his charges in a contentious weekend interview with Chris Wallace of Fox News Channel , for his claims that the Bush administration “ did not try ” to kill Osama bin Laden in the eight months they controlled the White House before the Sept. 11 attacks .
“ The notion somehow for eight months the Bush administration sat there and did n’t do that is just flatly false – and I think the 9/11 commission understood that , ” Rice said during a wide - ranging meeting with Post editors and reporters .
“ What we did in the eight months was at least as aggressive as what the Clinton administration did in the preceding years , ” Rice added .
Rice lies .
I combed through the article looking for all the ways the Bushies were at least as aggressive as what Clinton did .
Here ’s one :
“ I would just suggest that you go back and read the 9/11 commission report on the efforts of the Bush administration in the eight months – things like working to get an armed Predator [ drone ] that actually turned out to be extraordinarily important , ” Rice added .
In the last post I quoted a Newsweek article from 2002 ( not free content ) which said ,
Rumsfeld vetoed a request to divert $ 800 million from missile defense into counterterrorism .
The Pentagon chief also seemed uninterested in a tactic for observing bin Laden left over from the Clinton administration : the CIAâ€™s Predator surveillance plane .
Upon leaving office , the Clintonites left open the possibility of sending the Predator back up armed with Hellfire missiles , which were tested in February 2001 .
But through the spring and summer of 2001 , when valuable intelligence could have been gathered , the Bush administration never launched even an unarmed Predator .
Hill sources say DOD didnâ€™t want the CIA treading on its turf .
Ah , but that ’s old information .
What did the 9/11 report actually say ?
I found comments on the drone beginning on page 210 :
The main debate during the summer of 2001 concentrated on the one new mechanism for a lethal attack on Bin Ladin–an armed version of the Predator drone .
In the first months of the new administration , questions concerning the Predator became more and more a central focus of dispute .
Clarke favored resuming Predator flights over Afghanistan as soon as weather permitted , hoping that they still might provide the elusive “ actionable intelligence ” to target Bin Ladin with cruise missiles .
Learning that the Air Force was thinking of equipping Predators with warheads , Clarke became even more enthusiastic about redeployment .
The CTC chief , Cofer Black , argued against deploying the Predator for reconnaissance purposes .
He recalled that the Taliban had spotted a Predator in the fall of 2000 and scrambled their MiG fighters .
Black wanted to wait until the armed version was ready . ”
I do not believe the possible recon value outweighs the risk of possible program termination when the stakes are raised by the Taliban parading a charred Predator in front of CNN , ” he wrote .
Military officers in the Joint Staff shared this concern .
There is some dispute as to whether or not the Deputies Committee endorsed resuming reconnaissance flights at its April 30 , 2001 , meeting .
In any event , Rice and Hadley ultimately went along with the CIA and the Pentagon , holding off on reconnaissance flights until the armed Predator was ready .
The CIA ’s senior management saw problems with the armed Predator as well , problems that Clarke and even Black and Allen were inclined to minimize .
One ( which also applied to reconnaissance flights ) was money .
A Predator cost about $ 3 million .
If the CIA flew Predators for its own reconnaissance or covert action purposes , it might be able to borrow them from the Air Force , but it was not clear that the Air Force would bear the cost if a vehicle went down .
Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz took the position that the CIA should have to pay for it ; the CIA disagreed .
Second , Tenet in particular questioned whether he , as Director of Central Intelligence , should operate an armed Predator . ”
This was new ground , ” he told us .
Tenet ticked off key questions : What is the chain of command ?
Who takes the shot ?
Are America ’s leaders comfortable with the CIA doing this , going outside of normal military command and control ?
Charlie Allen told us that when these questions were discussed at the CIA , he and the Agency ’s executive director , A. B. ” Buzzy ” Krongard , had said that either one of them would be happy to pull the trigger , but Tenet was appalled , telling them that they had no authority to do it , nor did he .
Third , the Hellfire warhead carried by the Predator needed work .
It had been built to hit tanks , not people .
It needed to be designed to explode in a different way , and even then had to be targeted with extreme precision .
In the configuration planned by the Air Force through mid-2001 , the Predator ’s missile would not be able to hit a moving vehicle .
White House officials had seen the Predator video of the “ man in white . ”
On July 11 , Hadley tried to hurry along preparation of the armed system .
He directed McLaughlin , Wolfowitz , and Joint Chiefs Vice Chairman Richard Myers to deploy Predators capable of being armed no later than September 1 .
He also directed that they have cost - sharing arrangements in place by August 1 .
Rice told us that this attempt by Hadley to dictate a solution had failed and that she eventually had to intervene herself .
On August 1 , the Deputies Committee met again to discuss the armed Predator .
They concluded that it was legal for the CIA to kill Bin Ladin or one of his deputies with the Predator .
Such strikes would be acts of self - defense that would not violate the ban on assassinations in Executive Order 12333 .
The big issues –who would pay for what , who would authorize strikes , and who would pull the trigger–were left for the principals to settle .
The Defense Department representatives did not take positions on these issues .
The CIA ’s McLaughlin had also been reticent .
When Hadley circulated a memorandum attempting to prod the deputies to reach agreement , McLaughlin sent it back with a handwritten comment on the cost - sharing : ” we question whether it is advisable to make such an investment before the decision is taken on flying an armed Predator . ”
For Clarke , this came close to being a final straw .
He angrily asked Rice to call Tenet . ”
Either al Qida is a threat worth acting against or it is not , ” Clarke wrote . ”
CIA leadership has to decide which it is and cease these bi-polar mood swings . ”
These debates , though , had little impact in advancing or delaying efforts to make the Predator ready for combat .
Those were in the hands of military officers and engineers .
General John Jumper had commanded U.S. air forces in Europe and seen Predators used for reconnaissance in the Balkans .
He started the program to develop an armed version and , after returning in 2000 to head the Air Combat Command , took direct charge of it .
There were numerous technical problems , especially with the Hellfire missiles .
The Air Force tests conducted during the spring were inadequate , so missile testing needed to continue and modifications needed to be made during the summer .
Even then , Jumper told us , problems with the equipment persisted .
Nevertheless , the Air Force was moving at an extraordinary pace . ”
In the modern era , since the 1980s , ” Jumper said to us , ” I would be shocked if you found anything that went faster than this . ”
September 2001 The Principals Committee had its first meeting on al Qaeda on September 4 .
On the day of the meeting , Clarke sent Rice an impassioned personal note .
He criticized U.S. counterterrorism efforts past and present .
The “ real question ” before the principals , he wrote , was “ are we serious about dealing with the al Qida threat ? . . .
Is al Qida a big deal ? . . .
Decision makers should imagine themselves on a future day when the CSG has not succeeded in stopping al Qida attacks and hundreds of Americans lay dead in several countries , including the US , ” Clarke wrote .
“ What would those decision makers wish that they had done earlier ?
That future day could happen at any time . ”
So , in a nutshell , through the spring and summer of 2001 , when valuable intelligence could have been gathered , while Condi and crew were spinning their wheels over an armed Predator , the Bushies never launched even an unarmed Predator .
The DOD didnâ€™t want the CIA treading on its turf .
This is Condi ’s version of being “ at least as aggressive ” as the Clinton Administration ?
At least the Clinton White House made use of unarmed drones to spy on bin Laden .
Condi is blowin’ smoke .
The Drone exemplifies exactly the opposite of what Condi claims .
There ’s more on the dithering over the drones revealed in CBS and Fox News reports from 2003 .
Now , let ’s go back to the New York Post story for Condi ’s other criticism of the Clinton interview .
She also said Clinton ’s claims that Richard Clarke – the White House anti-terror guru hyped by Clinton as the country ’s “ best guy ” – had been demoted by Bush were bogus .
“ Richard Clarke was the counterterrorism czar when 9/11 happened .
And he left when he did not become deputy director of homeland security , some several months later , ” she said .
How can you tell when Condi Rice is lying ?
It ’s when her lips are moving .
As Fred Kaplan explained ,
Clarke was n’t a Cabinet secretary , but as Clinton ’s NCC , he ran the “ Principals Committee ” meetings on counterterrorism , which were attended by Cabinet secretaries .
Two NSC senior directors reported to Clarke directly , and he had reviewing power over relevant sections of the federal budget .
Clarke writes ( and nobody has disputed ) that when Condi Rice took over the NSC , she kept him onboard and preserved his title but demoted the position .
He would no longer participate in , much less run , Principals ’ meetings .
He would report to deputy secretaries .
He would have no staff and would attend no more meetings with budget officials .
Clarke probably resented the slight , took it personally .
But he also saw it as a downgrading of the issue , a sign that al - Qaida was no longer taken as the urgent threat that the Clinton White House had come to interpret it .
( One less - noted aspect of Clarke ’s book is its detailed description of the major steps that Clinton took to combat terrorism . )
The Post staff , in their official function as propagandists and mouthpieces for the VRWC , did not fact check Condi ’s remarks .
That this exclusive was given to the Post suggests to me that Condi did n’t want the piece fact checked ; indeed , she did n’t want the general public looking at it real hard at all .
By talking to the New York Post she catapulted the propaganda directly at the Right .
But now I want to go back to the 9/11 Commission Report quote from above .
This bit is on page 212 :
The Principals Committee had its first meeting on al Qaeda on September 4 .
On the day of the meeting , Clarke sent Rice an impassioned personal note .
He criticized U.S. counterterrorism efforts past and present .
The “ real question ” before the principals , he wrote , was “ are we serious about dealing with the al Qida threat ? . . .
Is al Qida a big deal ? . . .
Decision makers should imagine themselves on a future day when the CSG has not succeeded in stopping al Qida attacks and hundreds of Americans lay dead in several countries , including the US , ” Clarke wrote .
“ What would those decision makers wish that they had done earlier ?
That future day could happen at any time . ”
The Principals Committee had its first meeting on al Qaeda on September 4 .
Yeah , real aggressive , Condi .
Took you more than seven months to hold a bleeping meeting .
The Principals Committee of the National Security Council was established by Poppy Bush , a.k.a. “ 41 . ” Apparently this is a Big Deal committee .
Richard Clarke sent a memo to Condi Rice on January 25 , 2001 , which said “ We urgently need . . . a Principals level review on the al Qida network . ”
The “ urgent ” meeting was held , finally , on September 4 .
In Condi World , urgent and aggressive mean “ dither for more than seven months . ”
Finally , let ’s go back to the New York Post story one more time :
The secretary of state also sharply disputed Clinton ’s claim that he “ left a comprehensive anti-terror strategy ” for the incoming Bush team during the presidential transition in 2001 .
“ We were not left a comprehensive strategy to fight al Qaeda , ” Rice responded during the hourlong session .
Would it surprise you if I told you Condi is lying ?
Let ’s go back to this page .
Washington , D.C. , February 10 , 2005 – The National Security Archive today posted the widely - debated , but previously unavailable , January 25 , 2001 , memo from counterterrorism coordinator Richard Clarke to national security advisor Condoleezza Rice – the first terrorism strategy paper of the Bush administration .
The document was central to debates in the 9/11 hearings over the Bush administration ’s policies and actions on terrorism before September 11 , 2001 .
Clarke ’s memo requests an immediate meeting of the National Security Council ’s Principals Committee to discuss broad strategies for combating al - Qaeda by giving counterterrorism aid to the Northern Alliance and Uzbekistan , expanding the counterterrorism budget and responding to the U.S.S.
Cole attack .
Despite Clarke ’s request , there was no Principals Committee meeting on al - Qaeda until September 4 , 2001 .
The January 25 , 2001 , memo , recently released to the National Security Archive by the National Security Council , bears a declassification stamp of April 7 , 2004 , one day prior to Rice ’s testimony before the 9/11 Commission on April 8 , 2004 .
Responding to claims that she ignored the al - Qaeda threat before September 11 , Rice stated in a March 22 , 2004 Washington Post op - ed , “ No al Qaeda plan was turned over to the new administration . ”
Two days after Rice ’s March 22 op - ed , Clarke told the 9/11 Commission , “ there ’s a lot of debate about whether it ’s a plan or a strategy or a series of options — but all of the things we recommended back in January were those things on the table in September .
They were done .
They were done after September 11th .
They were all done .
I did n’t really understand why they could n’t have been done in February . ”
Also attached to the original Clarke memo are two Clinton - era documents relating to al - Qaeda .
The first , “ Tab A December 2000 Paper : Strategy for Eliminating the Threat from the Jihadist Networks of al - Qida : Status and Prospects , ” was released to the National Security Archive along with the Clarke memo .
“ Tab B , September 1998 Paper : Pol - Mil Plan for al - Qida , ” also known as the Delenda Plan , was attached to the original memo , but was not released to the Archive and remains under request with the National Security Council .
It appears
The NSC is still sitting on Tab B , “ Pol - Mil Plan for al - Qida . ”
Or else sometime on September 12 , 2001 , Condi ran it through a shredder .
Update : More about the “ comprehensive strategy to fight al Qaeda ” that Condi does n’t remember at ThinkProgress .
Apparently the 9/11 Commission says she got it .
As the Clinton administration drew to a close , Clarke and his staff developed a policy paper of their own [ which ] incorporated the CIAâ€™s new ideas from the Blue Sky memo , and posed several near - term policy options .
Clarke and his staff proposed a goal to â€œroll backâ€ al Qaeda over a period of three to five years â€ ¦[ including ] covert aid to the Northern Alliance , covert aid to Uzbekistan , and renewed Predator flights in March 2001 .
A sentence called for military action to destroy al Qaeda command - and control targets and infrastructure and Taliban military and command assets .
The paper also expressed concern about the presence of al Qaeda operatives in the United States.â€  [ p. 197 ]
Update update : From the Department o’ Stupid Sheep — Several rightie bloggers , including the Anchoress , complain that “ the MSM ’ did n’t fact check Clinton .
Everything Condi says is , of course , automatically true .
None of the sheep bothered to check what she told the New York Post against the 9/11 commission report .

This is big news .
It 's been clear for some time now that Monica Goodling , as liaison between DoJ and the White House , is at the crux of the scandal .
Indeed , David Iglesias is on record saying that she holds the " keys to the kingdom . "
Now that she 's been given immunity and is being forced to testify , the hope is that she will implicate Rove and Miers to the point where their testimony will become inevitable ( although it will certainly be met with strong resistance from the Bushies ) .
CNN Political Ticker :
Congressional investigators checking for political motive in the Justice Department 's dismissal of selected U.S. attorneys last year now have a federal court order to hear from a former high - level government attorney , Monica Goodling .
In a request for immunity from prosecution filed and granted within hours Friday at U.S. District Court , the House Judiciary Committee said the protected testimony could shed light on circumstances " surrounding recent terminations of certain United States attorneys , representations to Congress regarding those circumstances , and related matters . "
The panel 's leadership believes Goodling took part in " crucial discussions " leading to a " termination list " that was then " refined and finalized , " according to a letter last month from committee Chairman John Conyers , D - Mich . , that was sent to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
Republicans and right - wing sympathizers have been insisting for weeks now that there is " no evidence of a crime . "
Leaving aside the reams of circumstantial evidence that 's piled up , the primary reason there has been no " smoking gun " is because Congress has n't had access to the most crucial aspects of the potential crime -- Goodling and the millions of missing emails .
Well , they have Goodling now .
Showpaper Benefit with Asa Ransom , Sigmund Droid , the Muggabears , and Nymph @ 92Y Tribeca , 8 pm , $ 7 - 20 sliding - scale donation
The Showpaper has been covering all - ages shows in the NYC and tri-state area for almost two years and has turned into a huge success .
It ’s a simple formula , and a magnificent idea : a huge list of all - ages d.i.y. shows , absurdist horoscopes , a hipster - kid “ I saw you ” section and consistently rad artwork printed every two weeks and distributed to coffee shops / venues / etc. to keep your broke , ( possibly underage ? ) ass in the loop .
But printing 10,000 copies without any advertising or other commercial support is n’t easy .
Showpaper stays afloat because of volunteers , donations , and revenues made at the benefit shows that they throw every two weeks .
Help the Showpaper help you by coming out to 92Y Tribeca and checking out Asa Ransom , Sigmund Droid , the Muggabears , and Nymph .
The timing was no doubt intentional .
On the same day that Apple had announced a major press conference to unveil something " fun " ( which turned out to be an Intel - powered Mac mini and an iPod speaker the size and shape of a giant brick ) , Microsoft tantalizingly offered journalists the opportunity to come and witness a new and exciting technology .
As Redmond was a much shorter trip for me than Cupertino , I obliged .
What was this fabulous new technology ?
All they would tell us was that it was n't Origami , the much - rumored touchscreen mini Tablet - PC device .
So as our small group sat there in the giant Microsoft Executive Briefing foyer , deprived of any Internet access ( wireless or otherwise ) , we wondered what they could possibly be on about .
We were gathered into a small room , where a host of video and still cameras crowded around the display panel on the wall .
Kevin Schofield , the General Manager of Microsoft Research , introduced a team of four researchers who would be demonstrating the new technology .
First , he gave a background chat about Microsoft Research itself .
From left to right : Dr. AJ Brush , Dr. Marc Smith , Dr. Steven Drucker , Kevin Schofield , Brian Meyers .
The division was formed in 1991 by Bill Gates and former theoretical physicist Nathan Myhrvold , then Microsoft 's Chief Technology Officer .
Today it is headed by Rick Rashid , who is best known for creating the Mach kernel and operating system at Carnegie - Mellon University .
( Ironically , it would be his student , Avie Tevanian , who would wind up turning Mach into a commercial product with NeXTstep and then OS X ) .
Over 700 people in five separate labs ( one in Redmond , one in Silicon Valley , one in Bangladore , one in Beijing , and one in Cambridge ) work in Microsoft Research .
Rather than thinking about how their inventions might fit into the marketplace , the members of the division are more concerned about how many papers they can get published in academic journals .
This creates an atmosphere more similar to a university than a large corporation , according to Dr. Marc Smith , PhD , who describes himself as a " Research Sociologist . "
While the group is n't directly concerned with getting its products out into the marketplace , they still like to see the fruits of their labors being utilized .
Schofield finished his introduction by saying :
" We believe that tech transfer [ from research to products ] is n't a logistical and mechanical process , but actually a social process . "
By this time , the assembled journalists were anxious to see exactly what was going to be unfurled .
I was the first one in the room to have noticed the Dance Dance Revolution ( DDR ) pad on the floor , but even I was surprised when it turned out to be the centerpiece of the event .
Dr. AJ Brush , PhD , jumped on the pad and showed us how the team had used the off - the - shelf gaming interface to demonstrate a new method of human - computer interaction .
Closeup of the e-mail interface .
Firing up a custom - built e-mail application , she used her feet on the up and down arrows to scroll through messages , and hit another pad to open and close them for viewing .
E-mails could be flagged using the left and right arrows .
Deleting was the most fun , as it involved jumping and hitting a specific combo ( right arrow and the diagonal between up and left ) together .
Dr. Brush said that test subjects had gotten quite excited about deleting e-mails and became a bit too carried away in cleaning out their Inbox .
Dr. Stephen Drucker then demonstrated a second possible application for the pad , a smooth - scrolling photo management application in the vein of iPhoto or " Microsoft Codename Max . "
The user could quickly run through photos and sort them into different folders using the DDR pad , although Dr. Brush did admit that in testing it was found that one 's right leg could get tired while constantly scrolling to the next photo .
Dr. Drucker demonstrates a photo sorting program .
The floor was then opened up to questions .
First off the bat was the obvious one : it looks like fun , but when the fun wears off , how practical is such a system ?
Schofield admitted that there have to be specific , measurable increases in productivity for a new system like this to take off , but that there were some cases where people might welcome a change of pace in the way they interact with their computer .
The opportunity to stand up , stretch , and get a small bit of exercise while simultaneously sorting through your Inbox might appeal to busy workers who are hunched over their keyboards all day long .
Besides , he concluded , " there is no law that says work can't be fun . "
The question of a learning curve for the new user interface was brought up .
Dr. Drucker replied that while they had n't done coordination testing , they had discovered that learning a new UI can be fun , as many opening levels in video games have shown .
However , the user does not necessarily have to hit both pads simultaneously for performing certain functions : one foot can be planted at a time for people who do n't feel comfortable with jumping .
I verified this myself on the pad .
Jumping , however , is clearly much more fun .
Will this device actually make it into a shipping product ?
" That we leave up to the product groups .
They are the experts , " Schofield said .
" Personally , I can envision this being in all sorts of products . "
One example that was given was a display kiosk in a mall , where shoppers could interact with the display without putting down their bags .
Such kiosks are already planned for demonstration purposes inside Microsoft buildings .
I asked if there was a difference in reactions to the system between older and younger test subjects .
My wife , who is a dancer , introduced me to DDR a few years ago .
While we have often played it together , most of the people we play with in the arcades are half our age .
The few people in our age category who even dare to try the system are extremely tentative and often fail to pick it up at all .
Indeed , when the journalists were offered a chance to try out the system themselves , very few came forward immediately .
However , researcher Brian Meyers insisted that when their adult test subjects overcame their initial embarrassment and got used to the idea , they quickly became fans of the system .
Is the world ready for Dance Dance E-mail ?
Perhaps not , but the point of the press event was not just to show that one can hook up a DDR pad to business applications ( although this is the first time I 've heard anyone come up with that idea ! ) .
It was designed to show us that Microsoft is busy thinking about new and different ways that people can interact with their computers .
Microsoft Research actually has a ton of other projects on the go , as I discovered later during an informative chat with Dr. Smith .
Most of these , like systems designed to sift through Usenet news posts and track which people are providing useful information , are interesting but highly conceptual .
Jumping up and down on a DDR pad to delete your e-mail , however , fits neatly into a news sound bite .
Besides , it 's good exercise .
Last fall , a sophomore at Arizona State University named Matthew Jezierski started a club in honor of a group he considers to be oppressed and undervalued : the white male .
The Caucasian American Men of ASU grabbed attention thanks to the club 's name , but Jezierski insisted it was n't a white pride organization .
Jezierski , who is fluent in Polish ( he was born in the United States ) , said he only wanted to promote cultural awareness .
He did n't understand why being of European descent is anything to be ashamed of .
CAMASU copied its mission statement almost verbatim from the African American Men of ASU , with a few obvious changes .
Its supporters ( at one time , the club had 40 members ) told reporters that white males are quickly becoming a minority on college campuses and in America , and that their numbers are declining by outstanding percentages .
Um , not quite .
Not in Arizona , and definitely not at Arizona State .
In 2006 , 283 black ASU students graduated with about 7,000 of their white peers .
Once again , Arizona became the national butt of a joke .
Even Conan O'Brien made fun .
" A group of students at Arizona State University have caused a controversy because they 've been going by the name The Campus Caucasian Club , " O'Brien said in a November broadcast of Late Night .
" Administrators have asked the group to go back to its original name , The Golf Team . "
When the club started , Jezierski told the campus newspaper , " This club is a way to instill pride in each other and not be ashamed we 're Caucasian males . "
But recently , when contacted by New Times , he sounded sheepish .
" It dwindled off , " he said .
" There 's not much interest in it . "
He did n't really want to talk about the club anymore .
Maybe that 's because Jezierski was n't really the one behind it in the first place .
The truth is that a woman started the Caucasian American Men of ASU : a blond - haired , blue - eyed former beauty pageant queen named Emily Mitchell , who never even went to Arizona State University .
Without Mitchell , an energetic 24 - year - old hired gun dropped onto the ASU campus from South Carolina , Jezierski's idea would likely have remained just that .
Emily Mitchell looks like just another undergrad , but she 's actually a political organizer working for a Virginia - based nonprofit called the Leadership Institute .
The Leadership Institute was founded in the late ' 70s to put young conservatives into prominent positions .
Four years ago , LI started a campus leadership program .
It 's Mitchell 's job to push students like Jezierski to become active in what she calls the conservative movement .
She takes the kids from idea to action .
And she relishes the controversy some of her organizations , like CAMASU , create .
Mitchell started 57 clubs on Arizona college campuses during the 2006 - 2007 school year , including CAMASU ; the New Sexual Revolution , an abstinence club ; and the Network of Enlightened Women , a conservative women 's group opposed to radical feminism and concepts such as women 's studies or The Vagina Monologues , one she says she 'd like to be a part of if she were a student .
She also started Choice Magazine , a libertarian publication .
And she supported established clubs like ASU 's anti-abortion group Students for Life , founding chapters on other college campuses .
Surprisingly , she does n't work closely with the College Republicans .
Though some of her acolytes may be involved with that group , she does n't seek them out .
The Leadership Institute is interested in focusing on issues , not politicians .
It would be easy to stereotype Emily Mitchell  she 's just the kind of Ann Coulterish conservative ( even looks like her ) the left loves to hate .
But Mitchell defies the stereotype of the slack - jawed racist or religious wing nut .
A member of Mensa and a perennial scholarship winner , she holds a degree in biology .
And she 's charming .
In one breath , Mitchell can explain why she 's against Hillary Clinton , affirmative action and feminism , then switch gears with a smile and offer you a cookie .
She considers herself a new kind of activist , in charge of an anti-revolutionary revolution , but what 's more interesting is that someone her age is even active in politics at all .
This generation of college students is n't exactly known for political activity , and ASU has rightfully earned the nickname Apathetic State University .
The only times students are truly excited about politics are when they involve a brush with celebrity .
Last fall , when former President Clinton visited campus to push the Democratic midterm agenda , students mobbed Hayden Lawn to catch a glimpse .
Few showed interest in the warm - up act , stump speeches from local politicians  the ones they'd be voting for or against ( assuming they voted at all ) .
Clinton 's charisma was what drew them outside in the hot sun for over an hour .
And in 2004 , when ASU hosted the third presidential debate between George W. Bush and John Kerry , the campus was abuzz with political activity  but only when the national news cameras were rolling .
When CNN filmed an episode of Crossfire live from Hayden Lawn , students packed the front rows , waving signs every time the cameraman zoomed out for a panoramic shot , but were silent when the cameras turned off for the day .
That 's not to say ASU students are alone in their indifference .
In 2004 , during a presidential election heavily marketed to the youth vote , turnout among college students was disappointing .
And in the 2006 midterm elections , largely touted as a turning point in American politics , the youth vote will likely be lower than that of any other demographic when the numbers are crunched , says Michael McDonald , a voter behavior expert for the Brookings Institute .
" I will bet my life , quite frankly , that older people voted at higher rates than younger people in 2006 , " he says .
Clint Bolick , a conservative libertarian who recently joined the Goldwater Institute to launch a center for constitutional law , says the numbers are n't surprising .
" The last time I remember an issue galvanizing young people was a very long time ago , and that was the draft , " he says .
" Even the Iraq war may seem a little abstract because we do n't have a draft .
Issues that directly affect students are n't there . "
It does n't seem to bother , or even occur to , Emily Mitchell that many students on campus just are n't interested .
The last thing on her mind is apathy .
" It has n't been that long since I was a college student .
I remember sitting in political science class with my hand raised for seven minutes and nobody calling on me because they thought they knew what I was going to say , " she says .
" I remember thinking that The Vagina Monologues was not the best way to help women and wishing I could do something about it , " she says .
She got her wish .
" We are the new rebels .
The liberals are the academic elite , and we are the ones breaking them down , " she says .
" They 're like the generals .
But there are only a few of them .
We 're the ones in the trenches doing the fighting .
So , I can walk away with a smile knowing the ones on the highest horses are shot first . "
The Leadership Institute is not the only conservative group challenging what some perceive as a leftist bias on college campuses .
Controversial writer and activist David Horowitz has his Campaign for Academic Freedom .
Aside from penning a couple of books on the topic ( The Professors and Indoctrination U : The Left's War Against Academic Freedom ) , Horowitz and his colleagues at the Freedom Center in Los Angeles have written an " academic bill of rights , " which they have tried to make both federal and state law .
Horowitz says a professor 's politics should never be known , even in a political science class .
He says too many students graduate with a bias learned in classes like Chicano or women 's studies .
Whether or not bias exists on ASU 's campus is difficult to gauge .
There is no document that lists the political leanings of professors .
Mitchell is n't the first conservative to stir the pot at ASU .
In the 1980s , a group of three  Jay Heiler , Matthew Scully and Len Munsil  rose to powerful campus leadership positions , causing a stir on campus and earning the nickname The God Squad .
( All have been heard from since : Heiler went on to become chief of staff for then - Governor Fife Symington , Scully wrote speeches for Dan Quayle and George W. Bush , and Munsil made an unsuccessful bid for governor last year . )
Like Emily Mitchell , the three stood to fight for conservative values , and they also found a professor , Mark Reader , to pick a fight with .
Reader was a political science professor involved in the anti-nuclear movement .
He spoke about liberalism and conservatism in the classroom , where his opinions about nuclear power and other environmental issues were well - known .
He was singled out by The God Squad and a D.C. - based group , Accuracy in Academia , as a mouthpiece for the left .
It got so bad for him that he received death threats , and the story made national headlines .
Reader , who retired nine years ago , says the persecution of professors who want to challenge the powers that be continues , and so does political inertia from students .
" People have been kept ignorant .
They just do n't understand the relationship between cause and effect , " he says .
" There 's been a great failing of the educational process .
The other thing going on is :
Young people , those who are thoughtful , might have an underlying sense of hopelessness . "
Emily Mitchell is one young person full of hope .
She starts her workday early .
She 's up by 6 a.m. , answering e-mails from a network of students stretched across Arizona and New Mexico .
Then , she has phone calls to make .
A typical daily schedule is filled with notes like , " Call Chasity and reassure her and check progress , " and " Call Sandra to ask how meeting went . "
By midmorning , Mitchell 's in her white Jeep Cherokee ( she calls it the Protest Mobile ) , on her way to school .
She works at all the ASU campuses , Scottsdale , Mesa and Glendale community colleges , and other schools in the Valley .
She 's never exactly sure where she 'll wind up by the end of the day , so she keeps the Jeep stocked with essentials : poster board , paint , a table , a bullhorn and cookies .
On a hot morning in April , she 's running a few minutes behind schedule for a demonstration she helped ASU Students for Life stage .
It 's national Pro-Life T - shirt day , so Mitchell 's got a full plate of demonstrations to manage .
Before she arrives at the display outside ASU 's Memorial Union , the six or so students manning the table mill around a graphic , eight - foot anti-abortion poster .
They arrange pamphlets and plastic fetuses on a table and glance around for someone to educate .
Dozens of students pass by without even blinking .
No one stops to ask questions , and the anti-abortion students hang back .
They are n't passing out literature or starting conversations .
But once Mitchell shows up , they become lively .
They still are n't shouting slogans ( though one boy is setting up a microphone ) , but they work harder to appear interested and a few students walk up to the table to ask questions .
A thin , sweet - looking girl looks around nervously .
This is her first time working a table for Students for Life .
She smiles when she sees Mitchell .
Mitchell 's kind , but firm .
" Can we practice the dialogue ? " she asks the girl .
As the girl opens her mouth to say yes , a group of three boys approaches the table full of questions about late - term abortion .
When her student falters , Mitchell is there to redirect the conversation .
The next group that comes up gets Mitchell 's spiel almost verbatim , and the trainee gains confidence .
When asked a question about rape , she gives a bold answer  " many women think of the baby as a source of joy that came out of a bad experience "  but gives it with enough Mitchell - esque confidence that the group seems to accept what she 's saying .
After about an hour , Mitchell is running late for another anti-abortion event at ASU West .
The club there started just a week ago and it needs her help .
She jumps into the Protest Mobile , almost hitting a curb as she exits the garage .
" Women drivers , no survivors , " she says , laughing at her joke .
The long drive to the West Valley , through tedious traffic , does n't faze her .
She spends hours behind the wheel as part of this job .
" I try to be equally as excited about green lights as I am upset about the red ones , " she says .
On the way , she talks about how happy she is with her students  especially the girl she worked with earlier .
" She made a very daring argument about the case of rape , but she made it calmly and logically , and they accepted it , " says the proud teacher .
" She 's not beating them over the head with a stick . "
Mitchell develops close friendships with her students , sometimes lingering over food with them at Waffle House until early in the morning .
She says over and over that the job is n't about her ; it 's about what the students can do .
Without her presence on campus , they may be a little lost .
( An understatement . )
" We teach them how to generate effectiveness , " she says .
" I figure out the color bicycle they want to ride and teach them how to ride it . "
After arriving at ASU West , Mitchell walks quickly to where her students are already set up .
Their display is much less impressive than the one at the Tempe campus :
It 's just a table with some students hanging around in anti-abortion shirts .
Mitchell slips on a shirt and hands the leader of the group a clipboard to hold the membership signup sheet he 's holding .
Again , she 's in charge  at first , doing most of the talking to students that pass by .
Students on this campus are even less - engaged , but she manages to collect some signatures .
After a while , the other volunteers take her cue and collect signatures on their own .
About an hour and a half later , they call it a day and Mitchell gets ready to drive down to Coolidge , where she plans to do some recruiting at Central Arizona College and then follow up with students at Scottsdale Community College , who are planning another anti-abortion demonstration tomorrow .
Unlike other activist leaders , Mitchell insists she 's not in the business of changing minds .
She 'd rather reach students who are already conservative and then motivate them into action .
She 's fond of referring to the Leadership Institute as a " do tank , " not a think tank .
" It 's not my job to convince every person on every college campus that conservative is right , " she says simply .
But she does have a strategy .
Her philosophy is that you start by simply showing up , giving conservative students a point to rally around .
And it does n't hurt to have a display that grabs attention .
One idea she borrowed from a Texas LI representative is an anti-illegal immigration game she calls " hole in the border . "
The premise is simple : Paint a map of America on a piece of plywood , cut a big hole in it and have students toss beanbags through the hole .
" Of course , everyone gets it in because the hole is so big , " she says .
" We give out prizes [ that say ] ' Congratulations !
Free in - state tuition !' or ' You do n't have to pay your hospital bills . '
The carnival atmosphere makes everyone want to play .
We had a blind guy play , and he got it in on the first try . "
The Leadership Institute takes care of its representatives , who usually are fresh out of college .
They work for 10 weeks during each semester , receiving $ 500 for each group they start .
The Institute covers living expenses .
Though LI promotes conservative values , it is registered as a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) nonprofit and lists itself as nonpartisan .
But it is clear that founder and president Morton Blackwell , at least , is a staunch Republican .
He 's served in various parts of the RNC since 1965 and is currently a Republican committeeman for Virginia .
Campaign finance records reveal Blackwell has made thousands of dollars in personal donations to Republican candidates , including Steve Forbes and President Bush .
There were no donations listed for any Democratic candidates or organizations .
The group 's Web site includes a list of " deep blue campuses " ( ASU is n't on it ) and a downloadable video called " Roots of the Ultra Left , " with with segments featuring titles like " What Socialists Really Think About Your Family and our American Culture . "
The group sells cufflinks and ties emblazoned with capitalist Adam Smith 's profile .
" There is nothing on campus that could be described as conservative , " Blackwell says .
" It 's really outrageous .
Families that send their kids to college do n't expect they 're going to be in left - wing indoctrination centers . "
That 's one of the reasons he started the campus leadership initiative Mitchell is a part of .
Representatives hit campus every fall behind tables and recruitment posters with a picture of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher under the word " yes , " and Michael Moore and Fidel Castro under the word " no . "
Blackwell names Mitchell as one of the program 's most effective representatives .
" We try and select people who are going to be mature and responsible .
Dealing with young people , you always have a mixed bag , " he says .
Emily , he adds , is one of its stars .
Mitchell is accustomed to being a star .
Her life is one success story after another .
Born in Lancaster , South Carolina , she says she had a pretty typical upbringing .
Her dad was in textiles .
As a child , she competed in pageants and won the title of Little Miss Lancaster , where the biggest part of the competition was the interview question .
The committee asked 9 - year - old Mitchell what she thought of rap music .
" I told them I thought it was abysmal , " she says .
She lost interest in pageants by the time she got to high school , though much later , she lived her childhood dream one more time , winning the title of Miss Lancaster and competing in the Miss America - sponsored Miss South Carolina pageant .
She did n't win , but she says it was enough just making it as Miss Lancaster .
She discovered politics in college .
Like many in her generation , Mitchell says it was the September 11 terrorist attacks , which struck when she was a freshman at Duke University , that grabbed her attention .
She remembers riding the shuttle bus in silence to class that day and , later , watching other students burn a flag on campus , which shocked her .
" It was seeing the celebration of the attack on our country that made me realize I have to do something about being American , " she says .
It was then that she started to wake up to what she says is the " leftist bias " on university campuses .
By the next year , she had transferred to Furman University , a small liberal arts school in Greenville , South Carolina , where she initially majored in political science .
It was a political science class that brought her to the Leadership Institute .
Mitchell recalls a world politics class with a professor who told her there was no way she could get a passing grade on a paper she was writing defending capitalism over communism .
" She told me there was no suitable argument , " says Mitchell .
The professor , Katherine Kaup , recalls the exchange differently .
" I remember the paper was n't strongly researched and I told her to rewrite it .
She was n't happy , " she says .
" I encourage them to take any view as long as they defend their argument .
I 'm not a socialist , either .
I 'm a card - carrying Republican . "
Around that time , Mitchell met a campus representative from the Leadership Institute who helped her figure out how to found a conservative club , Leaders for a Free America .
" I thought :
This is really important .
I knew if this was happening to me , I was n't the only student who had been discriminated against because of her political beliefs , " she says .
From that day forward , she was part of the conservative activist movement .
" I was n't very heavily involved with College Republicans , " she says .
" I was involved with issues themselves .
Because what 's the purpose of any political party ?
Not to advance ideals .
It 's to get people elected .
That 's it .
Let 's get to the core of things .
Let 's get down to business .
That 's not the concern of any political party . "
She does n't like to talk about what candidates she might endorse .
As a representative of LI , she feels she needs to keep her views to herself and push the work she does with her students .
She will disclose this : " If I meet a political candidate in favor of naps and cookies [ I 'd endorse him ] . "
She 's joking , of course .
That 's the fun thing about Mitchell  one second , she 's dead serious about politics ; the next , she 's goofing around .
" People need to loosen up , " she says .
" Activism is fun . "
Originally , she wanted to get her doctorate and become a professor .
But although Mitchell loved the work , she hated the research system that requires professors to spend more time hunting for funding than teaching or researching .
" The reason I cited to my colleagues was , ' I actually want to be an artist , ' " she says , because " molecular biologists do n't ask questions about art . "
Actually , in addition to all the other things she does , Mitchell is an artist .
She sells her oil paintings and photography at the Butterfly Gallery in Tucson , her home base .
She lives with her husband , a fellow scientist who works at the University of Arizona .
The pair met in college when he was a lab assistant in her genetics lab , where she schemed to get his attention .
" I pretended I did n't know what I was doing with a microscope , " she says .
" He 'd come fix it and I 'd mess it up again .
I 'd actually already worked in a lab for like a year at this point . "
With a world so fueled by politics , you 'd expect Mitchell to have a mate who shares her views .
He does n't  at least , he 's somewhat further to the left .
" Well , he claims he 's not , but he 's moderately liberal , " she says .
" I have plenty of liberal friends .
I was in a sorority , and the president was as liberal as they come . "
After she graduated from Furman , Mitchell moved to Tucson , where her fiancé , Geoff , lived .
There , she got a job in a research lab and worked there until funding ran out .
The two were married in June 2006 .
Around that same time , she was contacted by the Leadership Institute and was offered a job as a field representative .
She started last September .
Though she maintains her views are not relevant , that it 's the students who count , she mentions more than once that if she could join any of the clubs she helped start , the Network of Enlightened Women would be her top pick .
And when she talks about a recent protest of illegal immigration that she helped stage at Northern Arizona University , it 's pretty clear the First Amendment is a big deal to her .
During that protest , there was a telling altercation .
Mitchell and three NAU students were collecting signatures for a petition and had set up a wall made out of cardboard boxes to represent the border .
It turned out they were sitting in an area that was n't designated as a free speech zone , and an administrator asked them to move .
The students refused until the police were called .
Video footage of the incident is on YouTube .
A favorite tactic of Mitchell 's is to photograph and record every action and post it online as an example of leftist bias .
When she talks about the incident , her sweet Southern twang hardens , and it 's obvious she 's angry that the police were called .
" We were , like , you can move our stuff , but you can't move us .
I always encourage my students to take the moral high road , so that means not doing illegal things , " she says .
But is she willing to get arrested for the cause ?
She hesitates when asked .
" There are things I want to say , but you know . . .
There 's me and then there 's me doing my job .
As an LI employee , I 'm not going to advocate getting arrested , " she says , pausing before adding , " If I was the student , I would have [ let them arrest me ] for standing in a place that 's free . "
Though she is required to take the " moral high road " as an employee of the Institute , Mitchell is n't a stranger to confrontation .
The incident at NAU is tame compared with an altercation she had in October regarding the Caucasian men 's club .
She takes a firm stance that the club is necessary to even a playing field dotted with culturally specific clubs and classes in Chicano studies , women 's studies and African American studies .
She says the club was meant to promote equality ( and , of course , just like other clubs on campus , it could not exclude anyone from membership based on race or gender ) .
" It 's about balance .
The African American men . . . their name is equally divisive .
They 're excluding Caucasian men .
The Caucasian population is declining by percentages making it a growing minority , " Mitchell says .
" He [ Jezierski ] speaks fluent Polish and was offended .
There 's a separate Latino studies or Chicano studies , but nothing for people who are white in color .
They do n't have anything to represent Slavic or German studies .
Why are n't European cultures considered diverse ? "
But that 's not so surprising .
What is shocking is a fight that took place between Mitchell and two professors .
What really happened that day depends on whom you 're talking to .
Mitchell has her story , the professors have theirs .
The details of the police report are straightforward .
On September 29 , Mitchell was manning a table and passing out fliers to drum up interest in CAMASU .
Two fine arts professors  Kate Duncan and Claudia Mesch  passed the table and stopped to talk to Mitchell .
Mesch asked Mitchell why the club was necessary , which sparked a debate between the women  the older , who had lived through the civil rights movement , and the younger , Mitchell , who insisted that movement was a thing of the past .
" I said , ' With all due respect , the civil rights movement happened before most of these students ' parents were even born .
It 's been 40 years since the ' 60s , ' " says Mitchell .
" She was just beside herself . "
As the exchange became more heated , Mitchell pulled out her camera and began to record a video , asking the professors for their names .
( Click here to view a clip . )
At that point , Duncan , who had remained quiet , told Mitchell she did not want her picture taken and refused to give her name .
Mitchell continued recording , holding the camera three inches from the professor 's face .
When she refused to stop , Duncan reached forward to block the lens .
( View the footage here . )
This is where the two stories differ .
Duncan says she only wanted to stop Mitchell from taking her picture and did not reach out to harm Mitchell or the camera .
Mitchell says Duncan violently attempted to grab the camera , breaking it and injuring her hand in the process .
In a statement she wrote for the police report , Mitchell says , " Her short fingernails scratched my hand until I bled . . .
I somehow managed to physically pry her fingers out of my skin and off my camera . . .
I tried to get them to repeat their hate crime speech . . the only information they would give me was that they were in the College of Fine Arts . "
After the altercation , the professors left .
In a memo sent to Mary Stevens in ASU 's Office of General Counsel , Duncan wrote that she did n't think " much more of it other than it was unpleasant and that the girl was really out of control . "
However , Mesch filed a complaint with ASU 's police department .
Mitchell did n't forget about it , either , though she also did n't go directly to the police .
A couple of hours after the incident , she went to the dean 's office and spoke to the secretary and the dean , " still shaking like a leaf , " according to the report .
She showed them the video , but no one recognized the professors .
She did not file a police report for several days .
She wrote in a victim 's statement : " Five days later , the injury is still sore and scabbed over . "
In a photograph taken of her hand by ASU police , it is difficult to see the marking .
The report says only that the skin around the injury was pink and " appeared to be a surface scratch . "
On the day Mitchell reported the alleged assault , she directed students to post fliers around campus featuring pictures of Duncan and Mesch under the heading " wanted for assault . "
The fliers listed the number for ASU Police but were not associated with the official investigation .
The fliers violated several parts of ASU 's sign - posting policy and were taken down .
Meanwhile , Mitchell was kicked off campus and allowed back only on official business .
On the Arizona Growler , a conservative blog based in Tucson , Mitchell offers her defense : " The 'WANTED . . . for assault ' that the professor believes may have implicitly indicated her in the crime was just a them on the Old Wild West kind of posters .
We do live in Arizona , after all . . . there was absolutely no vindictive or premeditated motive at work here . "
Under Morton Blackwell 's direction , Mitchell decided to press assault charges .
The case was dismissed in March .
Mitchell says she was told the case was thrown out because there was n't enough evidence to show a reasonable likelihood of conviction " beyond a reasonable doubt that an injury occurred . "
Duncan , a quiet woman who prefers to spend her time in Alaska 's Yukon Valley studying indigenous beadwork , declined the request for an extensive interview but did say she 's glad the ordeal is behind her .
Mitchell was perturbed that the charge was dismissed , and she 's not thrilled with the legal system .
" Does n't it defeat the purpose of defense if they wo n't defend you unless they 're convinced they can win ? "
Today , the Caucasian American Men of ASU no longer exists .
The club was never officially recognized by the university , and Jezierski acknowledges that interest fell off after a month or so .
In April , Jezierski told the ASU student newspaper that he'd decided to join a Polish group on campus and that other members joined such clubs as the German Devils Deutsch Club .
Though one member of the club was quoted as saying the name was pretty much just a publicity stunt , Jezierski denies it .
" It was a serious issue , " he told the State Press .
But not serious enough to actively pursue  not without Emily Mitchell around .
Not long after CAMASU was founded , Mitchell 's turf was expanded to include New Mexico .
Without constant care , a club like CAMASU was n't likely to grow .
Mitchell has decided to move on .
Her contract with the Leadership Institute expired in April , and she decided not to renew .
Instead , she 's decided to become a high school biology teacher .
Some of Mitchell 's clubs have survived .
The New Sexual Revolution ( a group that works for abstinence before marriage ) has about a dozen committed members , with a much larger e-mail list .
And when the club hosted Dr. Janet Smith , an anti-contraceptive advocate , on campus this spring , more than 100 students showed up to hear her talk .
Another of Mitchell 's projects , Choice Magazine , just went to press on its second issue and has a dedicated core of students writing and editing it .
In all , she started 57 clubs in Arizona and New Mexico .
At $ 500 each , that 's some lucrative activism  but still , she 's ready to move on .
" People keep asking me if I 'm sad , " she says .
" But once you 're a part of the movement , you never really leave . "
Four years ago this week , the tanks rolled for what President Bush originally called , “ Operation Iraqi Liberation ” – O.I.L .
I kid you not .
And it was four years ago that , from the White House , George Bush , declaring war , said , “ I want to talk to the Iraqi people . ”
That Dick Cheney did n't tell Bush that Iraqis speak Arabic well , never mind .
I expected the President to say something like , “ Our troops are coming to liberate you , so do n't shoot them . ”
Instead , Mr. Bush told , the Iraqis ,
“ Do not destroy oil wells . ”
Nevertheless , the Bush Administration said the war had nothing to do with Iraq 's oil .
Indeed , in 2002 , the State Department stated , and its official newsletter , the Washington Post , repeated , that State 's Iraq study group , “ does not have oil on its list of issues . ”
But now , we 've learned that , despite protestations to the contrary , Condoleezza Rice held a secret meeting with the former Secretary - General of OPEC , Fadhil Chalabi , an Iraqi , and offered Chalabi the job of Oil Minister for Iraq .
( It is well established that the President of the United States may appoint the cabinet ministers of another nation if that appointment is confirmed by the 101st Airborne . )
In all the chest - beating about how the war did badly , no one seems to remember how the war did very , very well – for Big Oil .
The war has kept Iraq 's oil production to 2.1 million barrels a day from pre-war , pre-embargo production of over 4 million barrels .
In the oil game , that 's a lot to lose .
In fact , the loss of Iraq 's 2 million barrels a day is equal to the entire planet 's reserve production capacity .
In other words , the war has caused a hell of a supply squeeze — and Big Oil just loves it .
Oil today is $ 57 a barrel versus the $ 18 a barrel price under Bill “ Love - Not - War ” Clinton .
Since the launch of Operation Iraqi Liberation , Halliburton stock has tripled to $ 64 a share — not , as some believe , because of those Iraq reconstruction contracts — peanuts for Halliburton .
Cheney 's former company 's main business is “ oil services . ”
And , as one oilman complained to me , Cheney 's former company has captured a big hunk of the rise in oil prices by jacking up the charges for Halliburton drilling and piping equipment .
But before we shed tears for Big Oil 's having to hand Halliburton its slice , let me note that the value of the reserves of the five biggest oil companies more than doubled during the war to $ 2.36 trillion .
And that was the plan : putting a new floor under the price of oil .
I have that in writing .
In 2005 , after a two - year battle with the State and Defense Departments , they released to my team at BBC Newsnight the “ Options for a Sustainable Iraqi Oil Industry . ”
Now , you might think our government should n't be writing a plan for another nation 's oil .
Well , our government did n't write it , despite the State Department seal on the cover .
In fact , we discovered that the 323 - page plan was drafted in Houston by oil industry executives and consultants .
The suspicion is that Bush went to war to get Iraq 's oil .
That 's not true .
The document , and secret recordings of those in on the scheme , made it clear that the Administration wanted to make certain America did not get the oil .
In other words , keep the lid on Iraq 's oil production — and thereby keep the price of oil high .
Of course , the language was far more subtle than , “ Let 's cut Iraq 's oil production and jack up prices . ”
Rather , the report uses industry jargon and euphemisms which require Iraq to remain an obedient member of the OPEC cartel and stick to the oil - production limits — “ quotas ” — which keep up oil prices .
The Houston plan , enforced by an army of occupation , would , “ enhance [ Iraq 's ] relationship with OPEC , ” the oil cartel .
And that 's undoubtedly why Condoleezza Rice asked Fadhil Chalabi to take charge of Iraq 's Oil Ministry .
As former chief operating officer of OPEC , the oil cartel , Fadhil was a Big Oil favorite , certain to ensure that Iraq would never again allow the world to slip back to the Clinton era of low prices and low profits .
( In investigating for BBC , I was told by the former chief of the CIA 's oil unit that he'd met with Fadhil regarding oil at Bush 's request .
Fadhil recently complained to the BBC .
He denied the meeting with the Bush emissary in London because , he noted , he was secretly meeting that week in Washington with Condi ! )
Fadhil , by the way , turned down Condi 's offer to run Iraq 's Oil Ministry .
Ultimately , Iraq 's Oil Ministry was given to Fadhil 's fellow tribesman , Ahmad Chalabi , a convicted bank swindler and neo -con idol .
But whichever Chalabi is nominal head of Iraq 's oil industry in Baghdad , the orders come from Houston .
Indeed , the oil law adopted by Iraq 's shaky government this month is virtually a photocopy of the “ Options ” plan first conceived in Texas long before Iraq was “ liberated . ”
In other words , the war has gone exactly to plan — the Houston plan .
So forget the naive cloth - rending about a conflict gone haywire .
Exxon - Mobil reported a record $ 10 billion profit last quarter , the largest of any corporation in history .
Mission Accomplished .

Simple .
Ah Ha !!
7 November , 2006
The following was origanally posted to the beginners list .
If you have questions the beginners list is a good place to go for help .
You can find the beginners list here .
Learning Smalltalk is definitely and experience .
There is a major “ Ah - ha ! ” moment prerequisite .
It is really amazing to see people hit that “ Ah - ha ! ” .
Some people do it quickly but most take some time .
I ’ve seen it come after even a years worth of practical hands on programming , so do n’t get frustrated if it does n’t come right away .
The best I can do to help you is to give you some hints on how to get there yourself .
1 ) Object message .
Programming in Smalltalk really does n’t get much harder then this concept .
Object message .
it := Consider the Concept .
you := Person new .
you live : it .
you breathe : it .
you sleepOn : it .
What is the Object ?
( An instance of a class or class definition )
What is the message ?
Everything is Smalltalk follows this pattern ; there is an Object and a message .
The message or method may have parameter .
2 ) Your code goes everywhere !
One of the first questions I ’m always asked is ; “ Where does my code go ? ”
The answer is EVERYWHERE !
In Smalltalk you are building objects .
By that I mean you can model real things .
Pick anything and think of it as a component of the rest of the system , and consider what components make up this thing .
For example : aShoe .
a Shoe :=
Shoe new .
a Shoe laces : ShoeLace greenLaces .
a Shoe color : Color green .
a Shoe price : ( USDollars dollarValue : 12 ) .
a Shoe owner : aManufacturer .
You can see that there are many different components or Objects that can make up what you are modeling .
Relationships can be modeled , new components can be added , you are free to model what ever you want .
So where does your code go ?
It goes where it is needed .
It goes in the object that needs that code .
For example sell a shoe :
Manufacturer >> sell : aShoe to : aPerson
“ sell a shoe to aPerson collect price , update books and decrease inventory ”
aPerson collectMoney : aShoe price .
self updateMonthyBooks : ( Sales item : aShoe price : aShoe price date :
Date today ) .
has Inventory := self removeFromInventory : aShoe .
has Inventory if False : [
self backOrder : aShoe
] .
You can see lots of objects that are implied in this code but look at where the code is .
a Person which is an instance of Person is responsible for paying so collectMoney : is on Person .
There could be lots of ways that a person could pay so let the person object handle that .
The manufacturer has its own account books so it should be able to updateMonthlyBooks : which could be sent to an AccountingSystem instance .
I also hear : “ Once I make a really great shoe , how do I hook that into the rest of the system ? ”
This really confuses some people .
Try to see your program as more then just pieces , but instead as a whole entity .
When you realize that your program could start like this : ShoeStore open .
Or MyWorld turn .
Or MyWorldsTime start .
Or Universe explode .
It ’s easy to consider how a shoe might fit in your program .
3 ) Polymorphism and Inheritance .
Do I need to understand these to understand Smalltalk ?
YES !!
But do n’t worry .
They are big words for simple concepts .
You are a child of your parents .
You inherit certain characteristics from them , which make you like your parents , but you change some of the characteristics to allow you to be more of yourself ( polymorphism ) .
Polymorphism means having many forms .
So how does that help ?
The concept of objects would be good enough and still be very powerful without this functionality but when you add in Inheritance and Polymorphism you really start to cook !
These concepts really get things moving and allow you to do some fantastic programming .
Let ’s extend the shoe store example .
What if we wanted to sell socks or shoe polish , or custom shoe laces ?
What are the things that are similar that could be modeled as a superclass so that our sales Items could inherit those behaviors ?
Object subclass : SalesItems
instanceVariables : ‘ purchaseDate purchasePrice manufacturer ’
SalesItem subclass : Shoe
SalesItem subclass : ShoePolish
SalesItem subclass : ShoeString
You can see from this example that subclasses of SalesItem inherits the instanceVariables purchaseDate purchasePrice and manufacturer .
We could implement methods on SalesItems that allow us to sell a general item without having to implement these methods on every item .
That is the power of inheritance .
Now what things need to be different for each item ?
Since I ’m making this up as I go let me apologize if this is not the best example .
Say that our store likes to make funky shoes by buying them from the manufacturer , then changing the laces .
We also sell other funky laces , and we allow people to change the laces before they leave the store if they want too .
How are we going to keep track of all this ?
We want to be able to just sell and item without having to worry about this , so
SalesItem>>removeFromInventory : anInventory
“ remove this item from anInventory ”
anInventory removeFromInventory : self .
Now if you call this method on ShoePolish then anInvetory will removeFromInventory : self ( self is an instance of ShoePolish since this method is called from there ) .
This method is inherited .
Let ’s change things for Shoe
Shoe>>removeFromInventory : anInventory
“ remove this item and it ’s shoe laces from anInventory and replace shoelace if necessary ”
| lacesWereChanged the ShoesLaces |
anInventory removeFromInventory : self .
lacesWereChanged := self askUserIf : ‘ Were the laces changed ?’.
the ShoesLaces := lacesWereChanged
ifTrue : [ self askUser : ‘ Please select laces from list ’ forItemInList : anInventory shoeLacesList ]
ifFalse : [ self laces ] .
anInventory removeFromInventory : the ShoesLaces .
Now this is polymorphism .
When you remove an item from inventory it will do what you want since it inherits a method from SalesItems .
If it does n’t do what you want you can give your object its own personality by changing what it does .
This is polymorphism .
Go forth and Smalltalk , and if you have questions feel free to ask !
This is the place to do it .

Coffee is a vital source of income for Ethiopia
The US retailer will market , distribute and , in some cases , license Ethiopia 's range of high - quality coffee brands .
A row over the recognition and use of trademarks for its coffee has stymied co-operation between the two sides .
But it is hoped the deal will act as a catalyst to raise prices and improve the livelihoods of Ethiopian farmers .
' Milestone '
Although Ethiopian coffees command a premium price in foreign markets , particularly the US , farmers who grow the beans often live in extreme poverty .
Hopes of an alliance between Starbucks and Ethiopia receded last year when the retailer objected to a plan to license rights to coffee brands in countries where they were not registered as trademarks .
Having the commitment and support of Starbucks will improve the income of farmers and traders
Getachew Mengistie , Ethiopian Intellectual Property Office
Starbucks was also accused of opposing potentially lucrative trademark applications in the US .
But the new agreement acknowledges Ethiopian ownership of popular coffee designations such as Yirgacheffe , Harrar and Sidamo , regardless of whether they are registered or not .
It will also allow Starbucks to use coffee types in certain markets under agreed conditions .
Ethiopian farmers will not receive royalty payments from the deal , but it is hoped that more effective distribution and marketing will help boost demand and , in time , lift prices .
" This agreement marks an important milestone in our efforts to promote and protect Ethiopia 's speciality coffee designations , " said Getachew Mengistie , director general of the Ethiopian Intellectual Property Office .
Starbucks recognises the value of Ethiopian beans
" Having the commitment and support of Starbucks will help enhance the quality of Ethiopian fine coffees and improve the income of farmers and traders . "
Ethiopian coffees have been trademarked in the US , Japan , Canada and Europe , while applications are pending in China , Brazil and India .
Fairtrade concern
But fair - trade campaigners argue that this has done little so far to reward Ethiopian farmers , some of whom receive only $ 300 a year for their crop .
Ethiopian officials said the ultimate aim of the agreement was to try to boost prices , which for Starbucks purchases averaged $ 1.42 per pound last year .
Starbucks said the accord was far more comprehensive than previous agreements .
" We are extremely pleased that this agreement supports both the Ethiopian speciality coffee industry and the farmers and their communities that produce these fine coffees , while allowing us to bring them to our customers , " said chairman Howard Schultz .
Ethiopia is Africa 's largest coffee producer , ahead of Uganda and the Ivory Coast , and coffee is its largest source of foreign exchange .

Can you balance 11 nails on the head of just one ?
Can you balance 11 nails on the head of just one ?
“ Illegal immigrants are imbedded in our nation , so allowing them to apply for a work visa would be a good way to draw them in and set a path for them to become legal , ” said Mr. Nuñez , whose family came from Puerto Rico .
“ If they have been working here and are law - abiding and can contribute to our country , they should be allowed to stay and become citizens . ”
Most of those polled agreed that illegal immigrants should eventually be allowed to apply to become American citizens .
But 59 percent said that former illegal immigrants should be considered for citizenship only after legal immigrants who have played by the rules .
Under the Senate bill , illegal immigrants would have to wait eight years before they could become permanent residents and at least 13 years to become citizens .
Two - thirds of Americans in the survey favored creating a guest worker program for future immigrants .
The bill would create a temporary worker program in which immigrants would come for three stints of two years each , going home for one year between each stint and returning home for good after the third .
More than half of those who favor the guest worker program say the workers should be allowed to apply to become permanent immigrants and eventually American citizens if they maintain a strong work history and commit no crimes .
About a third of those who favored the program disagree , saying guest workers should be required to return home after their temporary period .
The bill does not include a path to citizenship for guest workers .
In the debate , Democrat senators have assailed the temporary worker plan , saying it would create an underclass of easily exploited low - skilled workers .
On Wednesday , senators voted to cut back the number of guest workers to 200,000 from the 400,000 proposed in the bill .
The bill also calls for reinforcing the borders , cracking down on employers who hire illegal immigrants and eliminating the backlog of visa applications from aspiring legal immigrants .
In the poll , 75 percent of those who responded favored tougher penalties for employers of undocumented workers , and 82 percent said the federal government should do more to reinforce the border .
But only 15 percent of respondents favored fences as the main method to reduce illegal border crossings .
Companies do n’t care about money .
At least at our level .
The basic point of this essay is how you can get free stuff from your company , but that ’s crass , so I have to say that it ’s about much more than that .
It ’s about using your existing resources , like your job , to improve your skill set .
It ’s about learning how to write a proposal that will get you funding for anything from a $ 5,000 conference to a new lemonade stand .
And it ’s about realizing that companies do n’t care about money as much as you think .
Have you ever wanted to do something in college or at work that just seemed really cool but was too expensive ?
Maybe it was attending that fancy conference .
Maybe it was getting a new piece of software , or taking someone you ’re working with to a fancy lunch , or traveling to one of your company ’s other offices on the other side of the country .
How come it has n’t happened ?
Usually , the answer is “ there ’s not enough money . ”
Today , I ’m going to show you how to get around that .
When I was in college , there were a few times that this funny thing happened .
A bunch of us would be standing around , asking each other what we were doing that weekend , and people would start to answer .
“ I ’m working on this damn paper , ” someone would say .
“ I ’m tutoring some high - school kids , ” another would say .
Then it would be my turn , and I would say something like , “ I ’m going to Hawaii for a conference this weekend . ”
The rest of them would just stare at me .
It was n’t that I was rich or cool , but just that I had figured out how to do stuff I wanted ( travel ) and get someone to cover it .
Let me explain .
Today , I want to talk about how companies do n’t care about money–at least , not the money you have in mind .
You ’re just one employee .
They are a Big Company or Large University .
See , lots of people have this funny idea that there is n’t enough money to do the things they want at work or at school .
“ My life would be so much easier if I did X , but we do n’t have the budget , ” they say .
I ’m talking about “ resource constraints , ” a fancy word meaning there ’s not enough money or people to do everything .
But I want to show you how to get individual benefits –like attending conferences , getting a new monitor , or a new piece of software –that also benefit your company .
An interesting point :
If a company has 10 employees and each of them makes a $ 50,000 annual salary , the firm is actually paying about $ 75,000 - $ 100,000 / year for each of them when you factor in taxes , benefits , office space , equipment , etc .
That means a small firm of 10 employees has to be making around $ 1 million / year just to break even .
That means there ’s a lot of money in companies .
And they want to use it to grow .
That ’s where you come in .
What do you want ?
Companies do n’t care about spending money on their employees as much as you think .
As I wrote in Do n’t Quit Without Asking For What You Want ,
One of my friends , for example , was unhappy about having to pay the toll every day for her commute–a very understandable complaint .
But she did n’t tell her boss about this , who I guarantee would have moved heaven and earth if he ’d known an employee was close to leaving .
$ 6.00 per day is nothing to companies .
That ’s a simple example .
But there ’s more .
See , companies do n’t care as much about spending money as they care about getting things done and making more money–much , much more than could be saved by being stingy with you .
That ’s why you should be taking advantage of the incredible opportunities you have if you work at a company or attend any large institution .
You want to go a conference ?
No problem , you just have to craft the proposal the right way and find the right person .
Will that piece of software help your team finish the project on time ?
Great , read on to learn how / why your company will sponsor it .
Now , I ’m not talking about small things that you could purchase out of your pocket .
Those are nice , but I ’m talking about large items that you would n’t ordinarily purchase on your own .
Things that are equally useful to the company as you .
A sales seminar you ’ve always wanted to go to , for example , or a $ 5,000 conference , or a trip to meet the remote person you ’ll be working with for the next six months .
Things that help you develop as an employee and help the company , too .
But first , the barriers .
Why do n’t more people ask their companies for these kinds of things ?
I think ( 1 ) we do n’t realize that companies will pay for our personal development and ( 2 ) we do n’t take the initiative of figuring out what we want and asking .
Companies do n’t care about money
I realize I ’m being a little sensationalistic with that title .
But the point is that most large companies care about getting things done and making more money .
If it came down to higher revenues or cost cutting , can you think of one company that would prefer to cut costs ?
I can’t .
Ironically , companies are often far less risk - averse than individuals when it comes to spending money .
They know that costs will be incurred–and some failures will happen–but the successes should outweigh the costs .
Early - stage VCs ( very risky ) expect that out of 10 companies , about 5 will fail , 2 - 3 will do ok / flounder , and 1 will succeed in a huge way .
Basically , they estimate want a 10 x return on average , and they ’re perfectly ok knowing that most of them wo n’t do very well .
Let ’s look at the shipping industry , which also understands very well that it ’s worth paying inconvenient costs like parking tickets , even if they add up to a lot .
UPS , Fedex , and other delivery services get over 7,000 tickets every day in New York City alone , which cost them over $ 102 million in 2005 .
It ’s just the cost of doing business .
A couple weeks ago , I was having lunch with a friend of mine who ’s a former consultant at BCG and now goes to Stanford Business School .
We were both talking about business stuff , and pretty much mocking ourselves for a business idea we both had a few years ago .
We used to think that it would be so smart to to start consulting for management - consulting companies on how to help them cut costs .
For example , they spend an incredible amount of money on last - minute airfare .
“ They waste so much money ! ” I remember saying a few years ago .
“ They ’ll book the most expensive ticket instead of waiting 3 hours to save 50 % . ”
Now we know better .
“ They do n’t care about costs , ” my friend , the former consultant , said .
“ They ’re a top - line company , especially when their consultants are billing $ 500 / hour . ”
In other words , for these companies with a focus on their intellectual capital , time is money .
And they ’d rather spend more to make more–focusing on increasing revenue–than try to cut costs , where the gains are comparatively small .
Luckily , neither of us started this not - quite - stupid - fratboy - business - idea years ago .
Instead , now we can recline and chuckle at our earlier naiveté , feeling supremely self - satisfied .
God , if you were there , you would have been disgusted at how pleased we were with ourselves as we chomped on our Baja Fresh .
( As a funny sidenote , that same friend told me about a consulting firm he once interviewed with .
After the final round , which they flew him to New York for , the firm realized it had n’t given him a drug test .
No problem , my friend said , I can do it out here ( California ) at any drug - test place around .
Nope , the company replied , you have to do it here –that ’s policy .
My friend said , “ That company literally flew me to New York to pee in a cup , and I turned right around and flew back . ” )
Ok , back to companies .
They will pay for more things than you can imagine provided you demonstrate a couple of things :
1 . It ’s relevant to your work .
This is a deal - breaker , and without relevance to your work ( “ I want to visit Puerto Rico because the beaches are nice ! ” ) , you ’re not getting anywhere .
2 . A convincing argument why doing it will be more valuable than not doing it .
I mean valuable to the company and to your self - development .
Now , here ’s how .
How to convince your company to sponsor your cool activity
I ’m going to approach this from the perspective of a manager .
I ’ll tell you what I look for from employees when they ask for some sort of sponsorship .
First , take the initiative to figure out what you want to do .
I ’ve given some ideas before , but the basic thing I ask myself is , “ What would help me work better , and what would remove barriers ? ”
Is it new equipment ?
Is it meeting someone in person ?
Once you know that …
Research the options and pick the right one .
Any manager is more convinced when you show that you ’ve done your homework and made a choice for a reason .
Bad : “ I like conference X !!!!!!!!! ”
Better : “ I ’d like to attend Conference X this year .
Michelle From Marketing attended last year , and here ’s what she got out of it : ( Testimonial here ) ”
Even better : [ Everything from above , plus… ]
“ After reviewing these 3 options of relevant conferences , I ’d like to attend X because it ’s in our budget , it will help my career development for this year ( mention metrics ) , as well as give me the tools to work faster on Project Enigma . ”
Bam .
If someone takes the initiative to go through all that and present a convincing case , it ’s hard to say no .
There ’s just one more thing .
Show the potential ROI ( return on investment ) to the company .
Show them why ordering that report is worth its price tag .
Tell them how that new tool will help speed up your development process .
Use your company ’s language to show , honestly and plainly , why you need additional resources to do your job optimally .
Yes , it ’s scary to ask for more things , but any good manager will respect someone who takes the initiative to identify a goal , craft a proposal , and ask for the resources to be better at their job .
It does n’t even have to succeed in ROI , although it really helps if it does .
You just need to make the case why it could result in ROI .
For example , when I was on a business trip last year , I got a great opportunity to meet someone important if I stayed an extra night .
I changed my ticket –for a price increase of over 100 % the original ticket cost–just to meet this person because there was potentially huge ROI if it worked out .
We did n’t end up closing the deal , but that was the cost of doing business .
When I worked at AuctionDrop , I told my boss that I wanted to buy a usability report that cost about $ 250 .
I wrote up a 1 - page proposal explaining why I wanted it , what it would do , and how I would use it .
He looked at the report and actually laughed out loud .
“ $ 250 ?
Go for it . ”
It took 4 seconds .
At PBwiki , we ’re actively trying to adopt this idea of not being cheap , but instead looking forward to growth .
We ’re not a deep - pocketed company , but there are things that are strategically important that are worth it .
Want a book that will help you kick ass on your project ?
Get it .
Want huge whiteboards for your office ?
No questions asked .
We ’ve paid for software , business lunches , travel , conference fees , marketing experiments , and a bunch of other stuff .
It ’s not like we ’re particularly special–most companies that value their employees give them the tools they want / need to succeed .
But it ’s a good example that companies will spring for more than you think .
And that ’s what I want to share so that you can help your company and do cool things for free .
It ’s not just for companies
This advice applies to more than companies .
For example , think about where you could take the idea of ( 1 ) picking something you ’re interested in , ( 2 ) making the case in the right way , and ( 3 ) asking for someone to sponsor you ?
How about parents ?
Although I think that Letting your parents manage your money is dumb , I think asking them for money for a specific project , like a business venture , is very cool .
Lots of people email me saying , “ I want to start a Roth IRA , but I do n’t have the $ 3,000 to open up the account . ”
To me , that seems like the perfect time to ask your parents .
You say , “ Look Mom and Dad , I want to start a Roth today .
Here ’s why it makes sense to start early .
Here ’s my plan for where I ’m going to invest .
Here are the risks , here ’s my timetable for returning your money ( plus interest ) , and here ’s some research I ’ve gathered about the best place to open it . ”
Honestly , I ’m not a parent yet , but if my son or daughter came to me saying that , how could I resist ?
It works for investing , opening a lemonade stand , traveling somewhere on a learning trip , or any number of things .
How could you use the idea ?
Also , from being in Silicon Valley , there is a huge culture of angel investors , who are basically rich people that invest in interesting companies .
When I realized how many there are , I realized there ’s a 2 - way street going on here : Entrepreneurs need cash , and angels want interesting investments and the excitement of a new venture .
If it works right , everyone can benefit .
The big takeaway
If you ’re not taking advantage of your company to do cool things ( that also benefit them ) for free , I honestly believe that you ’re wasting your opportunity .
Part of the benefit of working at a company –especially larger ones–is the immense resources they have .
$ 200 is nothing .
Neither is $ 2,000 for some things , or even $ 20,000 if the potential ROI is justified .
Where else could you get the opportunity to pick something you want to do , ask someone to hand over a bunch of money , and get you a pat on the back to do it ?
Part of succeeding here is acting like you have an unlimited budget .
If you had $ 10 million dollars at work , what would you do ?
As Ian Ybarra puts it in another excellent post ,
I ca n’t stand when I ask people what they really want to do and they wo n’t answer .
They sit silently , thinking about their excuses for why they ca n’t do what they want to do .
They all have different excuses , and they wo n’t tell me what they are , so I have to go fishing .
Here are 10 questions I ask to get the real answer .
What would you do …
1 . if you had a billion dollars ?
( Now money is no object . )
2 . if your parents were completely supportive of any path you chose ?
( Now your parents ca n’t make you do something . )
3 . if your older sibling (s ) were n’t so successful ?
( Now you ’re not trying to live up to something you ’re not . )
4 . if your friends were n’t all going to work in finance ( or another industry ) ?
( Now you ’re not letting peer pressure pistol whip you . )
5 . if we could all travel at the speed of thought ?
( Now you can live where you want and work where you want , no problem . )
6 . if you had graduated from the best college in the world ?
( Now you ’re not paralyzed by a lack of the “ perfect ” brand –whatever that is . )
The point is , once you start acting like you have all the tools at your disposal–which you basically do–it becomes less a matter of “ How do I get this ?!?! ” and more a strategic question of , “ What do I want to do ? ”
Also , when it comes to asking your parents or personal contacts for money , please do n’t get me wrong .
If you read this and think , “ Ramit , you ’re an elitist who has rich friends / family and I can never do that , ” you have n’t taken anything away from this post and I question whether you are literate .
It ’s not about the amount , whether it ’s $ 10,000 or $ 100 .
If you just ask for money without a plan , that ’s stupid .
And if you plan to take without giving back , that ’s charity , not personal development .
But I ’m still puzzled when I hear friends say , “ I have this great idea , but it ’s so expensive to get it started . ”
A lot of my friends have plenty of money and would be happy to invest a little bit into a new venture , especially the ones in Silicon Valley .
Come up with a plan and try asking the right people .
As long as you have a specific plan and have thought through the issues , it does n’t hurt to ask whether it ’s your boss , parents , or even professional contacts .
I ’m hoping a couple of my friends will send me proposals after reading this .
Update :
This post is dedicated to my dad , who taught me that companies do n’t care about money time and time again .
As recently described excelently , threads are ugly beasts , waiting to get you when you let your guard down ( and eventually you will ) .
Yes , that means that I should really get my head round the asynchat module and stop using ThreadingMixIn s with the SocketServer , but that 's not the point of this post .
Inter process communication , aka IPC , is way safer and scalable when you want to distribute the work between many processors .
But what bothers me is the complete lack of a nice support for this in the stdlib , while there is an excellent threading module .
So what options are there ?
You could stay inside the stdlib and construct something out of pickle and sockets , but that is n't amazing as you 'll have to write a lot of boiler plate code that will have it 's own bugs .
Leaving the stdlib you could probably replace pickle with json , but appart from being able to talk with non -python code you 're not really better off .
There is of course the excellent omniORBpy if you grok CORBA .
But the python mapping of CORBA was written by C++ programmers , so despite being the best CORBA mapping available it is still not the most lovely thing to work with as python developer .
And CORBA is a rather heavy weight approach that is far from applicable in all situations .
XML - RPC is another internet - aware IPC option that even has support in the stdlib , but once more the overhead when you 're just on a local machine and want to use 2 CPUs is silly .
Twisted must surely have some solution too , but I do n't really know that and again I think it will be rather heavy - weight .
Lastly I feel obliged to mention SOAP in this paragraph too , but can't help to shrudder when thinking about it .
I guess what I 'm looking for is some simple , light weight and scalable module that does something similar to how Erlang passes messages around .
Maybe all I 'm asking for is a module that ties up subprocess and pickle and lives under the IPC section in the stdlib .
But it would be nice if it could also transparantly stream the data accross a socket so you can also run on multiple hosts if you want ( maybe in a separate module though ) .
Having a module like that around would obsolete the need for boilerplate code as well as establishing some sort of " best practice " IPC .
Anyways , I think this is more like me wondering what people use or would want to have for their IPC in python .
Anyone ?

These rules were collected , some editing took place to combine duplicates and refine wording , and the list was sent back to see whether any rules were missing from the list .
The list was also submitted to members of the ANSI - 200 / HFES HCI standards committee who were also asked to identify rules that might be missing .
Once the new suggestions were incorporated into the list , a list of 34 rules of thumb had been defined . ”

Congressman Dennis Kucinich commandeered the House floor for an hour Wednesday to discuss “ in detail the Congressional and White House efforts to privatize the oil of Iraq . ”
Before he spoke , he announced the speech in a public e-mail .
The talk is excerpted here .
Kucinich.us :
Oil was the primary reason for the invasion of Iraq .
There were , of course , no weapons of mass destruction , no connection between Iraq and 911 , no connection between Iraq and Al Queda ’s role in 911 .
Despite that the Bush - Cheney Administration , with the approval of a Democratic - controlled Senate and the Democratic leader of the House , supported and commenced a brutal campaign of shock and awe , of bombing , invasion and then occupation of Iraq .
Iraq may have as much as 300 billion barrels of oil untapped .
With oil headed toward $ 70 a barrel , the oil wealth of Iraq could be worth as much as $ 21 trillion .
Nearly 3,400 sons and daughters of America have been sacrificed .
As many as 1,000,000 innocent Iraqi civilians have been killed in the course of the US occupation .
The taxpayers of the United States will pay between one and two trillion dollars for this war , which is based on lies .

Munch painted a number of versions of The Scream
The Scream and Madonna were found in a police operation .
" We are 100 % certain they are the originals .
The damage was much less than feared , " police said .
They had been missing since two armed men ripped them from the wall and threatened staff at the Munch Museum in the Norwegian capital in August 2004 .
Three men were found guilty of charges relating to the theft in May .
" We felt it was a victory today when the pictures turned up , " police chief Iver Stensrud told a press conference in Oslo .
" For two years and nine days we have been hunting systematically for these pictures and now we 've found them . "
Mr Stensrud added that police believed the paintings had remained in Norway since they were stolen .
" We feel we have been hot on the trail of the paintings the whole time , but it has taken time , " he said .
Two men were pictured running from the museum with the paintings
The Scream , painted in 1893 , is one of the world 's most recognisable paintings .
The artworks will now be examined by experts to establish what effect their two - year disappearance has had on their condition .
Mr Stensrud said no reward had been paid but would not give details of how the paintings were recovered .
Police said no new arrests had been made and the two gunmen remain at large .
In May , Bjoern Hoen , 37 , was sentenced to seven years for planning the robbery , Petter Tharaldsen , 37 , got eight years for driving the getaway car and Petter Rosenvinge , 34 , received four years for supplying the vehicle .
Hoen and Tharaldsen were also ordered to pay 750 m kroner ( £ 62.3 m ) compensation to the City of Oslo to reflect the value of its lost paintings .
Three other men were acquitted .
All had pleaded not guilty .
Mr Stensrud said those convicted had not contributed to the recovery of the paintings .
