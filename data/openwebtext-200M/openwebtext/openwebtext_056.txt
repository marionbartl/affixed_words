They also serve who only stand and wait
What if we could reduce carbon dioxide emissions and cut electricity bills without adding any cost to consumer electronics ?
Oh , and what if we could cut down the size of the ginormous " wall warts " clogging up spike bars across the globe ?
This is the promise of a global initiative to cut down on standby power .
Standby power is the current drawn by devices which are switched " off " where " off " means a low - power state in which the device is not performing its primary function .
This is power used when a television set is switched off , but waits in silence for the code from a remote control that will cause it to spring to life once more .
It 's the power used by the clock on the microwave oven , the red LED glowing on your home stereo , and the power brick on the cell phone charger even when no phone is attached .
Some of these devices are well - engineered and consume only milliwatts of power when waiting for commands , but most are not .
They can suck up 30 W or more even when idle or " off . "
Modern devices pull power from the mains 24 hours a day , year - round , and even when switched off , external AC / DC power supplies never stop drawing power .
Paying for this largely wasted energy wo n't bankrupt a household , but when multiplied by all the households in a country or continent , the numbers get real big , real fast .
But unlike many other problems we face , this is a solvable one .
In fact , it 's already been solved ; electrical engineers have the tools to save nations like the US billions of dollars annually and to reduce greenhouse gases while they 're at it .
The best news ?
The changes will cost almost nothing to implement .
That 's a proposition that manufacturers , environmentalists , economists , governments , and consumers can all embrace , and they have .
But there 's still a long way to go .
The wheel in the sky keeps on turning
Just try to stop the wheel on your electric meter .
Day and night it turns in silence , spinning out the record of your electricity use , and it mocks your attempts to bring it to a halt .
It was n't always this way .
A few decades back , it was simple enough to wander through a house flipping off switches .
When all devices were off and the refrigerator was unplugged , the electric meter stopped , killed by the lack of power flowing into the house .
This state of complete electrical isolation is unknown to most modern homeowners , whose meters spin endlessly .
Every TV , stereo , light , computer , and washing machine can be switched off , but the meter will continue to spin .
Disconnect the growing number of devices ( set - top boxes , routers ) never meant to be switched offstill spinning , Pull the plug on the fridgestill spinning .
The only reliable way to stop the wheel is to unplug ( not switch off ) every device in the house .
Most modern devices use AC / DC adapters with transformers that consume power even in a no-load state ( when the device they are attached to is not drawing any current ) , which is why power bricks are warm to the touch even when disconnected from their devices .
This is one sort of standby power ; another is the power used when devices are switched on but are in a low - power state , waiting for user action .
Laser printers that are n't currently printing , for instance , enter a low power mode until called they need to print another sheet .
These states are beneficial ; without them , printers and other devices would use massive amounts of power each year .
But they still cost money and they still draw power .
That power draw can be significant .
The International Energy Agency looked into the issue a few years back and found that VCRs could draw from 5W to 19 W while in standby , cable boxes from 8W to 14W , and fax machines could suck up anywhere from 5W to 30W .
Nothing quite as wonderful as ( saving ) money
All that power adds up .
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that standby power accounts for 1.5 percent of OECD member countries ' residential electricity use .
This is only an average , though ; highly industrialized and wealthy countries like Germany have a much higher number , about 4 percent .
That 's 20 terawatt hours ( TWh ) of " wasted " electricity each year in just one country .
Over the course of a device 's lifetime , the cost of all that standby power can actually exceed the cost of having the device on .
The IEA estimates that each watt shaved from a unit 's standby power measurement will save buyers $ 3 to $ 8 over the course of that product 's life .
Alan Meier , a staff scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who helped to spur much of the international attention on standby power in the mid-1990s , calculates that products can save an average of 3 watts through relatively simple reengineering .
At government electricity prices , this comes out to a $ 10 average lifetime savings .
When a government buys millions of products a year , this is more than pocket change .
Those millions are only saved if the cost of the devices in question stays the same .
Fortunately , Meier estimates that simple but substantial improvements cost nothing in consumer electronics .
For other products , the cost may be up to a dollar a devicean excellent investment .
It makes such good sense that George Bush directed the entire federal government to buy low - standby - power devices back in July , 2001 .
His executive order instructed agencies to " purchase products that use no more than one watt in their standby power consuming mode . "
Because the federal government is one of the largest purchasing organizations in the world , this is a directive that carries serious weight in the industry .
The government 's leverage over manufacturers means that more efficient devices will be offered not just to government , but to the public as well .

Today I was speaking with my brother .
I love my brother very much because he is very smart .
My brother knows everything .
I told my brother that when I marry a good socialist comrade I want many children to raise for love of Dear Leader because I love Dear Leader more than everything .
My brother who is very smart praised me with a hug ^_^ but he made warning to me that in US people are so poor that they can't have children of their own and they drown all the new babies all the time T_T I ask my brother who know everything what heppen when people still want to not drown their baby and he reveal to me that Bush send CIA spy steal the people 's babies against their will and they put them on a big white US boat to sell them to Jews in Palestine country .
TT_TT I hate Bush .
That 's why my brother say US is country without love or caring , unlike DPRK where all the comrades live for the love of Dear Leader who is the father of all Koreans .
Then I ask my brother who is very patient as well as smart how can US keep population if all babies are drown or selled away to Jews by Bush .
Brother say that Bush send US GI inside Mexico country to steal all the babies there and make them into US without international knowing it which is why they are called illegal immigrants so Bush can exploit them for slave labor in his secret salt mines on his ranch in Texas and that also Bush kidnap Korean girls to make sex slave in White House .
This scare me much and I can't sleep for fear of nightmare of Bush .
I hate Bush who drown and steal all the world babies for personal profit and make me have nightmares . >.

The staff 's signal to get their coat
Enough with all this blue sky thinking in the workplace .
Not just because the phrase is yet another example of meaningless office twaddle .
But because it is time for some red sky thinking , the signal , in these darkening autumn days , that it is nearly time to go home .
Achieving it is dependent on a bit of horizoning - not quite the same as predicting the company 's future performance , more staring out of the window , according to one Magazine reader , Stig .
In other offices , that may be commonly known as workspace - specific perceptual abstraction , or daydreaming .
At James Dignan 's office , his workmates also try to get away with non-specific interfacing or needless chat .

This is part two of a two - part series [ see linuxjournal.com / article/9096 for part one ] .
In this article , I build upon the concept of a parse pipeline with the State monad .
Then , with all the pieces in place , I show the complete Haskell program .
I also take a step back and consider why Haskell is n't as popular as some other languages and whether it deserves a place in your programmer 's toolbox .
The State Monad
In part one of this series , I showed parse pipelines that looked like : c $ b $ a ctx Now , there are two problems with basing the whole program around this construct .
The first is that everything is written backwards .
It 's not too hard to work around that by creating an operator that reads left to right , unlike $ .
However , it 's also a pain to pass the ParseContext explicitly to and from every function that acts as a ParseContext transformer .
[ Note : 1 . In an early version of my program , I wrote the following : -- |> is like a UNIX pipe .
infixl 9 |> x |> f = f x Hence , c $ b $ a ctx could be written ctx |> a |> b |> c .
I originally wrote the whole program around this construct instead of the State monad , but I like the State monad better because of Haskell 's syntactic sugar for monads . ]
Purely functional means you have to pass everything to the function ( that is , no globals ) and you have to return everything from the function ( that is , no side effects allowed , not even printing a message to the user ) .
Passing everything explicitly can get tedious , but that 's something Haskell has an answer for — monads .
Instead of having to piece a pipeline together using $ , the do syntax can transform the above into : do a b c
Not only does the do syntax “ read the right way ” , but ( and this is a key point ) it 's also syntactic sugar for saying , “ the result of ' a ' will be needed to call ' b ' , and the result of ' b ' will be needed to call ' c ' . ”
It 's still a pipeline , but now it 's syntactically convenient .
The State monad is a monad that comes with Haskell , which is perfectly suited for the current situation .
The State monad is a simple monad that simply encapsulates a bit of state .
Looking at the example above , a , b and c are all functions that take and modify this implicit state .
Because each might modify that state , they must be run in order , which , of course , is n't necessarily the norm in Haskell .
The notion of a ParseContext transformer dovetails perfectly with how the State monad works .
Each ParseContext transformer will now have the following signature : f :: State ParseContext ()
This translates into : " f " is a function that has type " State ParseContext ( ) " , which is to say that " f " operates within the " State " monad where the " State " monad is encapsulating a " ParseContext " object .
In summary , what does the monad buy us ?
It allows us to use the do syntactic sugar in order to tie statements together into a chain that must be executed in order .
It takes care of implicitly passing around ParseContext objects .
Lest my reader get bleary eyed , let 's see some code !
I 've updated the makeCool .hs program to use the State monad , thus creating a true Rube Goldberg ( en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg#Rube_Goldberg_machines ) program : import Control .
Monad .
State data TokenType = Identifier | Qualifier | Type | Symbol Char deriving ( Show , Eq ) data Token = Token { tokenType :: TokenType , tokenValue :: String } deriving Show data ParseContext = ParseContext { input :: String , --
The input that has not been parsed yet .
output :: String , --
The output generated so far .
currTok :: Token , --
The current token , if defined .
stack :: [ Token ] --
A stack of tokens we have n't dealt with yet .
} deriving Show makeCool :: State ParseContext ( ) makeCool = do ParseContext {input = s} <- get put ( ParseContext {input = " " , output = s ++ " is cool !
" } ) return ( ) main = do s <- getContents let ctx = ParseContext {input = s , output = " " } in putStrLn $ output $ execState makeCool $ ctx Running it : $ echo -n " Haskell " | runhugs - 98 makeCoolState .hs
Haskell is cool !
A few things deserve note .
First , in order to use the State monad , you must pass - 98 to runhugs , which enables special Hugs extensions .
Next , what used to be : putStrLn $ output $ makeCool ctx is now : putStrLn $ output $ execState makeCool $ ctx The execState function is used to get into and out of the “ State monad world ” .
Occasionally , it 's easy to get confused by higher order functions like execState ; however , it 's easy enough to apply a cookie - cutter approach .
That is , execState makeCool $ ctx takes ctx as an initial state and returns a final state .
makeCool operates within “ the context ” of the State monad .
Easy enough .
If you really want to know the nitty - gritty details of how the State monad works , there 's a really fun explanation on Wikipedia ( en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming:Haskell_monads#The_State_monad ) .
Notice that makeCool uses the do syntax to tie multiple statements together .
First it uses the get function to get the current state .
Then it uses the put function to put back an updated state .
Then it returns ( ) , which is to say nothing useful .
Looking at get and put , at it's heart , the makeCool function is still a ParseContext transformer .
Another thing deserves note .
As usual , there are a few convenience functions for interacting with the State monad .
For instance , instead of using get and put explicitly , it 's also possible to use the modify function , combining the two activities .
Hence , the makeCool function could have been written : makeCool :: State ParseContext ( ) makeCool = modify ( \ctx -> ctx {input = " " , output = input ctx ++ " is cool ! " } )
The modify function takes a callback that takes the state as input and returns state as output .
Instead of passing a named function to modify , I 'm passing an anonymous function , hence the \ syntax .
Translating : " makeCool " is a " ParseContext transformer " .
Modify the " ctx " by setting " input " to " " and setting " output " to the original input plus the string " is cool ! " .
As in other languages , anonymous functions can be either ultra-convenient or ultra-inscrutable , depending on both the author and the reader .
Nonetheless , I 'll use the convenience functions where , uh , convenient .
Pulling It All Together Okay , we 're getting really close now -- one more example .
Let 's transform makeCoolState.hs into something slightly more useful and “ pretend ” we 're reading tokens .
We 'll naively treat each character as a Symbol token , and we 'll simply read four tokens .
import Control .
Monad .
State data TokenType = Identifier | Qualifier | Type | Symbol Char deriving ( Show , Eq ) data Token = Token { tokenType :: TokenType , tokenValue :: String } deriving Show data ParseContext = ParseContext { input :: String , --
The input that has not been parsed yet .
output :: String , --
The output generated so far .
currTok :: Token , --
The current token , if defined .
stack :: [ Token ] --
A stack of tokens we have n't dealt with yet .
} deriving Show -- Read one token from input and put it on the stack .
getToken :: State ParseContext () getToken = do ctx@( ParseContext {input = c:input ' , stack = stack '} ) <- get let tok =
Token {tokenType = Symbol c , tokenValue = [ c ] } in put ( ctx {input = input ' , currTok = tok , stack = tok : stack'} ) --
This is a completely different way of writing getToken .
getTokenAnotherWay :: State ParseContext () getTokenAnotherWay = modify getTokenAnotherWay ' where getTokenAnotherWay ' ctx = ctx {input = input ' , currTok = tok , stack = tok : stack'} where c = head $ input $ ctx input ' = tail $ input $ ctx tok = Token {token Type = Symbol c , tokenValue = [ c ] } stack ' = stack $ ctx -- Call getToken a few times .
parse :: State ParseContext ( ) parse = do getToken -- I would not normally duplicate lines like this .
getToken -- I 'm just trying to illustrate a point .
getTokenAnotherWay getTokenAnotherWay main = do s <- getContents -- currTok is undefined below .
It 's defined later .
let ctx = ParseContext {input = s , output = " " , stack = [ ] } in print $ execState parse $ ctx Running it : $ echo " Haskell " | runhugs - 98 monadPipes.hs ParseContext { input = " ell
" , output = " " , currTok = Token { token Type = Symbol 'k ' , tokenValue = " k" } , stack = [ Token { token Type = Symbol 'k ' , tokenValue = " k" } , Token { token Type = Symbol 's ' , tokenValue = " s " } , Token {token Type = Symbol ' a ' , tokenValue = " a" } , Token {token Type = Symbol ' H ' , tokenValue = " H " } ] }
At the risk of cheating , I 've manually added newlines and indentation to the output to make it more legible .
Nonetheless , this output is really exciting !
It 's taken the string Haskell and treated the first four letters as Symbol tokens , placing each one on the stack .
This fascinating glimpse into the heart of the ParseContext was made possible simply by making sure to add deriving Show in the right places and calling print on the final ParseContext in the line : print $ execState parse $ ctx Notice a few other things .
The do syntax is used to parse four tokens in a row : parse = do getToken -- I would not normally duplicate lines like this .
getToken -- I 'm just trying to illustrate a point .
getTokenAnotherWay getTokenAnotherWay
In getToken , I used get and put , but in getTokenAnotherWay , I used modify .
In general , I 've varied how the code was implemented in very minor ways to show different ways of doing things .
After all , even C has three different constructs for a loop ; you pick the most convenient tool for the job at hand .
As a last note , to experience how incredibly lazy Haskell is , instead of using echo to enter the value Haskell , try typing the input characters one at a time , pressing Return after each character .
Haskell will start outputting the output before you are done typing the input .
In fact , Haskell will produce as much output as possible for the input you have provided .
In a sense , because the input is read lazily , the rest of the program can run “ proactively ” .
Now , take a deep breath , and prepare for the plunge .
Here 's what you have at your disposal :
You have the C version of the code .
There 's a fantastic “ Tour of the Haskell Syntax ” that you can refer to at www.cs.uu.nl/%7Eafie/haskell/tourofsyntax.html.
If you installed Hugs , the Haskell Prelude contains most of the simple functions that I make use of .
I find it helpful to refer to the source as it's meant to be self documenting .
On my system , it 's installed at / usr / lib / hugs / libraries / Hugs / Prelude.hs .
Similarly , the source for the State monad is /usr / lib/ hugs / packages / mtl / Control /Monad/State.hs .
The formal documentation is at haskell.org/hawiki/MonadState .
At long last , here 's the code : {- Translate C type declarations into English .

Commentary I really hate to spoil the tone of such a nice tutorial with opinionated commentary , but the exceedingly careful reader may have noticed that the C version is shorter than the Haskell version !
In fact , by my count , there are 106 useful lines of code in the C version and 146 lines of useful code in the Haskell version .
What happened ?
This is the type of thing that can make a budding article writer lose sleep at night !
Notice a few things .
The C version is using static memory allocation .
It pre-allocates space for 100 tokens , each of which can be up to 64 characters long .
Modern C applications must usually manage memory dynamically , and it's a painful , error - prone chore .
Nor does the example do any error handling .
Haskell 's exception system went completely unused .
Last of all , the example did n't make use of any abstractions .
Haskell 's high - level , functional nature means that libraries , in general , can be higher level in Haskell than in C , but this is meaningless if you do n't even use a parsing library .
Note , however , that the Haskell version already has some benefits over the C version .
For instance , being able to print a ParseContext for free was really nice .
Theoretically , because all parsing state is contained in a ParseContext , you can pass off the ParseContext to another machine and let it continue the computation .
If , during parsing , for some reason it was necessary to undo what you had done and go back to some previous parsing state , it 's absolutely possible to throw away your current ParseContext and continue with some previous ParseContext .
Consider the task of removing a bolt .
You have your choice of a crescent wrench ( say , C ) , a socket set ( say , Java ) or an impact wrench ( say , Haskell ) .
An impact wrench is incredibly powerful and can make difficult tasks easy .
However , what we 've seen is that sometimes it takes longer to retrieve the compressor from the garage in order to use an impact wrench than it takes to simply get the job done with a crescent wrench .
If Haskell is so powerful , why is n't it more popular ?
I think it 's because the authors and many of the users are just too dang intelligent !
I 've heard Guido van Rossum , the author of Python , say something like , “ ML is a great language - - it 's just too bad you have to have an IQ higher than 150 to use it . ”
Consider that in Paul Hudak 's book , The Haskell School of Expression , Hudak drags the user through writing code to calculate the area of a concave polygon [ exercise 2.5 on page 33 ] before he even shows the user the canonical “ Hello world ” example [ page 37 ] , and I still have n't gotten to the part in the book that explains how to use Hugs .
[ Note : I 'm being facetious .
I do n't think it 's covered in the book at all .
Hugs is an implementation of Haskell , and the book is about the language itself , not any particular implementation .
However , my point stands that unless you actually get an interpreter or compiler running so that you can actually write some code , you can't truly claim to know a language .
I spent hours trying to figure out why the Hugs shell would n't let me define a function before I found out that you have to store them in a file and load them as a library . ]
Furthermore , as much as I love Haskell 's type system , I think there 's a real misconception .
Hudak writes :
The best news is that Haskell 's type system will tell you if your program is well - typed before you run it .
This is a big advantage because most programming errors are manifested as typing errors [ p. 8 ] . I do n't agree .
Although I would agree that most bugs are caused by programmers typing the wrong code , I would not agree that most bugs are manifested as typing errors !
In fact , I find that most of my bugs are caused by subtly misunderstanding the fine details of a difficult problem , and I 've heard other well - respected programmers say the same thing .
Personally , being a fan of duck typing , I find that most of the time , types are almost a nuisance !
[ Note : Lest Java programmers send me hate mail , this is a topic covered repeatedly by Bruce Eckel , author of Thinking in Java , on his blog ( mindview.net / WebLog/ArticleIndex ) .
For instance , this post : mindview.net /WebLog/log-0025 .
If you consider tools like QuickCheck ( www.cs.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck), which can use Haskell 's type system to generate test cases automatically , you 'll see that a whole article could be written debating whether Bruce Eckel 's ideas apply to Haskell .
Nonetheless , I think it 's fair to say that Haskell 's type system gives you “ more bang for the buck ” than Java's . ]
I spent a lot of time wondering why Haskell programmers seemed to be so successful .
I 've come to the following conclusion :
It 's not that good programmers are necessarily drawn to Haskell - - as Google has shown , there are a lot of extremely talented programmers who are content to code in Java .
Rather , it 's that you have to be a smart , patient , disciplined and dedicated programmer to code in Haskell at all .
The truth of the matter is you can be a bad programmer and make a living coding in Java .
The same can not be said of Haskell .
In summary : I think that it 's fair to say that Haskell has some flaws ( for instance , you have to be smart to use it ) , and it might not ever be as popular as Java , PHP or Ruby .
However , languages are like friends ; you take the good with the bad and enjoy them as a whole ( with the exception of C++ ; almost no one uses all of C++ ) .
Haskell is like a brilliant kernel programmer I once worked with .
Asking him anything outside his areas of expertise was like trying to dereference a random location in memory .
I use to joke that his user interface was about as friendly as a Commodore 64 - - “ syntax error ” .
Nonetheless , you just could n't beat him if you needed a new device driver for some random piece of hardware .
Likewise , if I had to reimplement Pascal or write Perl 6 , Haskell would be my first choice -- although I 'd definitely use a powerful parsing library .
In fact , I 'm pleased to say that Haskell is a welcome addition to my programmer 's toolbox !
From RogueBasin
This is a rough route map for the creators of roguelikes .
I 'm well aware that there are many possible routes and that no two journeys are the same -- this is a description of one of possibilities and maybe will help you to plan your own .
Please add your comments -- maybe we could make this article really helpful .
What are your own routes ?
There is a school of thought in programming that data structures are more important than code : once you have the data structures right , the code will be self - evident .
It may be useful to think before embarking about how you want to structure spatial information , a list of map tiles and their properties , character information , monster / NPC information , and information regarding objects and marks / sound / scent / footprints or tracks on the map ( if at all ) .
Cases where these types of decisions may become significant include conflict between monsters / NPCs , invisibility , flying , falling , gradients ( like climbing hills ) , line of sight , transmogrify ( becoming another being ) , save / restore , any situation in which map tiles are modified ( burned , tunneled , teleported , melted , duplicated , scorched , etc. ) , and area transitions .
Overground / wilderness areas often present different requirements to traditional dungeons .

Step 1 - Decide to write a game
Most of you will have this step behind you already , but there are some hints about the direction of the first step .
The best reason to start developing your own roguelike game is to create a game that you will enjoy playing yourself .
Do n't start by asking around about the definition of roguelike game -- you do n't need it .
If the game you write is not considered roguelike by others , but it 's still fun to play for you -- you succeeded .
It 's not like there 's some kind of a contest to write a game meeting certain specifications .
Do n't plan too much .
Of course , if you want certain things in your game , you must write it so that there is room for them -- but do n't even try to anticipate everything -- it 's just impossible .
When you write a design doc , you make a lot of decisions .
Most of the decisions can't be made without performing some test first -- usually by writing small programs utilizing a given feature .
It 's best to make the decisions when your project has already reached the appropriate stage -- when you do n't need to write an additional program , because your project already has everything you need .
It 's no fun to just proceed according to plan -- leave some space for improvisation .
Do n't be afraid about making mistakes or implementing something in an inflexible way -- you can improve it when you need it -- most of the time it will be ok .
Step 2 - Hello world !
Prepare your programming environment .
Choose your language and platform , choose appropriate compilers / interpreters , editor , version control , automated build , and other utilities .
Set them up so that you 're comfortable with them .
Decide on which libraries you 're going to use -- it can change later , but it 's usually a painful change .
Do n't think too much about portability -- it can be fixed later .
Think about what you need and what you 're comfortable with .
Decide on the language you want to write comments and object names in your code , as well as the language you want to be used in your game .
It 's strongly recommended to use English in your source code -- you can get more help this way from others .
Do n't worry about i18n yet ; translation is usually a very late step in the development process .
Write a simple ' Hello world ! ' program and test whether it works .
Test your libraries , etc. -- you do n't want any surprises .
Start coding .
Step 3 - It 's a boy !
Start with screen output and keyboard input .
Decide preemptively on your screen layout ( easy , you can change it later ) and make the routines that display map characters , status lines and messages .
Make the routine to read key - presses ( no config files , no keys redefinition ) .
Make a '@ walking around the empty screen ' demo .
Play with it a little , clean things up , play some more , imagining the game is finished and you 're playing it .
Make the message handling routines -- especially for the debugging messages -- they come in handy .
Step 4 - The map
Decide on your map structure .
Do n't over - generalize -- you can add things later .
Make your ( empty ) map displayed on the screen .
Scrolled if you need it .
Add some elements to your map to see if they are displayed correctly ( just hard - code them , you do n't need a level generator yet ) .
Make your ' @ ' appear on the map -- not as it's element at first , just as a cursor .
Test the scrolling , maybe make a ' look ' command .
Now turn ' @ ' into creature .
You still do n't have time implemented , so the keyboard - reading routines will just move it around the map .
Include the checks for walls in the movement code .
Maybe add doors and open / close commands .
Step 5 - Saving / Loading
( First : Note that you can initially do away with save and load entirely - a feature not present in many early implementations - and generate your dungeons instead of hard - coding them , which is arguably a more roguelike approach ! )
Read the map from a file instead of hard - coding it .
You can play with it and test different configurations if you make it human - readable from the start .
Add the ' save ' command and the procedures to save your game -- the map at first , then , gradually , all of other game elements .
From now on , when you implement something that needs saving , also implement saving it as soon as possible .
Here 's a handy article about save files and how to implement them ; it 's worthwhile to read when planning ahead what form you 'll save things in .
Once you work with files , you can make your preferences and keybindings config files .
Again , if you make them human - readable , you 'll save yourself a lot of trouble .
Now , when you 're not sure how any element of the game works , you can save the game to a file and just check it .
Step 6 - It 's alive !
Alive !
Implement other creatures ( monsters ) and time .
Add a single monster to begin with .
Give it some simple AI ( like moving randomly ) .
Start with my turn - your turn , then implement the time system you want ( or , usually , a simplification of it and gradually make it more complicated later ) .
( Note : If you use a library , it can be easy to implement The Incredible Power of Dijkstra Maps .
See also Dijkstra Maps Visualized . )
Remember to test everything as you go .
Step 7 - Interaction
Add stats for your creatures .
A simplification of the ones you envisioned , probably .
It 's best to add stats as they are needed , not because they ' look cool ' .
Make the creatures notice each other - bump , attack , etc .
Gradually improve their AIs , so that they can chase the player .
Implement and test the combat system - without equipment for now , just hardcode the values .
Do lots of testing .
Step 8 - Data files
Move the creature , map features , etc. definitions to data files .
Forget about scripting for now If something cannot be moved -- just leave it for now .
( Note : This is an irrelevant step for interpreted languages .
You may instead take the opportunity to organize your code in such a way as to make adding new denizens or map features an easy process . )
Step 9 - Items
Add items .
For start , just objects you can pick up -- no properties .
Gradually give them properties , kinds , stats , etc. , implement inventory , picking up and dropping , equipping and using ( no effects yet ) , also stacking , containers ( if you want them ) , etc .
This step usually requires lots of testing to debug .
Step 10 - Magic
Add item effects , special monster attacks , spells .
Add items and monsters to test them .
You do n't need all the possible effects right away , just the ones that are needed for the next step .
Step 11 - Simple game
Try to make a simple , hard - coded game .
Play it and give it to your friends .
Test the mechanics you 've implemented so far .
See if the game is fun .
Change everything you need to change .
Do n't forget to test a lot .
Always ask someone to test the game 's ' fun factor ' , or test it yourself after a while ; it 's hard to notice some things right away .
This step should take a pretty long time , until you 've got a playable , fun mini-game .
Step 12 - Levels
Write your level generators .
Implement moving between the levels , a wilderness and / or town if you want them , saving the levels on level change if you want them to be persistent ( so that they do n't take up memory ) .
Spread your monsters and items on different depths .
Add more monsters and items , with their effects , as needed .
Step 13 - Experience
Start developing your experience system and skill system .
Tune the monsters ' and items ' stats .
Make character generation screen , classes , races , and whatever else you need .
Playtest your game frequently .
Step 14 - Citizens
Add NPCs , shopkeepers , and simple quests if you need them .
Keep adding features and tuning the stats .
Step 15 - Free at last
Start adding and testing all the ' unique ' features you thought were so cool months ( years ? ) ago , when you started the whole thing .
Revise your opinions of them and see if they fit the game .
Write your pet random plot generator , factions system , infinite wilderness generator , neural network AI , or other unique feature , since you can now test it in a working game .

Jeremy was kind enough to share a " live WTF " with us all .
Although I receive a fair number of submissions that point to a publicly accessible website , I rarely link to the site in question .
As bad as it is that Mom - And - Pop - Store.com has a " SqlString " parameter on their viewProduct page , I doubt they 'd appreciate it when someone went and replaced " SELECT ... WHERE ProductId=43 " with " DROP DATABASE " .
Not that any of you would do that or anything .

OK , good .
Now , if you were using something other than Internet Explorer , you likely experienced a familiar sight : a blank page as a result of the site being coded for IE only .
In and of it self , that 's not too big of a deal , even for # 20 on the Fortune 500 List , Philip Morris Altria .
What inspired me to share this with you today was the unique way that Marlboro.com redirects visitors to the actual content page .
Consider that , normally , if one wanted to redirect visitors from one page to another , he 'd use one of the following techniques :
Sending a HTTP 300 " Redirect Response " from the server
Using the " Refresh " META Tag in HTML
Setting the browser 's " window.location " with JavaScript
Aparantly not content with any of these fairly standard ways of redirection , the folk (s ) behind Marlboro.com decided to use the following :
Programmatically setting the HREF property of a hyperlink on the page and then executing the ( IE - Only ) click ( ) method on that hyperlink

[ Update 11 Feb 07 : North Korea denies it ]
The Daily NK reports :
Sources residing in the district of Chongjin , North Hamkyung informed on the 1st and 5th “ On December 20th , a mass group of 120 prisoners from the camp in Hwasung escaped and so the National Safety Agency and the People ’s Protection Agency are in a state of emergency ”  and said “ Lately , additional checkpoints have been established at various locations in North Hamkyung inspecting permits for both vehicle and personal travel . 
In the history of North Korea , there has only been one known incident like this one — the mass uprising at Onsong , Camp Number 12 , in 1987 , when 5,000 people were killed .
The punishment for escape is death , and former guards claim that they were offered generous bounties for killing escaping prisoners .
One source said “ A close acquaintance and officer from the Safety Agency told me that some prisoners had ran away from a political concentration camp in Hwasung . 
The source informed “ The figure seems to exceed 120 people ”  and “ since the end of last year , the atmosphere in North Hamkyung has been tense and the province has been in a state of emergency . 
The prisoners did this by cutting the wire and clubbing a guard , and when they got out , someone outside was there with at least one getaway car .
The regime ’s security forces have put up numerous roadblocks to try to recapture the prisoners .
They have reportedly recaptured 21 of them , who are virtually certain to face a firing squad .
Elsewhere , the report suggests that others were recaptured in China .
The significance of this , if true , is proof of the existence of an organized underground inside North Korea .
As you will see below , Hwasong is a very long walk from China .
Without help from an underground , these people would have had nowhere to go ; they would all have been recaptured or killed almost immediately .
If around 100 prisoners were still at large weeks after the fact , or made it at least as far as China , someone must have helped , hidden , and fed them .
Further , on the day of escape , one prisoner visited his home in Chongjin , North Hamkyung to escape with his family but was arrested by border guards while in attempt .
It ’s a safe bet that this entire family was arrested .
I discovered Camp 16 accidentally , while google - earthing North Korea recently .
I stumbled upon it because it ’s not far from Musudan - ri , the place from which North Korea did its missile tests last July .
Snooping through the mountains , I saw this , and soon realized what I was looking at .
Wanting to confirm my judgment , I went to David Hawk ’s photographic exhibits from “ The Hidden Gulag , ” and confirmed that the latitude and longitude were a match .
I followed this fence line for the entire perimeter , and realized that this place is gargantuan .
It measures 18 miles by 16 miles .
That ’s nearly half the size of the state of Rhode Island [ Correction : a quarter of the size of the state of Rhode Island , and more than four times the size of the District of Columbia ] .
That jagged yellow line that cuts off the northwest corner is the Chinese border .
Closer in , the fence line is clearly visible .
I marked the guard posts , which are only faintly visible until you zoom in to a lower altitude .
Here are two of the larger groups of barracks in Camp 16 :
Here ’s the camp ’s South gate :
According to the story , the camp holds 10,000 prisoners .
They could be there for anything from the expression of dissent , to finding themselves on the wrong side of a factional dispute , to being the wife or child of someone who said the wrong thing one day .
Survivors of these camps report that each year , about 20 to 25 % of the prisoners die .
Men. Women .

NEW DELHI : Agni III is ready for launch , awaiting a green signal from the political leadership , Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ) chief M Natarajan announced on Friday .
The most ambitious surface - to - surface missile has a 3,000 km intercontinental reach and is capable of carrying a one - tonne nuclear payload .
" All technical parameters for the launch of the missile have been completed .
We are ready for the launch , " he told reporters on the concluding day of the 4th Defexpo .
The announcement was significant .
Though DRDO had claimed readiness to launch Agni III a year - and - a - half back , no trials were undertaken apparently keeping in view the international opinion .
To a barrage of queries on the repeated slippage and time over - runs on a number of key DRDO projects like main - battle tank ( MBT ) ' Arjun ' and ' Tejas ' light combat aircraft programme , Natarajan , while admitting that these programmes were running far behind schedule , said that country 's defence scientist were working to check these factors .
" The defence scientists are conscious that there have been time over - runs on some of the projects , " he said assuring that emphasis now was being laid on keeping time factor in all the programmes .

I 'm still not sure what I think about Joel Spolsky 's JavaSchools post .
On one level , he just seems to be saying that he wants schools to be harder to weed more people out .
Sure , I think it 's justifiable that you have to have a certain kind of intelligence to be a good programmer , and that it 's good to identify people who will be most successful based on that .
( Similarly , if you are n't getting enough majors , making sure people succede is n't the answer , rather finding the right people and attracting them to CS is the answer . )
He 's also arguing against vocational education ( as Java has become a vocational skill ) , though that does n't seem to be what people are picking up on .
It makes sense that vocational education is part of the issue , because in vocational education it is expected everyone passes .
You sign up , you pay your money , they graduate you , period .
Unless you simply do n't try , you will graduate , probably with any degree you want .
There 's always been schools like this , but they 've become much much more common .
Honestly I think we -- the programming community -- really should call out some of these schools as frauds .
It makes me sad when I see an ad where somebody says how successful they are making computer games with their degree from DeVry .
It 's such obvious bullshit to me , which makes it more pathetic that kids are conned into this sort of thing .
But that 's an aside .
The point is that the same thing is happening to more reputable universities , and what Joel is talking about is this trend .
You pay your money , they make sure you get through school , and as long as you try you should get a B or better .
But I 'm not excited about the model that Joel wants -- one where you present these fairly small , quite mathematical , and fairly difficult concepts , and use that to eliminate students .
It can work , sure , because those are useful and important skills that represent a useful talent ; but they do n't represent all the important skills and talents .
I think it would be much more interesting if there was more of an emphasis on the size of the problems , not just a sampling of challenging techniques .
Pointers and recursions are useful concepts for algorithms , but as a programmer writing algorithms is not central to what I do , nor is it completely clear without experience why you use those concepts .
I 'd rather have someone good at designing and understanding the larger systems of software , than someone who was just good at algorithms .
We need to give students large projects , not just exercises and algorithms .
Large projects are n't about pointers -- in fact , in a language with pointers it is unlikely that a new programmer will ever get far enough to encounter any of the truly interesting problems .
And recursion is useful and important , but it 's not a prerequisite for anything .
These projects need to be large enough that the students will fail , regardless of their talent ; hard enough that they 'll fail in small ways ( forced to throw away bad code and ideas ) , and ultimately in larger ways ( likely creating a big , confusing , buggy system they can't maintain ) .
All learning is best done through failure .
Instead of Joel 's model where failure is a way of weeding people out , failure should be seen as a requirement for learning .
I learned way more in the programming I did outside of my schoolwork in college , because those tasks were ambitious and naive and prone to failure .
Any passionate and talented programmer should be able to point to a pile of failed projects .
If they have n't stopped learning -- and it's not okay to stop learning -- then that pile should be growing .
But is this really good for employers ?
Maybe not .
If schools do n't produce passionless programmers who are afraid their inadequacies will be exposed , then who will work in the enterprise environments , who will write the accounting software , who will submit to using their B&D languages and their top - down methodologies ?
Sorry , I 've become snarky .
But enterprise software aside , fear of inadequacy is a big problem .
It 's what makes people defensive and territorial and hard to work with .
It makes people unwilling to learn new things , unable to guide themselves independently , unable to recognize their utility in the context of a team .
Recognizing and becoming comfortable with one 's own inadequacy -- for we are all inadequate -- is important .
Humility is very freeing .
I think schools should teach more of that .
How can you interpret literature if you have n't written an angsty poem ?
How can you work in science if you have n't royally messed up an experiment , if you 've never drawn the wrong conclusion ?
How can you practice mathematics if you have n't been convinced of a proof that later turned out to be wrong ?
How can you be a philosopher without believing firmly in something you later come to detest -- and moreso , having tried ernestly to convince others of that ill - considered idea ?
How can you be a musician without writing a sappy or derivative song ?
Even cello players should be forced to write at least one love song .
So maybe that 's what I 'd ask of a prospective employee .
Tell me about some of the things you failed at .
What happens when an F - 16 RAF Hawk CT155202 engine sucks in a bird momentarily after takeoff ?
If this video is any indication , you level off , attempt to restart the engine , fail , point it at an unpopulated area , and eject .
Roughly 5 - 6 seconds into the video , you can see the bird just before it enters the engine .
( Interesting tidbit : if you know the " block number " of the plane , you can figure out if it has a General Electric or Pratt & Whitney engine . )
Those of you paying attention will notice two surprisingly calm voices on the recording .
This is a two - seat model ( F - 16B ) rather than the standard single seater .

Mindfulness meditation from the Theravada tradition for the spiritual development of people of all faiths & none .
Online courses & support since 1997
Mindfulness in Plain English by Bhante Gunaratana
Chapter 3
What Meditation Is
Meditation is a word , and words are used in different ways by different speakers .
This may seem like a trivial point , but it is not .
It is quite important to distinguish exactly what a particular speaker means by the words he uses .
Every culture on earth , for example , has produced some sort of mental practice which might be termed meditation .
It all depends on how loose a definition you give to that word .
Everybody does it , from Africans to Eskimos .
The techniques are enormously varied , and we will make no attempt to survey them .
There are other books for that .
For the purpose of this volume , we will restrict our discussion to those practices best known to Western audiences and most likely associated with the term meditation .
Within the Judeo - Christian tradition we find two overlapping practices called prayer and contemplation .
Prayer is a direct address to some spiritual entity .
Contemplation is a prolonged period of conscious thought about some specific topic , usually a religious ideal or scriptural passage .
From the standpoint of mental culture , both of these activities are exercises in concentration .
The normal deluge of conscious thought is restricted , and the mind is brought to one conscious area of operation .
The results are those you find in any concentrative practice : deep calm , a physiological slowing of the metabolism and a sense of peace and well - being .
Out of the Hindu tradition comes Yogic meditation , which is also purely concentrative .
The traditional basic exercises consist of focusing the mind on a single object : a stone , a candle flame , a syllable or whatever , and not allowing it to wander .
Having acquired the basic skill , the Yogi proceeds to expand his practice by taking on more complex objects of meditation : chants , colorful religious images , energy channels in the body and so forth .
Still , no matter how complex the object of meditation , the meditation itself remains purely an exercise in concentration .
Within the Buddhist tradition , concentration is also highly valued .
But a new element is added and more highly stressed .
That element is awareness .
All Buddhist meditation aims at the development of awareness , using concentration as a tool .
The Buddhist tradition is very wide , however , and there are several diverse routes to this goal .
Zen meditation uses two separate tacks .
The first is the direct plunge into awareness by sheer force of will .
You sit down and you just sit , meaning that you toss out of your mind everything except pure awareness of sitting .
This sounds very simple .
It is not .
A brief trial will demonstrate just how difficult it really is .
The second Zen approach used in the Rinzai school is that of tricking the mind out of conscious thought and into pure awareness .
This is done by giving the student an unsolvable riddle which he must solve anyway , and by placing him in a horrendous training situation .
Since he cannot flee from the pain of the situation , he must flee into a pure experience of the moment .
There is nowhere else to go .
Zen is tough .
It is effective for many people , but it is really tough .
Another stratagem , Tantric Buddhism , is nearly the reverse .
Conscious thought , at least the way we usually do it , is the manifestation of ego , the you that you usually think that you are .
Conscious thought is tightly connected with self - concept .
The self - concept or ego is nothing more than a set of reactions and mental images which are artificially pasted to the flowing process of pure awareness .
Tantra seeks to obtain pure awareness by destroying this ego image .
This is accomplished by a process of visualization .
The student is given a particular religious image to meditate upon , for example , one of the deities from the Tantric pantheon .
He does this in so thorough a fashion that he becomes that entity .
He takes off his own identity and puts on another .
This takes a while , as you might imagine , but it works .
During the process , he is able to watch the way that the ego is constructed and put in place .
He comes to recognize the arbitrary nature of all egos , including his own , and he escapes from bondage to the ego .
He is left in a state where he may have an ego if he so chooses , either his own or whichever other he might wish , or he can do without one .
Result : pure awareness .
Tantra is not exactly a game of patty cake either .
Vipassana is the oldest of Buddhist meditation practices .
The method comes directly from the Sitipatthana Sutta , a discourse attributed to Buddha himself .
Vipassana is a direct and gradual cultivation of mindfulness or awareness .
It proceeds piece by piece over a period of years .
The student 's attention is carefully directed to an intense examination of certain aspects of his own existence .
The meditator is trained to notice more and more of his own flowing life experience .
Vipassana is a gentle technique .
But it also is very , very thorough .
It is an ancient and codified system of sensitivity training , a set of exercises dedicated to becoming more and more receptive to your own life experience .
It is attentive listening , total seeing and careful testing .
We learn to smell acutely , to touch fully and really pay attention to what we feel .
We learn to listen to our own thoughts without being caught up in them .
The object of Vipassana practice is to learn to pay attention .
We think we are doing this already , but that is an illusion .
It comes from the fact that we are paying so little attention to the ongoing surge of our own life experiences that we might just as well be asleep .
We are simply not paying enough attention to notice that we are not paying attention .
It is another Catch - 22 .
Through the process of mindfulness , we slowly become aware of what we really are down below the ego image .
We wake up to what life really is .
It is not just a parade of ups and downs , lollipops and smacks on the wrist .
That is an illusion .
Life has a much deeper texture than that if we bother to look , and if we look in the right way .
Vipassana is a form of mental training that will teach you to experience the world in an entirely new way .
You will learn for the first time what is truly happening to you , around you and within you .
It is a process of self discovery , a participatory investigation in which you observe your own experiences while participating in them , and as they occur .
The practice must be approached with this attitude .
" Never mind what I have been taught .
Forget about theories and prejudgments and stereotypes .
I want to understand the true nature of life .
I want to know what this experience of being alive really is .
I want to apprehend the true and deepest qualities of life , and I do n't want to just accept somebody else 's explanation .
I want to see it for myself . "
If you pursue your meditation practice with this attitude , you will succeed .
You 'll find yourself observing things objectively , exactly as they are -- flowing and changing from moment to moment .
Life then takes on an unbelievable richness which cannot be described .
It has to be experienced .
The Pali term for Insight meditation is Vipassana Bhavana .
Bhavana comes from the root ' Bhu ' , which means to grow or to become .
Therefore Bhavana means to cultivate , and the word is always used in reference to the mind .
Bhavana means mental cultivation .
' Vipassana ' is derived from two roots .
' Passana ' means seeing or perceiving .
' Vi ' is a prefix with a complex set of connotations .
The basic meaning is ' in a special way . '
But there also is the connotation of both ' into ' and ' through ' .
The whole meaning of the word is looking into something with clarity and precision , seeing each component as distinct and separate , and piercing all the way through so as to perceive the most fundamental reality of that thing .
This process leads to insight into the basic reality of whatever is being inspected .
Put it all together and ' Vipassana Bhavana ' means the cultivation of the mind , aimed at seeing in a special way that leads to insight and to full understanding .
In Vipassana mediation we cultivate this special way of seeing life .
We train ourselves to see reality exactly as it is , and we call this special mode of perception ' mindfulness . '
This process of mindfulness is really quite different from what we usually do .
We usually do not look into what is really there in front of us .
We see life through a screen of thoughts and concepts , and we mistake those mental objects for the reality .
We get so caught up in this endless thought stream that reality flows by unnoticed .
We spend our time engrossed in activity , caught up in an eternal pursuit of pleasure and gratification and an eternal flight from pain and unpleasantness .
We spend all of our energies trying to make ourselves feel better , trying to bury our fears .
We are endlessly seeking security .
Meanwhile , the world of real experience flows by untouched and untasted .
In Vipassana meditation we train ourselves to ignore the constant impulses to be more comfortable , and we dive into the reality instead .
The ironic thing is that real peace comes only when you stop chasing it .
Another Catch - 22 .
When you relax your driving desire for comfort , real fulfillment arises .
When you drop your hectic pursuit of gratification , the real beauty of life comes out .
When you seek to know the reality without illusion , complete with all its pain and danger , that is when real freedom and security are yours .
This is not some doctrine we are trying to drill into you .
This is an observable reality , a thing you can and should see for yourself .
Buddhism is 2500 years old , and any thought system of that vintage has time to develop layers and layers of doctrine and ritual .
Nevertheless , the fundamental attitude of Buddhism is intensely empirical and anti-authoritarian .
Gotama the Buddha was a highly unorthodox individual and real anti-traditionalist .
He did not offer his teaching as a set of dogmas , but rather as a set of propositions for each individual to investigate for himself .
His invitation to one and all was ' Come and See ' .
One of the things he said to his followers was " Place no head above your own " .
By this he meant , do n't accept somebody else 's word .
See for yourself .
We want you to apply this attitude to every word you read in this manual .
We are not making statements that you would accept merely because we are authorities in the field .
Blind faith has nothing to do with this .
These are experiential realities .
Learn to adjust your mode of perception according to instructions given in the book , and you will see for yourself .
That and only that provides ground for your faith .
Insight meditation is essentially a practice of investigative personal discovery .
Having said this , we will present here a very short synopsis of some of the key points of Buddhist philosophy .
We make no attempt to be thorough , since that has been quite nicely done in many other books .
This material is essential to understanding Vipassana , therefore , some mention must be made .
From the Buddhist point of view , we human beings live in a very peculiar fashion .
We view impermanent things as permanent , though everything is changing all around us .
The process of change is constant and eternal .
As you read these words , your body is aging .
But you pay no attention to that .
The book in your hand is decaying .
The print is fading and the pages are becoming brittle .
The walls around you are aging .
The molecules within those walls are vibrating at an enormous rate , and everything is shifting , going to pieces and dissolving slowly .
You pay no attention to that , either .
Then one day you look around you .
Your body is wrinkled and squeaky and you hurt .
The book is a yellowed , useless lump ; the building is caving in .
So you pine for lost youth and you cry when the possessions are gone .
Where does this pain come from ?
It comes from your own inattention .
You failed to look closely at life .
You failed to observe the constantly shifting flow of the world as it went by .
You set up a collection of mental constructions , ' me ' , ' the book ' , ' the building ' , and you assume that they would endure forever .
They never do .
But you can tune into the constantly ongoing change .
You can learn to perceive your life as an ever - flowing movement , a thing of great beauty like a dance or symphony .
You can learn to take joy in the perpetual passing away of all phenomena .
You can learn to live with the flow of existence rather than running perpetually against the grain .
You can learn this .
It is just a matter of time and training .
Our human perceptual habits are remarkably stupid in some ways .
We tune out 99 % of all the sensory stimuli we actually receive , and we solidify the remainder into discrete mental objects .
Then we react to those mental objects in programmed habitual ways .
An example :
There you are , sitting alone in the stillness of a peaceful night .
A dog barks in the distance .
The perception itself is indescribably beautiful if you bother to examine it .
Up out of that sea of silence come surging waves of sonic vibration .
You start to hear the lovely complex patterns , and they are turned into scintillating electronic stimulations within the nervous system .
The process is beautiful and fulfilling in itself .
We humans tend to ignore it totally .
Instead , we solidify that perception into a mental object .
We paste a mental picture on it and we launch into a series of emotional and conceptual reactions to it .
" There is that dog again .
He is always barking at night .
What a nuisance .
Every night he is a real bother .
Somebody should do something .
Maybe I should call a cop .
No , a dog catcher .
So , I 'll call the pound .
No , maybe I 'll just write a real nasty letter to the guy who owns that dog .
No , too much trouble .
I 'll just get an ear plug . "
They are just perceptual and mental habits .
You learn to respond this way as a child by copying the perceptual habits of those around you .
These perceptual responses are not inherent in the structure of the nervous system .
The circuits are there .
But this is not the only way that our mental machinery can be used .
That which has been learned can be unlearned .
The first step is to realize what you are doing , as you are doing it , and stand back and quietly watch .
From the Buddhist perspective , we humans have a backward view of life .
We look at what is actually the cause of suffering and we see it as happiness .
The cause of suffering is that desire - aversion syndrome which we spoke of earlier .
Up pops a perception .
It could be anything - - a beautiful girl , a handsome guy , speed boat , thug with a gun , truck bearing down on you , anything .
Whatever it is , the very next thing we do is to react to the stimulus with a feeling about it .
Take worry .
We worry a lot .
Worry itself is the problem .
Worry is a process .
It has steps .
Anxiety is not just a state of existence but a procedure .
What you 've got to do is to look at the very beginning of that procedure , those initial stages before the process has built up a head of steam .
The very first link of the worry chain is the grasping / rejecting reaction .
As soon as some phenomenon pops into the mind , we try mentally to grab onto it or push it away .
That sets the worry response in motion .
Luckily , there is a handy little tool called Vipassana meditation which you can use to short - circuit the whole mechanism .
Vipassana meditation teaches us how to scrutinize our own perceptual process with great precision .
We learn to watch the arising of thought and perception with a feeling of serene detachment .
We learn to view our own reactions to stimuli with calm and clarity .
We begin to see ourselves reacting without getting caught up in the reactions themselves .
The obsessive nature of thought slowly dies .
We can still get married .
We can still step out of the path of the truck .
But we do n't need to go through hell over either one .
This escape from the obsessive nature of thought produces a whole new view of reality .
It is a complete paradigm shift , a total change in the perceptual mechanism .
It brings with it the feeling of peace and rightness , a new zest for living and a sense of completeness to every activity .
Because of these advantages , Buddhism views this way of looking at things as a correct view of life and Buddhist texts call it seeing things as they really are .
Vipassana meditation is a set of training procedures which open us gradually to this new view of reality as it truly is .
Along with this new reality goes a new view of the most central aspect of reality : ' me ' .
A close inspection reveals that we have done the same thing to ' me ' that we have done to all other perceptions .
We have taken a flowing vortex of thought , feeling and sensation and we have solidified that into a mental construct .
Then we have stuck a label onto it , ' me ' .
And forever after , we treat it as if it were a static and enduring entity .
We view it as a thing separate from all other things .
We pinch ourselves off from the rest of that process of eternal change which is the universe .
And then we grieve over how lonely we feel .
We ignore our inherent connectedness to all other beings and we decide that ' I ' have to get more for ' me ' ; then we marvel at how greedy and insensitive human beings are .
And on it goes .
Every evil deed , every example of heartlessness in the world stems directly from this false sense of ' me ' as distinct from all else that is out there .
Explode the illusion of that one concept and your whole universe changes .
Do n't expect to do this overnight , though .
You spent your whole life building up that concept , reinforcing it with every thought , word , and deed over all those years .
It is not going to evaporate instantly .
But it will pass if you give it enough time and enough attention .
Vipassana meditation is a process by which it is dissolved .
Little by little , you chip away at it just by watching it .
The ' I ' concept is a process .
It is a thing we are doing .
In Vipassana we learn to see that we are doing it , when we are doing it and how we are doing it .
Then it moves and fades away , like a cloud passing through the clear sky .
We are left in a state where we can do it or not do it , whichever seems appropriate to the situation .
The compulsiveness is gone .
We have a choice .
These are all major insights , of course .
Each one is a deep - reaching understanding of one of the fundamental issues of human existence .
They do not occur quickly , nor without considerable effort .
But the payoff is big .
They lead to a total transformation of your life .
Every second of your existence thereafter is changed .
The meditator who pushes all the way down this track achieves perfect mental health , a pure love for all that lives and complete cessation of suffering .
That is not a small goal .
But you do n't have to go all the way to reap benefits .
They start right away and they pile up over the years .
It is a cumulative function .
The more you sit , the more you learn about the real nature of your own existence .
The more hours you spend in meditation , the greater your ability to calmly observe every impulse and intention , every thought and emotion just as it arises in the mind .
Your progress to liberation is measured in cushion - man hours .
And you can stop any time you 've had enough .
There is no stick over your head except your own desire to see the true quality of life , to enhance your own existence and that of others .
Vipassana meditation is inherently experiential .
It is not theoretical .
In the practice of mediation you become sensitive to the actual experience of living , to how things feel .
You do not sit around developing subtle and aesthetic thoughts about living .
You live .
Vipassana meditation more than anything else is learning to live .
BEIJING , Aug. 31 — When high school students in Shanghai crack their history textbooks this fall they may be in for a surprise .
The new standard world history text drops wars , dynasties and Communist revolutions in favor of colorful tutorials on economics , technology , social customs and globalization .
Socialism has been reduced to a single , short chapter in the senior high school history course .
Chinese Communism before the economic reform that began in 1979 is covered in a sentence .
The text mentions Mao only once — in a chapter on etiquette .
Nearly overnight the country ’s most prosperous schools have shelved the Marxist template that had dominated standard history texts since the 1950’s .
The changes passed high - level scrutiny , the authors say , and are part of a broader effort to promote a more stable , less violent view of Chinese history that serves today ’s economic and political goals .
Supporters say the overhaul enlivens mandatory history courses for junior and senior high school students and better prepares them for life in the real world .
The old textbooks , not unlike the ruling Communist Party , changed relatively little in the last quarter - century of market - oriented economic reforms .
They were glaringly out of sync with realities students face outside the classroom .
But critics say the textbooks trade one political agenda for another .

There ’s an interesting debate going on about whether bloggers should accept gifts from vendors .
Lately Microsoft , working through their PR agency , Edelman , has been getting rather aggressive about trying to buy good coverage from bloggers .
A few months ago they invited bloggers out to Seattle to meet Bill Gates , with all expenses paid ( hotel , airfare , etc ) .
Last week they send out a round of expensive laptops with Vista preinstalled .
These are not loans , by the way : they ’re completely free laptops ( “ yours to keep ! ” ) .
Here ’s the offer I received from a Microsoft employee :
I ’m working on getting some hardware out to key community folks , and I ’d like to offer you a review PC .
I ’d love to send you a loaded Ferrari 1000 courtesy of Windows Vista and AMD .
Are you interested ?
This would be a review machine , so I ’d love to hear your opinion on the machine and OS .
Full disclosure – while I hope you will blog about your experience with the pc , you do n’t have to .
Also , you are welcome to send the machine back to us after you are done playing with it , or you can give it away on your site , or you can keep it .
My recommendation is that you give it away on your site , but it ’s your call .
Just let me know your opinion on Windows Vista and what you plan to do with it when the time comes .
Sounds nice , huh ?
What could be wrong with that ?
Robert Scoble says “ it ’s an awesome idea . ”
He says that as long as the bloggers disclose that they got the laptops free , they ’re acting ethically .
And he says that Edelman is just “ doing their job , ” which is therefore by definition ethical :
On Edelman ’s side ?
Is sending out laptops ethical ?
Of course !
That ’s their job .
Scoble is wrong .
Just because it ’s someones job to do something , does n’t make it ethical .
Robert , your logic is faulty .
Unless you want to assume that anything that Edelman does in the name of promoting Microsoft is automatically ethical , this logical argument you are making is simply false .
For example , if Edelman paid a bribe to a government official to standardize on Windows , that would not be ethical , even though it ’s their job .
So .
Does disclosure work ?
The theory here is that if a blogger admits to receiving a gift , the reader can make up their mind as to whether that blogger has any credibility on this topic .
Imagine this innocuous series of events :
Blogger gets free Vista PC Tries it out Feels obliged to blog about it Writes “ I got a free Vista PC .
It has a really sharp - looking on - screen clock ! ”
Reader thinks , “ hmm , no credibility , but that ’s a nice looking clock there .
Maybe I ’ll get Vista . ”
Effectively Microsoft has bought publicity and goodwill .
And even though the blogger has fully disclosed what happened , their message is corrupting the medium .
I ’ve been thinking long and hard about this , and the only conclusion I can come to is that this is ethically indistinguishable from bribery .
Even if no quid - pro-quo is formally required , the gift creates a social obligation of reciprocity .
This is best explained in Cialdini ’s book Influence ( a summary is here ) .
The blogger will feel some obligation to return the favor to Microsoft .
These gifts reduce the public trust in blogs .
Recently I wrote a nice article , for example , about Sonos .
I bought the system with my own money , liked it , thought it had some great UI that programmers should pay attention to .
Most people understood the article to be what it was : a positive review about a good product , influenced only by the fact that the product was good .
But some people thought it was just a paid advertisement .
This is the most frustrating thing about the practice of giving bloggers free stuff : it pisses in the well , reducing the credibility of all blogs .
I ’m upset that people trust me less because of the behavior of other bloggers .
Do n’t even get me started about PayPerPost .
Anyway .
I do not have clean hands .
I accepted that stupid cell phone from Sprint fully intending to never write about it , and later decided it was so bad I should just write a negative review .
For a couple of years , I accepted a donation of colocation space and facilities from Peer 1 Network , but only because they were the best colocation facility and backbone provider I could find , and only because Joel on Software is really a non-profit , advertising - free site and I was happy to accept the sponsorship .
Google donated a Search Appliance to provide search for Joel on Software , also mostly as a community service on their part , which was very nice .
They probably intended to get some free publicity out of it .
They did .
Microsoft ’s crazy offer , though , made me think a lot more about this whole thing , and I ’ve decided that from this point forward I ’m not accepting anything , full stop .
Even if my moral logic is faulty , and there ’s nothing wrong with accepting gifts , I personally feel that it ’s not worth the reduced credibility .
Who are the most trusted reviewers out there ?
Consumer Reports , probably .
They do n’t take anything from vendors .
They even buy everything they review at retail , which is what I ’m going to do .
Today , Fog Creek Software pays the Peer 1 bills .
I declined the Microsoft offer and bought my own fully - loaded Dell laptop ( a D620 ) to try out Vista .
My conclusions :
Do not , under any circumstances , consider upgrading an XP system to Vista … even if it ’s fairly new and even if it ’s Vista Supremo Premium Ultra - Capable .
When you get a new computer , if it comes with Vista pre-installed , that ’s when you ’ll upgrade .
Do n’t buy a new computer now just to get Vista .
If your current system meets your needs , stick with it until you really need a new system .
Vista is not reason enough for a new PC .
Need more details ?
Read Paul Thurrott ’s review .
It ’s impossible to be completely pure here .
I ’m not an isolated test lab in the middle of nowhere doing nothing other than testing products .
The ways in which I am influenced are many .
Disclosure is not always possible .
I may forget things .
Things can get blurry .
I might have gone to a bookstore , looked at the Apress section ( my publisher ) to see if they have anything new and interesting , seen a good book , bought it , given it to one of my summer interns , and then it shows up in a critical scene in the Aardvark ’d movie .
And Gary Cornell , the publisher of Apress , is a close personal friend .
OK , was that unethical ?
I ’d have to live in a monastery to completely avoid those kinds of conflicts of interest .
I ’d have to bore everyone to tears to disclose them , and I might forget stuff , so disclosure is not even a practical answer .
I ’ll keep trying , though , to earn your trust .
China Newsphoto
ROSS PEROT , a populist American politician , predicted in the early 1990s that a trade pact with Mexico would create a ‘ ‘ giant sucking sound ' ' as jobs headed south .
Instead , America experienced full employment .
So giant - sucking - sound detectors turned to China .
In time , China became the workshop of the world , although by then America had long hollowed out much of its manufacturing .
Now there really is a giant sucking sound — not one made by the flight of jobs , but by China ferociously hoovering up commodities and raw materials .
Although it accounts for roughly 4 % of global GDP ( measured at market exchange rates ) , China consumes 30 % of the world 's supply of minerals and other raw materials .
This time around , the world has not only heard the sucking sound , but has also felt its effects , as the prices of commodities such as iron ore , copper and zinc have soared , doubling or tripling in just a couple of years .
How has China suddenly developed such a big appetite ?
The economy has been growing at a dizzying rate , recently by double digits .
Much of this growth is driven by fixed - asset investment , which now accounts for more than 50 % of GDP a year — a higher proportion than that of any other country at any time in history .
This relentless capacity for expansion has created an insatiable demand for raw materials .
China also wastes a lot .
Take energy consumption .
China required 4.3 times as much energy as America in 2005 to produce one unit of GDP , up from 3.4 times in 2002 .
It can be argued that much of China 's new investment has not yet reached optimal efficiency .
That may be true , but it does not explain why things are getting worse : China consumed 15 % more energy per unit of GDP in 2005 than it did in 2002 .
India , also a rapidly expanding economy , consumes only 61 % as much energy as China per unit of GDP .
China 's wasteful growth has brought joy to commodity producers and their bankers and shareholders worldwide .
With rising profitability and stock prices , they have been happily expanding mining operations and acquiring or merging with rivals .
But there are reasons to believe that the surge in commodity prices worldwide has run out of steam .
The slowdown of the American economy , China 's largest export market , will further force China to focus on stimulating domestic demand
There is strong evidence that the current cycle of China 's investment - led growth has peaked .
A clear sign of overheating is the increase in accounts receivable .
Although sales appear robust , Chinese firms are beginning to find it difficult to get paid in cash , either because their buyers cannot turn over their own stocks fast enough or because they have trouble borrowing money to finance their purchases .
The receivables of the 166 largest state - controlled Chinese firms rose by 14 % in the first half of 2006 from a year earlier .
For over a third of these firms , receivables now account for more than 30 % of total sales , which is twice as high as the average gross margin for Chinese firms .
It was the escalating volume of ‘‘ triangular debts ' ' or receivables between different domestic firms that led to the overheating and consequent severe austerity programme in the mid-1990s .
China 's growth has become too expensive in many ways .
Overinvestment pulls up prices of raw materials but , simultaneously , overcapacity depresses the prices of finished products .
Whereas prices of imported raw materials rose sharply between 2003 and 2005 , those of Chinese exports to America fell by 5.2 % .
As a net importer of raw materials and a net exporter of finished products , China is paying a high price for its growth , particularly to commodity - producing countries .
China needs a break to catch its breath , in more ways than one .
As anyone who has been to the mainland in recent years knows , all the major cities are choking with smoke and environmental damage has reached appalling levels .
The government knows this and during 2006 tightened the screw on the economy several more turns .
Interest rates will continue to rise .
The trouble is that much of the liquidity comes from hot money , which finds its way into China around foreign - exchange controls in anticipation of a yuan appreciation .
Each rise in interest rates only encourages more speculative inflows .
This means that China will inevitably allow the yuan to appreciate further in 2007 ( though not as sharply as worriers in Washington , DC , would like ) , while also further relaxing capital controls , to keep the growth of money supply at least partly in check .
The central bank has taken other measures to reduce liquidity , including telling banks not to lend to ‘‘ overheated sectors ' ' such as steel , cement , coal and power , and forcing them to buy central - bank bills .
These measures are already checking investment growth .
The economy will grow more slowly in 2007 .
This will help the country make the transition from investment - led growth to expansion led by private consumption .
The slowdown of the American economy , China 's largest export market , will further force China to focus on stimulating domestic demand .
All this suggests that the good times for commodity producers are about to come to an end .
Although commodity producers will mourn it , a quietening of China 's roar will help sustain its growth .
And , for the health of China and its neighbours , a pause for breath — of cleaner air , one hopes — will definitely be welcome .
The famously austere Mr Ahmadinejad has been criticised by his own allies after attending the lavish opening ceremony of the Asian games in Qatar , a sporting competition involving 13,000 athletes from 39 countries .
The ceremony featured Indian and Egyptian dancers and female vocalists .
Many were not wearing veils .
Women are forbidden to sing and dance before a male audience under Iran 's Islamic legal code .
Officials are expected to excuse themselves from such engagements when abroad but TV pictures showed Mr Ahmadinejad sitting with President Bashar Assad of Syria and Ismail Haniya , the Palestinian prime minister , during last Friday 's ceremony in Doha .
Religious fundamentalists , usually Mr Ahmadinejad 's keenest supporters , are asking why he attended a ceremony that violated his own government 's strict interpretation of Shia Islam .
The Baztab website , considered close to Mohsen Rezaee , a former revolutionary guard commander with links to powerful sections of Iran 's political hierarchy , said Mr Ahmadinejad 's presence had offended Shias in Iran and elsewhere .
" The failure of Ahmadinejad to object and his constant presence has damaged the image of Iran 's Islamic revolution and its commitment to Islamic rules in contrast with the Arab countries in the Gulf , " it said .
The president 's aides insist he was not present during the singing and dancing .
His press secretary , Ali Akbar Javanfekr , claimed Mr Ahmadinejad had left for Doha airport before the performance .
However , Baztab posted footage which purported to show Mr Ahmadinejad in his seat after the show .
Jalal Yahyazadeh , a rightwing MP , said : " We have heard from some sources that Ahmadinejad was in the stadium at the time .
Those who created the conditions for his presence should be investigated as quickly as possible . "

While I am venting about Google this morning , I may as well share a feeling I 've had lately about Google .
They are lame .
Not in their core search product which remains the single greatest web service in existence .
But in many of their recent initiatives , Google has introduced a delay between submit and display .
And that 's just lame in this day and age of instant recall .
Here are some examples of their lameness .
When I first uploaded a video to google , it just vanished .
Poof .
Gone .
I had no way to see it and no idea where it had gone to .
I put Google Analytics on my blog on Monday .
I still do n't have any data .
The service tells me , " Analytics has been successfully installed and data is being gathered now .
Your first reports will be ready within twelve hours . "
Not exactly .
I submitted a theater review to Google Base this morning .
And it took ten minutes to be processed and displayed .
Does it take Craigslist that long to post a listing ?
No way .
Posting stuff to the Internet has to be instantaneous .
What if wrote this post on Tyeppad and it took me 10 minutes to see the result ?
What if I posted a photo to Flickr and it took a day to see it ?
What if I put sitemeter on my blog and had to wait three days before seeing my traffic ?
I would stop using all of those services .
Fortunately , they do n't do that to me .
Google does .
Is it arrogance that they think they can get away with it while others can't ?
Are they so huge that their vaunted data centers can't process the posts quickly enough ?
Who knows ?
But I know this .
Google is lame .
Here ’s a question : is Runtime Revolution the cross- platform application development tool for people who just want to get things done ?
Answer : quite possibly .
Runtime Revolution revives the simple development model that Bill Atkinson pioneered with Hypercard back in 1987 .
Fresh from his triumph of building MacPaint for the Apple Macintosh , Atkinson brought together the concepts of object - based , event - driven programming and hypermedia to create a highly popular tool for rapid application development .
Atkinson insisted that Apple gave it away free with the Macintosh which helped it to spread quickly in the late 1980s .
Unfortunately the lack of a decent PC implementation and commercial changes at Apple meant that Hypercard eventually withered away .
Further development was stopped in 2000 and , sadly , Apple abandoned it altogether in 2004 .
Hypercard was , perhaps , one of the most influential pieces of software ever written .
Not only did it influence Robert Cailliau , the technical wizard behind the creation of the World Wide Web , it was also the model for Viola - the first Web browser - and Javascript .
Hypercard has also maintained a devoted following in the development world and a range of subsequent developments have kept its spirit alive .
This heritage is immediately apparent in Runtime Revolution .
It builds on the Hypercard approach and overcomes many of the original tool 's limitations .
Revolution actually sits on top of a cross- platform engine called Metacard which was developed as a Hypercard replacement in the early 1990s .
Runtime took over the Metacard engine a couple of years ago and has effectively transformed Hypercard into a modern cross-platform development tool .
You can build one set of code to run on Linux and Windows PCs as well as the original Macintosh .
The latest version - just released - supports Microsoft 's new Vista operating system .
Revolution comes in two basic forms - Revolution Media , a low - cost version geared to producing media applications such as slide shows or presentations - and Revolution Studio for more advanced development .
Revolution Studio also comes in an Enterprise edition .
All Revolution tools use the concept of the Hypercard stack as their starting point .
In its rawest form a stack can be equated to a database which contains cards instead of records .
Each card in the stack can contain a variety of objects including fields and buttons .
Each object may have a script associated with it .
A simple navigation button , for example , can contain a script which transfers to a new location - such as a different card or stack .
Revolution 's graphical development environment enables new objects to be dragged into the screen area and modified accordingly .
Buttons and fields can be re-positioned and re-sized .
Their associated scripts may also be called up and edited to initiate further actions .
One of the best features of Revolution is the ability to flip flop between edit mode and run mode .
The main tool bar includes a button to alter the mode so you can set up a new object , edit the script , flip into run mode and check that it does what you want instantly .
If it does n't do what you want - you flip into edit mode , make some changes and try again .
This combination of power and simplicity is what appeals to developers .
Bill Marriott , a US - based developer who works closely with Runtime , is a big fan .
" I used to like Hypercard and came to Revolution because it was an obvious successor .
Revolution lets you build full applications - the language is just so easy and yet so powerful , " he says .
Marriott is also impressed with the cross- platform features .
" It is the only serious product that lets you write one set of code for so many platforms .
I recently completed a project for a hospital where they had a wide range of machines from old clunkers to the newest high - spec machine .
Just one development and it worked fine on every machine . "
This comes at a price , however .
" If I have a gripe it is that you can't do things like browser plug-ins and Active X controls - but that 's what you sacrifice for the cross - platform compatibility , " he observes .
Ben Rubinstein , technical director of CogApp ( formerly Cognitive Applications ) also came to Revolution from Hypercard - although he is keen to point out that Revolution is much more than just a Hypercard replacement .
" It really does improve on Hypercard - particularly in the ways that the language has been extended .
It holds its own against development tools such as C , C++ and Python and we use it for all sorts of projects . "
Rubinstein says Revolution is especially useful for small scale projects which need building quickly .
" You can use it for the sort of applications that you would not do if you did not have this sort of tool - rapid one - off development for a complete functional application . "
He also praised the cross-platform features in Revolution .
" If you develop on one platform you hardly have to check that it works on the others .
We have clients with Mac and Windows and have found it is quite easy to do auto - updates on multiple platforms . "
This creates something of a dilemma for Rubinstein .
" On the one hand it is the sort of product that I want to keep a secret because it gives us a competitive edge .
On the other hand I want to shout about it because it is so good . "
Marriott is equally complimentary : " It ’s a tool for people who want to get things done . "
Runtime provides free 30 - day trial copies of Revolution and prices start at £ 33.00 for Revolution Media and £ 666.00 for Revolution Enterprise .

Cognitive Seduction and the " peekaboo " law
Brains are turned on by puzzles .
Brains are turned on by figuring things out .
Brains are turned on by even the smallest " aha " moments .
And despite what some of you ( * cough * men * cough * ) might believe , the brain is more turned on by seeing just the arms of a naked woman behind a shower curtain than it is by seeing all of her .
So if you 're trying to engage someone 's brain , do n't show everything .
Let their brain connect the dots .
At least , that 's what the neuroscientists say in the latest issue of Scientific American Mind .
In their article The Neurology of Aesthetics , our favorite brain guy V.S. Ramachandran and Diane Rogers - Ramachandran describe a series of " laws " of aesthetics ( they put " laws " in quotes ) and how they 're supported by what we know of the brain .
My favorite -- and one that we 've been talking about ( minus the festive name ) for a long time here -- is known as Peekaboo .
From the article :
" An unclothed person who has only arms or part of a shoulder jutting out from behind a shower curtain or who is behind a diaphanous veil is much more alluring than a completely uncovered nude .
Just as the thinking parts of our brain enjoy intellectual problem solving , the visual system seems to enjoy discovering a hidden object .
Evolution has seen to it that the very act of searching for the hidden object is enjoyable , not just the final " aha " of recognition -- lest you give up the chase .
Otherwise , we would not pursue a potential prey or mate glimpsed partially behind bushes or dense fog . "
If something dangerous is hiding in the bushes , it 's damn useful for the brain to reconstruct a complete tiger from just a few bits of orange and black peeking out between the leaves .
Apparently it's all the little mini-aha moments that send messages to the brain that prompt still more searches and more mini-ahas until the final BIG aha where your brain nails it .
It goes on :
" The clever fashion designer or artists tries to evoke as many mini " ahas , " ambiguities , peak shifts and pardoxes as possible in the image . "
We 're always trying to leave something to the reader / learner / observer 's imagination .
Something for them to fill in .
( This relates to our earlier space between the notes post ) .
In my workshops and talks , I show a series of photos where things are not fully resolved ... a face hidden behind a hand , a ( potentially naked ) woman staring intently at an object you can't quite see , the lower half of a young man suspended in air next to a tree , where you can't see the ground OR anything above his waist ( is he hanging from the tree ? on a trampoline ? in the midst of an alien abduction ? )
To the brain , these " Hmmm ... what 's the story here ? " images are virtually irresistible .
The brain needs to figure it out , and enjoys the experience .
This applies to non-visual things as well , of course .
In learning , the more you fill things in and hold the learner 's hand , the less their brain will engage .
If they do n't need to fire a single neuron to walk through the tutorial , lesson , lecture , etc. , they 're getting a shallow , surface - level , non-memorable exposure of " covered " material , but ... what 's the point ?
Obviously this does n't mean you just never tell them anything period .
This is about graduated hints , mental teasing , cognitive treasure hunts , sparking curiosity , etc .
Things that engage the brain .
( This is part of the brain - friendly strategy we use in our books . )
Whether you 're trying to get someone 's attention , keep their attention , motivate them to stick with something , or help them to learn more deeply and retain what they 've learned , leave something for their brain to resolve .
Do something to turn their brain on .
[ Disclaimer : this does NOT apply to something like reference docs , where you do n't want their brain to become engaged .
With reference material , I want to get them in and out as quickly as possible -- with the accurate info they need -- and where retention and recall is not a goal . ]

Forget neurology , the philosophers have known this since antiquity .
For a recent example : " Is not the most erotic portion of the body where the garment gapes ? . . . it is intermittence , as psychoanalysis has so rightly stated , which is erotic : the intermittence of skin flashing between two articles of clothing ( trousers and sweater ) , between two edges ( the open - necked shirt , the glove and the sleeve ) ; it is this flash itself which seduces , or rather : the staging of an appearance - as - disappearance . " -- Roland Barthes , The Pleasure of the Text ( 1973 )
Posted by : John | Nov 28 , 2006 5:57:49 PM
This is absolutely true !
As a teacher , I believe it is important to teach by asking questions and allow students to formulate answers as I guide them .
That is why retention for straight lecture is practically nil but if a student does a project , they can recall what they learned years later !
It is the difference between good teaching and terrible teaching .
Unfortunately , many college profs and teachers do not remember this !
I love teaching but it is a tough job when done right because it means guiding and resisting the temptation to ' tell all " and take away the thrill of discovery .
Peekaboo is so true !
Posted by : Vicki Davis | Nov 28 , 2006 6:15:37 PM
Absolutely true .
I 'm a 24 - year - old male , so naturally , I am assumed to be flying off the horny - scale handle , but even during my high school years until present time , that alluring image or thought killed me more than revealing entirely everything .
I think this is why when only so much is revealed , it attracts me a lot more than the person being entirely nude .
Just the thought of revelation or the hint of it is the real driving power ( at least in my experiences ) .
I would see a woman in two places : entirely nude and in a very fitting , alluring outfit ( that slit up the side alongside the leg up to the upper - thigh is murder ) and while she would have a knockout body nude , that teasing hint provided by the outfit drove it home better .

I 'm just wandering if the image would be as alluring if the shower curtain was completely opaque and not a bit translucent ...
Also , without scrolling back up can anyone say what was on the shower curtain ?
If not , just consider it a reminder to use an appropriate image for what you are " selling " ... this might be a bad choice if you were selling shower curtains .

Kathy ,
This article is BRILLIANT and a must read for any teacher !
Nothing is worse than when you 've got that zombie - syndrome going in class .
We 've all been there as students and it's likely that every teacher has experienced it sometime in their career .
Something to grab students in and trigger them to want to learn is a great technique .
And I TOTALLY agree that spoon feeding a curriculum and holding their hands every step of the way helps NONE .
In fact it only enables them to become more dependent , which is why I LOVE the idea of problem based learning .
I 'm constantly reminded by other instructors that though it 's important to teach students , it 's equally as important that they understand it 's their responsibility to LEARN what 's being taught .
And that 's where this article become a perfect fit to catching their attention and making learning more motivational .
I LOVE it !

A very interesting theory .

Ramachandran is a maniac when it comes to brains , having spent a good part of his life studying and researching on the subject .

The peekaboo theory relates to incongruency theory and brand names .
If the name of your company or product is too descriptive , it fails to engage the customer 's mind .

The same could be said about music as well ... a bit of novel ambiguity in chord structure or in the lyrics ,
which bugs someone like Bob Dylan when fans misinterpret the words to his songs .

This reminds me of an interview with the director of a - ha 's " Take On Me " video I saw back in the ' 80s .
As well as the technical innovation of the video his key objective was to make more of the band members by showing less of them , thereby generating increased interest to know and see more of them .

I think this also explains why you miss people after not seeing them in a while .
Bits and pieces of what it feels like to be around them start to go away , and as you obsess on searching your memories to build the full picture of who they are , it makes you think " if only I could see them right now . "
Same goes for love .
In a lot of cases , " falling in love " consists of work you do on your own reflecting back .
And even Ernest Hemingway built his novels around the " iceberg principle " , where only the tip , above water , was told , and the huge mass underwater was implied :
" If a writer of prose knows enough about what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader , if the writer is writing truly enough , will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them .
The dignity of movement of the iceberg is due to only one - eighth of it being above water .
The writer who omits things because he does not know them only makes hollow places in his writing . "

The costume designer of the original Star Trek added his own twist to this same psychology .
The female love interests would often be wearing quite a lot of clothing ( this was the 60s when the law was still quite strict on what could be shown on TV ) , so he would not only reveal just enough flesh ( as the article above mentions ) but also make it look as if the clothes might just fall off at any moment .
As a result , many men remember the Star Trek women as being scantily clad - in actual fact , they were anything but :-)

Great post as always !
Interesting as the peekaboo factor is by itself ( and I love difficult puzzles and intellectual challenges ) , it also takes me to wanting the next level of involvement , which hinges on suspense , and , in a ' story ' context , conflict .
The enhancement of curiosity to discover the parts that are hidden with what she / you / I will do or say next and in response , is downright irresistable .

Allowing us to imagine what is behind the curtain is more alluring because what we are imagining is almost always BETTER than what is actually underneath .

I have noticed that some major advertisers do this .
I have seen billboards and ads where the font is " so big " that the brand name gets cut off :
i.e .
Marlbor
Budweis
When I saw them , I thought it was brilliant , because my brain then automatically completed the full brand name .

Vera 's comment led me to realise the peekaboo factor is at work here , in the blog and the comments .
What else is said if I come back to morrow or scroll down just a little more ?
Sometimes the anticipation is better than the reality , and sometimes the reality leaves anticipation gasping .
Which , naturally , leads to further anticipation and more scrolling .
Does this help explain the popularity of blogs and online forums ?

New Evidence Suggests Noah's Sons Rode Flying Dinosaurs CREATION SCIENCE BREAKING NEWS
For years , Creation Scientists have disputed how Noah was able to quickly collect millions of indigenous animals from remote , inaccessible regions of the world for a 40 - day ride in his ark .
New evidence from an archeological find in China supports the long held Christian belief that Noah 's sons rode giant flying dinosaurs to transport duck billed platypuses from Australia , and penguins and polar bears from the Antarctic , to name a few .
" Those must have been some mighty big flying dinosaurs , " says Pastor Deacon Fred .
" Imagine the look on Noah 's face when his sons flew in for a landing with a pair of Hippos strapped to the back of one of them things !
Glory to God ! "
" The Lord is just amazing , " says Creation Scientist , Dr. Jonathan Edwards .
" Whenever Atheist scientists make a new find , they think it will hack away at our Christian beliefs .
They must get pretty peeved at how sneaky our Lord is , because whenever they unearth something , it only provides more support for the historical accuracy of the Holy Bible
And these flying dinosaurs they keep finding are no exception ! "
Dr. Edwards explains that it would have been impossible for Noah 's sons to travel to the four corners of the earth to areas that were previously inaccessible on foot .
" Noah and his sons had to collect two of every single creature on the face of the planet , " he says .
" We 're talking about a big haul here .
At first we just attributed it to what Creation Scientists call , the Holy Finger Snapping Theory .
That 's where God snaps his fingers and just makes it so . "
Edwards points out that Creation Scientists are still unanimous in attributing the fact that Noah was able to load 100 million plus animals onto a 450 foot ark " in the selfsame day " ( Genesis 7:13 - 14 ) to the Finger Snapping Theory .
In the case of how the animals were collected from remote regions of the world in the first place however , recent archeological finds indicate that Noah 's sons were able to tame giant flying dinosaurs and in turn , load them up with food supplies and hitch rides for long trips around the world to China , South America , Australia , Greenland , and the North Pole .
Creation Scientists estimate that since the Earth is only ten - thousand years old , human beings were living among dinosaurs and had plenty of time to tame them .
" I would have loved to have been around to see Cain and Abel rolling around in the grass outside the Garden of Eden playing with the pet raptors their father , Adam , gave them for their birthdays , " says Pastor Deacon Fred .
" What a glorious time that must have been ! "
Through tithing donations from Landover Baptist Church members , the Center for Creation Research was able to secure several fossilized remains of flying dinosaurs valued at over $ 14 million .
The remains will be studied exhaustively for evidence of the leather harnessing used to secure Noah 's sons for their long transcontinental journeys .

Chop off a salamander 's leg and a brand new one will sprout in no time .
But most animals have lost the ability to replace missing limbs .
Now , a research team at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies has been able to regenerate a wing in a chick embryo - a species not known to be able to regrow limbs - suggesting that the potential for such regeneration exists innately in all vertebrates , including humans .
Their study , published in the advance online edition of the journal Genes and Development on November 17 , demonstrates that vertebrate regeneration is under the control of the powerful
Wnt signaling system :
Activating it overcomes the mysterious barrier to regeneration in animals like chicks that can't normally replace missing limbs while inactivating it in animals known to be able to regenerate their limbs ( frogs , zebrafish , and salamanders ) shuts down their ability to replace missing legs and tails .
' In this simple experiment , we removed part of the chick embryo's wing , activated Wnt signaling , and got the whole limb back - a beautiful and perfect wing , ' said the lead author , Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte ( homepage ) , Ph.D. , a professor in the Gene Expression Laboratory .
' By changing the expression of a few genes , you can change the ability of a vertebrate to regenerate their limbs , rebuilding blood vessels , bone , muscles , and skin - everything that is needed . '
This new discovery ' opens up an entirely new area of research , ' Belmonte says .
' Even though certain animals have lost their ability to regenerate limbs during evolution , conserved genetic machinery may still be present , and can be put to work again , ' he said .
Continued at " Regeneration : Scientist regrow chicken wing " [ Wingless , Science ]

Based on the Genes and Development paper " Wnt / beta - catenin signaling regulates vertebrate limb regeneration " :
Abstract
The cellular and molecular bases allowing tissue regeneration are not well understood .
By performing gain - and loss - of - function experiments of specific members of the Wnt pathway during appendage regeneration , we demonstrate that this pathway is not only necessary for regeneration to occur , but it is also able to promote regeneration in axolotl , Xenopus , and zebrafish .
Furthermore , we show that changes in the spatiotemporal distribution of beta- catenin in the developing chick embryo elicit apical ectodermal ridge and limb regeneration in an organism previously thought not to regenerate .
Our studies may provide valuable insights toward a better understanding of adult tissue regeneration .
Also see " Birds that make teeth ( Press Release + Summary ) " :
Gone does not necessarily mean forgotten , especially in biology .
A recent finding by researchers at the University of Wisconsin , Madison , and colleagues from the University of Manchester have found new evidence that the ability to form previously lost organs - in this case , teeth - can be maintained millions of years after the last known ancestor possessed them .

Bloggers On Blogging : ブルース・シュナイアー 著者： Rebecca Blood 日本語訳： yomoyomo
以下の文章は 、Rebecca Blood による Bloggers On Blogging : Bruce Schneier の日本語訳であり、著者の許可を得て公開するものである。
Bruce Schneier は非常に人気のあるブログである Schneier on Security を 2004年10 月に始めた。彼は BT Counterpane の CTO であり、八冊の本の著書である。彼の著書にはベストセラーになった『セキュリティはなぜやぶられたのか』、『暗号の機密とウソ』、『暗号技術大全』、そして『Practical Cryptography』がある。
44 歳 の Bruce は、ロチェスター大学で物理学の学士号、アメリカン大学でコンピュータサイエンスの修士号を取得している。彼は有力な暗号アルゴリズムである
Blowfish と Twofish を作り、議会で証言をし、また政府の複数の技術委員会で委員を務めている。彼は電子プライバシー情報センターの理事、EFF
や ACLU の顧問を務めている 。Bruce は妻である Karen Cooper と二匹の猫とミネソタで暮らしている 。
最初に読まれたウェブログは何でしょうか？
正直思い出せないのですが、自分はブログに乗り遅れた人間だと思っています。私は2004年の大統領選挙期間中に政治系のウェブログを定期的に読み始めました。その前は、何人かの友達のウェブログをごくたまにちら見するぐらいでした。
なぜご自分のウェブログを始めたのですか？
私 は1998 年から Crypto-Gram（訳注：日本語訳）という月刊の電子メールニュースレターを配信しています。Crypto-Gram
は、多くの場合ニュース記事を契機とする様々なセキュリティの話題を扱ったエッセイ、並びに私が読者に注意を向けたいと思う他のニュース記事やウェブページへのリンクから構成されていました。Crypto-Gram
はとても人気がありましたし、私も作るのを楽しんでいました。
いろんな人たちが私に Crypto - Gram をブログにするように勧めましたが、私は抵抗しました。月に一度というスケジュールがあったので、ある問題について書く前にそれをしばらく自分の中で広げることができたのです。またそのおかげで書きたいものを書きたいときに書くことができました。毎日何かを書くよう強いられたくはありませんでしたし、毎日何かしら書く十分な時間にしろ題材にしろあるなんて想像できませんでした。ですから、私は
Crypto - Gram の月一回の配信ペースを維持したのです 。
問題は、他のブログが私のエッセイになかなかリンクしてくれないことでした。というのも、私がエッセイを配信する頃までに、それはどれも古いニュースになっていたからです。そこで
Schneier on Security ウェブログを Crypto - Gram のエッセイを事前に公開する手段として開始し、他のブログがエッセイを取り上げられるようにしたわけです。つまり最初、Schneier on Security はそうした性質のものでした。しかし何ヶ月か経つうちに徐々にエントリがブログ的なものになっていきました。私がよりブログ的なエントリを書き始めたのです。ブログが普通やるようにマテリアルを引用し始めたわけですが、それは元々の
Crypto - Gram では滅多にやらない手法でした 。
そして徐々に 、Schneier on Security が Crypto - Gram のブログバージョンなのではなく 、Crypto-Gram が私のブログの月刊電子メール版になったのです。実際
Crypto - Gram はそういう書き方をしています。この一月のブログへのすべての投稿をカット＆ペーストし、再編集や再構成をし、そしてそれを一通の電子メールの形式で送信するわけです。
あなたのサイトは何を扱っていますか？
Schneier on Security は……そうですね、セキュリティを扱っています。主に技術的なセキュリティ、そして経済や政治や心理学とセキュリティとの関わりについて書いています。私がこの分野で仕事を始めたコンピュータセキュリティや暗号法の話題が多いですが、テロリズムや犯罪などといった現実世界のセキュリティも取り上げています。投票機械、国民
ID カード、空港での乗客のプロファイリング、データベース、身分証明の盗難や偽造、安全に関する法律、そしてセキュリティが常にトレードオフであるという概念について書いています。
更新頻度はどれくらいですか？
ウェブログを始めた頃は、ウィークデイには少なくとも一度更新しました――更新は大抵朝でした。書くものをより多く見つけるようになるにつれ、更新頻度が変わりました。今では一日に二回更新していますし、十分なネタの在庫があれば一日に三回更新するときもあります。私は通常前もって、場合によっては数日分前もって投稿スケジュールを立てます。一日二回の投稿スケジュールを予約してから週単位の休暇に行ったりします。誰も私が出かけていることに気付きすらしないわけです。
アクセス数はどの程度ですか？
答えにくい質問ですね。統計情報を見ると、一日95,000人のユニークビジターがおり、一日あたり220,000のページニューです。RSS
フィードがその中でトップで、およそ20,000です。そしてもちろん、125,000人もの人たちが
Crypto-Gram で月に一度同じマテリアルを読んでいます。ブログの読者と
Crypto - Gram の購読者は一部重複しているでしょうけど。
おお、多いですね。あなたは著述、講演、そしてブログによって政策立案者に意見が届いていると思いますか？
自分の書くものが誰に届いているか知りたいものです。私はたくさんのメールを受け取ります。ファンメールと私の書くものとは異なる見解による長文のよく考えられた意見の両方なので、私の文章を読み、それについて考えてくれる人たちがいるのは知っています。しかし、私の文章を読む人たちがどういうタイプかはあまり分かりません。多くの記者が私のブログを毎日読んでいるのは知っていますが、私のブログや
Crypto-Gram よりも新聞の論説記事のほうが、多くの政策立案者に意見が届いているのではないかと私は睨んでいます。
Technorati のブログランクでは何位ですか ？
通 常120位台です。100位近くになっているのを見たことがありますが、一度きりでした。
ウェブサイトで収入を得ていますか？
少なくとも直接にはありません。セキュリティにフォーカスしているので、ブログや
Crypto-Gram から広告で収入を得られるとは思いますが、その必要性を感じたことはまだありません。自分に職と俸給がある限り、広告を載せるのは避けたいと思っています。しかし、遅かれ早かれ屈服するかもしれませんが。
ただ私は講演、記事執筆、そしてコンサルタントをやって収入を得ています。そしてブログはそうしたものをすべてをサポートしています。
どのツールをお使いですか？ またその理由は ？
Movable Type ですが、特に理由はありません 。
あなたのウェブログが他のチャンスに結びついたことがありますか？
自分が為すことは何であれ、他のものをサポートします。ですので、何が何につながるか言うのは難しいわけです。私の仕事なのか、講演なのか、書籍なのか、エッセイなのか、そして論説記事、ブログ、そして
Crypto-Gram なのか。あらゆるものはそれ以外のあらゆるものにつながるのだと私は思います。
リンクする記事はどのように選んでいますか？
私の興味を引く記事をリンクします。それが話題にしているのが、自分が書こうとしているものだからリンクする場合もあります。自分が書こうとしているものでないからリンクする場合もあります。一番好きなのは、セキュリティやセキュリティ技術について細かいところまで配慮された一般的な観点を説明するリンクです。私はしばしば、より一般的なセキュリティに関するエッセイを書く出発点としてニュース記事を利用します。そうする場合、その文脈で利用できる他のリンクを探します。
週に一度のイカに関するエントリ――あれを見つけるのは簡単です（訳注：Friday Squid Blogging のこと） 。
訂正はどのように行いますか？
場合によります。単純な誤記なら、単に修正します。誤記を指摘するコメントの削除については気持ちが揺れます――修正を行ったら、それを指摘したコメントはもはや意味がないのではないか――が、今までのところそうしたコメントは残してきました。かなりの量の修正ないし追加がある場合、私はエントリの一番下に更新分を追加します。毎月
Crypto-Gram のためにエントリを編集する際、多くの修正、追加、そして更新を行います。
面白いリンクはどこで見つけるのでしょうか？
あらゆるところでリンクを見つけます。読者が私にメールしてくれるのが多いですね。自分が訪問するいろんなニュースサイトで見つける場合もあります。他のセキュリティ系ブログで見つける場合もあります。
何かウェブサーフィンの秘訣はありますか？
タブブラウズ。これがなくては一巻の終わりです。
一つのエントリを書くのにどれくらいの時間をかけますか？
書くのに一分かからないブログエントリもあります。リンク一つと、ことによるとコメント一言からなる短いエントリの場合です。エントリを書き、編集パスをすぐに済ませ、そして投稿スケジュールを決めます。投稿したいものにでくわすうちに、一日中それをやることもしばしばです。
長めのエッセイだと書くのに数日かかります。取り上げる話題は、ずっと考えてきたことの場合もあれば、いくつかのニュース記事が契機となることもあります。私は
Forbes に毎月 、Wired.com には隔週でコラムを担当しています――そして定期的に新聞の論説記事を執筆します――ので、そうした長めのエッセイは、ブログに投稿する前にそうした場に掲載されます。これらのエッセイには、下書き、書き直し、編集と長い時間を費やします。エッセイの下書きを他の人たちに送って読んでもらい、コメントをもらうこともしばしばです。
他のすべての出版社と、エッセイは彼らのところでまず最初に掲載し、そしてその後で私のブログにそれらを転載できるよう合意しています。なので、出版社のサイトにエッセイが掲載される数時間後にブログに投稿するようスケジュールを予約します。
わざと反応を誘発すべく書いたことはありますか？
そのやり方について何か助言はあります？
「 これは間違いなくコミュニティから反応があるな」といった考えを持ってブログエントリを書いたことは一度もありません。私のエッセイは挑発的なこともありますが、決してわざとではありません。それに私が何年もかけて学んだのは、どのエントリが多くのコメントを生み、どのエントリがそうでないかは予測できないということです。
ブログはあなたがブログ以外で書くものに（Crypto-Gram 以外にも）影響を与えていますか？
ブロギングというのは、ハイパーテキスト的に思考することです。つまり、引用とリンクです。元のマテリアルを要約しなくてもいつでもそれから引用できるわけで、ある意味いい加減なものに思えます。私がブログを始める前、Crypto-Gram
では元々、エントリの最後にリンク一覧を入れていたものです。テキストの中に直接リンクを埋め込むことができるとありがたい。Crypto-Gram
のためにブログエントリを変換する際、私はテキスト中のリンクをすべて記事の一番下に移動します。テキストベースと
HTML ベースの媒体の両方に同時に関わるのは面白いですね。
一日のうち何時間をオンラインで過ごしますか？
状況次第です。旅行中の場合、一日のうち一時間か、ことによるとそれ以下しかオンラインでないかもしれません。家にいる場合、一日中オンラインで過ごせます。日常的にネットを訪れているのは間違いありません。最近では私の仕事と社会的交流の多くがネット上で行われますし。
それは私が知る皆にあてはまります。どれくらい初期からインターネットにいましたか？
またどの時点でインターネットはあなたにとってコミュニケーション／配信ツールから変化し、社会的装置になりましたか？
私が最初に電子メールを取得したのは1987年ぐらいで、インターネットがコミュニケーション／配信ツールであるよりずっと前から社会的装置でしたよ。単純にクリティカルマスの問題です。友達がインターネットを使うようになるとすぐ、私は彼らと会話をするのにそれを使いました。そして徐々に変化が起こりました。1990年代の半ばのある時点で、自宅でパーティをやる際、紙の招待状を送るのを止め、電子メールだけを使うようになったのを覚えています。
ブログを書くのはいつですか？
可能なときはいつでもです。標準的な一日というのはありません。多くの場合旅行していたり、他にやる仕事を抱えています。ですから、できるときはいつでもブログを書くわけです。
フォローしているウェブログはいくつありますか？
およそ50です。もちろん、そのすべてを毎日見ているわけではありません。
新しいウェブログをどうやって見つけます？
新しいウェブログを見つけるには二通りあります。別のウェブログからのリンクを辿ってか、あるいは読者が私に教えてくれるかです。
ブログを読む場合、自分とは異なる意見を積極的に探しますか？
私は常にいろんな観点や意見を探すようにしています。そういうのにこそ面白いものがあるからです。私の場合、自分と意見の異なるだろうと思うものを読むことでそれを行います。
電子メールは何通受け取りますか？ それにすべて返事できますか ？
インターネットの特性の一つに、普段の社会的文脈から離れて交流を行うことがあります。もし私が会合の場にいて、話したい人と会ったなら、私は彼がどういう状態か見ます。彼が他の人たちと群れていたら、私は彼と話をするのは後にするかもしれません。彼が仕事に没頭していたら、通りがかりに挨拶するかもしれません。彼が退屈しているように見えたら、彼と会話をしようと思う可能性が上がるでしょうね。
インターネットにはこの文脈が欠けています。誰かに電子メールを送るとき、あなたはそれを虚空に送ることになります。相手は忙しいだろうか？
話したがっているだろうか？ 似たような電子メールを数十通も殺到してるだろうか？
あなたはそういうのを知ることができないのです。
私はたくさんの読者メールを受け取ります。その多くに投稿するものへの良質な提案を含みますので、全部を読むよう努めています。しかし、そのあまりにも多くに、意見、提案、推薦といった私の時間を割く要求があるんですね。どれも私と面識がないか、あるいはおそらくカンファレンスで一度か二度会ったことのある人たちからの善意から出たものなんですよ。個々に見れば、こうした電子メールはどれも筋の通った要求で、回答するのはまったく簡単です。多分どれも五分から十分しかかからないでしょう。でも、そういうのが一日数十通来るとなると……多過ぎますね。
それでも私は、忙しすぎて適切な回答ができないと言うだけであっても、全部に回答するよう努めています。
これまでに嫌がらせの電子メールやコメントを受け取ったことはありますか？
それにはどう対処していますか？
嫌がらせの電子メールは定期的に受け取ります。無視しますがね。そして嫌がらせのブログコメントを見かけた場合ですが――それが私に対する罵倒であれ、別のコメント主に対するものであれ――削除します。意見の相違は結構ですが、礼儀正しい対話を行うにはいくつか最低限の基準があります。
自分のサイトの更新が他のブログよりも満足のいくものである時期があります。あなたにとって最も満足のいく特定種類のエントリ、あるいは特定の日というのはありますか？
一行リンクのエントリよりも独立したエッセイの方が好きですね。そちらの方が書くのが面白いですし、満足度も高いです。
新たにブログを始める人に何かアドバイスはありますか？
実行あるのみ。退屈させるのではないかと恐れてはいけません。人の関心を引くのを恐れてはいけません。実行あるのみです。
書籍、映画、テレビ、そしてそれ以外のオフラインメディアについてですが――現在そうしたものに時間を取られていますか？
マスメディアはどうも得意じゃないんです。何ヶ月もテレビをつけてませんし――というか何年もテレビなしで過ごしていますし――映画にも滅多に行きません。書籍、雑誌、エッセイと読書はたくさんします。私は旅行が多いので、いろんな読み物があるのが好きです。後で読むためにインターネットから何かを印刷するのも珍しいことではありません。
ウェブログにおいて何があなたの関心を引きますか？
私がこれまで知らなかった優れた情報。
あなたのウェブログは人生を変えましたか？
私をコンピュータに縛り付けるものがまた増えただけです。
趣味は何ですか ？
食べ物です。料理する方も食べる方も。妻と私は
Minneapolis Star - Tribune やその他の出版物にレストランの批評を書いています。
あなたについて最も物語るものは何ですか？
このような質問に答えないという事実です。
使っているのは Mac ですか？ それとも PC ですか ？
PC 。Windows です。これについては読者からこっぴどく叱られるのですが、PC の方が私には使いやすいのです。政治的な声明のことだけを考えれば、ぜひとも
Linux ユーザでありたいところです。しかし、私は自分の技術サポートはしませんし、学びたくありませんので、会社で使うものを使っているのです。
ご自分のサイトは読まれますか？
あらゆる種類の人たちが私のサイトを読みます。暗号やコンピュータセキュリティのおたくたち、国家安全に関心のある人たちなどです。私は一般のオーディエンスに向けて書いていますし、それこそ私が読もうと思うものです。

Editor 's note :
In our Behind the Scenes series , CNN correspondents share their experiences covering news and analyze the stories behind the events .
DELRAY BEACH , Florida ( CNN ) --
The face of a partially mummified baby boy , wrapped in newspaper since 1957 , is haunting -- chilling even .
Imagine the shock when a suitcase was opened two weeks ago in a storage locker by a woman in Florida , and there it was , a mummified corpse with his umbilical cord still attached .
Investigators showed me photos of the remains .
The boy is curled in a fetal position , with light - colored curly hair covering his head .
The remains measure just under a foot and weigh only 13 ounces .
" You can see the actual facial features .
You can see the eyes .
The slit for the mouth ... and also portions of the fingers and toes , " said lead Detective Gene Sapino of the Delray Beach Homicide Division .
" At first , I was n't convinced it was a child -- until I saw the face .
...
It 's obviously emotional because that 's a child . "
I was also shown the contents found with the child , which was stuffed in a decal - covered suitcase , crammed into an even larger piece of luggage .
Inside that suitcase , there was an intriguing black - and - white photograph of a little girl probably not yet 10 years old .
Near the photo , there was a small striped box , and inside , a silver , thimble - sized container holding a tiny rosary .
There were two religious cards .
( Gallery : See what was found with the child )
A musty smell filled the air as we went through the contents .
It was eerie to think that the remains had been stored inside luggage for at least 50 years .
As I looked at the photographs of the child , it was amazing to think that the remains were so well preserved .
You could still make out his features , all the way down to his fingers and toes .
The most touching thing to me was seeing his light curly hair .
What did the mummified child look like ?
I can best compare it to the famous photographs of King Tut .
When you see something like this , you can't help but speculate about what happened .
I also tried to picture what it was like at the moment that this woman , going through her parents ' storage area , discovered his remains -- as she peeled back layers of newspaper from 1957 .
Clearly , this was the last thing she expected to see , and it was no wonder to me that police described her as an emotional wreck .
One police officer said the discovery even hit investigators hard , especially for those who have children .
' Child was cared for '
Investigators are now trying to sort through the mystery .
A forensic examiner said an initial investigation revealed no obvious signs of trauma .
" I think the child was cared for , " said Sapino .
" If this was something where it was an unwanted child , why would n't they just dispose of it ? "
The horrifying discovery was made in late - January .
The New Jersey woman had flown to Florida to clean out her parents ' rented storage area .
She did n't know it existed until the manager told her the rent was past due .
She found a suitcase resting on top of a recliner , according to police .
She then opened it and discovered the smaller suitcase covered with decals from Palisades Park in New Jersey , the Gettysburg Museum , Fort Jackson U.S. Army base in South Carolina and North Carolina 's beaches .
The child was wrapped tightly in paper from the New York Daily News , dated January 9 , 1957 .
It was then wrapped , paper and all , with a pair of black nylon pants , police said .
Experts : Newspaper helped preserve child
Experts say the newspaper absorbed moisture from the infant 's remains and prevented mold from speeding decomposition .
" It 's a natural dehydration process of the tissue that leads to mummification , " said University of Florida forensic anthropologist Anthony Falsetti .
A sample from the baby 's humerus arm bone has been sent to the University of Texas .
Scientists there will compare it to DNA samples from the woman who found the remains , her brother and the deceased woman 's sister to see whether they 're related to the infant on the mother 's side .
Falsetti continues to examine the remains .
He hopes to figure out the fetus ' age and cause of death .
" It tells you something about the mindset of the person who kept these remains all these years .
If it turns out to be one of the parents of this child , then it seems most likely this was an accidental or even a natural occurrence , " he said .
" And for whatever reason , they could not part with the individual . "
MARS FOREST LIFE
BIO - DIVERSITY-6
Report # 115
February 19 , 2007
Before we embark into the much less familiar looking and stranger looking Mars forest life bio - diversity evidence such as in the last report and to come in future reports , this report will deal with life evidence that may be unfamiliar to the Earth human eye and yet at the same time in a form that can still be readily and conclusively recognized at least as biological life of some kind .
In that way it is very strong evidence .
At the very least I suspect that most of you will be able to conclusively determine that it most definitely cannot be confused with any kind of geology , as some would have us believe , and take it from there .
This evidence in the overall scheme of things is as strong and definitive as this kind of poor quality visual imaging as released to us can get as to life in general on Mars .
I 've been holding some the stronger quality evidence like this back a bit to give people and in particular the secrecy crowd time to adjust and reconsider prior beliefs .
However , I 'm including it here and now to demonstrate to both viewers and the powers that be as a minor warning shot across the bow that this planetary truth business is very real and that time is running out for those who wish to procrastinate and remain wrapped in a cocoon of delusion .
The bottom line is that one needs to understand that we are entering a new age of change that is not going to ultimately leave much room for such choices .
So it 's better to begin to get used to the idea in the here and now while there is still time for some choice as evidence like this begins to make its presence felt in our world societal matrix .
With that said let 's get on with this report 's evidence .
The first image above is taken from near the bottom of the long official S06-00607 third listed .GIF science data strip and encompasses one side of the strip to the other which , according to the official statistics , is 2.95 km or 1.83 miles .
Be aware that subsequent evidence images here will be working upward from this point and very near each other to the point of overlapping .
This above first image is included here just to demonstrate to you how difficult it can be to identify life evidence in this very poor quality black and white satellite imaging as it has been released to us .
The darker color evidence is too dark and the lighter color evidence is too light making the contrast between the two too strong canceling out a lot of detail .
This official view demonstrates that , if it was n't for the many branching tendrils extending out from the darker evidence on the left into the lighter color terrain adjacent to it , there would n't be much of a clue here that some of this evidence might be life and warrant closer examination .
I suspect you can imagine that many scientists after trusting and naive scientists have looked at this very same image and passed on by it without remark .
Why ?
Because it does n't fit in any readily recognizable way with their well established paradigm expectations of how geology is suppose to look and is therefore ignored as inexplicable and dismissed as simply anomalous because they presume ahead of time that life is not going to be a factor worthy of serious consideration in this data unless it is so obvious that it just leaps out of the image right in their face and in reinforcing multiples .
Well all I can say is good luck on that !
It 's just never going to happen in this heavily obfuscated imaging .
If you want truth in this imaging , you 're really going to have to dig for it including thinking outside the box .
Actually this kind of predisposition is understandable when you have a trusting and to my mind naive academia personality that assumes that this imaging is not obfuscated , everything in it is true , and the resolution is as good as it can be .
In fact , even when you have a less trusting more suspicious investigator type personality used to seeing some of the underbelly of life , there still is n't much here to go on that might be conclusive .
In fact , there is no telling how many such images with good solid life information hidden in them that I have also passed over myself .
However , at least , I did n't miss this one .
The above second image is basically of the same scene as in the first image but now the view has been rotated 68 º clockwise to the right to provide a more correct upright view of the evidence .
Of course it has also received some lightening and clarification work in it by me .
This has caused the light color background to be over saturated with white eliminating smaller detail there but at the same time bringing the darkest color evidence detail into a little better view .
Note that in each upper left and lower right corner you can see the edge of the strip .
So this view is from one side of the strip to the other .
As you can see , absolutely none of the darker obviously elevated form evidence has any resemblance to rock or soil geology .
So this evidence clearly cannot be explained by geology and yet it is evidence and something that just simply can't be ignored .
What you are looking at is one form of slightly lighter color Mars forest life in the foreground that looks suspiciously like densely packed very upright more cold hardy fir / pine forest tree growth but likely is n't exactly that .
In the background is a densely packed forest of stranger looking larger broader sprawling growth with many slender branches or tendrils .
This latter evidence is actually a darker color than the foreground forest and I had to lighten the foreground forest evidence too much to bring out the detail of the background forest in this poor imaging .
I must warn you that the lightening of the evidence imaging here has eliminated too much lighter color background detail and that has done away with a important characteristic of the larger type forest detail .
Not only does each of the larger size forest clumps demonstrate many tendrils extending out in the air , they also extend branching out in the ground level material well out from the the base area of each living object clumps erupting the ground level material there .
This factor is what drew my initial attention to this particular larger size evidence in the image strip official view .
So what ever life form this larger size background forest is , it is very likely different than anything that we here on Earth are familiar with , that is unless it 's just that I am personally unfamiliar with it .
The above third image scene is shifted just to the right of and slightly up the strip from the view in the second image and immediately adjacent to it .
The evidence here in this image is primarily of the lighter color foreground type forest evidence in the second image and provides a 150 % closer view of this type of evidence .
That is all the zoom factor that the official image will allow before the evidence detail starts deteriorating too much .
This large patch 's tighter view filling most of this image dimensions has allowed me to darken the evidence just a bit to a more natural state than was the case in the second image .
Even with this slightly better view , it is hard to determine just what this very tall and upright life form evidence is ?
Is it plants like trees or is it a very upright colony form of life ?
If this scene was on Earth with such poor quality fuzzy imaging , we would no doubt quickly assume that we 're looking at a poorly seen forest of trees , and likely cold hardy fir / pine trees at that , but this is Mars where I have learned that a great variety of many different types of colony life forms have adapted and flourish there and so care must be exercised with such assumptions based on poorly seen visual evidence .
There is one extra thing I will bring your attention to though .
Note how well and sharply defined the boundary edge line of this forest is where it meets the light color over saturated terrain just out from and away from the base of the tall upright forms .
Is something else independent and smaller growing around the base of the upright forms too small and fine to see any detail of here at this poor resolution ?
Or , is this evidence a natural function of the upright form 's growth and spread at their base area ?
Who knows but I suspect it may likely be more the latter than the former .
If so , we may be looking at a forest of an upright stage of colony life here that the resolution just will not allow us to be conclusive about .
The above fourth image moves the view just a little further to the right and up the strip adjacent to that in the third image .
As you can see , once again we have the combination of the smaller foreground type forest evidence and the larger sprawling branching tendril background forest evidence type .
Here the foreground evidence is less mature , smaller and more scraggly but now we have a much more telling view of the darker larger more sprawling branching tendril background evidence .
Obviously this evidence is very strong as to representing life and yes larger size is better when it comes to viewing this evidence adequately in this poor resolution imaging .
So do you see anything in the darker color evidence down there that looks even remotely like rock and soil geology ?
Suggest you get your eyes up close to the screen and take a close look at the larger background forest detail .
Once one clarifies this evidence providing some at least fairly decent detail of it despite the dark black and white obfuscation and puts the view into better more upright perspective , this very strong evidence literally leaps out at you as LIFE even if new and a bit strange looking .
Even with the most stubborn in denial scientist and academic , it is hard to imagine there being the slightest chance of rationally confusing such evidence with geology .
We may not know exactly what kind of life it is but , one thing is very clear , it most definitely is LIFE and on another world that is officially suppose to be devoid of it .
This is what planetary exploration discovery is all about .
Why would simple biological life evidence like this need to be a secret ?
What on earth could be so threatening about simple plants or trees or colony life ?
Nothing if you think like the average person but plenty if you think like the secrecy crowd .
Remember that , although we might not be familiar with its visual looks , this more easily recognized evidence is almost certainly life similar to what we do know and accordingly clearly recognizable as such .
Can you really bring yourself to believe otherwise ?
A forest with a density like this clearly doing well and flourishing rather than struggling to survive clearly implies sufficient ground water presence as well as air quality considerably different than that officially promoted and super freezing conditions being very unlikely .
If so , then the clear implications is that this planet can in fact support life as we know and it appears plenty of it is already present there too .
Once viewers awareness unlocks and increases to this point and once viewers start breaking through the both artificially and self induced psychological obfuscation concept barriers to such basic perceptions , the secrecy agenda knows that it is then only a small next step to consider intelligent life and then even very advanced life with all its implications .
In other words , in a click , click , click domino effect , the very fabric of deception and the information exclusivity that the secrecy protects begins to be threatened as a populace moves increasingly toward no longer being ignorant and under manipulated control .
Hello !!
The above fifth image scene location is again just a little further to the right and up the strip over lapping from the fourth image scene .
It demonstrates primarily now the sprawling branching tendril evidence but here getting smaller and more scraggly looking .
The reason is because this is in fact on the edge of this forest as it peters out into a large expanse of more open empty looking terrain material just above this point in the strip .
Even though more scraggly looking , this less mature evidence is still very strong from a visual point of view because it is not as dense , massive , light absorbing , and thereby obscuring dark in color as the larger size evidence below this point presented in the previous images .
Because of this , it allows a different and to some extent better view of the many individual branching tendrils or branches or what ever they are eventually determined to be .
Even better , it does n't require experts to tell one what one is looking at unless you really really do n't trust your own common sense judgment capabilities .
As far as I 'm concerned , accumulative evidence like this , especially in the strongest fourth and fifth images , is as indisputable conclusive proof positive of biological living life on Mars as its going to get and , after examining this , anyone who can believe otherwise is in my humble opinion living in denial and I might add on borrowed time .
If your own common sense can't allow you to adequately interpret evidence as obvious as this as at least not being geology , then nothing can help you and I wish you well .
This evidence is obviously major but it is only a drop in a bucket filled with such challenging gauntlets ready to be thrown down .
As unique telling evidence like this stacks and adds up here in this reporting , it is going to become increasingly difficult and eventually simply impossible for enough of Earth humanity and / or the secrecy agenda to hang on to the inaccurate illusion and deception of the past decades and generations that Mars is a frozen primarily carbon dioxide gas atmosphere enveloped dead world incapable of supporting carbon based life as we know it .
We 're entering the days now when this kind of illusion is all coming apart like rotting mush and coming to an end .
Further , and suggest you listen closely , the process is now accelerating whether some of us want it or not .
If it is all beginning to get to be a little too real now , that can't be helped as growing up and adjusting into a new challenging environments has never been easy .
We are all now entering a new age , one not only of technology advancing exponentially relentlessly driving this advance at its base , but one that will also require some different adaptive life psychologies from all of us to some newly aware of planetary environmental realities sooner rather than later .
You can count on it .
The above sixth image from the companion S06-00608 wide - angle context reference strip demonstrates where the evidence in this report is located in a more regional context view as indicated by the white outline of the S06- 00607 narrow - angle strip located within it .
Note above the area where the darker forest evidence is located on a dark slanting finger sticking out in the light reflective terrain material as pointed out by the double arrows .
Within that small dark finger of terrain , note the subtly different slightly lighter and darker color tones .
The lighter color logically represents the foreground upright forest evidence while the darker color represents the larger size sprawling branching tendril forest evidence .
It is rational and logical to presume that most of the dark color light absorbing areas in the above S06-00608 wide - angle regional image to our right of the S06- 00607 narrow - angle image white outline consists primarily of these two slightly lighter and darker forest life form types and perhaps more .
You should be aware that the S06-00608 wide - angle regional image is supposed to be some 119 km or 74 miles across as measured horizontally according to the S06-00608 official statistics .
That gives you an idea that forest evidence like this is not some small patch confined to the boundaries of the S06- 00607 narrow - angle strip but a very dense successful forest many miles across and very extensive .
It is also logical to presume that most of that dark color light absorbing terrain to the left of the S06- 00607 narrow - angle strip outline and across the light color terrain is likely also dense forest life of some kind as well .
I mention these larger scale factors for your consideration because here on Earth such massive numbers of carbon based forest plant life equate directly to huge carbon dioxide absorbing and oxygen producing engines that impact the entire planet 's atmosphere in a major way .
Of course , although the secrecy agenda may know better than we do via the much higher detailed imaging no doubt hijacked away from us into their secrecy , we out here in the public can not know conclusively exactly what kind of life this is based on in this poor imaging as released to us or whether it produces oxygen as plant life does here on Earth .
It is reasonable to assume so but too much can't be made of that at this early point because of all of the many different types of colony life and their unique evolution and presence that I at least know also exists on Mars that could be , although I doubt it , uniquely different .
Still , it is reasonable to at least strongly suspect that such extensive Mars forest life evidence has a profound oxygen impact on the planetary atmosphere of Mars making the atmosphere favorable and sustainable not only for the colony life but the massive conventional tree forest evidence that I 've also presented in previous reports .
That has all kinds of implications for Mars true atmospheric conditions .
Further , the mere existence of forests on such successful massive scales and in the South Polar Region right where the planetary temperatures are suppose to be so incredibly freezing cold and right where the old " unquestionable " instrument temperature data was obtained from is very telling as to the correctness of the official position and that data .
In any case , here is my contribution of some very powerful evidence of biological life 's presence on Mars .
Now I 'm not looking for someone to take this evidence as a bomb and run with it , rather my thought is that it may have to serve as reinforcing my reporting credentials for some .
As the more skeptical viewers begin seeing stranger more unfamiliar looking biological life evidence here at this website in the reports to come , rather than quickly dismiss them , they may want to remember this report 's quality evidence and that just maybe this investigator just might actually be onto something here .
We 'll see .

China Is Again Banning Feed Reader Apps ★ iOS feed readers Fiery Feeds and Reeder today tweeted that Apple notified them they were being removed from the Chinese App Store to comply with Chinese law .
Both link to a 2017 tweet from Inoreader saying the same .
( An earlier version of this post did n’t make clear that Inoreader ’s tweet was three years old . )
It ’s completely unclear what explains the three year gap here , and the entire policy makes no sense .
Why ban feed readers but not web browsers ?
At a technical level , feed readers are just web browsers for RSS feeds .
China ’s Great Firewall should block feeds ( and centralized feed aggregating sources ) just as easily as it blocks websites .
I suppose there ’s not much point looking for sense in this decision — China is going to China .
Amazon One : New Hand - Scanning Payment System Set to Debut in Amazon ’s Own Stores ★ Jason Del Rey , reporting for Recode : Amazon on Tuesday is unveiling a new biometric technology called Amazon
One that allows shoppers to pay at stores by placing their palm over a scanning device when they walk in the door or when they check out .
The first time they register to use this tech , a customer will scan their palm and insert their payment card at a terminal ; after that , they can simply pay with their hand .
The hand - scanning tech is n’t just for Amazon ’s own stores — the company hopes to sell it to other retailers , including competitors , too .
I ’m happy to hear more details , but on the surface this sounds insane .
Why in the world would anyone voluntarily send their palm print to any company to store in the cloud ?
With something like Face ID and Touch ID , your biometric info is not only stored solely on your own device , it ’s stored on the secure enclave on your own device .
Even the apps running on your own device can’t access it .
And with Apple Pay , if you ever need or simply want to create a new card number , you can do so .
( Settings → Wallet & Apple Pay → Name of Card → Card Information → Request New Card Number . )
You ca n’t request a new palm print .
This is a terrible idea and the only reason I can think of why Amazon created it is that they wanted their own payment system and felt they had to use some kind of biometrics for identification , privacy implications be damned , because they do n’t have any sort of mobile device platform they could use instead .
Why they do n’t just stick to offering a scannable code from their app is beyond me .
Coalition for App Fairness ★ Spearheaded by Epic Games , Spotify , and Tinder parent Match Group , the Coalition for App Fairness is an advocacy group pushing for legal and regulatory changes to “ app stores ” — but quite specifically Apple ’s in particular .
Some of their aims are unobjectionable , but the main ones would effectively do away with the App Store as we know it : 1 . No developer should be required to use an app store exclusively , or to use ancillary services of the app store owner , including payment systems , or to accept other supplementary obligations in order to have access to the app store .
9 . No app store owner should prohibit third parties from offering competing app stores on the app store owner ’s platform , or discourage developers or consumers from using them .
Basically they ’re demanding that platforms like iOS and Android be run like PC platforms like MacOS and Windows .
But as I ’ve been emphasizing all summer long , such a view would require game consoles to surrender the same control .
iOS is an app console — a platform where the platform maker controls all software for the platform .
3 . Every developer should have timely access to the same interoperability interfaces and technical information as the app store owner makes available to its own developers .
Good luck with that one .
4 . Every developer should always have access to app stores as long as its app meets fair , objective and nondiscriminatory standards for security , privacy , quality , content , and digital safety .
Who gets to make these determinations if not the platform owner ?
To name just one high profile developer and just one of those categories , Facebook has very different standards for privacy than Apple .
What the Coalition for App Fairness is arguing is that Apple should n’t get to decide the standards for privacy ( or security , quality , content , and whatever “ digital safety ” is ) for its own platform — some other unnamed arbiter ( perhaps the Coalition for App Fairness itself ) would make such determinations .
Apple Marina Bay Sands ★ Apple Newsroom , three weeks ago : Apple today previewed Apple Marina Bay Sands , the first Apple Store to sit directly on the water .
Appearing as a sphere floating on the iridescent Marina Bay , the store introduces a new and captivating retail experience at one of the most iconic locations in Singapore .
Entirely surrounded by water , Apple Marina Bay Sands offers uninterrupted 360 - degree panoramic views of the city and its spectacular skyline .
The sphere is a first - of - its - kind , all - glass dome structure that is fully self - supported , comprised of 114 pieces of glass with only 10 narrow vertical mullions for structural connection .
As Apple ’s third retail location in Singapore , the new store creates an unforgettable space for customers .
Whenever complaints about Apple pop up — like , say , this weekend ’s story about a ripoff app topping the charts in the App Store — some number of people will respond along the lines of , “ Well , what do you expect from a company run by a penny - pinching beancounter like Tim Cook ? ” I.e. that Apple , under Cook ’s leadership , has gotten cheap , and the reason for Problem X is that Apple refuses to spend money to fix it .
This is nonsense .
Apple is not cheap .
A miserly penny - wise / pound - foolish company does not design and build architectural marvels like this new store in Singapore .
Apple spends lavishly on what they care about and consider important .
Google ‘ Clarifies ’ Play Store Policies , Ending Spotify , Netflix , and Apple Music ’s Use of Their Own In - App Billing Systems ★ Sameer Samat , vice president of product management at Google , on Google ’s Android Developer Blog :
We want to be sure our policies are clear and up to date so they can be applied consistently and fairly to all developers , and so we have clarified the language in our Payments Policy to be more explicit that all developers selling digital goods in their apps are required to use Google Play ’s billing system .
Again , this is n’t new .
This has always been the intention of this long standing policy and this clarification will not affect the vast majority of developers with apps on Google Play .
Less than 3 % of developers with apps on Play sold digital goods over the last 12 months , and of this 3 % , the vast majority ( nearly 97 % ) already use Google Play ’s billing .
But for those who already have an app on Google Play that requires technical work to integrate our billing system , we do not want to unduly disrupt their roadmaps and are giving a year ( until September 30 , 2021 ) to complete any needed updates .
And of course we will require Google ’s apps that do not already use Google Play ’s billing system to make the necessary updates as well .
This whole blog post is rather opaque .
Basically they ’re saying two things .
First , big whales like Spotify and Netflix that have been using their own credit card processing in their Android apps need to switch to Google ’s system for the apps they distribute via the Play Store by next year .
Most reports are mentioning Spotify and Netflix here , but unless I ’m missing something this policy change ( or as Google claim , “ clarification ” ) will also apply to Apple Music — the Android version of which charges users who sign up in the app directly , not via Google Play .
The fact that Apple forces all subscription streaming services to use Apple ’s in - app payments on iOS but does n’t use Google ’s on Android for Apple Music has been a source of much heckling .
Second , in a masterful jujitsu move turning Epic ’s own language about “ fairness ” to its own advantage , Google is making a vague promise about making it easier to use third - party app stores on Android :
In response to that feedback , we will be making changes in Android 12 ( next year ’s Android release ) to make it even easier for people to use other app stores on their devices while being careful not to compromise the safety measures Android has in place .
We are designing all this now and look forward to sharing more in the future !
There are no additional details , just that .
But they ’re presenting it as the main thrust of today ’s announcement , not the move to require Spotify / Netflix / et al to use Google ’s payment system for apps in the Play Store .

The New York Times Has 20 Years of Trump ’s Tax Returns ★ Russ Buettner , Susanne Craig , and Mike McIntire , reporting for The New York Times : Donald J. Trump paid $ 750 in federal income taxes the year he won the presidency .
In his first year in the White House , he paid another $ 750 .
He had paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years — largely because he reported losing much more money than he made .
We got him this time for sure .

‎ Widgetsmith and The Case of the Missing App Store Bunco Squad Widgets and custom app icons via Shortcuts are the breakout hit features of iOS 14 .
This should be not surprising : people love to customize their stuff , and until now you could n’t really customize much more than your wallpaper and icon arrangement on the iOS home screen .
Now you can , and people are digging it .
For youngsters who ’ve grown up only knowing iOS , this is their first taste of this sort of thing .
“ Underscore ” David Smith ’s new app Widgetsmith is , thus , having a bit of a moment .
Widgetsmith is like a widget construction kit :
It starts with a wide collection of highly customizable widgets , which range in function from date , to weather , to astronomy .
Each can be adjusted precisely to best fit your desired function and appearance .
This set of widgets can then be dynamically scheduled to appear on your home screen following rules you define .
For example , a particular widget could show the weather first thing in the morning , then your calendar during your work day , then switch to your Activity ring progress as you wrap up your day .
This lets you take full advantage of each slot on your home screen .
It ’s rocketed to the # 1 spot on the App Store ’s Productivity list .
My teenage son , out of the blue , asked me if I ’d heard about it — not iOS 14 widgets in general , but Widgetsmith specifically .
1
A well - deserved hit product .
If you ’re having fun playing around with widgets , you should definitely check out Widgetsmith if your neighborhood teenager has n’t already turned you onto it .
And but so of course the ripoff scammers are already doing their thing , and the App Store is welcoming them .
Search for “ Widgetsmith ” — the exact name of Smith ’s app — and the first app in the results is not Widgetsmith but a name - alike ripoff called , I swear , “ Widgetsmith - Color Widgets ” .
This utterly shameless ripoff , replete with a ham - fisted knockoff of the icon to boot , is listed above the actual Widgetsmith , despite the fact that the actual Widgetsmith is currently the # 1 app in Productivity and has over 53,000 overwhelmingly positive reviews .
The ripoff app has 25 5 - star ratings , one 1 - star rating , and one written review , which reads , verbatim , “ Thank developer for making such great app especially for iOS 14 ! ”
The entire description of the ripoff app is written in similar broken English .
[ Update 6 PM : Two hours later , and the rip - off Widgetsmith is gone . ]
Three points .
First , how in the world did this app get approved with this name and with this icon ?
And how is it still there ?
The ripoff version is now popular enough to be ranked # 7 on the Entertainment list .
Where ’s the App Store bunco squad ?
This would n’t even be a hard case to crack .
It would n’t be more obvious that this app is a ripoff if its name were “ Widgetsmith - Ripoff Version ” .
Apple keeps telling us how great the App Store is , but ripoffs like this remain commonplace .
Apple right now has a promotion touting the benefits of the App Store on the front page of apple.com ( gee , I wonder what prompted that ? ) , which states :
The apps you love .
From a place you can trust .
For over a decade , the App Store has proved to be a safe and trusted place to discover and download apps .
But the App Store is more than just a storefront — it ’s an innovative destination focused on bringing you amazing experiences .
And a big part of those experiences is ensuring that the apps we offer are held to the highest standards for privacy , security , and content .
Because we offer nearly two million apps — and we want you to feel good about using every single one of them .
I doubt anyone feels good about “ Widgetsmith - Ripoff Version ” , including the hucksters who made it .
And if only the App Store were run just as a storefront , this would n’t happen .
I ’m pretty sure that if you go to Apple ’s online store and search for “ Solo Loop ” , or walk into one of their retail stores and ask for one , you ’re not going to be presented with a fly - by - night piece - of - crap knockoff named “ Solo Loop - Color Bands ” , with Apple ’s actual Solo Loops hidden behind them .
The App Store is not trustworthy if that includes trusting that the apps in its trending lists and search results are legitimate .
If Apple ran a food court like they run the App Store they ’d let a McDowell ’s open up two stores down from McDonald’s .
Second , even accepting that this app was allowed into the store with this name and this icon , how in the world does it rank ahead of the actual Widgetsmith in search results ?
How can App Store search be this wrong ?
It ’d be bad enough if “ Widgetsmith - Ripoff Version ” were listed after the actual Widgetsmith , but listed ahead of it ?
( And to be clear , the placement of “ Widgetsmith - Ripoff Version ” atop the results is not from paid search placement — those are a problem too , but they are marked as ads .
This is not an ad . )
Third , go check out the actual Widgetsmith , trust me . ★
Chatology Bites the Dust With Big Sur ★ Speaking of Flexibits , some sad news :
After more than 7 years , Chatology is being discontinued due to major changes with Messages in the upcoming release of macOS Big Sur .
Chatology is no longer available for purchase but should continue to work on macOS Catalina and earlier .
The “ major changes ” are the rewrite of Apple ’s Messages app in Catalyst .
From the Mac ’s perspective , it really is an all - new version of Messages .
Messages has been through a lot of changes over the years — longtime Mac users will recall that it started life as iChat all the way back in August 2002 * — a most excellent client for AIM and other instant messaging platforms .
One thing iChat was never good at , though , was search , and that ’s the gap Chatology filled — and in fact continues to fill for anyone not yet using Big Sur .
Search still is n’t great in Messages , but it ’s a lot better than it used to be , and for me at least works pretty reliably with Messages in the Cloud .
My big problem with search in Messages is n’t about finding a needle in the haystack that is one ’s Messages history , it ’s about the UI of the search results when it finds a lot of needles and I ’m looking for one in particular .
As a dedicated search tool , Chatology excelled at that sort of winnowing of results — of search within search , if you will .
Messages ’s built - in search does n’t even try to be good at it . * A good month for debuts .
Fantastical ’s iOS 14 Widgets ★ Speaking of MacStories , here ’s Ryan Christoffel on the latest update to Fantastical :
As you can see , there ’s an option here for everyone .
Additionally , all widgets can be configured to show the exact data you want , in many cases taking advantage of Fantastical 3 ’s calendar set feature , by which the app lets you group together sets of calendars and / or task management accounts .
Widgets containing events or tasks can be tied to your preferred calendar set , and you can optionally have them show or hide events , tasks , and the weather .
Widgets containing a month view can have a heat map activated to show at a glance which days on the calendar are busier or more free ; this heat map is additionally tied to a specific calendar set .
Finally , even the simple Icon and Date widgets can be configured to show or hide the month and today ’s weather .
It ’s a lot of style , size , and content options , but when you go configure them , it ’s all very sensible .
Fantastical ’s debut widget support feels like a nice set of calendaring - oriented Lego bricks .
At their best , iOS 14 widgets are at the intersection of usefulness and tinkering fun .
The widgets for Apple ’s own built - in apps are like pre-built toys , but the good third - party widgets let you customize your own out of sensible pre-built pieces , and Fantastical ’s exemplify that mindset .

Latest AirPods Pro Firmware Includes Support for Spatial Audio ★ John Voorhees , writing last week for MacStories : AirPods
Pro firmware version 3A283 is currently rolling out to users with two new features : spatial audio and automatic device switching . [… ]
I tested the feature with my iPhone 11 Pro Max and 12.9 - inch iPad Pro , and it worked with both , even though Apple only mentions iPhone models on its iOS 14 preview page .
In my tests , I played the latest episode of Ted Lasso , a TV + show that supports multi-channel audio .
I also tried HBO ’s Game of Thrones .
It ’s going to require more testing , but the feature seems to support any multi-channel audio source , regardless of the video streaming provider .
As Ted Lasso played , I turned in my chair and got up , and walked around my office .
With spatial audio turned on , which you can do by long - pressing the volume slider in Control Center in the iOS or iPadOS 14 betas , the source of the sound seemed to come directly from my iPad that was sitting on my desk .
Next , I switched to watching on my iPhone and moved it as I walked around my office .
The entire time the sound seemed to be coming directly from the iPhone .
Very cool , very fun , and in my testing — also against an episode of Ted Lasso , which , if you have n’t watched it yet , is one of the best new TV shows in years — it feels very natural , not gimmicky or distracting .
The spatiality just feels right .
Also , is it just the placebo effect , or did Apple greatly improve Transparency mode in this latest firmware ?
I typically wear my AirPods Pro while I ’m out walking around town , and I prefer Transparency mode to Noise Cancellation while I ’m perambulating so I can hear what ’s going on around me .
It could be my imagination , but it seems to me that with this latest firmware Transparency mode is magically better — a lot less white noise from wind .
There used to be a baseline background whooshiness that is now just gone .
When I pause my podcast or music , it ’s like I do n’t even have earbuds in at all .
I just … hear .
If anyone knows whether this is actually new and improved , let me know .
Rogue Ads From Google Prompt
You to Download a Spurious Text File ★ Ben Lovejoy , writing for 9to5 Mac :
An increasing number of people are finding a wide range of websites — including ours — are asking permission to allow downloads to your Mac from googlesyndication.com …
The problem is a rogue ad that has made it through to the Google ad network , which is used by a great many websites .
If you do allow the download , it ’s just a harmless text file , but it ’s annoying to have to keep hitting Cancel to block it .
This should not just never happen , it should not be possible to happen .
If your ad network can foist a “ harmless text file ” download , it can foist any sort of file download .
More Adventures in Solo Loop Sizing Impeccable timing on my part last night :
This makes me suspect that many are using Apple ’s measuring tool inaccurately , or printing it out at the wrong scale , or both , and perhaps Apple should clarify the printed instructions .
The current instructions simply read :
Cut and wrap the tool around your wrist , snug but not too tight .
What those instructions do n’t make clear , but perhaps should , is that I think you ’re supposed to use the tool to precisely measure the circumference of your wrist , not to simulate the circumference of what you think would be a comfortable watch band .
Think about how a tailor measures your chest or waist — you ’re not cinching a tourniquet , but you do n’t want any slack at all .
Apple today updated its Solo Loop PDF sizing tool .
The sizes remain exactly the same , but the instructions have been clarified , much as I suggested , and are now accompanied by a helpful illustration .
They now read :
Cut the tool .
Then wrap it tightly around your wrist where you typically wear your watch .
You can use tape to hold the wider part in place .
Make sure the tool feels snug and does n’t slide up or down .
No more ambiguous “ snug but not too tight ” .
Now they ’ve made clear that it should wrap tight enough not to slide around .
Apple also clarified what to do if your wrist seems to fall between sizes :
Note the number the arrows point to — that ’s your band size .
If the arrows point to a line , choose the smaller of the two numbers closest to the line .
A few people have wondered why Apple does n’t just map fluoroelastomer Sport Band sizes to Solo Loop sizes .
I can see why Apple does n’t do that — they ca n’t assume everyone already has access to an Apple Watch with a Sport Band , and even for people who do have access to one , Apple ca n’t assume it ’s the right size watch ( 38/40 mm vs. 42/44 mm ) .
And to further complicate matters , each Sport Band comes with two sizes for the side with the holes : “ S/ M ” and “ M/ L ” .
So that ’s four separate mappings from Sport Band holes to the new Solo Loop sizes .
That ’s complicated .
But it ’s no longer a safe assumption that everyone has access to a printer , either , so let ’s figure out the mappings here .
It turns out Sport Band holes do map exactly to the new Solo Loop sizes .
That makes sense , when you think about it , but it had n’t occurred to me until today to just lay Sport Bands next to the measuring tool .
The distance between the holes in every Apple Sport Band is exactly the same as the distance between the 12 sizes of Solo Loops on Apple ’s measuring tool .
[ Update :
My measurements for the smaller 38/40 mm Sport Bands had an off - by - one bug1 when I originally published the photo and table below .
Sorry about that .
I believe they are correct now . ]
[ Update 2 : Do n’t overthink these photos .
The top of the bands are n’t supposed to line up .
My methodology was simple .
I tried all four Sport Band combinations on my own wrist : 40 and 44 mm watches , with both the S/M and M/L bands .
Then I lined up the Sport Band hole that fit my wrist best with the Solo Loop size that I know fits me best ( size 7 ) .
That ’s it .
You line up the Sport Band hole that fits you best with the Solo Loop size that fits you best and the other hole - to - Solo - Loop - size mappings just fall into place .
The fact that the tops of the bands do n’t line up when you do this is irrelevant . ]
Here are two photographs to illustrate the mappings .
First , these black Sport Bands are for smaller Apple Watches ( 38/40 mm ) :
These gray Sport Bands are for larger Apple Watches ( 42/44 mm ) :
No matter which width and length , all Sport Bands have 7 holes .
The following table shows how those holes correspond to Apple ’s new Solo Loop sizes : 38/40 mm 42/44 mm S/M 1–7 3–9 M/L 4–10 6–12
To me , the photographs above make the mappings much more obvious than the table .
It practically demands an illustration , lest you get lost between counting Sport Band holes and counting Solo Loop sizes .
The range of wrist sizes for the Sport Bands corresponds exactly to the new Solo Loops — the first hole on the 38/40 mm S/M Sport Band is a size 1 , and the last hole on the 42/44 mm M/L Sport Band is a size 12 . ★
PRC State Newspaper China Daily : ‘ Proposed TikTok Deal Is a Dirty and Underhanded Trick ’ ★ China Daily , an English - language arm of Chinese state media :
What the United States has done to TikTok is almost the same as a gangster forcing an unreasonable and unfair business deal on a legitimate company . [ … ]
China has no reason to give the green light to such a deal , which is dirty and unfair and based on bullying and extortion .
If the US gets its way , it will continue to do the same with other foreign companies .
Giving in to the unreasonable demands of the US would mean the doom of the Chinese company ByteDance .
Effectively , it sounds like they ’re telling Trump to go pound sand .
How ‘ Naked Ballots ’ Could Become Pennsylvania ’s ‘ Hanging Chads ’ ★ Jonathan Lai , reporting for The Philadelphia Inquirer :
The state Supreme Court in Pennsylvania , a critical battleground state that ’s seen as increasingly likely to determine who wins the White House , last week ordered officials to throw out “ naked ballots ” — mail ballots that arrive without inner “ secrecy envelopes . ”
Pennsylvania uses a two - envelope mail ballot system : A completed ballot goes into a “ secrecy envelope ” that has no identifying information , and then into a larger mailing envelope that the voter signs .
It ’s unclear how many naked ballots there will be , because this is the first year any Pennsylvania voter can vote by mail , and most counties counted them in the June primary without tracking how many there were .
“ Naked ballots ” sound like fun in general , but in this case , they sound like a hold - your - breath potential nightmare in the making .
This is seen as a potential problem for Democrats because , thanks to you - know - whose drumbeat of anti-mail - voting nonsense , there ’s a huge partisan split in Pennsylvania regarding who plans to vote by mail .
I voted by mail in the primary in June , and the instructions are pretty clear about putting your ballot in the unmarked secret envelope , which in turn goes into the outer envelope that you sign and return .
But it would be a lot simpler and inherently more error proof if there were just one envelope — or if ballots were counted regardless of whether they were placed in the “ secrecy envelope ” .
It ’s really a privacy envelope for the voter , so the fact that they voted can be verified by someone who does n’t get to see who they voted for , not a measure of election integrity .
Anyway , spread the word about these “ secrecy envelopes ” to anyone you know in Pennsylvania .
Mail voting is new here , so it ’s best to make people widely aware of this rule .
The other election - related rulings from our state supreme court were good news for the franchise , though :
The decision ordering them thrown out was part of a trio of rulings Thursday that , among other things , extended the deadline for voters to send mail ballots back , permitted the use of drop boxes for voters to return them , and removed the Green Party ’s presidential ticket from the ballot .
Adventures in Solo Loop Sizing Juli Clover , reporting for MacRumors , “ New Apple Watch Owners Have to Return Entire Device for Ill - Fitting Solo Loop or Braided Solo Loop ” : Because these bands are not adjustable , Apple sells each one in nine different sizes to make sure each person gets a snug fit .
To get the right sizing , Apple offers a printable tool [ PDF ] and also measurement comparisons so you can estimate size , but as it turns out , that sizing is n’t always accurate and Apple ’s returns for ill - fitting bands ordered with one of the new Apple Watches are a hassle .
Customers who chose a Solo Loop or a Braided Solo Loop along with an Apple Watch Series 6 or SE and have a poor fit ca n’t just return the band for a new size — the entire Apple Watch has to be returned since it ’s considered a set .
Unfortunately , there are limited supplies of the new Apple Watch Series 6 models and the new bands , so customers forced to make a return are now having to wait from late October to late November for a new Apple Watch , depending on the model chosen .
This sucks , but you can see how it happened .
I think this is the first situation where Apple has been not just hindered , but outright bitten by COVID - era restrictions .
First , it ’s obvious these bands are better sized in person than using a paper ruler .
But second , exchanges are better facilitated in person too .
Starting a few years ago , when you buy a new Apple Watch , the watch + band bundle is treated as a single SKU , but the watch and band are in separate boxes inside an outer cardboard wrapper .
The band in its own box seems like something you ought to be able to exchange independently of the watch , but it is n’t sold that way .
This has worked fine to date , because none of Apple ’s bands prior to the Solo Loops are sized precisely .
All their other bands are adjustable , and to cover a wide range of wrist sizes , some come in two sizes .
Apple ’s Sport Band , for example , comes in “ S/ M ” and “ M / L ” sizes , but Apple just includes both sizes when you buy one .
There ’s a reason why no watch bands from any watch brand I ’m aware of are sized as precisely as Apple ’s new Solo Loops .
It ’s a huge logistical problem compared to adjustable watch bands , and the whole thing is premised on people knowing their correct size — which is a function both of their actual wrist size and their preference for how loose or tight they prefer bands to feel .
Based on what I see on Twitter and in various public forums , it seems like most people with ill - fitting Solo Loops are winding up with ones that are too loose , not too tight .
Justine Ezarik measured her wrist as a 5 , but Apple sent her size 3 ’s and 2’s as review units , and the 2’s fit her perfectly .
( Again , Apple PR ’s size guessers are freakishly good . )
This makes me suspect that many are using Apple ’s measuring tool inaccurately , or printing it out at the wrong scale , or both , and perhaps Apple should clarify the printed instructions .
The current instructions simply read :
Cut and wrap the tool around your wrist , snug but not too tight .
What those instructions do n’t make clear , but perhaps should , is that I think you ’re supposed to use the tool to precisely measure the circumference of your wrist , not to simulate the circumference of what you think would be a comfortable watch band .
Think about how a tailor measures your chest or waist — you ’re not cinching a tourniquet , but you do n’t want any slack at all .
Here ’s me measuring my wrist .
But I ’ve seen reports from folks who used Apple ’s tool and wound up with Solo Loops that are too tight , and I ’ve also seen reports from people who prefer the rubber Solo Loop in one size but the Braided Solo Loop in a different — usually smaller — size .
So again , like buying shoes , there ’s no substitute for trying them on in person .
Which , alas , is not an option for a lot of us at the moment . ★
Xbox X Series One X Secret X Edition ★ Jay Peters , writing for The Verge : Today , Microsoft launched pre-orders for its upcoming next generation console , the Xbox One X. Sorry , I meant the Xbox Series X . Can you blame me ?
There ’s only one word of difference between the two names , and it ’s the one in the middle .
There are also three X’s .
I might not be the only one who gets them confused , though .
( Microsoft itself has , but I digress . )
Despite today being pre-order day for the Series X ( reminder : the new one ) , the One X ( the old one ) had a banner day on Amazon as well , at one point up 747 percent on Amazon ’s “ Movers & Shakers ” sales charts .

Hey ★
My thanks to Hey for sponsoring last week at DF .
You ’ve probably heard about Hey , but here ’s how they describe it ( and capitalize it ) : Email .
It feels like a chore .
It ’s overwhelming , it ’s messy , it ’s relentless .
It ’s necessary , but hopelessly broken .
That ’s why we fixed it .
Introducing HEY .
HEY ’s fresh approach transforms email into something you want to use , not something you ’re forced to deal with .
HEY puts you back in control .
You decide who can — and ca n’t — email you .
HEY is packed with workflows , not workarounds , that help you cut back on the emails you get , and focus on the ones you want .
There ’s nothing else out there like it .
Give it a shot — it ’ll change your relationship with email for the better .
I have a lot to say about Hey , and I plan to write a lot more about it soon .
Briefly though , I ’ll just say this : when I hear that someone “ reinvented ” something like email , I roll my eyes and take it with a very large grain of salt .
But
Hey truly is like nothing else I ’ve ever seen for email .
It feels a lot more like email was back in the ’90s , when it felt fun .
I switched my public address for DF reader email to Hey when it debuted back in June , and I have n’t looked back .
It makes me want to check for new mail rather than dread it — a feeling I have n’t had about my public email since the very early days of DF .
Hey is that transformative .
‘ Dissents Speak to a Future Age ’ ★ Ruth Bader Ginsburg : Dissents speak to a future age .
It ’s not simply to say , ‘ My colleagues are wrong and I would do it this way . ’
But the greatest dissents do become court opinions and gradually over time their views become the dominant view .
Ginsburg ’s dissent in Shelby County v. Holder , a 5 - 4 decision in 2012 in which the Court ’s conservative majority invalidated key portions of the Voting Rights Act , is one for the ages .
This line is perfect :
Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet .
‘ While You ’re at It , Make It Sing ’ ★ David Post , who twice served as a law clerk for Ruth Bader Ginsburg : Most of what I know about writing I learned from her .
The rules are actually pretty simple : Every word matters .
Do n’t make the simple complicated , make the complicated as simple as it can be ( but not simpler ! ) .
You ’re not finished when you ca n’t think of anything more to add to your document ; you ’re finished when you ca n’t think of anything more that you can remove from it .
She enforced these principles with a combination of a ferocious — almost a terrifying — editorial pen , and enough judicious praise sprinkled about to let you know that she was appreciating your efforts , if not always your end - product .
And one more rule :
While you ’re at it , make it sing .
At least a little ; legal prose is not epic poetry or the stuff of operatic librettos , but a well - crafted paragraph can help carry the reader along , and is always a thing of real beauty .
She had the kind of fierce integrity that I think we all would want to see in a judge ; she was always determined to get it right , to do right by the litigants and to do right by the law .
She had her biases and her blind spots ; we all do .
But I have often said that if my life were on the line , I ’d be happy if she were on the bench , because she would be as fair - minded when weighing the evidence as one could ever ask for .
‘ Rejected as a Clerk , Chosen as a Justice ’ ★ From Neil A. Lewis ’s front - page story of Ruth Bader Ginsburg ’s nomination to the Supreme Court :
In 1960 , a dean at the Harvard Law School , Albert Sachs , proposed one of his star students to Justice Felix Frankfurter of the Supreme Court as a law clerk .
Justice Frankfurter told Professor
Sachs that while the candidate was impressive , he just was n’t ready to hire a woman and so could n’t offer a job to Ruth Bader Ginsburg .
Judge Ginsburg , who now sits on the Federal appeals court and was chosen today by President Clinton for the Supreme Court , recently told that story to her own law clerks to explain how she became interested in the role of women in the eyes of the law .
From 1973 to 1976 she argued six women ’s rights cases before the Court and won five of them , profoundly changing the law as it affects women .
“ She is the Thurgood Marshall of gender equality law , ” said Janet Benshoof , the president of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy , an abortion - rights advocacy group , repeating a common description of Judge Ginsburg .
Like Justice Marshall , who shaped the legal strategy of the civil rights movement for the NAACP Legal and Educational Defense Fund before he joined the Court , Ruth Ginsburg organized the cases , found the plaintiffs and delivered the oral arguments .
Think about that .
When Ginsburg was in law school , gender inequality was so profoundly unjust in the United States that she was n’t even considered for a clerkship on the Supreme Court , simply because she was a woman .
By the time she died , she was not merely a justice on the Court , but one of the most iconic , essential , and influential ones in history .
That was n’t because she was born at the right time and surfed an inevitable wave — she helped create the wave .
By force of her intellect , will , and keen sense of justice , she helped bend the arc of the moral universe .
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Dies at 87 ★ Nina Totenberg , for NPR : Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , the demure firebrand who in her 80s became a legal , cultural and feminist icon , died Friday .
The Supreme Court announced her death , saying the cause was complications from metastatic cancer of the pancreas .
The court , in a statement , said Ginsburg died at her home in Washington surrounded by family .
So it goes .
‘ The Reluctant Debut of the A14 Processor ’ ★ Jason Snell , writing at Six Colors :
But all of those figures compare the A14 in the iPad Air to the A12 processor in the previous model , not the A13 processor found in the iPhone 11 series .
Now , Apple would likely claim that it ’s only fair to make a comparison across devices with similar screen sizes and thermal characteristics .
But in scrupulously adhering to the comparisons to the A12 , Apple is not telling us how much faster the base A14 processor — likely the foundation of the next generation of iPad Pro models and possibly even the first round of Macs running Apple Silicon — is compared to its immediate predecessor .
I do n’t think Apple ’s doing this because it ’s not proud of the A14 .
( On the contrary , Apple seems very aware of how important this chip is , including the fact that it ’s Apple ’s first to be manufactured using Taiwan Semiconductor ’s new 5 - nanometer process . )
No , this is about leaving some space for Apple ’s forthcoming iPhone launch event to boast a bit more about the A14 .
Which makes sense .
The iPhone is Apple ’s most important product .
It deserves to be boasted about a bit .
It was really conspicuous that Apple would only offer performance comparisons to the A12 , ostensibly because that ’s the SoC in the previous generation iPad Air , and so they felt it fair to compare iPad to iPad .
But we know , from 10 years of experience , that the performance characteristics of an A - whatever in an iPad are very similar to the performance characteristics of the same A - whatever in iPhones .
The X and Z suffix chips — like the A12X and A12Z — are different , and to date , have only appeared in iPad Pros in recent years , and prior to that , only in high - end iPads before there were “ iPad Pros ” .
But the no-suffix A14 in the new iPad Air is almost certainly effectively identical to the A14 we ’ll see next month in this year ’s new iPhones .
I truly wonder if that ’s the only reason Apple is n’t shipping new iPad Airs yet — to keep A14 performance under wraps for the iPhone event .
Apple Is Already Seeding Developer Betas of iOS 14.2 ★ Juli Clover , MacRumors : Apple today seeded the first betas of upcoming iOS 14.2 and iPadOS 14.2 updates to developers , just one day after releasing the iOS 14 update and a few hours after hinting at the iOS 14.2 beta in an Xcode beta update .
So where ’s 14.1 ?
I think Michael Simmons has the simple explanation :
My guess is that iOS 14.1 was skipped for iPhone 12 next month , and they ’re already in production with 14.1 preinstalled .
We ’ll find out soon enough …
They may not be in production yet ( or at least not at the stage where they install the OS ) , but yes , I think iOS 14.1 is the version for the new iPhones coming next month , and it ’s effectively frozen at this point , so all ongoing development at Apple has already moved to 14.2 .
Trump Administration to Ban Downloads of TikTok and Block Access to WeChat on Sunday ★ Steve Kovach , reporting for CNBC : The Commerce Department announced it will ban U.S. business transactions with China - owned social apps WeChat and TikTok on Sunday .
The announcement sets up two different time frames for WeChat and TikTok , with a full ban on WeChat going into effect Sunday along with a ban on updates and maintenance to the TikTok app .
TikTok has a Nov. 12 deadline before companies are banned from providing cloud and internet services for the app , which could give Oracle more time to hammer out its offer for TikTok to satisfy President Trump .
Be careful of headlines along the lines of “ U.S. bans TikTok ” — right now it ’s just new downloads that will be banned , not use of the app if already downloaded .
Predictably , TikTok has shot to the top of the download charts .
We Chat is in a different boat — it ’s set to be fully banned .
The politics of this distinction could n’t be more clear .
Peter Kafka : WeChat : Enormously popular with Chinese - Americans .
Owned by Chinese company .
Will be crippled in US Sunday night .
TikTok : Enormously popular with Americans including some Trump voters .
Owned by Chinese company , trying to do deal w/ Trump supporters .
Will be OK through election .
Larry Ellison is a big Trump supporter , just in case you were n’t aware of how flamboyantly transparent the cronyism is with the Oracle - TikTok deal .
Apple Watch Series 6 : Graphite
Is the New Black
One of the numerous lamentable aspects of product introductions in the coronavirus era is the lack of any sort of post - keynote hands - on access to the products .
Apple ’s product photography is nonpareil , but there are some things you need to see in person .
Color is one .
And for how things feel , well , you obviously need to have whatever it is in hand — or in this case , on wrist .
With this week ’s new products , the ones I was most interested in seeing , feeling , and trying in person were : the Graphite stainless steel Series 6 Apple Watch ( how dark is it ?
how polished ? ) , the new Solo Loop and Braided Solo Loop bands ( how stretchy are they ?
how comfortable ?
better than the regular Sport Bands or just different ? ) , and the new Leather Link strap ( how ’s it compare to the Leather Loop ? ) .
Apple sent me the following products for review , which arrived early Wednesday morning — without having asked me if I had any specific requests : Graphite stainless steel Series 6 ( 44 mm )
Graphite Milanese Loop
Solo Loop ( black )
Braided Solo Loop ( black )
The advantage , perhaps , of having boring but very consistent taste is that I ’m very easy to predict .
While what Apple sent was n’t an exact match for my personal “ what I ’m most interested in ” list , it was remarkably close , and sending the Milanese Loop instead of the Leather Loop is better for the single biggest question on my mind — evaluating the Graphite stainless steel finish .
But that ’s not all .
Part of the thing with the Solo Loops is that they ’re rather precisely sized — they stretch to take on and off , but they ’re meant to fit your wrist in their unstretched state .
Going by Apple ’s print - and - cut - out DIY sizing PDF , the difference between each size is less than 6.6 mm .
According to Apple ’s paper tool , I should take a size 7 , but I ’m closer to an 8 than a 6 .
They sent me each of the Solo Loops in two sizes : 7 and 8 .
And , indeed , the size 7 fits me perfectly .
The size 8 straps fit OK , but they ’re loose — not little - kid - wearing - their - dad ’s - watch loose , more like someone - who - prefers - a - slightly - wiggly - fit loose .
Whoever on the Apple ’s Watch team decided which sizes to send me absolutely nailed it .
It ’s uncanny .
I checked with a few of my fellow hacks and Apple sent them the exact right sizes too .
Nobody was asked to measure their wrists , nobody was asked which hole they use in the regular Sport Bands .
I ca n’t get over this .
I feel like I just lost $ 5 to a carnival barker who correctly guessed my age to the exact year , and I want to get back in line to bet another $ 5 to see if he can guess my weight .
Graphite Stainless Steel
In addition to the wrist - size guessers , I would like to nominate the color - naming team at Apple for a nice bonus this year .
They do good work .
1 Graphite is an excellent name for this stainless steel finish .
It is darker , but it is not nearly black .
Describing where Graphite lies on the spectrum compared to the other dark metallic finishes in Apple ’s product line really does require words , not photographs .
I mean , compare Apple ’s product photography for the Space Black Series 6 in stainless steel ( only available in Hermès models this year ) with Graphite Series 6 in stainless steel .
Apple ’s photos make them look indistinguishable .
For posterity , I ’ve saved copies of Apple ’s product shots of the Series 6 in Graphite , Space Black Hermès , and Space Black Titanium ( which I very much like , but which really ought to be called Space Gray , because it ’s definitely not black ) .
In real life , the difference is very clear .
Apple ’s photography captures Graphite very accurately , but makes Space Black look much lighter than it actually is , to accentuate its polished surface in comparison to Space Gray aluminum and Space Black titanium .
( I do n’t have access to a new Series 6 in Space Black , but I do own Space Black Series 3 and Series 0 watches , and Apple ’s Space Black is the same across Apple Watches old and new . )
Apple ’s Space Black DLC finish for stainless steel is truly jet black — it ’s the polished glossy black of Darth Vader ’s helmet .
Graphite is more like a darker shade of silver — it is definitely darker than regular “ silver ” stainless steel , but just as definitely not black .
Another good comparison is to last year ’s Space Gray iPhone 11 Pro , which is also stainless steel , dark gray , and highly polished .
My Space Gray iPhone 11 Pro is definitely darker than the new Graphite Apple Watch .
To my eyes , Apple ’s Space Gray steel ( as seen on iPhones ) plays as black or near - black , unless you put it against something truly black .
Graphite never looks black .
Apple ’s dark gray stainless steel finishes , on a spectrum : Space Black Apple Watch ( darkest )
Space Gray iPhone 11 Pro
Graphite Apple Watch ( lightest )
Outdoors in daylight , my Space Gray iPhone 11 Pro looks closer to Graphite than to Space Black ; indoors at night , it looks closer to Space Black than to Graphite .
I think this is a good change for Apple ’s “ dark ” stainless steel watches .
Space Black made more sense with the original Series 0 – 3 form factor , where the displays were sharp - cornered rectangles and had larger bezels .
The Space Black finish effectively blurred the seam between the display sapphire and the steel case , and helped disguise the fact that the displays had awkwardly large bezels .
The watch as a whole looked like a shiny black monolithic capsule .
With the Series 4 redesign that carries through to this year ’s Series 6 , that sort of disguise is n’t necessary , because the displays are larger and have round corners .
Also , Graphite looks more obviously like polished steel than Space Black — they might well be equally polished and glossy , but because Graphite is lighter - colored it has a mirror - like effect that Space Black does n’t .
It ’s more glanceably premium - looking .
It ’s shiny .
That shininess carries through to the Graphite Milanese Loop , which definitely looks darker than the regular Silver stainless steel Milanese Loop , but just as definitely is not black .
Again , Apple ’s product photography for Graphite is very true to life to my eyes .
My Space Black Link Bracelet — from my original Apple Watch back in 2015 , still in pristine condition thanks to the near - imperviousness of the DLC finish — looks fine with the Graphite Series 6 watch .
It ’s definitely not an exact color match , but on the wrist , it plays .
The mirror - like finish of Graphite stainless steel helps it pick up the color of whatever band you pair it with .
( Apple still sells the Link Bracelets , in Silver and Space Black stainless steel , and the Space Black one still costs $ 100 extra — $ 450 vs. $ 350 . )
Why do the dark Hermès models still use Space Black instead of Graphite ?
I think that ’s to precisely color - match the existing Space Black hardware of Hermès watch bands .
But who knows ?
It really does seem a bit curious that Apple ’s dark stainless steel Series 6 models are only available in Graphite , and Hermès ’s dark ones are only available in Space Black .
[ Update : Here ’s the Series 6 in Space Black at Hermès ’s website .
These are slightly different photos , and maybe make the Space Black look more black than the photos on Apple ’s site ?
The hardware elements of the strap certainly do . ]
Solo Loops
I know not every Apple Watch owner has a Sport Band , but I assume a general familiarity with it as the canonical , iconic Apple Watch band .
Visually , the new Solo Loop looks like the Sport Band on the wrist .
But it feels quite different .
For one thing , the Solo Loops are half the weight of the Sport Bands .
My regular Sport Bands ( 42/44 mm width , S/M length ) all weigh about 25 grams according to my kitchen scale .
2
The new rubber Solo Loop weighs only 13 grams and the Braided Solo Loop just 11 grams .
( Apple ’s velcro Sport Loop bands remain the lightweight kings , at just 9 grams .
Personally I ’m just not a velcro guy , but I see tons of people wearing these straps . )
In addition to the weight difference , they also feel quite different because they ’re more supple .
If you hold a Sport Band by the connector and stick it out horizontally , it only droops a little , like a diving board in need of repair .
If you hold one of the new Solo Loops by the connector , it droops straight down .
It seems axiomatic that stretchiness and suppleness go hand - in - hand , but on the wrist you can really feel it , especially comparing the rubber Solo Loop to a regular fluoroelastomer Sport Band .
It ’s like baby ’s - butt - cheek soft and supple .
In terms of getting them on and off the wrist , I ’d say they ’re both clearly in “ just right ” range on the Goldilocks scale .
If they were stretchier , they might be a bit easier to get on and off , but I think they ’d then be too loosey - goosey on the wrist .
Once on your wrist , the Solo Loop bands are very secure .
And though Apple has a footnote on its Solo Loop web page stating “ Band may increase in length over time ” , I suspect they ’re a little less stretchy than they could be to make them more durable .
Here ’s how Apple describes the Braided Solo Loop fabric : Made from 100 percent recycled materials , the 16,000 polyester yarn filaments in each band are interwoven with thin silicone threads using advanced braiding machinery then laser cut to an exact length .
The 300D construction offers a soft , textured feel and is both sweat - resistant and water - resistant .
( “ 300D ” is the type of polyester — thinner and lighter than 600D . )
I ca n’t do better than Apple ’s own description : it does feel soft and textured , and it does seem water - resistant for a fabric band .
I soaked mine under a faucet , and it ’s not magic — it does get wet .
But if you ’ve ever worn a NATO - style watch strap , or one of Apple ’s old Nylon Woven Bands , or one of my personal favorites for mechanical watches , an Erika ’s Original MN strap , you know that these sort of nylon / polyester straps dry fairly quickly even after swimming .
I really like both of these straps , and will probably wind up wearing one or the other with my Apple Watch for the foreseeable future .
I hope both prove popular enough to become perennial mainstays in Apple ’s band lineup . ★
Want to start a startup ?
Get funded by Y Combinator .
May 2005
( This essay is derived from a talk at the Berkeley CSUA . )
The three big powers on the Internet now are Yahoo , Google , and Microsoft .
Average age of their founders : 24 .
So it is pretty well established now that grad students can start successful companies .
And if grad students can do it , why not undergrads ?
Like everything else in technology , the cost of starting a startup has decreased dramatically .
Now it 's so low that it has disappeared into the noise .
The main cost of starting a Web - based startup is food and rent .
Which means it does n't cost much more to start a company than to be a total slacker .
You can probably start a startup on ten thousand dollars of seed funding , if you 're prepared to live on ramen .
The less it costs to start a company , the less you need the permission of investors to do it .
So a lot of people will be able to start companies now who never could have before .
The most interesting subset may be those in their early twenties .
I 'm not so excited about founders who have everything investors want except intelligence , or everything except energy .
The most promising group to be liberated by the new , lower threshold are those who have everything investors want except experience .
Market Rate
I once claimed that nerds were unpopular in secondary school mainly because they had better things to do than work full - time at being popular .
Some said I was just telling people what they wanted to hear .
Well , I 'm now about to do that in a spectacular way : I think undergraduates are undervalued .
Or more precisely , I think few realize the huge spread in the value of 20 year olds .
Some , it 's true , are not very capable .
But others are more capable than all but a handful of 30 year olds . [ 1 ]
Till now the problem has always been that it 's difficult to pick them out .
Every VC in the world , if they could go back in time , would try to invest in Microsoft .
But which would have then ?
How many would have understood that this particular 19 year old was Bill Gates ?
It 's hard to judge the young because ( a ) they change rapidly , ( b ) there is great variation between them , and ( c ) they 're individually inconsistent .
That last one is a big problem .
When you 're young , you occasionally say and do stupid things even when you 're smart .
So if the algorithm is to filter out people who say stupid things , as many investors and employers unconsciously do , you 're going to get a lot of false positives .
Most organizations who hire people right out of college are only aware of the average value of 22 year olds , which is not that high .
And so the idea for most of the twentieth century was that everyone had to begin as a trainee in some entry - level job .
Organizations realized there was a lot of variation in the incoming stream , but instead of pursuing this thought they tended to suppress it , in the belief that it was good for even the most promising kids to start at the bottom , so they did n't get swelled heads .
The most productive young people will always be undervalued by large organizations , because the young have no performance to measure yet , and any error in guessing their ability will tend toward the mean .
What 's an especially productive 22 year old to do ?
One thing you can do is go over the heads of organizations , directly to the users .
Any company that hires you is , economically , acting as a proxy for the customer .
The rate at which they value you ( though they may not consciously realize it ) is an attempt to guess your value to the user .
But there 's a way to appeal their judgement .
If you want , you can opt to be valued directly by users , by starting your own company .
The market is a lot more discerning than any employer .
And it is completely non-discriminatory .
On the Internet , nobody knows you 're a dog .
And more to the point , nobody knows you 're 22 .
All users care about is whether your site or software gives them what they want .
They do n't care if the person behind it is a high school kid .
If you 're really productive , why not make employers pay market rate for you ?
Why go work as an ordinary employee for a big company , when you could start a startup and make them buy it to get you ?
When most people hear the word " startup , " they think of the famous ones that have gone public .
But most startups that succeed do it by getting bought .
And usually the acquirer does n't just want the technology , but the people who created it as well .
Often big companies buy startups before they 're profitable .
Obviously in such cases they 're not after revenues .
What they want is the development team and the software they 've built so far .
When a startup gets bought for 2 or 3 million six months in , it 's really more of a hiring bonus than an acquisition .
I think this sort of thing will happen more and more , and that it will be better for everyone .
It 's obviously better for the people who start the startup , because they get a big chunk of money up front .
But I think it will be better for the acquirers too .
The central problem in big companies , and the main reason they 're so much less productive than small companies , is the difficulty of valuing each person 's work .
Buying larval startups solves that problem for them : the acquirer does n't pay till the developers have proven themselves .
Acquirers are protected on the downside , but still get most of the upside .
Product Development
Buying startups also solves another problem afflicting big companies : they can't do product development .
Big companies are good at extracting the value from existing products , but bad at creating new ones .
Why ?
It 's worth studying this phenomenon in detail , because this is the raison d'etre of startups .
To start with , most big companies have some kind of turf to protect , and this tends to warp their development decisions .
For example , Web - based applications are hot now , but within Microsoft there must be a lot of ambivalence about them , because the very idea of Web - based software threatens the desktop .
So any Web - based application that Microsoft ends up with , will probably , like Hotmail , be something developed outside the company .
Another reason big companies are bad at developing new products is that the kind of people who do that tend not to have much power in big companies ( unless they happen to be the CEO ) .
Disruptive technologies are developed by disruptive people .
And they either do n't work for the big company , or have been outmaneuvered by yes - men and have comparatively little influence .
Big companies also lose because they usually only build one of each thing .
When you only have one Web browser , you can't do anything really risky with it .
If ten different startups design ten different Web browsers and you take the best , you 'll probably get something better .
The more general version of this problem is that there are too many new ideas for companies to explore them all .
There might be 500 startups right now who think they 're making something Microsoft might buy .
Even Microsoft probably could n't manage 500 development projects in - house .
Big companies also do n't pay people the right way .
People developing a new product at a big company get paid roughly the same whether it succeeds or fails .
People at a startup expect to get rich if the product succeeds , and get nothing if it fails . [ 2 ]
So naturally the people at the startup work a lot harder .
The mere bigness of big companies is an obstacle .
In startups , developers are often forced to talk directly to users , whether they want to or not , because there is no one else to do sales and support .
It 's painful doing sales , but you learn much more from trying to sell people something than reading what they said in focus groups .
And then of course , big companies are bad at product development because they 're bad at everything .
Everything happens slower in big companies than small ones , and product development is something that has to happen fast , because you have to go through a lot of iterations to get something good .
Trend
I think the trend of big companies buying startups will only accelerate .
One of the biggest remaining obstacles is pride .
Most companies , at least unconsciously , feel they ought to be able to develop stuff in house , and that buying startups is to some degree an admission of failure .
And so , as people generally do with admissions of failure , they put it off for as long as possible .
That makes the acquisition very expensive when it finally happens .
What companies should do is go out and discover startups when they 're young , before VCs have puffed them up into something that costs hundreds of millions to acquire .
Much of what VCs add , the acquirer does n't need anyway .
Why do n't acquirers try to predict the companies they 're going to have to buy for hundreds of millions , and grab them early for a tenth or a twentieth of that ?
Because they can't predict the winners in advance ?
If they 're only paying a twentieth as much , they only have to predict a twentieth as well .
Surely they can manage that .
I think companies that acquire technology will gradually learn to go after earlier stage startups .
They wo n't necessarily buy them outright .
The solution may be some hybrid of investment and acquisition : for example , to buy a chunk of the company and get an option to buy the rest later .
When companies buy startups , they 're effectively fusing recruiting and product development .
And I think that 's more efficient than doing the two separately , because you always get people who are really committed to what they 're working on .
Plus this method yields teams of developers who already work well together .
Any conflicts between them have been ironed out under the very hot iron of running a startup .
By the time the acquirer gets them , they 're finishing one another 's sentences .
That 's valuable in software , because so many bugs occur at the boundaries between different people 's code .
Investors
The increasing cheapness of starting a company does n't just give hackers more power relative to employers .
It also gives them more power relative to investors .
The conventional wisdom among VCs is that hackers should n't be allowed to run their own companies .
The founders are supposed to accept MBAs as their bosses , and themselves take on some title like Chief Technical Officer .
There may be cases where this is a good idea .
But I think founders will increasingly be able to push back in the matter of control , because they just do n't need the investors ' money as much as they used to .
Startups are a comparatively new phenomenon .
Fairchild Semiconductor is considered the first VC - backed startup , and they were founded in 1959 , less than fifty years ago .
Measured on the time scale of social change , what we have now is pre-beta .
So we should n't assume the way startups work now is the way they have to work .
Fairchild needed a lot of money to get started .
They had to build actual factories .
What does the first round of venture funding for a Web - based startup get spent on today ?
More money can't get software written faster ; it is n't needed for facilities , because those can now be quite cheap ; all money can really buy you is sales and marketing .
A sales force is worth something , I 'll admit .
But marketing is increasingly irrelevant .
On the Internet , anything genuinely good will spread by word of mouth .
Investors ' power comes from money .
When startups need less money , investors have less power over them .
So future founders may not have to accept new CEOs if they do n't want them .
The VCs will have to be dragged kicking and screaming down this road , but like many things people have to be dragged kicking and screaming toward , it may actually be good for them .
Google is a sign of the way things are going .
As a condition of funding , their investors insisted they hire someone old and experienced as CEO .
But from what I 've heard the founders did n't just give in and take whoever the VCs wanted .
They delayed for an entire year , and when they did finally take a CEO , they chose a guy with a PhD in computer science .
It sounds to me as if the founders are still the most powerful people in the company , and judging by Google 's performance , their youth and inexperience does n't seem to have hurt them .
Indeed , I suspect Google has done better than they would have if the founders had given the VCs what they wanted , when they wanted it , and let some MBA take over as soon as they got their first round of funding .
I 'm not claiming the business guys installed by VCs have no value .
Certainly they have .
But they do n't need to become the founders ' bosses , which is what that title CEO means .
I predict that in the future the executives installed by VCs will increasingly be COOs rather than CEOs .
The founders will run engineering directly , and the rest of the company through the COO .
The Open Cage
With both employers and investors , the balance of power is slowly shifting towards the young .
And yet they seem the last to realize it .
Only the most ambitious undergrads even consider starting their own company when they graduate .
Most just want to get a job .
Maybe this is as it should be .
Maybe if the idea of starting a startup is intimidating , you filter out the uncommitted .
But I suspect the filter is set a little too high .
I think there are people who could , if they tried , start successful startups , and who instead let themselves be swept into the intake ducts of big companies .
Have you ever noticed that when animals are let out of cages , they do n't always realize at first that the door 's open ?
Often they have to be poked with a stick to get them out .
Something similar happened with blogs .
People could have been publishing online in 1995 , and yet blogging has only really taken off in the last couple years .
In 1995 we thought only professional writers were entitled to publish their ideas , and that anyone else who did was a crank .
Now publishing online is becoming so popular that everyone wants to do it , even print journalists .
But blogging has not taken off recently because of any technical innovation ; it just took eight years for everyone to realize the cage was open .
I think most undergrads do n't realize yet that the economic cage is open .
A lot have been told by their parents that the route to success is to get a good job .
This was true when their parents were in college , but it 's less true now .
The route to success is to build something valuable , and you do n't have to be working for an existing company to do that .
Indeed , you can often do it better if you 're not .
When I talk to undergrads , what surprises me most about them is how conservative they are .
Not politically , of course .
I mean they do n't seem to want to take risks .
This is a mistake , because the younger you are , the more risk you can take .
Risk
Risk and reward are always proportionate .
For example , stocks are riskier than bonds , and over time always have greater returns .
So why does anyone invest in bonds ?
The catch is that phrase " over time . "
Stocks will generate greater returns over thirty years , but they might lose value from year to year .
So what you should invest in depends on how soon you need the money .
If you 're young , you should take the riskiest investments you can find .
All this talk about investing may seem very theoretical .
Most undergrads probably have more debts than assets .
They may feel they have nothing to invest .
But that 's not true : they have their time to invest , and the same rule about risk applies there .
Your early twenties are exactly the time to take insane career risks .
The reason risk is always proportionate to reward is that market forces make it so .
People will pay extra for stability .
So if you choose stability -- by buying bonds , or by going to work for a big company -- it 's going to cost you .
Riskier career moves pay better on average , because there is less demand for them .
Extreme choices like starting a startup are so frightening that most people wo n't even try .
So you do n't end up having as much competition as you might expect , considering the prizes at stake .
The math is brutal .
While perhaps 9 out of 10 startups fail , the one that succeeds will pay the founders more than 10 times what they would have made in an ordinary job . [ 3 ]
That 's the sense in which startups pay better " on average . "
Remember that .
If you start a startup , you 'll probably fail .
Most startups fail .
It 's the nature of the business .
But it 's not necessarily a mistake to try something that has a 90 % chance of failing , if you can afford the risk .
Failing at 40 , when you have a family to support , could be serious .
But if you fail at 22 , so what ?
If you try to start a startup right out of college and it tanks , you 'll end up at 23 broke and a lot smarter .
Which , if you think about it , is roughly what you hope to get from a graduate program .
Even if your startup does tank , you wo n't harm your prospects with employers .
To make sure I asked some friends who work for big companies .
I asked managers at Yahoo , Google , Amazon , Cisco and Microsoft how they 'd feel about two candidates , both 24 , with equal ability , one who'd tried to start a startup that tanked , and another who'd spent the two years since college working as a developer at a big company .
Every one responded that they 'd prefer the guy who'd tried to start his own company .
Zod Nazem , who 's in charge of engineering at Yahoo , said : I actually put more value on the guy with the failed startup .
And you can quote me !
So there you have it .
Want to get hired by Yahoo ?
Start your own company .
The Man is the Customer
If even big employers think highly of young hackers who start companies , why do n't more do it ?
Why are undergrads so conservative ?
I think it 's because they 've spent so much time in institutions .
The first twenty years of everyone 's life consists of being piped from one institution to another .
You probably did n't have much choice about the secondary schools you went to .
And after high school it was probably understood that you were supposed to go to college .
You may have had a few different colleges to choose between , but they were probably pretty similar .
So by this point you 've been riding on a subway line for twenty years , and the next stop seems to be a job .
Actually college is where the line ends .
Superficially , going to work for a company may feel like just the next in a series of institutions , but underneath , everything is different .
The end of school is the fulcrum of your life , the point where you go from net consumer to net producer .
The other big change is that now , you 're steering .
You can go anywhere you want .
So it may be worth standing back and understanding what 's going on , instead of just doing the default thing .
All through college , and probably long before that , most undergrads have been thinking about what employers want .
But what really matters is what customers want , because they 're the ones who give employers the money to pay you .
So instead of thinking about what employers want , you 're probably better off thinking directly about what users want .
To the extent there 's any difference between the two , you can even use that to your advantage if you start a company of your own .
For example , big companies like docile conformists .
But this is merely an artifact of their bigness , not something customers need .
Grad School
I did n't consciously realize all this when I was graduating from college -- partly because I went straight to grad school .
Grad school can be a pretty good deal , even if you think of one day starting a startup .
You can start one when you 're done , or even pull the ripcord part way through , like the founders of Yahoo and Google .
Grad school makes a good launch pad for startups , because you 're collected together with a lot of smart people , and you have bigger chunks of time to work on your own projects than an undergrad or corporate employee would .
As long as you have a fairly tolerant advisor , you can take your time developing an idea before turning it into a company .
David Filo and Jerry Yang started the Yahoo directory in February 1994 and were getting a million hits a day by the fall , but they did n't actually drop out of grad school and start a company till March 1995 .
You could also try the startup first , and if it does n't work , then go to grad school .
When startups tank they usually do it fairly quickly .
Within a year you 'll know if you 're wasting your time .
If it fails , that is .
If it succeeds , you may have to delay grad school a little longer .
But you 'll have a much more enjoyable life once there than you would on a regular grad student stipend .
Experience
Another reason people in their early twenties do n't start startups is that they feel they do n't have enough experience .
Most investors feel the same .
I remember hearing a lot of that word " experience " when I was in college .
What do people really mean by it ?
Obviously it's not the experience itself that 's valuable , but something it changes in your brain .
What 's different about your brain after you have " experience , " and can you make that change happen faster ?
I now have some data on this , and I can tell you what tends to be missing when people lack experience .
I 've said that every startup needs three things : to start with good people , to make something users want , and not to spend too much money .
It 's the middle one you get wrong when you 're inexperienced .
There are plenty of undergrads with enough technical skill to write good software , and undergrads are not especially prone to waste money .
If they get something wrong , it 's usually not realizing they have to make something people want .
This is not exclusively a failing of the young .
It 's common for startup founders of all ages to build things no one wants .
Fortunately , this flaw should be easy to fix .
If undergrads were all bad programmers , the problem would be a lot harder .
It can take years to learn how to program .
But I do n't think it takes years to learn how to make things people want .
My hypothesis is that all you have to do is smack hackers on the side of the head and tell them :
Wake up .
Do n't sit here making up a priori theories about what users need .
Go find some users and see what they need .
Most successful startups not only do something very specific , but solve a problem people already know they have .
The big change that " experience " causes in your brain is learning that you need to solve people 's problems .
Once you grasp that , you advance quickly to the next step , which is figuring out what those problems are .
And that takes some effort , because the way software actually gets used , especially by the people who pay the most for it , is not at all what you might expect .
For example , the stated purpose of Powerpoint is to present ideas .
Its real role is to overcome people 's fear of public speaking .
It allows you to give an impressive - looking talk about nothing , and it causes the audience to sit in a dark room looking at slides , instead of a bright one looking at you .
This kind of thing is out there for anyone to see .
The key is to know to look for it -- to realize that having an idea for a startup is not like having an idea for a class project .
The goal in a startup is not to write a cool piece of software .
It 's to make something people want .
And to do that you have to look at users -- forget about hacking , and just look at users .
This can be quite a mental adjustment , because little if any of the software you write in school even has users .
A few steps before a Rubik 's Cube is solved , it still looks like a mess .
I think there are a lot of undergrads whose brains are in a similar position : they 're only a few steps away from being able to start successful startups , if they wanted to , but they do n't realize it .
They have more than enough technical skill .
They just have n't realized yet that the way to create wealth is to make what users want , and that employers are just proxies for users in which risk is pooled .
If you 're young and smart , you do n't need either of those .
You do n't need someone else to tell you what users want , because you can figure it out yourself .
And you do n't want to pool risk , because the younger you are , the more risk you should take .
A Public Service Message
I 'd like to conclude with a joint message from me and your parents .
Do n't drop out of college to start a startup .
There 's no rush .
There will be plenty of time to start companies after you graduate .
In fact , it may be just as well to go work for an existing company for a couple years after you graduate , to learn how companies work .
And yet , when I think about it , I can't imagine telling Bill Gates at 19 that he should wait till he graduated to start a company .
He 'd have told me to get lost .
And could I have honestly claimed that he was harming his future -- that he was learning less by working at ground zero of the microcomputer revolution than he would have if he'd been taking classes back at Harvard ?
No , probably not .
And yes , while it is probably true that you 'll learn some valuable things by going to work for an existing company for a couple years before starting your own , you 'd learn a thing or two running your own company during that time too .
The advice about going to work for someone else would get an even colder reception from the 19 year old Bill Gates .
So I 'm supposed to finish college , then go work for another company for two years , and then I can start my own ?
I have to wait till I 'm 23 ?
That 's four years .
That 's more than twenty percent of my life so far .
Plus in four years it will be way too late to make money writing a Basic interpreter for the Altair .
And he'd be right .
The Apple II was launched just two years later .
In fact , if Bill had finished college and gone to work for another company as we 're suggesting , he might well have gone to work for Apple .
And while that would probably have been better for all of us , it would n't have been better for him .
So while I stand by our responsible advice to finish college and then go work for a while before starting a startup , I have to admit it 's one of those things the old tell the young , but do n't expect them to listen to .
We say this sort of thing mainly so we can claim we warned you .
So do n't say I did n't warn you .

If a company tried to pay employees this way , they 'd be called unfair .
And yet when they buy some startups and not others , no one thinks of calling that unfair .

It 's suspiciously neat .
My guess is the odds are slightly worse .

Iran is testing an advanced centrifuge designed to more swiftly produce enriched uranium in defiance of Security Council resolutions ordering it to stop , diplomats confirmed Thursday .
The centrifuges are still in the early testing stages , and are not being used to enrich nuclear material , said diplomats familiar with information from the International Atomic Energy Agency .
“ It is significant that they were able to make this more advanced , more reliable centrifuge in just about two years , ” said David Albright , a nuclear expert and former U.N. inspector .
“ It is also a troubling development that they could develop it in secret and be close to enriching uranium with it . ”
He said it did not change the estimate of his organization , the Institute for Science and International Security , that the earliest Iran could have a nuclear weapon is by the end of 2009 .
Advertisement
U.S. intelligence agencies in December issued an assessment saying they had concluded that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
The intelligence agencies said Iran ended covert efforts to produce highly enriched uranium suitable for use in a bomb , but made it clear that it could resume its efforts at any time .
Enriched uranium can be used to generate electricity or to produce material for a bomb , depending on the degree of enrichment .
Iran insists that it has the right to develop nuclear technology for civilian use , and has rejected the U.N. Security Council ’s calls to halt enrichment and the IAEA ’s requests to allow closer inspections .
The IAEA says that Iran must rebuild confidence after keeping its nuclear program secret for nearly 20 years and buying black market technology .
The centrifuge seems to be based on a P2 design obtained illicitly in 1995 from the network of rogue Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan .
Advertisement
Iran notified the IAEA in 2006 that it was working on the faster design , known as a modified P2 , or as Iran calls it , the IR - 2 , but refused to let inspectors see it .
IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei got the first look at the centrifuge in January when he visited a workshop in Tehran .
The diplomats asked that their names not be used because they were not authorized to comment about the matter .

Capsaicin in some peppers , attacks cancer cells ' mitochondria
They found capsaicin , an ingredient of jalapeno peppers , triggers cancer cell death by attacking mitochondria - the cells ' energy - generating boiler rooms .
The research raises the possibility that other cancer drugs could be developed to target mitochondria .
The Nottingham University study features in Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications .
The study showed that the family of molecules to which capsaicin belongs , the vanilloids , bind to proteins in the cancer cell mitochondria to trigger apoptosis , or cell death , without harming surrounding healthy cells .
We believe that we have in effect discovered a fundamental ' Achilles heel ' for all cancers
Dr Timothy Bates
Capsaicin was tested on cultures of human lung cancer cells and on pancreatic cancers .
Lead researcher Dr Timothy Bates said : " As these compounds attack the very heart of the tumour cells , we believe that we have in effect discovered a fundamental ' Achilles heel ' for all cancers .
" The biochemistry of the mitochondria in cancer cells is very different from that in normal cells .
" This is an innate selective vulnerability of cancer cells . "
He said a dose of capsaicin that could cause a cancer cell to enter apoptosis , would not have the same effect on a normal cell .
Cancer Research UK recommends reducing your risk of cancer by eating a healthy , balanced diet , with plenty of vegetables and fruit
Josephine Querido
Potential Drugs
The fact that capsaicin and other vanilloids are already commonly found in the diet proves they are safe to eat .
This could make development of a drug containing them a much quicker and cheaper process .
Dr Bates said : " Capsaicin , for example , is already found in treatments for muscle strain and psoriasis - which raises the question of whether an adapted topical treatment could be used to treat certain types of skin cancer .
" It 's also possible that cancer patients or those at risk of developing cancer could be advised to eat a diet which is richer in spicy foods to help treat or prevent the disease . "
However , Josephine Querido , cancer information officer at Cancer Research UK , said : " This research does not suggest that eating vast quantities of chilli pepper will help prevent or treat cancer .
" The experiments showed that pepper extracts killed cancer cells grown in the laboratory , but these have not yet been tested to see if they are safe and effective in humans . "
Cancer Research UK recommends reducing the risk of cancer by eating a healthy , balanced diet , with plenty of vegetables and fruit .
Dr Bates added that the mitochondria in cancer cells could also be targeted by other compounds .
He said the investigation and development of anti-mitochondrial drugs for cancer chemotherapy was likely to be " extremely significant " in the fight against cancer .
[ S ] taff lack training ... more focused on punishing ... than encouraging ....
New York education officials issued a scathing report yesterday on a Massachusetts school that punishes troubled and disabled students with electric shocks , finding that they can be shocked for simply nagging the teacher and that some are forced to wear shock devices in the bathtub or shower , posing an electrocution hazard .
The report , based in part on an inspection last month of the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center in Canton , portrayed a school in which most staff lack training to handle the students and seem more focused on punishing bad behavior than encouraging good acts .
The investigators said some forms of discipline , such as a device that delivers shocks at timed intervals , appear to violate federal safety regulations , and students live in an atmosphere of " pervasive fears and anxieties . "
[ S ] tudents live in an atmosphere of " pervasive fears and anxieties . "
The report , denounced by Rotenberg officials as biased , is expected to play a key role next Monday when education regulators in New York are scheduled to vote on whether to severely restrict the use of painful punishment on students from New York .
Two - thirds of Rotenberg 's students are sent from New York .
The inspectors said they had notified officials in Massachusetts and at the US Food and Drug Administration about possible violations of state and federal safety rules .
There have been increasing allegations of abuse at the Rotenberg Center in recent months .
22 allegations of abuse at the school since January , including 12 that involve injuries .
They include several assertions that students have been badly burned by the shock devices , known as graduated electronic decelerators .
The Massachusetts Disabled Persons Protection Commission has received 22 allegations of abuse at the school since January , including 12 that involve injuries .
Rotenberg officials have steadfastly denied the charges , but commission officials say that at least two have been substantiated .
Yesterday , a lawyer for the school , Michael Flammia , said the New York report grossly distorts what goes on at the school , which is often used as a place of last resort for students with autism , mental retardation , or behavioral problems .
School districts in several states , including Massachusetts , refer students to Rotenberg after other methods to control their behavior , such as hospitalization or drugs , have failed .
The school has about 250 students , about half of whom wear electric shock devices that teachers can activate around the clock .
" These findings are completely false .
They are the product of a biased review team sent by the New York State Education Department for the specific purpose of making derogatory findings " about the center , said Flammia , who denied that students are forced to wear shock devices in the shower .
He also said that New York officials are mistaken in asserting that the school is violating FDA or Massachusetts rules .
Flammia noted that New York inspectors had given the Judge Rotenberg Center high marks for safety last September , but he believes they turned against the school after the publicity surrounding a lawsuit filed this spring by the mother of a New York student .
Some parents of Rotenberg students rallied behind the school , as they have in the past , saying that most people do n't understand how serious their children 's problems are .
The school , which costs states and school districts more than $ 200,000 a year per student , helps students who have failed everywhere else , they say , and turns to shocks and other punishments only if less painful methods fail .
" This school has saved my daughter 's life , " said Marcia Shear of Long Island , whose 13 - year - old daughter , Samantha , used to punch herself in the head so often that she detached both retinas .
After she received a few high - level shocks , Shear said , the self - abuse stopped .
" I am livid at these people and pieces of garbage who think they know what they 're doing .
Let them come and sit with my child and go through what I 've gone through for 11 years . "
Antwone ... was shocked 79 times over 1 1/2 years ... became increasingly desperate to get away .
The 26 - page New York report intensified a debate over the Judge Rotenberg Center 's methods that has gone on for much of its 35 years .
The latest controversy began in March , when Evelyn Nicholson of Freeport , N.Y. , went public with a charge that her son , Antwone , had been mistreated at the school , where he was shocked 79 times over 1 1/2 years .
She initially consented to the procedure to curb her son's aggressive behavior , but said she changed her mind after Antwone became increasingly desperate to get away .
" There 's no education in what 's happening here , " said Ken Mollins , a lawyer representing the Nicholson family , which is suing New York for $ 10 million .
" The head of this institution calls this therapy .
I think this is more like a domestic torture chamber . "

Read the report on the Rotenberg Center The New York inspectors found that more than two - thirds of the direct - care providers at the Rotenberg Center have completed only a high school education , which they said " in many cases ... is not sufficient to oversee the intensive treatment of children with challenging emotional and behavioral problems . "
They also noted that only six of the 17 clinicians who oversee mental - health care at the school have a license in psychology .
The inspectors said the school appeared to violate FDA regulations in several ways , including a policy that allows the parents of students to administer shocks to students after only minimal training .
The New York report also said that the school appears to violate Massachusetts regulations that allow painful punishments only for " extraordinarily difficult or dangerous behavioral problems , " noting that they witnessed one student who was threatened with a shock after sneezing in class .
School officials said no shock had been given in this case .
[ S ] tudent ... threatened with a shock after sneezing in class ...
Center withholds food as a punishment .
Finally , the report raised concerns about students ' nutrition because the Judge Rotenberg Center withholds food as a punishment .
The report found that one New York student was in a program where he could be denied up to 25 percent of his normal food intake .
New York Deputy Education Commissioner Rebecca
Cort said the report painted a much darker picture of the Rotenberg Center than last year 's review , because the state took a more in - depth look , including a surprise inspection that showed the school 's practices are a lot different from written treatment plans for students .
Rotenberg 's Flammia said the school was never given a chance to review the report before it was made public and he said the school would demand a fair chance to respond .
He warned that if New York students are denied access to the Rotenberg Center , the state could be sued by parents of children who hurt themselves as a result .
Supporters of a bill in the Massachusetts Legislature to ban the use of electric shocks on students said they hoped the New York report would give new momentum to their efforts to force the school to change its methods or close .
A proposed ban was written into the state budget passed by the Senate , but the House of Representatives has not taken a position .
" It 's troubling that it 's necessary for New York officials to point out the violations of Massachusetts law taking place at this facility , " said state Senator Brian Joyce , the Milton Democrat who has led the effort to ban electric shock .

According to USA Today , 2.5 million antipsychotic prescriptions a year are written for kids under 18 .
The rate for privately insured kids is 6.5 in 1000 -- it has to be easily ten times that for Medicaid kids .
The FDA database has 45 deaths ; 6 from diabetes , the rest from CV disease , liver failure , suicide , etc .
There were 41 pediatric NMS cases .
According to the article , 13 % of antipsychotic prescriptions are for bipolar disorder .
So are antipsychotics being overprescribed ?
The answer is yes , but not for the reasons cited in the article .
The article , indeed , all articles about pediatric psychiatry , make a special point about how these medicines are not FDA approved for kids .
This is absolutely meaningless .
FDA approval requires two double blind , placebo controlled studies .
These studies are universally taken on by the drug companies .
No drug company would ever assume the massive risk of such a study -- let a lone two -- in kids .
How do you recruit the study subjects ?
What parent is going to allow it ?
Rich parents ?
No chance .
So it will have to be Medicaid parents -- and thus will come the Tuskegee - like charges , dripping with the obvious social and racial implications of pharma testing on poor minorities .
Pharma is already loathed ; they 're not going to take any risks for the sake of a medal from the FDA .
So there will not be any new pediatric indications for psych meds .
Not in this climate .
Think this hurts Pharma ?
It 's your kids that suffer .
But do n't be confused by crypto-socialist hysterics who say that Pharma will do anything for a profit , including peddle drugs to kids .
Drug companies do not market these antipsychotics for kids .
They are paranoid to a fault about doing this ; they know everyone is scrutinizing them , especially lawyers .
If you are a child psychiatrist who sees no adults , reps cannot even call on you .
And if they call on you for other things , they cannot mention the use in kids .
In the past five years , it has never -- never -- happened that a rep detailed me about their use in kids .
The only two reasons these drugs are used in kids is because psychiatrists give them , and parents demand them .
First , the parents .
They do n't come looking for antipsychotics , specifically .
But my experience is that they are unrealistic about what is going on with their kids ; in near denial about the family dynamics impacting on the kid 's behavior ; and virtually devoid of insight into relatively obvious , though procedurally difficult , maneuvers that could improve the situation .
If your kid does n't sleep enough , and consistently -- if your five year old does n't nap -- you cannot tell me your kid has ADHD .
Period .
Parents demand a diagnosis of bipolar disorder for their kids because it means the divorce had nothing to do with it .
They demand another medication when the first one fails to get the kid to do math homework instead of playing Xbox all day .
And their kids ' marijuana and alcohol abuse can't possibly have anything to do with their own marijuana and alcohol abuse .
Parents : do n't flame me .
Your situation is different , I know .
I know .
Second , psychiatrists prescribe them because of the pressure to do something , in the face of consistent failure .
They do n't start with antispychotics -- they end up with them .
They prescribe them out of desperation .
This is why , in every story about a child getting sick from one of these medicines , they are , in fact , on several medicines .
First they start with Ritalin .
If Ritalin does n't help , or there is a side effect , or they can't sleep -- then a second drug is added .
Maybe this helps , but after a while something else happens -- and another drug is added to this .
That 's why psychiatry 's current obssession with the detection of underdiagnosed " bipolar disorder " is so important .
This diagnosis justifies , and encourages , polypharmacy .
It is psychiatry 's ridiculously dangerous , and ultimately doomed , paradigm : if you are not doing well on a medication , you must be so sick that you require two medications .
It seems to have occurred to no one in psychiatry that failure on a medication could mean that it was the wrong medication .
The reason this polypharmacy madness is even possible is psychiatry 's obsession with diagnosis , labels -- with semiotics .
What makes a drug an antipsychotic ?
Well , it treats psychosis .
Fine -- but does that exclude its efficacy for something else ?
If it is later found to be efficacious in , say , depression , then what do you call it ?
Is the drug an antipsychotic that 's also good for depression , or an antidepressant that 's also good for psychosis ?
There 's no value in the label " antipsychotic " or " antidepressant " except what we give it .
It 's a drug that treats psychosis and depression , not an antipsychotic that treats depression ( or the other way around ) .
If you can't see the difference , stop reading now and go back to watching American Idol .
For example , why are antipsychotics viewed as " off label " for kids ?
The word " antipsychotic " is meaningless .
Antipsychotics are tested against a scale , like the Brief Psychatric Rating Scale .
But these scales measure a lot of things , like depression , and not just psychosis .
And at what point did we start making a distinction between psychosis and " dementia related psychosis ? "
Or bipolar depression and regular depression ?
Why do we need separate FDA approvals ?
Does someone know something about the physiology of these disorders that I do n't ?
Do we need to start approvals for " diabetes related depression ? "
Saying an antipsychotic is worse than an antidepressant for depression is a valueless statement , especially in the absence of data on this question .
You are actually better off asking , " which is better for depression , blocking the serotonin transporter or blocking 5HT2a receptors ? "
See ?
Put this way the distinction seems less obvious .
And even that question is valueless , as there is nothing ( that we know of at this time ) that allows us to say what effect either pharmacologic maneuver actually has .
5HT2A blockade does what again ?
Really ?
Do you have any evidence for that at all ?
And no more post hoc ergo propter hoc nonsense .
David Hume laughs at you .
A Simpson 's reference is helpful here :
Homer :
Not a bear in sight .
The Bear Patrol must be working like a
charm .
Lisa :
That 's spacious reasoning , Dad .
Homer : Thank you , dear .
Lisa :
By your logic I could claim that this rock keeps tigers away .
Homer : Oh , how does it work ?
Lisa :
It does n't work .
Homer : Uh-huh .
Lisa :
It 's just a stupid rock .
Homer : Uh-huh .
Lisa :
But I do n't see any tigers around , do you ?
[ Homer thinks of this , then pulls out some money ]
Homer : Lisa , I want to buy your rock .
I know .
The FDA , the Scientologists , socialists , the parents at the end of their ropes - the easy thing to do is blame Pharma .
I'm in the strange position of having to be a Pharma apologist , to be the only doctor willing to defend Pharma .
There are plenty things I do n't like about the way Pharma conducts business , but I can't voice these complaints because I have to use the time countering these inane attacks .
I know what will happen if the Pharma critics get their way .
You think Pharma should have no sales contact with physicians ?
Fine .
Now deal with the consequences .
The army has been unable to end the rebellion
Chad 's foreign minister said the proof was the firing of a missile at a French reconnaissance plane in the east .
The rebels began their offensive in the east at the weekend but were then said to be near the central town of Mongo .
A BBC correspondent in N'Djamena says tanks are stationed in key areas , such as outside the presidential palace .
Troops have been recalled to base despite the Muslim holiday of Eid - the biggest festival of the year in Chad .
The BBC's Stephanie Hancock in Chad says the outskirts of the capital are said to have been heavily fortified with government troops .
But she says the latest reports of the rebels ' location suggest they may have pulled back .
Rapid advance
" These rebels entered Chad from Sudan and they could only have procured this type of military equipment within the sight of and with the knowledge of the Sudanese authorities .
Sudan cannot deny it , " Chadian Foreign Minister Ahmar Allami told AFP news agency .
Khartoum denies backing the rebels , and in turn accuses Chad of backing rebels in the war - torn Darfur region .
Eastern Chad has a similar ethnic make - up to Darfur , where Arab militias are accused of carrying out a genocide against black Africans .
On Monday night , the rebels claimed to have seized the town of Am Timan , some 600 km from N'Djamena but the government denied it had fallen and urged the capital 's residents to stay calm .
" The government appeals to the population to remain calm and to go normally about one 's business , " said spokesman Hourmadji Moussa Doumgor .
On Sunday , the Union of Forces for Democracy and Development ( UFDD ) rebel seized the small town of Gos Beida .
Our correspondent says there was also fierce fighting in the border town of Ade .
France
Our reporter says the role of the French army here will also be key to how the struggle for power plays out .
Back in April , when rebels managed to reach the heart of the capital in a four - day advance before being overpowered , the French received widespread criticism from Chadians for the way they staunchly supported President Idriss Deby .
The French army has also admitted that two days ago one of their surveillance planes narrowly avoided being shot down by a surface - to - air missile fired by rebels .
While the French do still openly support the Chadian government , there are some questions over exactly how far they will go to prop up President Deby 's regime - and how much they are willing to risk , our reporter says .

What is Smalltalk ?
Where is the Editor ?
Where is the Compiler ?
How can I compile and run a program ?
Forget for a while about Smalltalk as a programming language .
Avoid , for a while , comparing it with other programming languages and their tools .
We are going to talk about something pretty different .
What is Smalltalk ?
Smalltalk is a different kind of computer .
One that is not based on the concept of program .
But wait a minute , does n’t Smalltalk run on regular computers ?
Yes , it does .
But Smalltalk lets you forget about a CPU that loads programs from disk to RAM , in order to execute them and such .
With Smalltalk , your computer becomes a virtual place filled with things .
You can interact with these objects , and ask them to perform actions .
You can inspect them , and study their behavior and relationships .
Of course , you can also modify their behavior and relationships .
Everything in Smalltalk is an Object .
For example , the Numbers and Characters .
But also the Editor and the Compiler are Objects .
The windows and menus , with their scrollbars and buttons and stuff are Objects too .
Pieces of code are also Objects .
In Smalltalk , even True and False are objects .
Most computers run Operating Systems .
But the entities of regular Operating Systems are not uniformly available for inspection , study and modification .
This would break the basic ideas of Smalltalk !
Therefore , while in Smalltalk , Smalltalk becomes the Operating System .
You can interact with and modify such things as Files and Directories the same way you manipulate any other object .
As the whole Smalltalk system is made with Objects , and all Objects can be studied and modified , the Smalltalk system hides no secrets from the user .
Any aspect of the system can be modified to suit the user needs .
To continue , you need a Smalltalk system .
Let ’s use Squeak .
You can go to http://www.squeak.org/Download and get Squeak for your platform .
The set of all the available object in a certain Smalltalk environment is called the ‘ image ’ .
The standard Squeak image includes really a lot of objects .
Perhaps too many for a beginner .
You can use it anyway , or you can get www.jvuletich.org/Squeak/EToysFreeMorphic/NoEtoysImage-jmv.zip.
This is a reduced image I like to use .
Launch Squeak .
Click on an empty area of the screen to open the World menu .
Select ‘ Open …’ / ‘ workspace ’.
There type 3+4 .
Select it .
Right click over it and select ‘ print it ’ .
If it shows 7 , you have written your Smalltalk “ hello world ” program .
Now you can try the first Smalltalk example in The Weekly Juan # 6 .
Copy and paste the code in an empty workspace .
Now select it and right click ‘ do it ’.
Voila .
It works .
Now let ’s try the second version .
This one includes some real Smalltalk programming .
This is , adding behavior to existing objects .
We ’ll add new behavior ( methods , code ) to FFT objects .
This is done by modifying the FFT class .
In Smalltalk all objects belong to some class , that defines its behavior .
Please note that classes are Objects too ( as everything else ) .
Open the world menu and select ‘ Open ’ / ‘ browser ’ .
What you see now is the Smalltalk browser .
The main tool for reading and writing Smalltalk code .
The top half of the browser has four lists .
From left to right we have :
- The System Categories .
The items here show groups of classes that belong together .
Do as follows : Right click / ‘ find class …’ FFT < Enter > .
The other 3 lists get filled .
- The Classes in the selected Category .
Class FFT is now selected .
- Method categories .
Methods in a class are grouped together in method categories .
You can create a new category if you wish , named for example ‘ extras ’ .
When you select a category , in the bottom half of the browser you see a method template .
Replace the selected text with the magnitudes method .
Right click / ‘ accept ’.
We have added a new method to the class .
Add the remaining 4 methods .
All the methods appear in the fourth list , the methods list .
Now you can try the second Smalltalk example , that uses the newly added methods .
Do it in a workspace as before .
After this , you can use the browser to see what other classes are available .
Some of the most interesting objects in Squeak are graphical objects , ‘ Morphs ’ .
Read about them !
Read my introductory article on Morphic .

The UN deaths have provoked an international outcry
The UN post
The post was hit by a precision - guided missile after six hours of shelling , diplomats familiar with the probe say .
UN - led crisis talks in Rome ended with no agreement to urge an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah .
Eight Israeli soldiers have died in ongoing clashes - the biggest loss in one incident since the conflict began .
Twenty - two soldiers were injured as Israeli troops tried to gain control of the town of Bint Jbeil , a strategically located Hezbollah stronghold .
An Israeli officer died in a separate clash later .
And a massive explosion destroyed a several - storey building in the centre of Tyre housing the offices of a top Hezbollah commander .
He was not there at the time .
A senior Israel army general said he expected the fighting would continue for " several more weeks " .
More than 400 Lebanese and 42 Israelis have died in two weeks of conflict , which began after Hezbollah captured two Israeli soldiers in a cross - border raid on 12 July .
In other developments :
Hezbollah fired more than 100 rockets into Israel , injuring 31 people , security and medical sources say
A Jordanian military plane arrived in Beirut to evacuate some of the most seriously wounded Lebanese civilians
Ten lorries loaded with food and medical supplies arrived in the southern town of Tyre from the capital , Beirut
Hezbollah 's leader Hassan Nasrallah warned on TV that his organisation would begin firing rockets further south into Israel than Haifa
More than 300 people - mainly US and Australian citizens - who had been caught in the fighting in southern Lebanon are due to leave from Tyre on a Canadian ferry on Wednesday evening
Israeli regrets
The four unarmed UN observers from Austria , Canada , China and Finland , died after their UN post in the town of Khiam was hit by an Israeli air strike on Tuesday .
A senior Irish soldier working for the UN forces had warned the Israelis six times that their bombardment was endangering the lives of UN staff , Ireland 's foreign ministry said .
Had Israel responded to the requests , " rather than deliberately ignoring them " , the observers would still be alive , a diplomat familiar with the report said .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has expressed " deep regrets " over the deaths .
Israel is conducting an investigation into the incident .
It has rejected accusations made by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan that the targeting of the UN position was " apparently deliberate " .
White House spokesman Tony Snow said " something went really wrong " to cause the deaths , but also said there was no reason to suggest the bombing was deliberate .
The UN Security Council is meeting to discuss the incident .
' Utmost urgency '
The Rome summit , called by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , brought together EU and Arab nations plus the US and Russia , but not Israel , Iran or Syria .
Images from the Middle East as the conflict enters a third week
In pictures
It also said a ceasefire " must be lasting , permanent and sustainable " .
The statement called for an international force with a UN mandate for south Lebanon , and the full implementation of existing UN Security Council resolutions calling for the disarming of militias and deployment of Lebanese troops in the border region .
Mr Annan said it was important to work with the countries of the region , including Syria and Iran , to find a solution to the crisis .
But Condoleezza
Rice was critical of the role of both countries .
" It 's not a question of talking to Syria , it 's whether Syria 's prepared to act , " she said .
In an impassioned speech , Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora warned that more people would die if the ceasefire was delayed , and called for a Lebanese - Israeli prisoner exchange as part of plan to end the fighting .
Like many tech - savvy professionals , Howard Chui was fascinated by his first mobile phone , which he acquired in 2000 .
He plumbed every menu on his Sony Clearnet PCS handset , looking for hidden capabilities .
His interest developed into obsession when he graduated to a Nokia 5190 in 2002 .
The Canadian sysadmin started sharing ringtones and backgrounds with friends and then writing about his passion at ( where else ? ) www.howardchui.com.
Chui fielded questions from readers , but he soon found himself inundated .
" I figured it would be useful if people asked questions on a forum , " he says , " so everyone could benefit from the answers . "
HowardForums was born .
HowardForums.com hosts discussions devoted to niches within a niche .
Conversations are broken down by carrier and manufacturer – Cingular , Motorola , Nokia , and so on .
Within those sections are subsections on subjects like troubleshooting and modding , and within those are threads on specific topics like Rokr firmware and Verizon 's customer service .
How many people could possibly be interested in content with such pinpoint focus ?
A very large number , as it happens .
A post on the new Motorola SLVR has racked up about 250,000 pageviews in less than a year .
The site served more than 250 million pageviews in 2005 , and it's on track to break 300 million in 2006 .
In short , Chui has discovered a meganiche .
I define a meganiche as a thin slice of the Web that nonetheless represents roughly a million users .
The meganiche is something new , and it will have a lasting impact on online business and culture .
For most of the past decade , the basic strategy for building a successful Web site was encapsulated in the phrase " Get big , get niche , or get out . "
You could appeal to a broad constituency , with all the blandness and generality that implies ( think Yahoo ) , or you could target a tightly focused group that was far smaller but easier to reach and more loyal than a mass audience ( think Slashdot ) .
Getting big would yield high volume and low margins , while getting niche would bring the inverse .
Getting out was what you were forced to do if you ended up stuck somewhere between the other two approaches .
That was when 36 million people were online .
Now that more than a billion people have access to the Web , there is no longer a trade - off between size and specificity .
The basic math is simple : A tiny piece of an immense pie is huge .
A decade ago , reaching one - tenth of 1 percent of Web users amounted to 36,000 people , a number that compared favorably with the circulation of , say , the daily newspaper in Bridgewater , New Jersey .
Back then , reaching a million users required a decidedly mainstream offering ( Amazon.com and MSN come to mind ) .
Now , getting niche can be the path to getting big ; one - tenth of 1 percent of today 's Web audience is a million people .
Forget Bridgewater – the Net is chockablock with special - interest sites and services you 've never heard of but whose user base exceeds the print circulation of The Washington Post .
HowardForums.com has a full - time staff of two – Chui and his wife – and 40 volunteer moderators .
Revenue , which Chui declines to reveal , comes from several forms of advertising : banners , Google ads , and certain threads that operate as commercial marketplaces .
As for marketing the site , it 's all word of mouth .
" People in the [ cell phone ] business refer their own customers to the forums when they can't answer a question , " Chui says .
Cell users hardly constitute a niche market – after all , mobile penetration in the US , Europe , and Asia averages nearly 70 percent .
But a small portion of cell users , it turns out , want to get more deeply into their phones than manufacturers are accustomed to – they want to enable Bluetooth file - sharing or reprogram the firmware .
Users do n't come to HowardForums.com because it can answer every question .
They come because they can get answers to every question on a particular , narrow subject .
Meganiche sites are often based on a mainstream topic , but they carve it into divisions that the market as a whole may barely recognize .
Gaia Online , for instance , is a community of anime fans – but not just any anime fans .
It appeals to those who want not only to watch Japanese animation but to share their enthusiasm and creativity in ways that broadcast media does n't allow .
Gaia 's cartoon - laden pages suggest a cross between a bulletin board and a massively multiplayer online role - playing game .
Users make their own wide - eyed avatars to take part in forums , guilds , and games and to share original artwork and stories .
Founded in 2003 , the site began as a list of links .
Today it has more than 4 million registered users .
At any given moment , thousands of fans are uploading original hand - drawn images ( the site holds 100,000 and counting ) , sharing fan fiction ( hundreds of original stories are posted each month ) , chatting ( 700 million messages ) , and exchanging in - world items for Gaia gold ( purchased through a secondary market on eBay , natch ) .
If you have n't heard of Gaia , there are good reasons .
Despite its size , the site has limited appeal .
Anime role - playing and tutorials on how to sketch girls with really big eyes do n't hold much interest for , oh , 99.9 percent of the Web 's population .
The remaining 0.1 percent , though , is the kind of audience VC - backed sites spent millions to court – and mostly failed to capture – during the dotcom boom .
Gaia can amass a large , committed audience at little cost because it does n't try to be all things to all people .
As a result , the site does n't need to advertise to the general public to reach its audience .
Another reason you may not have heard of Gaia is that media culture has n't caught up to media itself .
People often still assume that TV shows are more popular than Web sites .
This was true in the early days of the Web , when the sheer brand power of a traditional network , studio , or print outlet could pull a bigger crowd than an online upstart .
But as the Web has matured , it has begun to draw its own audiences , and they can be sizable .
Gaia attracted nearly a million unique users in August 2006 , according to Media Metrix 's comScore service – on par with the numbers for the mass - market sites RollingStone.com and MaximOnline.com .
Counting pageviews makes for a more dramatic comparison .
Gaia 's monthly pageviews per user ( 25.7 per visit ) beat not just RollingStone.com ( 2.9 ) but MSNBC.com ( 1.8 ) and Oprah.com ( 6.9 ) , according to Amazon 's Alexa service .
If you get the niche right , the audience is not only large and inexpensive but active and loyal as well .
As bewildering as Gaia may be to those who are n't captivated by spike - haired cartoon characters , at least its niche is recognizable .
Anime fans with an inclination to invest their personality in a customized avatar , and the spare time to create stories and artwork , are at least a definable demographic group .
But the meganiche phenomenon is n't confined to vertical categories like type - A cell phone owners and rabid anime fans .
Meganiches can address any interest , even one that users themselves would n't have thought of until they stumbled across a captivating Web page .
Consider YTMND.com .
The letters stand for " You 're the man now , dog , " a Sean Connery line from the formulaic feel - good flick Finding Forrester , released in 2000 .
Amused by the notion of a septuagenarian Scotsman using ghetto slang , Max Goldberg , then a 19 - year - old programmer , created a Web page celebrating the line and posted it at www.yourethemannowdog.com.
The layout was as simple as it was nonsensical : a still from the movie overlaid with a 3 - D font treatment of the phrase , which Goldberg soon gilded with an audioclip of the actor 's declamation .
It was just a stupid jab at a stupid movie , but it caught on .
" One day I checked my stats and saw the site was getting a few thousand people a day , " Goldberg recalls .
" I was amazed .
Then a few friends took the HTML code for www.yourethemannowdog.com and changed the text , image , and sound to make something similar but new . "
In effect , Goldberg had accidentally invented a new online art form flexible enough to inspire people whose sole commonality was a sense of the absurd .
" That 's when I decided to create YTMND.com . "
YTMND.com now hosts thousands of user - created Web pages , known as YTMNDs , that combine a background image , a sound clip , and rudimentary animation .
The effect is often comic but frequently inexplicable , the ultimate inside joke .
You might not think an animated hand drawing breasts on a comic - book heroine to a snippet of A - Ha 's " Take On Me " is much of a knee slapper , but a surprising number of people can't get enough – which , of course , is the very definition of a meganiche .
YTMND.com gets millions of unique visitors a month , more than 100,000 of whom have contributed YTMNDs .
Supported entirely by Google ads , Goldberg does all the system administration but mainly tries to stay out of the way .
" The site sort of runs itself , " he says .
His success illustrates an unexpected dimension of the meganiche 's power :
What begins as an isolated sarcastic gesture can become the world 's biggest inside joke .
I first encountered the meganiche concept by chance : I was examining the top few thousand sites listed by Alexa .
Once I had culled the well - known media outlets , famous brands , Web marketing firms , and porn venues , I was left with an unfamiliar , difficult - to - characterize residue .
There were focused communities ( HowardForums and Gaia , plus sites like CollarMe , LifeTips , and SwapperNet ) , silly diversions ( Consumption Junction , Funny Junk , I - Am - Bored.com , Shoosh Time ) , narrow commercial offerings ( NextPimp , YachtWorld ) , and creative forums ( 4Chan , FanFiction.net , and YTMND.com ) .
Many of these sites are unconventional in their approach , content , and design , but all garner substantial traffic .
And traffic means potential revenue , which makes the meganiche a good business bet as well as a cultural phenomenon .
User - generated content is the Web - biz buzzword of the day , and meganiche sites tend to produce lots of it .
These sites manufacture huge amounts of new online real estate – perfect for cheap , automated ads .
What drives revenue is n't the quality of the content but the volume of pages .
Not long ago , advertisers shied away from user - generated pages .
A banner on Tripod 's homepage was OK , but no self - respecting advertiser would risk putting his shiny brand next to chat or fan fiction , much less snapshots of a college freshman barfing at his first beer bash .
But that 's changing .
Google 's AdSense program brought to the Web a less brand - conscious style of advertising and a pool of advertisers who do n't view the online environment as an extension of print , with its concerns about the way an ad might clash with an editorial page .
Suddenly a site that depends on user contributions can have a business model .
Given the appealing characteristics of meganiche sites – cheap to build and run , attractive to a large , loyal user base – it's tempting to think they might trigger the next online gold rush .
However , the days of million - user sites built on a whim may already be over .
Gaia , HowardForums , and YTMND all launched at least a few years ago .
They began as hobbies , starting out niche and growing mega over time .
Unfortunately for anyone hoping to replicate this strategy , the competitive landscape has evolved since then .
The arrival of advertising money increases the incentive to create such sites by design rather than let them evolve .
( Exhibit A : MySpace . )
Furthermore , the Internet 's hyperinflationary era is over .
The online population grew by two orders of magnitude in the last decade ; during that time , a site that held its own against competitors could see its audience multiply automatically .
But at a billion or so users , the Net wo n't grow another order of magnitude , ever .
Future HowardForums and Gaias will gain new members only by diverting their attention from other sites .
However the competitive pressures play out , meganiches will be a permanent part of the landscape .
Between the one - size - fits - all Wikipedia and the West Iceland Tourist Guide , thousands of sites will serve audiences numbering in the hundreds of thousands or millions .
The mainstream will still exist , but it will be joined by innumerable meganiches , each a reflection of the often baffling diversity of human interests and tastes – and a reminder that even the most idiosyncratic Netizen can share an in - joke with his million best friends .

How two math geeks with a lava lamp and a webcam are about to unleash chaos on the Internet .
Here 's a random thought : " Everything we do to achieve privacy and security in the computer age depends on random numbers . "
So says Simon Cooper , an encryption expert and author of Building Internet Firewalls .
Random number sequences have been around for 4,000 years , but never have they been in such demand .
That 's because they 're the building blocks of cryptography .
Every time you establish an SSL connection to , say , E*Trade , there 's a string of digits working hard behind the scenes .
As many as 368 bits of random data go into creating the connection - 128 bits to make encryption keys , the rest for authentication codes and the prevention of replay attacks - that 's necessary whenever you send your credit card information over an ecommerce site 's " secure server " or exchange medical records with your insurance company online .
Even the secrecy of the messages whizzing between military commanders in the Middle East depends on random numbers .
A sequence is considered random if no patterns can be recognized in it - the longer the string , the stronger the encryption .
Producing these combinations is a painstaking process .
Just ask Landon Noll .
The 42 - year - old mathematician and cryptographer for computer security firm SystemExperts has been tinkering with random number generators , or RNGs , for nearly a decade - an exercise in bringing order to chaos .
" There 's a lot of beauty in chaos , " Noll says .
" The Grand Canyon would n't be so popular if it was just a uniform trench .
The trick is controlling and managing chaos and turning it into something useful . "
In 1996 , Noll and two colleagues at Silicon Graphics came up with Lavarand , a patented system that used Lava Lites to help generate random numbers .
( Patent 5,732,138 : " Method for seeding a pseudo - random number generator with a cryptographic hash of a digitization of a chaotic system . " )
The Web site attracted millions of visitors .
Some came for the shagadelic views of lava lamps in full gurgle ; others for a peek at the physics and math being used to generate random seeds .
Now Noll is working with Cooper on an improved RNG called LavaRnd ( which debuted in May at www.lavarnd.org).
The new process replaces the lava lamps with a more Zen - like source of entropy : a webcam with its lens cap on .
The chaotic thermal " noise " emitted by the webcam is digitized and put through a hash algorithm that churns the number set , stripping unwanted sections of predictability .
The result is a cryptographically strong sequence of numbers , ready for use in the real world .
And because the new service is open source , patent - free , and license - free , anyone will be able to cheaply build and operate a LavaRnd server and receive the precious commodity free of charge - a random act of kindness .
Noll has always been fascinated with numbers .
He 's made several prime - and perfect - number discoveries , and at one time held or coheld nine prime number - related world records .
He codiscovered the 25th and 26th Mersenne primes , which , if you 're keeping score at home , are 221701 - 1 and 223209 - 1 , respectively .
With LavaRnd , Noll is letting others get in on the mathematical fun .
" We 're trying to give people the ability to generate random numbers themselves , " he says .
" The webcam is a low - cost , readily available stimulus that 's not predictable .
Producing good random numbers is hard .
Anyone who says it 's easy is usually doing it wrong . "
In popular discourse , people often use the word random to describe things that are n't random at all .
The Random button on a CD player , for example , falls woefully short of its name .
When you press it , you never hear the same song twice or three times or even ten times in a row , which would have to be possible in a truly random set .
( Some CD players more accurately label the function Shuffle . )
Random access memory in a computer is n't random , and that 's a good thing .
RAM is organized and controlled in a way that lets data be stored and retrieved efficiently to and from specific locations .
A better name might be nonsequential memory .
True randomness is a stern taskmaster .
Random number strings must have no built - in trends or biases .
A value generated at a given time should n't be correlated in any way with previous values .
A hacker trying to determine the next digit in a true random - number sequence will find it computationally infeasible .
The first RNGs were dice .
They date back to ancient Sumeria and Egypt , and were used as the key element in games of chance .
As RNGs go , dice are pretty efficient .
As long as they are n't loaded , or the environment is n't otherwise altered to favor certain outcomes , throwing dice produces a reliable stream of random numbers .
The problem is low output .
You can generate the numbers only as fast as you can throw - making , say , a craps game an impractical means for generating large strings .
In the 20th century , the demand for random numbers exploded .
Pollsters use the sequences to help select representative samples of the public ; scientists to model chaotic molecular behavior ; physicists to conduct simulations of nuclear detonations .
Random numbers also play a crucial role in lotteries and gambling .
As recently as 100 years ago , people who needed random numbers for scientific work still tossed coins , rolled dice , dealt cards , picked numbers out of hats , or browsed census records for lists of digits .
In 1927 , statistician L.H.C.
Tippett published a table of 41,600 random numbers obtained by taking the middle digits from area measurements of English churches .
In 1955 , the Rand Corporation published A Million Random Numbers With 100,000 Normal Deviates , a massive tome filled with tables of random numbers .
To remove slight biases discovered in the course of testing , the million digits were further randomized by adding all pairs and retaining only the last digit .
The Rand book became a standard reference , still used today in low - level applications such as picking precincts to poll .
But when large ecommerce sites gobble millions of random digits every day to encrypt information , leafing through a book of tables does n't cut it .
What 's needed is a high - output generator that can plumb mere disorder and extract true randomness - a task , incidentally , beyond the reach of any computer on earth .
Computers make lousy RNGs .
A digital device can be programmed to scramble the bits of a number in such a way that the result appears to be unrelated to previously generated numbers .
But computers are , by design , deterministic ; they merely follow set procedures .
Start a new process from the same place , and a pattern emerges .
Such systems are often referred to as pseudo - random number generators .
RNGs attempt to get around this shortcoming by generating seeds from a number of seemingly unpredictable sources .
However , the fact that these seed sources usually are n't random means the system is still more vulnerable to attack than a random source .
In the late 1990s , security experts discovered that Netscape 's RNG seed was derived from just three quantities : the time of day , the process ID , and the parent process ID .
An adversary could predict those values and apply a common algorithm to compute the exact seed generated .
A better approach is to include a wholly unpredictable source of entropy as part of the hardware , the way Intel has done with its 800 - series chips .
A built - in RNG samples thermal noise given off by resistors .
Radio - active elements also make great sources of entropy , since - by the laws of quantum mechanics - the rate at which radioactive sources decay is completely unpredictable .
One random - number service , called HotBits ( www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits), run by Autodesk founder John Walker , employs a Geiger counter trained on a capsule of krypton - 85 .
Visitors to the site can even order numbers online .
Another service , Random.org , uses as its entropy source atmospheric noise from two secondhand radios tuned to different frequencies .
Mads Haahr , a lecturer in computer science at Trinity College in Dublin , designed the system , which generates about 111 million random bits a day .
Steady customers include Danish TV2 , which uses the numbers for its online backgammon service ; Technician , an American rock band , which employs them to generate unique covers for its CDs ; and an undisclosed US military lab , for an undisclosed purpose .
Random numbers are also available on CD .
In 1996 , Florida State University computer scientist George Marsaglia produced a disc containing about 5 billion random bits divided into sixty 10 - Mbyte files .
Marsaglia generated the bits by combining three sources of electronic white noise with the output from a RNG .
Landon Noll 's new LavaRnd process ranks among the best RNGs .
It can produce 165,000 bits of random data per second , more than twice the output of Intel 's RNG , plenty fast enough to meet most demands .
Coded in C and Perl , a LavaRnd server also comes cheap .
Call it randomness for the masses - and you do n't even have to buy lava lamps .
" It 's too bad we do n't use the Lava Lites anymore .
They 're so cool to look at , " says Noll .
" But replacing the bulbs got to be a real problem . "
For old times ' sake , Noll and Simon include shots of the lamps in glorious disorder on the site .
They serve as a useful reminder of the thick , gooey randomness most of us unknowingly rely on to drive the modern world .

The Bush administration has blocked release of a report that suggests global warming is contributing to the frequency and strength of hurricanes , the journal Nature reported Tuesday .
The possibility that warming conditions may cause storms to become stronger has generated debate among climate and weather experts , particularly in the wake of the Hurricane Katrina disaster .
In the new case , Nature said weather experts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - part of the Commerce Department - in February set up a seven - member panel to prepare a consensus report on the views of agency scientists about global warming and hurricanes .

Another important feature of Firefox is it 's standards - compliant rendering engine .
Firefox 's page rendering has proven to be very close to the official W3C behavior and display recommendations .
Consequently , web pages that render correctly in Firefox usually work reasonably , if not perfectly , in most other browsers with only minor adjustments .
Built - In Firefox Web Development Tools Firefox comes with several standard tools that are built into the browser .
By themselves , these tools are powerful enough to consider Firefox an essential web development tool .
These tools include :
An expanded page source viewer .
The ability to display detailed information about a web page .
A JavaScript debugging tool .
A real - time DOM inspector and editor .
Viewing the Source of a Page Like most browsers , Firefox provides the ability to view the source of a page .
Firefox offers a different twist , though .
Instead of sending the source code to an external text editor , Firefox uses its own source viewer with syntax highlighting and color coding of the html tags .
When content on a web page is highlighted , Firefox also offers the option to view the selected source by opening a version of the source code view , with the selection 's markup highlighted in the source .
This makes it easier to find a specific section of a web page in the overall source code .
Quick Tip
You can view the source of a page by choosing " View > Page Source " through the menu system or by choosing View Page Source form the context menu ( keyboard shortcut Ctrl - U ) .
You can view only part of the source of a page by highlighting a portion of the web page and then right - clicking to bring up the context menu and choosing " View Selection Source " .
Page Info Reports Firefox provides detailed information about a page through the Page Info window .
The General tab displays information about the page such as url , size , and rendering mode .
The Form tab displays the forms on the page and details about the fields in the forms .
The Links tab lists the links in the page , including hyperlinks and style sheets .
The Media tab contains information about all media on the page , such as images and favicons .
Quick Tip
You can access the Page Info window from " Tools > Page Info " or by right - clicking on the page and selecting " View Page Info " from the context menu .
Javascript Console
The Javascript Console is a tool for JavaScript developers to write and test javascript code snippets or external JS files .
The console provides an interface to use XPCOM components , a means for dynamic script loading , and the reporting of Javascript related and CSS errors in the web page .
DOM Inspector The DOM Inspector provides direct access to the Document Object Model .
For each element , the inspector provides a list of information including which CSS rules are affecting any given element in order of their cascade priority .
For quick access to the DOM for a selected element , you can also install the Inspect Element extension .
Quick Tip Firefox comes with the DOM inspector , but on Windows machines , you need to choose it when you first install the browser .
To do this choose " Custom Install " and then select " Web Developer Tools " .
Once installed , the Firefox DOM Inspector is under the Tools menu .
Firefox Web Development Extensions
In addition to the built in developer tools , Firefox provides the ability to add additional web development functionality through the use of add - on programs called extensions .
Some of the most useful extensions are described in the following slides .
Many more developer extensions are available on the Mozilla update site .
Look under the developer tools submenu to find additional web developer extensions .
The Web Developer Extension
This extension , by itself , makes Firefox an indispensable tool for Web development and testing .
The Web Developer Extension adds a toolbar to the browser containing various web developer tools .
It outlines page elements , displays the size of images , gives CSS and form information , disables certain elements on a page , and much more .
Accessibility Accessibility Extensions for Firefox helps in the testing of a page 's structural markup to meet the needs of people with disabilities .
Fangs gives a textual representation of a page , similar to the way it is read by a screen reader .
For more accessibility testing try the Accessibar Firefox extension or the Web Developer Extension .
Colors Colorzilla is an eyedropper tool .
Hovering over an element shows color info , DOM path info , and the X , Y offset from the previous click .
Cookies The Add & Edit Cookies extension allows for the adding and editing on cookies to a page .
This extension is a more featured version of the View Cookies extension .
CSS
The CSSViewer inspects elements on a page to give a complete rundown of the CSS declaration for a chosen element .
Aardvark is a CSS debugger with keyboard modifiers .
It displays items on the page such as the element name and id or class name of a selected element .
Quick Tip
For the Aardvark extension , as you glide the mouse over the page , you will see a red rectangle framing each element under the cursor .
You will also see a little yellow caption showing the HTML element type and its class or id if they exist .
Debugging Firebug helps in debugging AJAX , DHTML , and JavaScript web applications .
It will display errors that occur during the rendering of a page , will place the pointer on the appropriate line , and allows for the inspection of different values of the DOM .
Links LinkChecker checks every link on a web page to find bad links .
The simple color coding scheme makes it easy to quickly spot a bad link on a page .
Measurements MeasureIt draws a ruler across a web page to display the width , height , or alignment of any page element .
Page Information
The Extended Statusbar extension adds information to the status bar displaying the average download speed , bytes downloaded , load time , number of loaded images and percentage of the page loaded .
It is similar to Opera 's status bar .
The MetaTags Sidebar extension displays information from the source code , such as the code lying between the tags like description , keywords , and links .
tags like description , keywords , and links .
Page Parameters Live HTTP
Headers displays information about the HTTP headers on a page in real time .
UrlParams is a sidebar extension that displays the form parameters Firefox has sent to the server on the last request .
It will also let you change or add parameters and re-submit the request .
User Agents User Agent Switcher allows Firefox to identify itself as a different web browser , such as IE or Opera , to a web server .
Validation HTML
Validator adds HTML validation inside Firefox 's source viewer .
View Pages in Other Browsers IE
Tab is an extension that launchers your URL in Internet Explorer inside of a Firefox tab .
A simple time saver when checking pages for cross - browser compatibility .
IE View allows the current page or a selected link to be opened in the Internet Explorer browser .
OperaView provides the same functionality for the Opera web browser .
In addition , Firefox View allows you to open Firefox to the current page or selected link from within Internet Explorer .
Firefox Bookmarklets Bookmarklets ( favlets ) are small JavaScript programs that are stored as a URL within a browser 's bookmark and add additional functionality to the browser .
While most of what bookmarklets can due are already bundled into extensions , two good sources of bookmarklets can be found at Slayer Office and Square Free .
The Slayer Office Favlet Suite is particularly useful to show things such as a list of colors on a page or to change hidden fields on a form .
Firefox Developer Tools Extensions
In addition to extensions which help a developer to code and test a page there a several Firefox extensions that are designed to complement / replace various desktop development tools .
These extensions provide an interesting alternative to software such as Filezilla or Nvu .
Editors Codetch is a code editor for various markup languages .
It emulates many of the features seen in Dreamweaver into a editor inside of Firefox .
FTP Fireftp is a FTP client which allows for easy access to a FTP server .
Images MozImage is a simple image viewer and browser .
Screenshots The Pearl Crescent Page Saver saves an image of a web page to a file in PNG format .
The Page Saver extension uses the new canvas feature that was introduced in Firefox 1.5 .
The Screen Grab extension takes a screenshot of a web page in several different ways .
Most importantly , it allows you to capture the entire web document that you are viewing .
( Fortune Magazine ) -- Tucked away in the briefcase of Liz Ann Sonders , chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Co. , is a chart so scary she 's hesitant to show it to investors .
It plots the National Association of Home Builders ' Housing Market index - a monthly measure of builder confidence - against the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock market index , with a one - year lag .
It turns out that the mood of builders is a terrific stock market bellwether :
The correlation between current builder confidence and future stock market returns over the past ten years is downright unnerving .
Not only did the NAHB index presage the start of the post - 1994 bull market in stocks , but its decline starting in 1999 foreshadowed the equity market collapse that came the following year .
Builder confidence rebounded in November 2001 - a year ahead of the stock market upswing that began in October 2002 .
Why is Sonders worried now ?
Just look at the chart .
Over the past year , the NAHB housing index plummeted 54 percent .
Were stocks to follow suit , the S&P - 1400 in late October - would be trading below 700 this time next year .
Sonders is n't predicting anything so apocalyptic , but she does n't hide her concern about housing and her pessimism about stocks .
" In terms of consumer spending , I do n't think we 've felt anywhere near the brunt of all the adjustable - rate - mortgage resets and the massive increase in defaults and foreclosures in states like California , " she says .
" Housing downturns happen in a fairly slow - motion way , and I really think we 're just at the beginning of the impact on the market and the economy . "
The latest omen : GDP grew at its slowest pace in three years in the third quarter , hurt by the housing slump .
Such bearishness flies in the face of the euphoria now rampant on Wall Street .
The Dow Jones industrial average keeps hitting new highs , and the S&P is a stone 's throw away from its own record ( although in inflation - adjusted terms , they 're still below their peaks ) .
Third - quarter earnings ?
One report seems better than the next , with key companies like Google ( 92 percent profit growth ) , IBM ( 54 percent ) , and Bank of America ( 41 percent ) all posting stellar numbers .
" The effects of the housing correction will be entirely contained within the housing sector , " says Mike Englund , chief economist of Action Economics .
Corporate balance sheets are stronger than they 've been in years , with U.S. companies sitting on $ 600 billion in cash .
Interest rates are stable , and may decline .
Falling energy prices are easing the burden on energy - intensive industries like chemicals and airlines .
And as PNC chief investment strategist Jeff Kleintop points out , there have been only two midterm election years since World War II when the stock market did not stage a fourth - quarter rally .
The bulls ' bottom line : Housing may be a risk factor , but there 's too much other good news for it to be the catalyst for a recession or stock market meltdown .
That may turn out to be wishful thinking .
All the economic activity generated by home sales - new mortgages , realtor fees , outlays to painters and handymen , the inevitable shopping trips to Home Depot and Best Buy - played a huge part in digging the economy out of a recession in 2001 and 2002 .
Given the importance of home sales on the way up , it may be shortsighted to minimize their importance on the way down .
" The historical record is extremely negative in terms of what comes next , " says economist Ed Leamer , director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast .
" We 've had 11 sharp declines in the housing market since World War II , including this one .
Eight of the last ten were followed by a recession . "
For now , there 's little hard evidence that the housing slowdown is dragging down the economy .
Construction materials like concrete , wallboard and structural steel should be the canaries in the economic coal mine , yet their prices keep climbing .
Construction - related employment has been rising too - up fractionally from August to September and up 3 percent over the past 12 months , according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics .
But folks in the trenches paint a much darker picture , lending credence to the idea that we 're living through the lag - the period before the realities on the street show up in economists ' spreadsheets .
Business is so bad for real estate brokers that Steve Murray , a realty consultant and publisher of the Real Trends newsletter , thinks the industry might end up paring 15 percent of its workforce .
That equates to 200,000 agents , which is more than the total layoffs at Ford Motor Co. since 2000 .
" I do n't think the macro statistics reflect accurately what 's going on in many local markets , " says Bruce Karatz , CEO of national home - builder KB Home .
In many once - hot regions , order cancellation rates are running above 40 percent , new - home sales volume has dropped 50 percent , and new - home prices are down 10 percent to 25 percent .
Karatz says the current downturn is worse than any he has seen - even the early 1990s market that left so many big builders reeling .
If housing starts and sales were the only casualty , the economy probably would n't be in such peril .
Gary Gordon , an executive vice president at mortgage investment firm Annaly Capital and a former chief U.S. equity strategist at UBS , expects construction to fall to 4 percent of gross domestic product from 6 percent today - itself not enough to push the economy ( now growing at a 2.6 percent annual rate ) into recession .
The big risk is the ripple effect .
Consider Annamarie and James Vasiloff , a New Castle , N.Y. , couple who until recently had been shopping for a bigger home .
Had they found the right one , Annamarie says , they were prepared to spend a few thousand dollars on new furniture .
But frustrated with high prices and worried that real estate was about to crash , they put their home search on hold .
Housing turnover is a leading indicator of furniture sales , which is why analysts keep trimming earnings estimates for home furnishing retailers like Pier 1 and Ethan Allen .
Another big concern is what happens if consumers can't keep using their homes as cash machines .
By Gordon 's estimate , U.S. homeowners pulled more than $ 450 billion in equity out of their homes last year and are on pace for a similar bonanza in 2006 .
But with home values falling , homeowners may lose that source of ready spending money .
Should cash - out refinancings fall back to 2001 levels , he estimates , it would drain $ 300 billion from the economy - which would have roughly the same impact as a $ 60 jump in the price of a barrel of oil .
And that does n't include the added bite when homeowners who took out adjustable - rate mortgages a couple of years ago face rate resets that raise their payments .
It 's hard to overstate the damage of losing so much potential buying power .
Merrill Lynch economist David Rosenberg has argued that cash - out refis were the only reason the economy weathered the gas - price hikes this year and last .
Gordon is so worried about the disappearance of cash - out refi money that he 's predicting a recession in 2007 or 2008 .
When stock investors hear dire warnings like this , one natural response is to get defensive .
That 's tricky when some signals - namely equity markets hitting new highs - are bullish .
The smartest ( and safest ) way to protect a portfolio against a real - estate - fueled slowdown may be to shift some assets to intermediate - term bonds ( which would benefit if the Federal Reserve starts cutting rates next year to spur growth ) .
A more aggressive tactic would be to start bargain hunting among troubled housing stocks .
This approach is obviously for only the patient and steely - nerved .
Even some badly battered stocks may have further to fall , while others have n't been battered enough .
With that caution in mind , here 's a look at the prospects for seven prominent stocks in three housing - related sectors .
Homebuilders
Stocks like KB Home ( Charts ) , DH Horton ( Charts ) , and Lennar ( Charts ) are all trading at four or five times their earnings for the past 12 months - making homebuilding the cheapest sector in the S&P 500 .
Problem is , P / Es are meaningless if you can't predict the " E . "
Bruce Karatz , KB's CEO , thinks it will be next summer at the earliest before homebuilders work through all existing inventory .
In the meantime , he 's hopeful that a big upswing in free cash flow - builders have essentially stopped buying new land - will get companies like KB back into Wall Street 's good graces .
If not , do n't be surprised if some builders emerge as takeover candidates .
One investor to keep an eye on is Warren Buffett .
His company , Berkshire Hathaway , has been nibbling around the edge of the housing industry for years , with various acquisitions .
A bargain - priced homebuilder would fit nicely into Berkshire 's portfolio - something that has occurred to Karatz , though he hastens to add he is not talking to Berkshire about selling KBH .
" I 'm very good friends with [ Berkshire vice chairman ] Charlie Munger , and I just know he 's a very astute student of real estate markets , " says Karatz .
Mortgage lenders
With homebuilders , an argument can at least be made that much bad news is already priced into their stocks .
The same can't be said of mortgage lenders .
This year , shares of Washington Mutual ( Charts ) and Countrywide Financial ( Charts ) have returned 3 percent and 11 percent , respectively , despite questions about how they 'll fare during the housing downturn .
Not only is there the likelihood of declining : mortgage and home - equity - loan origination but they face increased credit risks as well , particularly if a weakening economy sparks defaults .
UBS analyst Eric Wasserstrom is already predicting a 40 percent increase in credit losses at Washington Mutual in 2007 .
Countrywide Financial is even more mortgage - dependent than WaMu .
Bank of America analyst Robert Lacoursiere , who has a neutral rating on WaMu , calls Countrywide a sell , citing a cooling housing market and the likely downturn in mortgage originations .
So we 'd avoid these stocks for now .
Home - improvement stores
We recently recommended Home Depot ( Charts ) as a potential long - term play for patient investors .
Trading at 11 times estimated 2007 earnings , the stock already reflects a lot of pessimism .
While the price may drop further - the company 's earnings tend to rise and fall with home sales - Home Depot is using its ample cash to revamp stores , make strategic acquisitions , repurchase stock , and boost its dividend .
Home Depot 's archrival Lowe's ( Charts ) has its own virtues , including brighter , friendlier - looking stores .
The stock is trading at 14 times this year 's estimated earnings , its lowest valuation since 1991 .
Lowe 's smaller size - 1,300 stores nationwide , vs. 2,100 for Home Depot - makes it easier to open new stores without cannibalizing existing ones .
And according to Morgan Stanley analyst Gregory Melich , Lowe's has significantly less exposure than Home Depot to extreme " bubble markets " like San Diego and Miami .
Analysts expect Lowe's to earn $ 2.20 a share this year .
Were the market to bump Lowe 's P/E back to 18 , that would translate to a share price of $ 40 , up from $ 30 today .
Some real estate stocks are still sizzling
The housing market may be sagging , but you would n't know it from the stellar performance this year of real estate investment trusts .
Some of the big winners : Equity Office Properties ( EOP ) and Vornado Realty Trust ( VNO ) have both gained 39 percent ; Simon Property Group ( SPG ) is up 26 percent .
REIT Mutual funds like Cohen & Steers Realty ( CSRSX . ) have soared as well .
Most REITs fall into one of two categories - office REITs that own and manage commercial properties and residential REITs that specialize in apartment buildings .
Office REITs are benefiting from the flood of private - equity money bidding up building prices .
The impact of private equity has been less pronounced on the apartment side , but there the cooling housing market has actually helped , encouraging more people to rent rather than buy .
The problem is , REIT share prices have been rising faster than earnings .
As a result , the rich dividend yields that are REITs ' calling cards are n't so rich anymore , with Equity Office Properties and Vornado yielding 3.1 percent and 2.8 percent , down from their ten - year averages of 6.4 percent and 4.8 percent , respectively .
The last time Equity Office 's yield was this low was early 1998 , a year the stock fell 16 percent .

Fixing a real - estate heavy portfolio
PataPata critique : the good , the bad , the ugly
by Paul FernhoutNovember 26 , 2006
It 's been about three months from my last post to the PataPata list as well as my last major change to the system .
I have been thinking about the system in the intervening time , and feel ready to produce a critique of it as an experiment ( sort of as a , sadly , " postmortem " report ) .
Others are welcome to chime in .
This critique covers various good , bad , and ugly results from this experiment , and then outlines some thoughts on where to go next .
This note marks the end of this phase of the PataPata experiment .
I am uncertain if this project on SourceForge will see more development , but I am certain if there is more development on this particular SourceForge project , it will likely be in a radically different direction than the work published here to date.== THE GOOD ==Overall , I think PataPata was a success as an experiment -- meaning I learned something from it .
That 's the value of an experiment -- to test reality and learn something new or confirm something old .
I tried to make a real prototype - based system on top of Python / Jython for use in educational software and I learned much about the strengths and weaknesses of such an approach .
So , in that sense , PataPata was a resounding success and probably worth the several person - months I ( and indirectly some others ) put into it .
I think PataPata advanced some ideas of being able to write out a world of live objects to text files as a human - readable program to reconstruct that world .
I 'm very happy with how that works and the potential it shows .
You can both have a live world of objects and convert it back and forth to human - readable Python source whenever you want it .
There are some gotchas , but in general it works .
Some of those ideas ( like naming instances to write out ) were inspired by PythonCard .
I was very pleased with how PataPata handled having multiple worlds , especially with how you could use a inspector tool in one world to change a window in another world .
So , in some way , you were " safe " if you broke that other world , in that you could still inspect it and fix it again .
This is unlike how in a typical Smalltalk image you can shoot yourself in the foot by , say , breaking the Window " open " method ( so debuggers and error notifiers and development tools also fail to open , so you can;t fix the problem ) .
It 's not a new idea from PataPata ( since some Smalltalks do this , or wanted to , and later versions of Python 's IDLE IDE do something like this ) , but I did like the result in PataPata , and I think it is not implemented often enough .
Wrapping widgets from TK , Swing , wxWidgets worked out fairly well ; the results were both better than I expected and easier to achieve than I thought .
I think this shows you can both use native widgets and have a cross - platform codebase at least for the basic widgets to make 90 % of an interface -- with only a few sacrifices and a little extra work .
To my knowledge , I think PataPata is the only system that supports ( to the limited extent it does ) both Swing and TK -- the native widgets of Python and Jython respectively .
I was very happy about that success considering the modest investment of time .
I think other systems , perhaps PythonCard , could benefit from considering this approach .
I think the hierarchical browser for looking at both the data and code of objects in one window worked out well .
I 'd seen similar things before , so this is not a unique innovation to PataPata ; this is just to say once again this still looks like a good idea to me .
Finally , I was very happy that Francois Schnell made a screencast of an early version of PataPata .
I learned a lot from that -- especially in terms of the power of screencast movies to get a complex idea ( building a GUI with prototypes ) across in a short time .
Thank you again , Francois.== THE BAD ==As an actual product , for the moment , PataPata has to be rated as a failure .
It is not usable for production code because it is not complete or well tested or well documented or IMHO providing enough bang for the buck of using it .
There are aspects of its overall approach I now question .
I remain hesitant to commit to converting our three big free educational software packages ( a garden simulator , a botanical plant 3D model generator , and a story authoring system ) to it , which had been my own hope for it and motivating much of my work on it .
I think I would still be better off converting those things to straight Jython + Swing or Python +wxWindows at this point than to PataPata .
At the very least , it would be easier for others to maintain such conventional conversions .
But there are other reasons too .
The biggest issue is that I learned that the seductive idea of prototypes may not be as powerful as its execution ( especially as an add - on to an existing language ) .
Consider what I wrote to someone else : " I 've been repeatedly confronted with the fact that prototype languages are powerful and elegant but ultimately , like Forth , end up losing something related to documenting programmer intent .
Documenting intent is one of the most important part of programming , and that is something that Smalltalk 's formal class structure enforces for most code over Self , just like C's named variables document intent which gets lost manipulating Forth 's data stack .
Plus , it is hard for any great language feature to offset issues like lack of community or lack of comprehensive libraries .
" And after at person suggested you usually need to name things before you can share them , I replied : " And I agree on the issue of " naming " something in order to share it .
Which gets back to the issue I mentioned of " documenting intent " .
With the PataPata system I made for Python , there was a choice point where I decided that prototypes used by other prototypes as parents needed to be named ( a difference from Self ) .
And I liked that choice .
But then , what am I really gaining over Smalltalk ( except not having a class side , which is nice , but is it worth the extra trouble and confusion ? )
" So , this leaves me questioning the whole move to prototypes .
That person also pointed out previous work on " Exemplar based Smalltalk " , so that is something I should look into further , perhaps as a compromise with Prototypes when I understand such previous work better .
Having said good things about the hierarchical browser above , I found myself editing the code by hand in a text editor a lot .
That means something is wrong with the development GUI design .
I 'm not sure where to pinpoint the problem or whether it was due to the early nature of the system , its incompleteness , or my lack of confidence in it or something wrong with the hierarchical browser or code export functionality .
But clearly it was not my intent in designing such a system to spend most of my coding time using scrolling a long file in a text editor , and I did too much of that .
I think the notion of putting behavior into instances of widgets was a misstep .
It seemed like a good idea at the time , and seemed like it might be an advance over Delphi or PythonCard more in line with Self or NewtonScript .
But having seen the result , I do n't like it .
Essentially , Delphi or PythonCard or similar systems ( including one proprietary in - house one I worked on for Smalltalk ) create instances of widgets which have actions tied to function names , where the actual functionality in terms of code is stored in some central object which represented the window or application .
So a button instance knows to send " closeButtonClicked " to the window , but it does not actually have any detailed code associated with that action .
PataPata stored the behavior most times in the actual prototype instance , so the code for " closeButtonClicked " would likely be right there in the specific button instance .
In the end , this seems confusing and harder to maintain .
Is code in the widgets or in the window or the application ?
It is one more layer to search for things .
It makes the stored source harder to follow too .
It also makes the implementation of widget wrappers more complex .
It makes it harder to move code from PythonCard or Delphi to this newer approach .
So , while it seemed like a good idea at the time , overall I 'd say it turned out bad in practice for making a GUI .
After trying this alternative , I prefer the model where widgets send messages to some more central object representing a window , an application , or a domain .
So , this can be seen as a validation of the PythonCard approach in that sense .
PataPata has too much complexity both in terms of internal code complexity and in what people need to learn to use it .
That is in part because it lives in two worlds -- the world of Python / Jython classes and the world of Prototypes .
Error messages are hard to understand because it is not clear what level they are coming from .
I have seen this before when I wrote layers on top of other systems .
Getting past this problem will take some creative thinking , if it is possible to fix at all .
The general issue here is having a clean way to pinpoint errors in code the user writes as opposed to reporting on errors or limitations in the underlying machinery that supports the user code .
There is no documentation .
This is one of the problems with moving away from conventional Python which has lots of documentation , email lists , and books for it .
The best documentation came from Francois Schnell who made a screencast about it ( mentioned above ) .
Writing good documentation is a non-trivial problem .
There is no user community for PataPata , and even I do n't use it .
Part of the community issue that I have n't wanted to advertise it or push it much since it is an early experiment .
Part of it is due to perhaps alienating some in the conventional schooling community on the Python edusig list by the way I approached talk of unschooling .
Though to that list 's credit , I have received much useful comments and criticism from the edusig list , quite a bit of it valid . :-)
Kirby Urner made many interesting points including general comments on the cost of a paradigm shift in terms of user effort needed to move to a new system without documentation and with most of the overall supporting code written in a different paradigm then the new one you want people to try ( so , they have to keep switching mental sets between old and new in a confusing way ) .
Ian Bicking contributed several important technical ideas in discussion on the edusig list ( especially relating to using Python 's metaclasses ) .
But some of the limited community is likely due to my reservations in promoting PataPata to either the programming community or the unschooling community , based on the other factors above , like the complexity of a system living in two worlds and also not being documented and having rough edges and big gaps .
I did not see the system as being at a point where more help would make it better ; more I see it at the point where some of the key ideas it pursued are to be questioned .
Unlike , say , our popular free PlantStudio software when it was new eight years ago , PataPata does not pass the test for a new thing of essentially providing 3X - 10X more value overall than the existing common alternatives to make it tempting to try it and then switch to it .
Switching development environments is rarely worth the effort for most people for most things for , say , just a 10 % improvement in one area .
And that applies even to my own thoughts about whether to use the PataPata framework in terms of my supporting it or my making something with it that others might support .
Also , I feel the GPL license perhaps cut the potential size of the audience down some , as well as my confidence in promoting it ; LGPL would probably find more takers , though I 'm not sure it would have worked for me in this particular case of an early experiment which included putting in many ideas and some older pieces of code I had ( an issue requiring more thought ) .== THE UGLY ==After this experiment , I am left still preferring actual Smalltalk syntax and mindset over Python and Jython syntax and emphasis ( as much as I love indentation based syntax ) .
It is easy to extend Smalltalk 's core in a shareable way by a few lines of code ( e.g. adding a " collect : except : " method to OrderedCollection ) .
Extending Python 's core requires a fairly complete understanding of a lot of code , probably significant coding including test case if you break anything else , and likely months or years of politicking before anyone can easily try your change ( since few people rebuild the Python interpreter ) .
I think Smalltalk keyword : syntax does a better job of documenting the intent of function or method calls , because each argument is in some sense labeled .
So , I am left unhappy that this system has Algol - like syntax .
As I wrote to someone else : " Also , I should have mentioned in more detail , what continued to drive my interest in Smalltalk is the keyword syntax .
Code like : " MyClass newWithX : 10 y : 20 " is just easier to guess at the intent of than " MyClass ( 10 , 20 ) " .
The sad thing is , while there has been plenty of work on somewhat Smalltalk - like systems in terms of OO with Python or Java or message oriented like Ruby or prototype oriented like the IO language , they all seem to begin with the premise that there is something wrong with the Smalltalk syntax , and so build an entire world around some Algol like syntax .
But it is precisely the syntax of Smalltalk that does a better job of documenting intent in the actual text of program code .
Which is another reason why I prefer Smalltalk to say Lisp ( as powerful and otherwise general as Lisp may be ) .
You can think about putting a keyword syntax on the other platforms , but then you end up with an ugliness of two paradigms .
In the case of Java & the JVM , that may be worth it for various benefits , for the others it likely is not . " I did include a compiler for Smalltalk - like syntax in a checkin of some mostly unrelated code in a subdirectory , but ultimately resolving that syntax issue in a production - oriented way is a very complex one .
I wanted to have PataPata use a network oriented system for remote debugging , but alas I did not have time to pursue that ( in a way I would have thought secure enough ) .
I did discover the wonder of TK 's remote execution notion implemented in the " Send " command ; but I did not get that working so that worlds could be in different processes ( right now they are all in the same process ) .
In general , some existing solutions for Python ( like the RPC system IDLE uses ) were not that general , and the ones which probably were seemed intimidating and fraught with security issues unless you really knew the framework .
So I just never explored that .
Plus , so far , I could not get other Python IDE developers interested in having a general scheme for this , so that remains an idea not explored in detail .
A parent who does unschooling wrote to me about PataPata and I had replied : " [ The ] biggest issue is I wanted to experiment more with a Self - inspired prototype - based programming approach , and PataPata would in that sense be different from either Python or Squeak as it advanced , because both of those are more class - based than prototype based .
Having experimented more with prototypes , I 'm not sure I like them as much as when I started , and am more questioning if right now they are worth the cost of being non-mainstream , or if they are indeed worth the cost , if the technical and semantic difficulty of putting them efficiently on a class - based system is worth the value of easy access to an existing class - based infrastructure with a different paradigm .
So I 'm not sure exactly where that effort is going anymore . :-)... IMHO Python or Squeak are quite usable as - is for unschooling ( as are many other good computer languages ) ; with PataPata I was just interested in trying an experiment in making Python an even better match by making it more transparent in the direction Squeak ( and Self ) has moved , and giving it a GUI designer that might be more usable at a younger age , and also I was responding specifically to a very schooling centered educational group which dominates any discussion of Python and education ( on the EduSig list , or Mark Shuttleworth 's school - centered initiative ) ....
Over the years , what I have discovered about " educational software " is that most of it is junk , and the really useful things to connect kids with are the open - ended packages which provide an avenue for their creativity and sense of mastery over aspects of the real or digital world -- so , for example , learning to write with a word processor is much better than playing some silly flash - words game , and using Photoshop or the GIMP is probably much better than using some silly math - blaster game or even the award winning Oregon Trail ( which is pretty good as those things go ) .
There are exceptions to this , but they are rare .
Generally , a parent working hand - in - hand with a kid to help them learn to use a software tool written for amateurs or professionals ( Python , Blender , OpenOffice , GarageBand , or our own PlantStudio :-) is probably going to yield more value for most older kids than anything specifically labeled " educational " .
One of the bigger potential areas for exceptions is educational simulations like our garden simulator , but even there , kids usually learn more by building their own simulations than by using a pre-made one .
Which brings us back to good programming environments for kids to have to make or modify such simulations ( which was another ideal driving the PataPata experiment ) .
" == WHERE TO GO FROM HERE ===Initially , this was supposed ( by me ) to be a project to bring the best ideas of Squeak and Self to Python and Jython , but in a " Pythonic " way , especially to support unschooling and homeschooling .
As outlined above , it has been an experiment with successes and failures on that score .
Where should it ( or I ) go from here ?
Clearly , it has not set the Squeak world on fire . :-)
Neither has it received Guido 's blessing .
And I do n't plan on using it as - is either .
So IMHO as of this point it 's effectively : " He 's dead , Jim " , at least for the moment as it was originally conceived .
I still think there is potential here for the good parts of PataPata to move forward in other contexts -- perhaps not even using prototypes .
Since I started the PataPata project six months or so ago , the free computing landscape has changed radically IMHO .
And that change is due to Sun 's decision to put much of Java under the GPL , removing Richard Stallman 's " The Java trap " argument against using Java for free software .
As I wrote elsewhere on benefits versus drawbacks of using the JVM and Java libraries as platform for free software : " What would matter to me from the maintainer side -- as a tradeoff against [ slower ] speed -- would simply be making my life as easy as possible to spend as much time on tools and applications and the least time on low - level porting issues , while still being reasonably crossplatform ( even with Swing 's usual warts ) .
I fought against Java at the start , and not just because VisualWorks consulting back then paid the rent . :-)
I 'd say VW of ten years ago is still better than the JVM of today .
Certainly the first five years of Java was a disaster for most people -- projects after project abandoned and all sorts of problems with missing features , random bugs only on one platform , abysmal performance , and so on .
Not to mention how mismatched static languages are as a general choice for most dynamically changing business and R&D applications ( great for implementing a VM though ) .
And then there was RMS on " the Java trap " .
Nonetheless , it 's now ten years after Java got going , and things have changed bit by bit .
Many Smalltalk ideas have migrated into Java ( Swing , HotSpot ) , and it has so many libraries , and it is ( supposedly ) going to be GPL at the core .
And computers are about 100X to 1000X faster than in 1996 , so performance issues really do n't matter as much for the kind of things I want to do ( mainly educational simulations and knowledge sharing apps ) .
So , I feel Java is perhaps finally at the point where it is stable enough that I can expect " write once , debug once , run everywhere " to finally be close to being true ( instead of " write once , debug everywhere " ) .
And I think even the best C++ programmer has to admit by now that Java ( with garbage collection ) is easier to program in and maintain than C or C++ ( at least , for most people and most applications , special cases excepted ) .
Obviously there will always be problems with incompatibilities of different Java versions and missing libraries and so on .
But with Sun's Java now going GPL , I might expect it will become even more ubiquitous and better supported by those who want it for other reasons .
" Now this does n't mean only the JVM makes sense to use for free software , but it does suggest it may make sense for me with my particular skills , needs , time limits , and experiences .
From what I read , and approach to Mac , PC , and GNU / Linux portability which writes as much code as possible in a platform neutral language like C and then writing say 10 % of the code in a platform specific way for each major platform will probably look nicer and be better accepted .
It just takes more time for learning , writing , and testing -- as I needed to do for PataPata , learning tricky details about TK , wxWidgets , Swing , and openGL , plus evaluating other toolkits including QT , KDE , Cairo , Gnome , and GNUStep / Cocoa .
My time for coding free software is limited and I 'd rather focus it on application coding and writing programming tools on top of a stable platform .
I 've also discovered that ultimately PythonCard is probably another good choice for Python oriented educational software .
PataPata drew several good ideas from PythonCard , though having said that , no doubt there are some good ideas in PataPata which PythonCard might use , like the hierarchical browser perhaps , or perhaps how to wrap basic widgets from multiple platforms other than wxWidgets .
Python + wxWidgets ( which underlies PythonCard ) remains a good crossplatform platform for coding -- although I think wxWidgets is a little brittle and perhaps aging in its C++ oriented design ; I certainly know I would not want to maintain wxWidgets or extend it in C++ , whereas I personally would consider writing native widgets using Java and the Swing library .
Likewise , I 'd rather code in Java to improve something like Jython than code in C to improve Python ( well , except for the fact that much current Jython 2.2 + coding is unfortunately the more boring and less glamorous ( but still very important ) task of catching up with Python 2.6 ) .
So , I am currently exploring other alternatives for how to port our educational software away from Delphi and to a free system .
The short list is really four items :* conventional Python + wxWindows , * conventional Jython +
Swing on the JVM , * some sort of Smalltalk on top of the JVM ( an existing one , or one I write from scratch ) , or* another free Smalltalk not on the JVM .
I 'm weighing the JVM alternative heavier because I see value in being able to write portable Java code when needed for performance .
The choice between Python and Smalltalk is still a tossup -- I prefer Smalltalk syntax and mindset and long term would prefer a codebase in Smalltalk , but I have already written a partial Delphi -> Jython +
Swing translator that did most of the heavy lifting of such a conversion ( and converting Delphi function names to Smalltalk keyword : syntax is likely to be tedious and require being done by hand ) .
Whichever path I choose ( and I may even use more than one for different projects ) , I think the good ideas tried in PataPata -- like storing an image of live objects as human - readable , having a hierarchical browser of data and code ( even if for instances and classes and metaclasses ) , using a screencast to get across a new idea , or wrapping widgets to give a uniform feel to them -- may find a place .
I have not decide what to do with this actual SourceForge project ( or discovered what is possible under Source Forge 's terms ) .
It is possible I may just leave it as is ( a cautionary tale or successful software experiment , take your pick :-) .
Or , if it is possible , I may re-purpose it along these new lines if I need a place to put , say , code and applications for an educationally - oriented effort ( implemented in Smalltalk or Jython or both ) on top the JVM .
I still like the name " PataPata " for a software environment which was inspired from a South African song by Miriam Makeba on a Putumayo CD of world music we have , and having now bought a bunch of the Miriam Makeba 's CDs and listened to them while I programmed on PataPata , I really like her music more and more .
It has an incredible depth of intricate rhythm and counterpoint to it , plus sometimes a political edge .
It would be an accomplishment to someday build a software environment worthy of that inspiration .

This is NOT the Death Star .

The Death Star battle station was the brainchild of Imperial bigwig Grand Moff Tarkin .
It was the centerpiece of Tarkin 's Doctrine of Fear proposal that created sweeping reform in the structure of the Empire .
It was also the final step in solidifying the Emperor 's total authority .
The largest change to the Empire made by the Doctrine of Fear was the dissolution of the Imperial Senate .
Tarkin 's policy put power directly in the hands of the regional governors .
The governors , who ruled over several planetary systems , now answered directly to the Emperor under the Doctrine of Fear .
This new organization greatly reduced the bureaucracy in the Empire and greatly increased the power of regional governors like Tarkin .

Opponents to the Doctrine of Fear ( and there were many in the Empire ) claimed that this new policy would rip the Empire apart and that planets would revolt without direct representation in the Senate .
Tarkin's answer to any potential dissonance was the Death Star .
Tarkin intended to make an example of a rebellious system as soon as the Death Star was capable .
He believed that after the total annihilation of a planet , fear would spread throughout the galaxy and maintain order .
The development and construction of the Death Star had begun long before the first debate ever took place about the Doctrine of Fear .
In fact , the Doctrine of Fear was ratified by the Emperor the very same day the second successful firing of the Death Star destroyed the planet of Alderrann .
Visionary scientists and engineers like Qwi Xux , Tol Sivron and Bevel Lemelisk were conscripted by the Empire to develop the space station .
They all worked in a top secret facility , code - named Maw , hidden deep in one of the most inhospitable regions of the galaxy .
A prototype Death Star was built at Maw but was little more than a spherical frame with an untested Superlaser .
It was much smaller than the Death Star would eventually be and had no propulsion system .
The construction phase of the Death Star project took place in orbit around the planet Despayre and was primarily handled by defense contracting company Sienar Systems .
Sienar had worked on a prototype of a similar space station many years earlier for the CIS , was contracted by Tarkin to do work on the Death Star project .
( It should also be noted that Sienar Systems CEO Raith Sienar was " coincidentally " an old friend of Grand Moff Tarkin ) .
For years , the Empire used prison labor to mine Despayre for materials .
Prison laborers also handled the more menial and dangerous aspects of the station 's construction .
The inspiration for the Death Star came from a Separatist super - weapon called the Great Weapon .
The Great Weapon was a moon sized - space station with a large laser cannon developed by the Trade Federation , Geonosians , and Techno - Union for use in their war against the Old Republic .
It was never put to use and was captured by the newly formed Empire after the Clone Wars .
The Great Weapon was never completed .
The original Death Star was destroyed in the Battle of Yavin by rebel pilot Luke Skywalker .
Skywalker fired a proton torpedo into a reactor vent shaft .
The ensuing chain reaction caused a critical overload of the reactor , destroying the entire station and killing everyone aboard .
Photographer JP
Trenque specialises in underwater photography and in 2005 his picture ( above ) won our Photographer of the Year award .
Recently he undertook a photographic expedition to Borneo , here he presents some of the stunning pictures he captured .
In a recent ongoing piece , I mentioned the “ Canada Line ” , a huge construction project currently disrupting Vancouver .
Motivated in part by the 2010 Winter Olympics , it ’s a subway / elevated train connecting the city core , the airport , and everything on the path between them , including a big strip of central Vancouver and Richmond , the suburb with the airport .
( It ’s called the “ Canada Line ” because the biggest chunk of funding is from the Federal , as opposed to provincial or city government ) .
Since I ’m writing for the Net , I wanted to link to it .
I did a quick search for its
Web site , which also turned up a pretty good Wikipedia entry on the subject .
The question is , which to link to ?
The answer is n’t obvious .
Why Wikipedia ? ·
One great thing about the Web is that everyone can be part of it , and another is that anyone can link to anyone , and a particularly great thing about blogs is that they do so a lot .
The trouble with the Web is that like everything else , per Sturgeon ’s Revelation , 90 % of it is crap .
In particular , a lot of institutional sites are pathetic self - serving fluff served up in anodyne marketing - speak with horrible URIs that are apt to vanish .
Linking to the Wikipedia instead is tempting , and I ’ve succumbed a lot recently .
In fact , that ’s what I did for the Canada Line .
After all , the train is still under construction and there ’s no real reason to expect today ’s links to last ; on top of which , the Line ’s own site is mostly about selling the project to the residents and businesses who ( like me ) are getting disrupted by it , and the taxpayers who ( like me ) are paying for it .
Wikipedia entries , on the other hand , are typically in stable locations , have a decent track record for outliving transient events , are pretty good at presenting the essential facts in a clear , no - nonsense way , and tend to be richly linked to relevant information , including whatever the “ official ”
Web site might currently happen to be .
At this point in history , the Wikipedia continues to look good , and the cheap - shot artists who dislike it when the general public is allowed to help write the Great Books , such as Bob “ Wikipedia is like a public toilet ” McHenry and Andrew “ Khmer Rouge in Daipers ( sic ) ” Orlowski , are looking bad .
( The jury is still out on Nicholas Carr ’s contention that the Wikipedia is inexorably evolving away from its populist roots into something like a conventional reference - publishing project . )
Why Not Wikipedia ? ·
But this makes me nervous .
I feel like I ’m breaking the rules ; being able to link to original content , without benefit of intermediaries , is one of the things that defines the Web .
More practically , when I and a lot of other people start linking to Wikipedia by default , we boost its search - engine mojo and thus drive a positive - feedback loop , to some extent creating a single point of failure ; another of the things that the Web is n’t supposed to have .
I ’d be astonished if the Wikipedia suddenly went away .
But I would n’t be very surprised if it went off the rails somehow : Commercial rapacity , legal issues , or ( especially ) bad community dynamics , we ’ve seen that happen to a whole bunch of once - wonderful Internet resources .
If and when it did , all those Wikipedia links I ’ve used ( 396 so far , starting in June 2004 ) become part of a big problem .
[ Let me be clear : I am an unabashed partisan of Wikipedia .
I think it is a triumph , a piece of evidence that being human is no bad thing ; and I ’ll do what I can , when I can , to help it .
If I think I see it going sideways I ’ll be in there shrieking and fighting . ]
Learn From History ?
· Obviously , the notion that writers should insert links to other relevant information did n’t first appear on the Web : it ’s at the core of academic publishing .
The word “ scholarly ” applies to work in which no assertion may stand unaccompanied by supporting evidence ; I think scholarly is good .
Academic citations , the stuff of scholarship , are not simple one - way pointers , they are little bundles of metadata : a page ( or section ) number in a particular edition of a particular published work , identified by author , title , date , publisher , and so on .
Given the way the library system works , there ’s a high degree of confidence that , given the contents of a citation , you ’ll be able to track down the original .
Web links are clearly transient and fragile by comparison ( the appeal of linking to Wikipedia is precisely that , at the moment , it feels a little less so ) .
On the other hand , you can click on them and follow them , right here right now ; and you can spin “ transient and fragile ” the other way , as “ dynamic and fresh ” .
I do n’t think , on balance , that they ’re a step backward .
Fragile Links ·
When I first started writing the ongoing articles and content , in parallel , I was thinking about a fragile = " true " attribute on links , to be inserted when I thought that there was a good chance that the ongoing piece would outlive them .
The idea was that I ’d fiddle the stylesheet so that “ fragile ” links would look different , by way of a warning .
The idea was not entirely lame .
But it needed me to make a whole bunch of judgment calls , and I quickly decided I probably was n’t very good at guessing at longevity ; so I discarded it .
Solution : Link Bundles ?
·
If we really care about links being useful in the long term ( and we should ) , maybe we need to abandon the notion that a single pointer is the right way to make one that matters .
If I want to link to Accenture or Bob Dylan or Chartres Cathedral , I can think of three plausible ways : via the “ official ” sites , the Wikipedia entries , and Google searches for the names .
[ More generally , I should say : direct links , online reference - resource links , and search - based links .
I ’ll come back to that . ]
What I want , then , is a link to a bunch of things at once .
It turns out that there ’s a perfectly good , if lightly - implemented , way to do this in XML , called XLink [ Disclosure : I helped create it . ] .
It ’s been lightly - implemented mostly I think because the browser writers just did n’t feel any particular pull for such a thing .
This has struck me as a little odd because every financial Web site in the world is full of multi-ended links : every time they mention a company they ’ll typically link to its share price , some analysis , and previous articles : check out almost any page at TheStreet.com , for example .
One Level of Indirection · I want more than multi-way links : I do n’t want to jump into bed with Wikipedia or Google or any potential single point of failure .
I ’d be willing to bet that if Wikipedia goes off the rails and some new online reference resource comes along to compete , there ’ll be an automated mapping between Wikipedia links and the new thing ; so the actual URIs may retain some value .
Similarly , a search string need n’t be tied to any one search engine .
Linking 2.0 ·
So here ’s what I ’d like : a way to write multi-ended links with simple indirection , and a reasonable way for users to display them in whatever browser they ’re using .
Fortunately , I have a nice link - rich testbed here at ongoing , with software I control , and the era of GreaseMonkey and AJAX , who needs to wait for the browser builders ?
Unless someone points out why this line of thinking is clueless or ( much more likely ) points at where someone ’s already solved the problem , maybe I ’ll take a run at the problem .
Google Chrome Frame is an early - stage open source plug - in that seamlessly brings Google Chrome 's open web technologies and speedy JavaScript engine to Internet Explorer .
With Google Chrome Frame , you can :
Start using open web technologies - like the HTML5 canvas tag - right away , even technologies that are n't yet supported in Internet Explorer 6 , 7 , or 8 .
Take advantage of JavaScript performance improvements to make your apps faster and more responsive .
BSOD
So Google just announced a new open source project : Chrome Frame Just to clarify : I do n't think it hurts anything , and I applaud Google 's intentions to rid us all of supporting such a piece of shit like IE .
It looks like a cool piece of technology and the most creative effort I 've seen since the Mozilla ActiveX control
But it 'll do jack shit to get around supporting IE in all of its broken glory .
I 'll ignore the current requirement of adding a meta tag to a page in order to trigger the plugin , and also the fact that this extremely young and experimental project does n't have things like deployment tools for IT departments to use .
They just announced this , and want feedback from developers at this point so they can continue working on it .
Google Chrome Frame will do jack shit , because the stick - in - the - mud companies that can't part with IE6 wo n't install a browser in a plugin .
If the companies did n't have ignorant , self - defeating , head - up - their - fucking - ass rules about what level of corporate hell they 'll ban you to for trying to install something on your machine , they would simply let you install the browser itself .
None of the companies currently threatening their employees with fines or even firing will consider for a second adding an entire browser via a plugin .
Employees might try to install it on their own in order to try to hide the fact that they get more work done when not using a complete piece of shit , but that will just prompt more companies to learn how to block people from installing browser plugins .
One of the reasons even the more laid back companies would probably let people install a whole other browser before installing a browser in a plugin : support .
If you have employees using web applications that take advantage of Chrome Frame and they hit a bug either in the web application itself or something more severe like a browser crash ( or maybe the always entertaining ) , that will fucking suck to figure out what happened .
And if you installed Chrome Frame without their knowing , then call up support with a " my browser fucking crashed on me again " that turns out to stem from Google 's crap code , your employer will fuck you .
Shit , once they finally upgrade to IE8 they 'll have enough of a problem with browser engines
We instead need to find out what products companies use that require IE and either get the distributer to stop that shit , or provide alternatives .
This will take a fucking long time , so I expect we 'll also need to educate some of these dumbasses who think that they 'll stay more secure by using an ancient fucking version of the least secure browser in existence , so they 'll at least let one of the better choices onto the machines .
Then employees will still have IE6 for the ten - year old shit software that requires it , and something else to use that actually works with the rest of the world .

PARIS , Jan. 31 — President Jacques Chirac has demanded that the United States sign both the Kyoto climate protocol and a future agreement that will take effect when the Kyoto accord runs out in 2012 .
He said that he welcomed last week ’s State of the Union address in which President Bush described climate change as a “ serious challenge ” and acknowledged that a growing number of American politicians now favor emissions cuts .
But he warned that if the United States did not sign the agreements , a carbon tax across Europe on imports from nations that have not signed the Kyoto treaty could be imposed to try to force compliance .
The European Union is the largest export market for American goods .
“ A carbon tax is inevitable , ” Mr. Chirac said .
“ If it is European , and I believe it will be European , then it will all the same have a certain influence because it means that all the countries that do not accept the minimum obligations will be obliged to pay . ”

This , I think , is rich : I just got back from the FedEx on Queen Anne , where I had been trying to ship a box of products from Greenwood Space Travel Supply to a potential client , just as samples of my packaging work .
I had them in a paper bag , mostly a collection of metal pint cans and a couple of brown apothecary jars .
I was worried about how to pack them so they would n't break , so I went up to the FedEx guy with the bag and asked him what kind of box I should use .
He immediately pulled out — I think just by chance — the bottle of " Rocket Fuel , " which has a label that looks like this :
FedEx guy :
Is this really what this is ?
Rocket fuel ?
Me [ laughing , used to this reaction from being at the space - travel supply store ] :
Oh , no , no , no .
Of course not .
It 's ... made - up .
Kind of a joke .
It 's actually full of sugar , which I just put in to give it some weight , but that 's all it is .
FedEx guy :
You can't ship this .
Me : But ... it 's just sugar !
What , uh , what if I empty it out ?
It does n't really need to have sugar in it .
FedEx guy : No .
They would still x-ray it , and then you 'd get a call when it was en route .
I do n't think it would make it .
Me : Hmmm .
I really need to get this out ... but I guess I do n't have to ship the " Rocket Fuel " can .
What about the rest ?
The FedEx guy then grabs cans of nitrogen ( N 2 ) and neon ( Ne ) , with their store - advertised " purity " of 78.084 % and 0.0018 % respectively ( which was our way of being clever about selling cans of normal air , since that 's their percentage in the atmosphere — which , of course , was our way of making more money for 826 Seattle by selling products that cost almost nothing to produce ) .
Here 's what the atmospheric gas cans look like on the shelf :
FedEx guy : Nope .
You can't ship these either .
Me : But ... they 're empty !
It 's just air .
And ... nitrogen ?
It 's , like , almost 80 % of the atmosphere .
There 's nothing dangerous about nitrogen , even if it were pure .
FedEx guy :
They look too much like bomb - making materials .
Me [ going into dumbfounded mode ] : Bomb ... Neon ?
What ?
Is there anything here I can legally ship ?
How about this bottle of tap water ?
I hand him a bottle of Certainty ( tagline , " For when it 's preferable to think you know more " ) , which looks like this :
FedEx guy : Nope .
It still looks too suspicious , too much like bomb - making materials .
Me : But it 's " Certainty . "
That 's not even a thing .
I just made that up .
[ That 's not strictly true .
It 's a scientific term / idea , and we sell it alongside bottles of " Uncertainty . "
But it 's like having a bottle labeled " Friendship . " ]
FedEx guy :
It 's just too suspicious .
[ long pause ]
Me [ going into post - 9/11 , TSA - style super - dumbfounded mode ] :
So what you 're saying is you can't ship any sort of containers , even if they 're empty ?
You know that we originally ordered these empty cans and jars from a company , and * they * shipped them to * us * .
FedEx guy :
They must have used a different vendor [ " vendor " ?
I can't remember , some word like that , like a " service " ] .
Which I imagine he said because he could n't bring himself to say , " It 's the * words * that are * on* the containers that are dangerous " — even after I had opened them all and demonstrated the utter harmlessness / emptiness of the containers themselves .
I sympathize with people who are n't making very much and are probably forced to comply with arcane corporate rules and who have to deal with weirdoes coming in with cans labeled " Rocket Fuel . "
I really do .
But ... c'mon .
How much effort is involved in * not* being part of the common - sense - negating , spirit - crushing , Bush - era fear - slash - stupidity machine ?
The terrorists win again .
Hopefully , actual terrorists wo n't learn to wrap their packages at home first .
Long story short , I packed them up there at the FedEx counter , with their scissors and tape and some extra bubble wrap I bought , and then I walked down the street to the U.S. Post Office and mailed them from there , all sealed up .
We 'll see how they fare .
I hope they do n't have snark - sniffing dogs .
A long time ago I decided that in order to make the Math - Ventures part of my homesite more attractive , I 'd like to convert all the mathematical formulae that had been written using ASCII Art ( % - ) ) into MathML - an XML grammar for writing mathematics .
Knowing that MathML was extremely verbose , I decided to try converting to HTML + MathML from LaTeX using TeX4ht .
However , when viewed using Firefox ( which has a built - in MathML support ) , the test page rendered all the formulae as plain text , which made me believe it was a bug in TeX4ht .
I left it at that for a long time , but a few days ago decided to give it another try .
Again displaying it did not render it nicely .
However , copy and pasting the notation into the MathML Tester on the Mozilla homepage , yielded perfect results .
After a little thought , my woman ( OK - programmer ) intuition told me that maybe Mozilla displayed it badly due to the fact the file ended in the .html extension and as thus was treated with the content - type of text / html .
Changing the extension to .xhtml ( with a content type of application / xhtml+xml ) , solved the problem and the formulae were redisplayed .
So I finished converting the page from its ASCII - art mess into TeX and rendered it into XHTML + MathML .
I needed to change the DOCTYPE to XHTML + MathML which involved some Latemp voodoo .
( As it turned out , I did n't do it properly the first time , and as a result the page did not validate ) .
I also had to install and configure the MathML fonts , or otherwise got weird artifacts and missing symbols in the formulas .
Then I discovered that when served as .xhtml , the Google AdSense ads do n't get displayed .
I found a workaround here , and after a lot of experimenting got it to work .
Then I needed to modify the < object > tag CSS to the following :
.ads_side , .ads_top_wide { overflow : hidden ; } .ads_side { width : 120 px ; height :600 px ; } .ads_top_wide { width :500 px ; height :70 px ; }
Otherwise , I got annoying scrollbars and clipped content at all the same reason .
Many thanks to someone I talked with on the IRC who helped a lot .
So then the Google Ads worked .
Afterwards , I decided to convert a diagram to SVG to make it l33ter .
I had to write a Perl script and experiment a bit with affine transformations .
The SVG works in Opera and Firefox 1.5.0.x , but does n't work in Konqueror from some reason .
The MathML works only in Firefox , because Opera and Konqueror do n't support it .
Here 's the final result .
The way I see it , when more and more sites like mine will integrate cutting - edge technologies , then more people will have them on their browsers , and web designers will have an easier life .
Similarly my Music Recommendations
Page now uses display : table and display : table - cell which works well in Firefox , Konqueror and Opera but is broken in MSIE 6 .
This will provide further motivation for people to stop using MSIE .
Together , we can make the revolution happen !
Well , in any case , cheers .
" Clear " Registered Traveller Program
CLEAR , a private service that prescreens travelers for a $ 100 annual fee , has come to Kennedy International Airport .
To benefit from the Clear Registered Traveler program , which is run by Verified Identity Pass , a person must fill out an application , let the service capture his fingerprints and iris pattern and present two forms of identification .
If the traveler passes a federal background check , he will be given a card that allows him to pass quickly through airport security .
Sounds great , but it ’s actually two ideas rolled into one : one clever and one very stupid .
The clever idea is allowing people to pay for better service .
Clear has been in operation at the Orlando International Airport since July 2005 , and members have passed through security checkpoints faster simply because they are segregated from less experienced fliers who do n’t know the drill .
Now , at Kennedy and other airports , Clear is purchasing and installing federally approved technology that will further speed up the screening process : scanners that will eliminate the need for cardholders to remove their shoes , and explosives detection machines that will eliminate the need for them to remove their coats and jackets .
There are also Clear employees at the checkpoints who , although they can’t screen cardholders , can guide members through the security process .
Clear has not yet paid airports for an extra security lane or the Transportation Security Administration for extra screening personnel , but both of those enhancements are on the table if enough people sign up .
I fly more than 200,000 miles per year and would gladly pay $ 100 a year to get through airport security faster .
But the stupid idea is the background check .
When first conceived , traveler programs focused on prescreening .
Pre -approved travelers would pass through security checkpoints with less screening , and resources would be focused on everyone else .
Sounds reasonable , but it would leave us all less safe .
Background checks are based on the dangerous myth that we can somehow pick terrorists out of a crowd if we could identify everyone .
Unfortunately , there is n’t any terrorist profile that prescreening can uncover .
Timothy McVeigh could probably have gotten one of these cards .
So could have Eric Rudolph , the pipe bomber at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta .
There is n’t even a good list of known terrorists to check people against ; the government list used by the airlines has been the butt of jokes for years .
And have we forgotten how prevalent identity theft is these days ?
If you think having a criminal impersonating you to your bank is bad , wait until they start impersonating you to the Transportation Security Administration .
The truth is that whenever you create two paths through security — a high - security path and a low - security path — you have to assume that the bad guys will find a way to exploit the low - security path .
It may be counterintuitive , but we are all safer if the people chosen for more thorough screening are truly random and not based on an error - filled database or a cursory background check .
I think of Clear as a $ 100 service that tells terrorists if the F.B.I. is on to them or not .
Why in the world would we provide terrorists with this ability ?
We do n’t have to .
Clear cardholders are not scrutinized less when they go through checkpoints , they ’re scrutinized more efficiently .
So why not get rid of the background checks altogether ?
We should all be able to walk into the airport , pay $ 10 , and use the Clear lanes when it ’s worth it to us .

Mental health problems are very common
A report published by the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health says children should be taught about mental health as part of the school curriculum by 2015 .
It urges a shift in focus from mental ill health to mental well - being , with services better geared to users ' needs .
The government says improvements have been made already and more will follow .
By investing in good mental health some of our nation 's starkest inequalities can be redressed
Angela Greatley
Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health
The report , which the Sainsbury 's Centre for Mental Health produced with the Local Government Association ( LGA ) , the NHS Confederation and the Association of Directors of Social Services , said that , over the next decade , mental health should become everybody 's business .
The key will be to reshape services to ensure that they are primarily geared towards meeting the needs of the people who use them , it said .
The report calls for people with severe mental health conditions to have their own budgets for the services they want , including alternatives to hospital .
Talking therapies , said the report , should be available as a matter of routine when people need them , along with advice on staying in work and maintaining an ordinary life .
People with mental health problems should also be offered an " associate " to help them manage their lives .
Big difference
It said that well planned and properly resourced public services can make a huge difference to the mental well - being of the whole population and , in particular , to the lives of those who have mental health problems .
HAVE YOUR SAY
People need to know that help is available and that they 're not alone

" By investing in good mental health , and offering people who experience mental distress a better service , the £ 77bn annual cost to society can be reduced and some of our nation 's starkest inequalities can be redressed . "
That cost includes health services , lost work days and ' quality of life ' .
LGA mental health spokesperson David Rogers said up to one in four people would suffer from mental health problems at some point .
" It is vital that we challenge the stigma surrounding this issue and create a climate which encourages tolerance , understanding and timely treatment .
" This report sets out a challenging but achievable vision of how the overall well - being of our communities can be improved by the health sector and local government working together . "
Jane Austin , of NHS Confederation , which represents more than 90 % of NHS organisations , said the report set out how health , social care and voluntary organisations could work in partnership to deliver top quality mental health services .
" It is only by adopting this kind of holistic approach that all those involved in improving the mental well - being of the whole population will be able to achieve that goal . "
Government progress
National Director for Mental Health Professor Louis Appleby said the National Service Framework for Mental Health had led to big changes over the last five years .
" We have seen record increases in investment and staffing , we now have over 700 specialised community mental health teams and we have the lowest suicide rate since records began , " she said .
" Whilst there is still more work to do , in recent years mental health services have become increasingly responsive to the needs and wishes of the people who use them .
" As we enter the second stage of implementing the framework , we face the ambitious task of ensuring the mental well - being of society as a whole . "
But Marjorie Wallace , chief executive of the mental health charity Sane , said : " While everyone will subscribe to ways of making it easier and pleasanter to obtain treatment , this is a well - rehearsed wish list prescribing a cloud - cuckoo land .
" This is likely to remain a utopia because , as the paper itself acknowledges , it is uncertain who will pay or whether it could ever be affordable .
WASHINGTON , Feb .
18 - One of the perquisites of being president is the ability to have the author of a book you enjoyed pop into the White House for a chat .
Over the years , a number of writers have visited President Bush , including Natan Sharansky , Bernard Lewis and John Lewis Gaddis .
And while the meetings are usually private , they rarely ruffle feathers .
Now , one has .
In his new book about Mr. Bush , " Rebel in Chief : Inside the Bold and Controversial Presidency of George W. Bush , " Fred Barnes recalls a visit to the White House last year by Michael Crichton , whose 2004 best - selling novel , " State of Fear , " suggests that global warming is an unproven theory and an overstated threat .
Mr. Barnes , who describes Mr. Bush as " a dissenter on the theory of global warming , " writes that the president " avidly read " the novel and met the author after Karl Rove , his chief political adviser , arranged it .
He says Mr. Bush and his guest " talked for an hour and were in near - total agreement . "
The Xbox was fitted with a 200GB hard drive packed with games
The Cambridge graduate was sentenced at Caerphilly Magistrates ' Court to 140 hours of community service .
The man had been selling modified Xbox consoles which he fitted with a big hard drive containing 80 games .
" This case sets a major precedent which marks a milestone in the fight against piracy , " said games industry spokesman Michael Rawlinson .
Bypass controls
The conviction is the first of its kind in the UK , where the modification of video games consoles has been an illegal practice since October 2003 , when the UK enacted the EU Copyright Directive .
It sends a clear message to anyone tempted to become involved in chipping consoles that this is a criminal offence and will be dealt with accordingly
Michael Rawlinson , Elspa
Consoles such as the Xbox and PlayStation 2 can be modified by chips that are soldered to a console 's main circuit board to bypass copyright controls .
The chips allow people to play games purchased legitimately in other countries , as well as running backup copies or bootleg discs .
In this case , the man was tracked down by an investigator working for the UK games industry trade body , the Entertainment & Leisure Software Publishers Association , ( Elspa ) .
The man , who has not yet been named , was selling modified Xbox consoles , fitted with a 200GB hard drive and 80 pre-installed games , via his website for £ 380 .
Elspa informed Caerphilly County Borough Council Trading Standards and Gwent Constabulary , as well as helping to collect forensic evidence used by the prosecution .
The man was sentenced to 140 hours community service and ordered to pay £ 750 in costs .
The court also seized his equipment - three PCs , two printers , three Xbox consoles and 38 hard drives .
" It sends a clear message to anyone tempted to become involved in chipping consoles that this is a criminal offence and will be dealt with accordingly , " said Mr Rawlinson , deputy director general of Elspa .
" The modification of consoles is an activity that Elspa 's anti-piracy team is prioritising .
It is encouraging to see the UK courts do the same . "
In July last year , Sony won a legal battle to ban the selling of mod chips in the UK .
“ Your People Live Only Upon Cod ” : An Algonquian Response to European Claims of Cultural Superiority
From the start of colonization , Indians and Europeans viewed each other across a wide cultural gulf .
Sure about the superiority of their civilization , European missionaries and teachers tried to convert Indians to Christianity and the European way of life .
Some Indians did adopt new ways after disease and violence had decimated their communities ; others rejected the European entreaties and pointed out the arrogance of these claims of cultural superiority .
French priest Chrestian LeClerq traveled among the eastern Algonquian people who lived in what are now the Maritime Provinces of Canada .
He recorded a Micmac leader ’s eloquent response to these attempts at “ reform ” that pointed out how difficult Europeans found it to live in Indian country .
If France was such a terrestrial paradise , he asked , why were colonists making their way across the Atlantic to live in the forests of North America ?
I am greatly astonished that the French have so little cleverness , as they seem to exhibit in the matter of which thou hast just told me on their behalf , in the effort to persuade us to convert our poles , our barks , and our wigwams into those houses of stone and of wood which are tall and lofty , according to their account , as these trees .
Very well !
But why now , do men of five to six feet in height need houses which are sixty to eighty ?
For , in fact , as thou knowest very well thyself , Patriarch — do we not find in our own all the conveniences and the advantages that you have with yours , such as reposing , drinking , sleeping , eating , and amusing ourselves with our friends when we wish ?
This is not all , my brother , hast thou as much ingenuity and cleverness as the Indians , who carry their houses and their wigwams with them so that they may lodge wheresoever they please , independently of any seignior whatsoever ?
Thou art not as bold nor as stout as we , because when thou goest on a voyage thou canst not carry upon thy shoulders thy buildings and thy edifices .
Therefore it is necessary that thou prepares as many lodgings as thou makest changes of residence , or else thou lodgest in a hired house which does not belong to thee .
As for us , we find ourselves secure from all these inconveniences , and we can always say , more truly than thou , that we are at home everywhere , because we set up our wigwams with ease wheresoever we go , and without asking permission of anybody .
Thou reproachest us , very inappropriately , that our country is a little hell in contrast with France , which thou comparest to a terrestrial paradise , inasmuch as it yields thee , so thou safest , every kind of provision in abundance .
Thou sayest of us also that we are the most miserable and most unhappy of all men , living without religion , without manners , without honour , without social order , and , in a word , without any rules , like the beasts in our woods and our forests , lacking bread , wine , and a thousand other comforts which thou hast in superfluity in Europe .
Well , my brother , if thou dost not yet know the real feelings which our Indians have towards thy country and towards all thy nation , it is proper that I inform thee at once .
I beg thee now to believe that , all miserable as we seem in thine eyes , we consider ourselves nevertheless much happier than thou in this , that we are very content with the little that we have ; and believe also once for all , I pray , that thou deceivest thyself greatly if thou thinkest to persuade us that thy country is better than ours .
For if France , as thou sayest , is a little terrestrial paradise , art thou sensible to leave it ?
And why abandon wives , children , relatives , and friends ?
Why risk thy life and thy property every year , and why venture thyself with such risk , in any season whatsoever , to the storms and tempests of the sea in order to come to a strange and barbarous country which thou considerest the poorest and least fortunate of the world ?
Besides , since we are wholly convinced of the contrary , we scarcely take the trouble to go to France , because we fear , with good reason , lest we find little satisfaction there , seeing , in our own experience , that those who are natives thereof leave it every year in order to enrich themselves on our shores .
We believe , further , that you are also incomparably poorer than we , and that you are only simple journeymen , valets , servants , and slaves , all masters and grand captains though you may appear , seeing that you glory in our old rags and in our miserable suits of beaver which can no longer be of use to us , and that you find among us , in the fishery for cod which you make in these parts , the wherewithal to comfort your misery and the poverty which oppresses you .
As to us , we find all our riches and all our conveniences among ourselves , without trouble and without exposing our lives to the dangers in which you find yourselves constantly through your long voyages .
And , whilst feeling compassion for you in the sweetness of our repose , we wonder at the anxieties and cares which you give yourselves night and day in order to load your ship .
We see also that all your people live , as a rule , only upon cod which you catch among us .
It is everlastingly nothing but cod —cod in the morning , cod at midday , cod at evening , and always cod , until things come to such a pass that if you wish some good morsels , it is at our expense ; and you are obliged to have recourse to the Indians , whom you despise so much , and to beg them to go a -hunting that you may be regaled .
Now tell me this one little thing , if thou hast any sense :
Which of these two is the wisest and happiest — he who labours without ceasing and only obtains , and that with great trouble , enough to live on , or he who rests in comfort and finds all that he needs in the pleasure of hunting and fishing ?
It is true , that we have not always had the use of bread and of wine which your France produces ; but , in fact , before the arrival of the French in these parts , did not the Gaspesians live much longer than now ?
And if we have not any longer among us any of those old men of a hundred and thirty to forty years , it is only because we are gradually adopting your manner of living , for experience is making it very plain that those of us live longest who , despising your bread , your wine , and your brandy , are content with their natural food of beaver , of moose , of waterfowl , and fish , in accord with the custom of our ancestors and of all the Gaspesian nation .
Learn now , my brother , once for all , because I must open to thee my heart : there is no Indian who does not consider himself infinitely more happy and more powerful than the French .

Is the proton losing weight , or has the fabric of the Universe changed ?
How heavy is a proton compared to an electron ?
The answer seems to have changed over the past 12 billion years .
© Punchstock
It seems that nothing stays the same : not even the ' constants ' of physics .
An experiment suggests that the mass ratio of two fundamental subatomic particles has decreased over the past 12 billion years , for no apparent reason .
The startling finding comes from a team of scientists who have calculated exactly how much heavier a proton is than an electron .
For most purposes , it is about 1,836 times heavier .
But dig down a few decimal places and the team claims that this value has changed over time .
The researchers admit that they are only about 99.7 % sure of their result , which physicists reckon is a little better than ' evidence for ' but not nearly an ' observation of ' the effect .
If confirmed , however , the discovery could rewrite our understanding of the forces that make our Universe tick .
Fickle forces
This is not the first time physicists have suspected physical constants of inconstancy .
In 1937 , the physicist Paul Dirac famously suggested that the strength of gravity could change over time .
And arguments about the fine - structure constant , α , have raged for years ( see ' The inconstant constant ? ' ) .
The fine - structure constant measures the strength of the electromagnetic force that keeps electrons in place inside atoms and molecules .
Some physicists have argued that the equations describing our Universe allow for variance in the relative masses of a proton and electron .
In fact , they have said , this value could theoretically vary more than α does , and so might be easier to pin down .
Times they are a -changing
To look for such variation , Wim Ubachs , a physicist from the Free University in Amsterdam , the Netherlands , and his colleagues studied how a cool gas of hydrogen molecules in their lab absorbed ultraviolet laser light .
The exact frequencies of light that are absorbed by each hydrogen molecule ( H 2 ) , which is made of two protons and two electrons , depend on the relative masses of these constituent particles .
Then they compared this result with observations of two clouds of hydrogen molecules about 12 billion light years away , which are illuminated from behind by distant quasars .
Although the light changes frequency on its long journey through space , researchers at the European Southern Observatory in Chile were able to unpick what the original frequencies absorbed by the hydrogen were .
Ubachs ' comparison suggests that over this vast timescale , which is most of the lifetime of the Universe , the proton - to - electron mass ratio has decreased by 0.002 % .
The scientists report their research in Physical Review Letters1 .
Constant craving
Ubachs says that his team 's laser measurements are hundreds of times more accurate than previous laboratory data .
This improves their detection of the mass ratio effect by a factor of two to three .
" They 've done the best job of anyone so far , " agrees John Webb , a physicist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney , Australia , who has studied changes in both the proton - electron mass ratio and the fine - structure constant2 , 3 .
So what could be causing the ratio to change ?
Both Ubachs and Webb say that it is unlikely that protons are losing weight .
Instead , some theories suggest that extra dimensions occupied by the particle might be changing shape .
Or perhaps it 's a consequence of the speed of light slowing down , or general relativity behaving in odd ways .
" We just do n't know what the explanation is , " Webb admits .
Firm it up
ADVERTISEMENT
If Ubachs ' finding is confirmed , it would be an " experimental foundation stone " for physics , says Webb .
Ubachs says that the observations could be improved or confirmed by looking at hydrogen clouds in the lab over a time period of , say , five years , but with a billion times greater precision .
This would remove the difficulty of working out the precise wavelength of very dim light after it has passed through billions of light years of space .
But it could also remove the effect altogether .
" It may be that it was only in an early epoch of the Universe that the value changed , " suggests Ubachs .

This article originally stated that Ubachs ' measurement was thousands of times more accurate than previous attempts to compare proton and electron masses .

A Viacom spokesman said the company had repeatedly asked YouTube to filter out its programming automatically , but that Google had not responded .
" They choose not to filter out copyrighted content , " said the spokesman , Carl D. Folta .
He added that the company apparently had the technology to filter out pornography and hateful material , which is rarely seen on YouTube .
Chad Hurley , the co-founder and chief executive of YouTube , said the company was still working on its filtering technology .
He said it had agreed to use it to identify and possibly remove copyrighted material from Warner Music , and it would discuss a similar arrangement with Viacom as part of a broader deal .
Mr. Folta said he found that stand unacceptable .
" They are saying we will only protect your content if you do a deal with us — if not , we will steal it . "
Whether YouTube is stealing content by serving up clips of copyrighted programs is very much up for debate .
Like most big Internet companies , Google claims it is protected by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , so long as it removes material whenever a copyright owner requests it .
John G. Palfrey Jr. , the executive director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School , said Google may well be able to use this defense , but " I do n't think the law is entirely clear . "
And if Google loses , " the damages could get astronomically high , " he said .
Viacom 's move comes at a time when it and other media companies have contemplated creating a service to rival YouTube .
There have been on - again , off - again negotiations among a variety of companies , including the News Corporation , NBC Universal and the Walt Disney Company .
Palestinians walk next to a section of the separation wall in the West Bank village of Al - Ram , north of Jerusalem , 20 February 2007 .
( MaanImages / Moti Milrod )
Bulletin # II - 2 - Main Findings , February 2007
75 % of Palestinians do not think that [ in principle ]
Israel has the right to exist , 70 % support One State
In the period 12 - 15 February , 2007 , Near East Consulting ( NEC ) conducted a phone survey of over 1200 randomly selected Palestinians in the West Bank , the Gaza Strip , and Jerusalem of which 806 were successfully completed .
It is worth noting that the margin of error is +/- 3.4 % with a 95 % confidence level .
51 % of Palestinians feel less secure since the January 2006 elections , as compared to 48 % last month , and 44 % in December 2006
The majority of Palestinians ( 85 % ) of the Palestinians continue to be either extremely concerned ( 55 % ) or somewhat concerned ( 30 % ) about the current situation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip .
This constitutes a decrease of 6 % since NEC ’s January 2007 survey
19 % are concerned because of the economic hardship that their household is facing ( +1 % since January ) , 31 % are concerned because of the general absence of security for their families ( +5 % since January ) , while 29 % remain concerned because of the internal power struggle ( - 13 % since January )
Despite the recent Mecca agreement , 75 % continue to feel insecure with respect to themselves , their family , and their property ( +1 % since NEC ’s January 2007 survey )
82 % of the Palestinians believe that the Executive Force should be integrated within the other security forces ( +3 % since January )
While in NEC ’s January 2007 survey , 43 % of Palestinians believed that a civil war was likely , since the Mecca agreement 77 % think that this likelihood has decreased , 8 % believe that the likelihood of a civil war since the Mecca agreement has increased , and 15 % feel that it remained the same .
The Mecca agreement and the future developments
The overwhelming majority of Palestinians ( 94 % ) support the Mecca agreement .
79 % believe that the Mecca agreement will hold .
Equally , 79 % believe that the envisaged Unity government in the Mecca agreement will succeed .
63 % believe that the embargo against the PA will be lifted as a result of the Mecca agreement .
20 % believe that Fateh most benefited from the Mecca agreement , 19 % feel that Hamas most benefited from the Mecca agreement , while 38 % believe that both benefited equally .
Although originally not an option to answer in the survey , 23 % of the respondents insisted that the Palestinian people most benefited from the Mecca agreement .
Despite the optimism surrounding the potential of the Mecca agreement , an exact equal percentage of Palestinians as last month ( 76 % ) believe that the crisis between Fateh and Hamas will end .
In other words , the Mecca agreement did not further influence Palestinian perceptions on this issue .
Factions and leaders
Between trust in Abu Mazen and trust in Ismael Hanieh , 51 % most trust the former , while 49 % most trust the latter .
However , when - more generally - Palestinians are queried about their trust in Palestinian personalities , 22 % most trust Ismael Hannieh , while 19 % most trust Abu Mazen .
Some of the other personalities who receive trust from a proportion of the Palestinian people include : Marwan Barghouti ( 16 % ) , Khaled Masha’al ( 9 % ) , Mustafa Barghouti ( 8 % ) , and Mohammad Dahlan ( 6 % ) .
Although his name was not included in the list of Palestinian personalities , 9 % of the respondents still insisted that they most trust the late President Yasser Arafat .
Very similar to NEC ’s January 2007 results , 43 % believe that the people in their neighbourhood mainly trust Fateh , 33 % believe that they mainly trust Hamas , while 21 % believe that the people in their neighbourhood do not trust any faction .
Personally , 34 % of the respondents place their trust in Fateh ( a drop of 6 % in comparison with NEC ’s January results ) , 28 % most trust Hamas ( compared to 26 % in January ) , while 33 % do not trust any faction ( an increase of 6 % since last month ) .
In other words , last month ’s high level of trust in Fateh has receded as an increasing percentage of respondents again opt not to trust any of the existing factions .
The Palestinian - Israeli context
70 % support a peace settlement with Israel , compared to 72 % in January 2007 and 77 % in December 2006 .
51 % believe that Hamas should change its position towards the elimination of Israel ( a drop of 5 % since January 2007 , and a 10 % drop since December 2006 ) .
63 % of Palestinians believe that Hamas should use all its efforts to reach a peace agreement with Israel .
85 % of Palestinians believe that there is a Palestinian peace partner .
This indicates an increase of 8 % since December 2006 , and is the most positive answer since NEC began asking this question in its May 2006 survey .
Meanwhile , 26 % believe that Palestinians have a peace partner in Israel .
This indicates a downward trend as in December 2006 still 30 % believed that there was a peace partner in Israel , while this was this the case for 36 % of Palestinians in November 2006 .
The current results consist of the least pronounced belief that there is a peace partner for Palestinians in Israel since August 2006 ( at the height of Israel ’s war against Hezbollah ) .
62 % of Palestinians support[ed ] the planned meeting on 19 February between Abu Mazen , Ehud Olmert , and Condaleeza Rice .
While principally 75 % of Palestinians do not think that Israel has the right to exist , 70 % support a one - state solution in historic Palestine where Muslims , Christians and Jews live together with equal rights and responsibilities .
Poverty conditions
The percentage of Palestinians who live under the poverty line is lower than previous months and it stands now at 64 % ( 32 % are hardship cases and 32 % are below the poverty line ) .
Supporters of Fateh seem to be less privileged than other respondents .
While the national rate for those below the poverty line is 64 % , the percentage is 67 % for Fateh supporters and 62 % for Hamas supporters .
This tendency has been rather consistent every month since March 2006 .
Writing Is Easy When It ’s Over
Writing is easy .
All you do is sit staring at a blank sheet of paper until the drops of blood form on your forehead .
Gene Fowler , Screenwriter , Director , Author
Let ’s face it .
Everyone can think of things we ’d rather do than write .
Writing is work , even when it comes easily .
We have to get the words down in the right order .
We have to check that they ’re all there and spelled correctly .
We have to make sure that they make sense to people who are n’t us .
Those are a lot of things to do when we might be doing something more fun , such as having a life .
Why do I write ?
I just ca n’t let opportunities fly right by me .
10 Reasons to Get Jazzed about Writing
Why do folks write ?
They know that words have power .
That a word well - placed and well - written can bring visibility and attention to them , their business and their brand .
They know that writing is an incredible tool that reaches farther than other forms of conversation do .
Even video , well - done , is written first .
We write because writing is power .
Here are 10 reasons to get jazzed about writing .
1 . In today ’s universe , writing is your voice .
Not to write is close to having laryngitis .
The ability to write is critical .
You learn it same way you learn to play the guitar–by practice .
If you want to communicate when the spotlight falls your way , you need to be writing “ solos ” now .
2. Writing can reach an unlimited audience .
More people can access what you have to say when they can read it .
Your audience can read what you write on their own terms , in their own time frame .
3 . Writing allows you to think before you speak .
One beauty of writing is that you can edit before people hear what you say .
The uhs and ums , the wild digressions , and off - base thinking can stay a secret between you and your delete key .
You end up looking smarter , and your audience ends up thinking you are too .
That ’s power .
4. Writing lasts to become an asset .
The words you craft today will still be available to you again and again .
One investment pays you back with many returns .
You can repurpose your writing to fit new situations .
You can make it last to serve you and your business as long as you need it to .
5 . Writing is free promotion .
Offer quality , relevant content to an audience who needs it , and they ’ll be coming back to see you again .
Your name , your business , and your brand will gain a following from the writing that you did .
6 . Writing increases the visibility of your brand .
Writing great content means search engine ranking and link popularity .
Whether you ’re looking for a new job or promoting your business , high visibility is currency in the knowledge universe .
Employers and clients are using search engines to check out relationships .
You do it .
Do n’t you ?
7 . Writing lets people know you as an individual .
You become the one and only you .
If I never wrote a word on this blog , how would you know who I am ?
Need I go on ?
8. Writing forces you to think through ideas .
When you leave your ideas in your head , it ’s easy to think you know them inside out .
Often after writing something , we know it better than before we started .
9 . Writing lets you define the big idea of your brand .
Whatever subject you write about will soon become what you are thought of as an expert on .
10 . Writing is networking with content .
Writing opens doors .
People read and answer back .
All people tend to see others who think like they do as being smart .
Some of those readers will become friends and business contacts .
I can think of so many reasons to write , and I get jazzed about the doors that each piece I write might be opening .
Now as I finish this post , I have one more page in my archives .
It ’s like one more dollar in my promotional bank account .
I can repurpose it and use it again and again .

In an interview with Austrian public television ORF , which was aired on Tuesday , Natascha Kampusch said she was still plagued by her ordeal and found it tough adjusting to her new , free life .
She said she had difficulty eating , going out alone or being in large crowds .
She now lives alone in Vienna and has access to counselors to help her recover .
Kidnapped in 1998 , Kampusch was forced to live in a basement cell for eight years .
Her extraordinary escape in August made headlines around the world .
Kampusch 's life is the subject of a recent book by two British journalists .
Natascha's September interview on ORF
Another similar case
Not unlike Kampusch , then 13 - year - old Stephanie Rudolph -- a German -- was seized on her way to school in Dresden in January .
During her five weeks of captivity , her kidnapper repeatedly raped her .
Rudolph managed to drop a note on the sidewalk during a rare walk with her abuser .
A passerby spotted it and alerted police , who freed her after several bumbled attempts .
Rudolph likewise gave an interview in late September -- shortly after Kampusch 's first one on ORF -- to German public broadcaster ZDF .
Rudolph 's captor was given the maximum sentence last week of 15 years in prison .
DW - WORLD .DE spoke with German child psychologist and trauma expert Christian Lüdke about the effects of going public with such dramatic events .
DW - WORLD.DE : Is it damaging to the girls to give public interviews ?
Christian Lüdke
Christian Lüdke : Both are victims of unbelievably violent acts .
Their childhoods were ended brutally and abominably .
They were traumatized and need protection and a sense of security .
In general , I think it is right to give the victims a voice , to allow them to speak in public about what happened to them , but only when they are truly ready and when it is beneficial to them .
In Natascha 's case , she gave the interview when she was still in shock , in Stephanie 's case , while the trial was underway .
It was as though they should sell their souls in the way they were asked to divulge information to the public .
The German public broadcaster ZDF requested my opinion about Stephanie Rudolph appearing on their talk show , and I strongly advised against it .
I believe such an appearance takes away from the magnitude of the situation ; it belittles it .
The girls present themselves as stable individuals who have hardly been hurt at all .
The culprit is then affirmed in a certain way , and the whole situation appears less dramatic than it actually was .
Millions tuned into Natascha 's first interview in September
But in both of these cases , the girls approached the media , and not the other way around .
In Natascha 's case , her advisors said the paparazzi was chasing her and rather than giving in to them , the whole business could be turned upside down .
In my opinion , that was the wrong advice .
They could have simply published a picture of Natascha , and protected her that way .
I found it appalling that during the interview she just suppressed the horrible events .
In the end , it was as if a fairy tale were being presented .
People wanted to see a fairy tale and they got it : it was as if a girl like " Sleeping Beauty " had suddenly appeared after 100 years .
She 's pretty , she 's eloquent , and people end up forgetting that she has been brutally abused .
And Stephanie ?
I think it was her father 's interests which were being served , and her lawyers ' -- they wanted to be in the limelight .
Stephanie should have been protected more and been given peace and quiet , and not been confronted with the whole situation again , especially not with the culprit .
Again , it is right to give victims a voice , but not in such a way that other people gain attention for it .
That is reprehensible -- both from a professional and a human standpoint .
It is a form of victim abuse .
Nonetheless , could the girls ' interviews perhaps have helped other victims of violent acts who may have been watching ?
There were probably thousands of people watching who may have experienced something similar -- abuse , rape , being held involuntarily -- but I do n't believe that Natascha 's and Stephanie 's descriptions were cathartic for them .
It could n't have been healing for them .
The images just come flooding back , which can lead to further trauma .
The can of worms is opened up again , the show comes to an end , and then they stand there helpless and alone .
That can't be helpful .
Mario Mederake received 15 - years in jail for kidnapping and abusing Stephanie R .
Why are other people interested in watching such interviews ?
They are fascinated by that which is repugnant , but there 's another reason : hearing such stories also offers relief to some people .
They feel relieved that such horrible events have not happened to them or their loved ones .
However , the latest studies show that for many people who are permanently confronted with such violence on television , a slow trauma process creeps up on them -- they gradually lose a sense of security themselves by hearing about such violent acts in the media .
How can one go about the whole issue better ?
I think it 's right to inform the public , and to do it quickly and comprehensively -- to explain what happened to the victims because providing information , after all , also gives people a sense of security .
It 's also right since the perpetrators are so often presented as victors , while the victims are shown as losers .
Actually , I find the victims to be the stronger ones because they have survived , and it takes courage to talk to the public .
But one should respect their boundaries so that an interview does not become another form of abuse .
Also , in Stephanie 's case , she did not appear in court to testify against her captor .
That was the right decision .
She should n't have to confront her victimizer and be traumatized again .
What is a healthy way for victims to try to come to terms with such an experience ?
Such traumatic experiences rob victims of a fundamental sense of security .
The acts imprint themselves on their souls and in how they feel about their bodies .
But every human being has his or her own method of recovery and self - healing .
The most essential thing is that survivors live in a peaceful atmosphere and gain distance to the events .
They should do nice things and not be constantly confronted with the negative experiences .
Young people in particular need a safe environment and reliable people around them who convey a sense of hope .
These young girls will never be able to forget what happened to them , but everyone has the ability to overcome even the most horrible events imaginable given the proper support .
No end in sight for Africa 's suffering masses
By Jeff Koinange
CNN Senior Africa Correspondent
Editor 's note : CNN's Jeff Koinange has spent years covering events from Africa , including visiting war and disaster zones and following the lives of refugees forced from their homes .
Here are his reflections on the U.N. 's World Refugee Day .
ENTEBBE , Uganda ( CNN ) --
Just imagine for a moment that everything you own -- from your hard - earned money to your home to your car to little mementos like pictures on the wall -- has just been taken from you by a group of people who do n't like the way you look or the shade of your skin or the shape of your nose .
Everything gone except , perhaps , the clothes on your back .
You 've been forced to flee , probably separated from your family and end up on the run with a bunch of people you 've never met , but with whom you now share a common goal -- staying alive .
Many hours or even days later , you arrive at a shelter run by an international nongovernmental organization .
You 're tired , exhausted , sick to your stomach and scared to death .
You end up sharing a tent with 40 to 60 other strangers where your bathroom , bedroom and kitchen combined have all been reduced to little more than the size of a normal bed .
( Watch Angelina Jolie reveal what she finds most shocking -- 2:10 )
And this will be your home for the next few months , perhaps years , and in some cases , decades .
This is what it 's like for a person fleeing persecution , war , civil strife , genocide .
Imagine living like this for years if not decades , raising your family in a refugee camp because you can't go home .
Even if you do manage to go home , you learn someone else has taken over your land , your home , your life .
I 've seen that person many times , that face that says , " I too once had it all but one day lost it all . "
Faces of refugees across the Africa I 've been traversing for the past decade and a half , from Liberia and Sierra Leone in West Africa , from Congo to Tanzania in the center of the continent and from Somalia to Sudan in the East .
Their stories are as heartbreaking as they are gut wrenching , lives turned upside down in the blink of an eye .
Living in a stadium sharing a pit latrine
Like the time I ran into Marcus Sawyer , once a wealthy attorney in Liberia 's capital , Monrovia .
Sawyer owned holiday homes in South Africa , an apartment in the south of France , real estate in Dubai .
You name it , he had it .
He had some big clients in the country , including influential government officials .
One day rebels invaded the capital and Sawyer , his family and thousands of Liberians were forced to flee and seek refuge in the city 's soccer stadium , the former home of the national team , The Lone Stars .
Suddenly it was home to more than 50,000 internally displaced people , or " IDPs , " and would become Sawyer 's new residence for the next six months .
" I never imagined in my wildest dreams I 'd end up like this , " he once told me , " sharing an outdoor pit latrine with a thousand people , sleeping in the same room with dozens of strangers .
It takes some getting used to . "
( Watch Dr. Gupta 's heartbreak as disease rips through squalid camps -- 2:50 )
The last time I saw Sawyer he had become a shell of his old self -- dejected , depressed and despondent .
And then there was the time I was in Gulu , in northern Uganda , where I came face to face with a new kind of terror -- and a new kind of refugee .
A town where for 20 years one man has caused untold suffering .
The man 's name is Joseph Kony , a one - time altar boy who claimed to have a vision from God to wage war against the Ugandan government .
Human rights groups say his rebels kidnapped children , brainwashed them and turned them into killing machines responsible for thousands of deaths , their victims often raped and tortured .
Propping up firewood with human heads
I met 19 - year - old Alice Abalo at a rehabilitation center run by the nongovernmental organization , World Vision , for those who escaped .
She was one of the lucky ones who had managed the impossible , fleeing with her 4 - year old daughter , a product of rape .
At first she did n't say much , but when she warmed up , she recounted tales of terror that could make anyone 's skin crawl .
( Watch Alice describe how she was forced to desecrate bodies -- 5:42 )
" One day the group we were in had just killed about six people and proceeded to decapitate them , " she said .
" Then , I was asked to light a wood fire using the victims ' heads as support , the same way one would use three stones .
I still have nightmares of their burning hair and brains oozing out of the burning heads .
It was horrible . "
Alice bore some visible physical wounds of torture , bullet scars on her leg and shrapnel wounds on her chest .
Aid workers said her physical wounds would eventually heal but her mental scars would no doubt last a lifetime .
She was to stay at this center for 45 days and then make her way back to her home in a village 20 miles away -- that was if her home had survived the rebel onslaught .
Trying to annihilate a generation of newborns
And just when it seemed things could n't get more depressing on a continent where misery and hardship are an every day occurrence , I landed in a refugee camp in the town of Bukavu in eastern Congo .
I walked into a hospital filled with victims of rape and mutilation and broke down .
The women here had been forced to flee their villages by marauding soldiers who were n't satisfied with just raping them -- they wanted to annihilate a generation of newborns -- mutilating their mothers by inserting knives , machetes and even pistols and rifles into their private parts after gang - raping them for days .
I have never seen such inhumanity in all my years as a reporter .
And to add insult to injury , when some of these women returned to their villages , they were either shunned by their families for " allowing " themselves to be violated , or they were gang - raped again by some of the same men in uniform .
If I 've ever felt helpless as a reporter , it was in Bukavu -- for these women had nowhere to run , nowhere to call home , and a bleak future that will deprive them of the ability to feel like women again .
In all of my journalistic travels , I can't help but see the images of Africa 's helpless and hopeless , and I can't help but think about what is it that drives man 's inhumanity .
What makes us revert to our basic , animalistic instinct ?
What makes one ethnic group want to destroy another ?
After all , this is the 21st century .
Are we not yet civilized ?
Questions I 'll be asking myself for a long time .
There seems no end in sight for the agony of Africa 's suffering masses .
Angelina Jolie has reportedly offended her ' in - laws ' by refusing to dress her new daughter in clothes bought by Brad Pitt 's parents .
The ' Tomb Raider ' actress , who delivered Shiloh Nouvel in Namibia in May , is said to have balked at the collection of pink , frilly outfits the actor 's mum and dad splashed out on .
Angelina allegedly refused to put the girly garments on Shiloh much to the displeasure of Brad 's parents , Bill and Jane .
A source told Britain 's The Sun newspaper : " Angelina knows her own mind and knows how she wants her children to be dressed .
She does n't like girlie , pink , frilly clothes .
You can see that by how she dresses her adopted daughter Zahara .
She does n't want her babies to be dressed like dolls .
" The actress ' decision has apparently left Bill and Jane - who were famously close to the ' Troy ' actor 's ex-wife , Jennifer Aniston - fuming .
The source added : " I do n't think she realises how much she has upset Brad 's family .
"
In the wake of Brad and Jennifer 's split , Jane was spotted lunching with the former ' Friends ' star and is believed to have kept in contact with her throughout the couple 's divorce .

A while back I argued that once it's freed from the tyranny of channels and schedules , TV would cease to come primarily in half - hour chunks .
Instead , more video content would be in shorter canape - sized morsels , say three , five , or ten minutes in length , better suited to online viewing habits and bite - sized attention spans .
And , sure enough , Al Gore 's Current TV is doing just that ( although why it is n't all stream / downloadable yet is a mystery ) .
They explain :
We slice the rest of the schedule into short pods -- each just a few minutes long -- that range far and wide , from international dispatches to profiles of cool people to intelligence on new trends .
This is not a traditional TV network ; watching Current , you 'll see more , on more topics , from more points of view .
The rise of shorter , smaller content is actually a trend that 's affecting all media and entertainment , reflecting not just the taste of a quick - change generation but also an increasing variety and flexibility in the ways we can consume media .
As we leave the era of one - size - fits - all distribution , we 'll increasingly see the end of one - size - fits - all content .
Indeed there 's an increasing amount of evidence that this is already underway :
Note that this increased range of distribution options can allow for longer content , too , with the rise of TV shows on DVD ( where you can watch much of a season at a single sitting ) as a prime example .
But the overall trend is toward shorter , faster , smaller everything .
We 're increasingly fine - slicing both the time we give media and the media itself .
Small is the new big .
Among the volcanoes in the Cascade Mountains , the long - term average is two eruptions a century .
" That does n't sound like a lot , " John Ewert , a Geological Survey scientist who was involved in assessing the risk posed by volcanic eruptions .
" But when you consider the size of the volcanoes and consider most of them are covered with snow and ice , it becomes a much more significant number . "
An eruption can melt the snow and ice , setting off avalanches and gargantuan flows of debris rolling down the side of the mountain .
But for now , the Geological Survey has few instruments keeping watch over them .
At Mount Shasta in Northern California , there are two seismometers within 10 miles of the volcano and another four within 20 miles .
" And that 's about it , " Mr. Ewert said .
Satellite monitoring might be able to give earlier warning of volcanic activity .
For example , satellites were able to detect a swelling of the South Sister volcano in central Oregon in 2001 .
Swarms of small earthquakes -- usually the first sign of a reawakening volcano -- did not start until three years later .
However , the technique does not work flawlessly ; it did not work at Mount St. Helens , for example .
Many of the scientists now observing Mount St. Helens were there when it erupted in 1980 and continued to observe the mountain as a series of 16 smaller eruptions , some lasting only a few days , continued through 1986 .
Then the mountain fell quiet , and the scientists did not expect another eruption in their lifetimes .
Last September , a swarm of small earthquakes started shaking the volcano .
The first eruption of ash and steam rose upward a couple of weeks later , followed by a flood of reporters who crammed news conferences , asking if another blast like the one of 1980 was imminent .

Mark Twain 's Letters from the Earth is a brilliant and incredibly imaginative take on the story of the Bible itself .
Starting with the creation of the Earth , Twain 's fresh view on the most basic of Biblical doctrine is objectively approached from the perspective of one without any preconceived religious notions .
Composed of prominent figures including Satan himself , the story weaves together a fresh , new slant on God and man .
With his sharp wit , Twain examines Heaven and Earth , and characterizes humanity in such an acute manner , that what he purports unanticipatedly seems obvious .
After reading this book , you will never look at the Bible or mankind the same .
-- Submitted by Janet Schmehl
" Letters from the Earth " is one of Mark Twain 's final assaults on the stupidity and hypocrisy of man and an apparently capricious and malevolent God .
It lacks his customary humor and seems to be written in a tone of outrage .
Satan goes to the earth and sends these letters to his friends , the archangels Gabriel and Michael .
What he finds is a complete disconnect between professed belief and action .
Twain turns accepted doctrines and smug platitudes on their heads to bolster his assertions .
The Problem of Evil has troubled men since Sumerian times at the very latest .
Twain holds
God responsible for creating human nature the way it is and the ' thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to ' as well , and the atrocities of his time are no worse than those sanctioned in the Bible .
If the reader can keep an open mind , some interesting insights and disquieting thoughts might enter .

I first read this book in high school , when I still had a sense of innocence and air of gullibility that is common of young guys of that age .

I enjoyed it immensely then and still do today .

Twain 's Final Vitriol
I could never , and will never , accept LETTERS FROM THE EARTH as anything other than the voice of a Mark Twain crying in a imagined wilderness of despair and confusion .
To him , a man who had given the world so much wit and humor , it must 've appeared as if all the entities of heaven and hell had conspired to play a diabolical joke on him .
The death of his beloved wife Livy and that of his daughters , his financial losses , the infirmities of age , ... all of these had and were taking their toll on him , both physically and mentally .
For an added " laugh , " while Twain 's personal despairs were bringing him to his lowest point , his public acclaim was continually rising to that of legendary status ... people from all over the world loved and admired him .
He was in constant demand by nearly everyone : for his opinions and advice , for his lectures at various universities , for merely his appearance at social events , etc . .
Only his closest friends were aware of the dark and embittered moods of this great man ; they alone knew of his anger toward everyone and everything .
It was inevitable that Twain would desire his bitterness to be made public in one way or another .
Of course , for one such as him this would be the way of the printed word of which LETTERS FROM THE EARTH is the result .
Within the course of its pages , it 's as if he transformed all the love and devotion shown to him into scorn and contempt ... throwing it into the faces of his admirers ; a catharsis for his internal pain and for the irony of his prestige .
This is n't the Mark Twain that brought to life the beloved characters of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn any longer ; it 's a " new " Mark Twain , one that the world would have been shocked to have seen .
I doubt if Twain 's image and mythical persona could have survived such an unveiling ; it 's better for most of us that it was never put to the test .
If anything , it was delayed long enough for Twain 's tragic side to subside into research , footnotes and further reading .
When I was young , I could n't love Twain as much as I did if I knew him too well ; now that I 'm older , I do n't love him any less for knowing him all too well .
I suppose that 's the way I feel about America , wherein Mark Twain played a considerable part .

Abstract : Mini-languages are a visually intuitive , simple , and powerful way to introduce students to programming .
They are a good foundation for general computer science instruction , provide insight into programming for the general population , and teach algorithmic thinking .
The goal of the paper is to provide an extensive review of the mini-language approach to teaching programming .
For different audiences and in different countries , the authors have extensive experience in design and application of mini-languages .
We outline the problems which motivate the application of this approach , present a brief history , review several existing mini-languages , and provide discussion of lessons learned .
In particular , we discuss how to choose a mini-language for a particular group of students and list some requirements for a successful application of a mini-language .
We conclude with a discussion of possible future directions of the mini-language approach development .
There have been many efforts to develop special languages for supporting the initial steps in programming education as an ' easy start ' for novices ( Mendelson , Green , & Brna , 1990 ) .
Genuine insight was given by the " turtle graphics " of Logo ( Papert , 1980 ) .
The success of Logo in general and turtle graphics in particular stimulated the development of the mini-language approach to teaching the principles of programming .
The idea of the mini-language approach is to design a small and simple language to support the first steps in learning programming .
In most of the existing mini-languages a student learns what programming is by studying how to control an actor , which can be a turtle , a robot or any other active entity , acting in a microworld .
Although an actor can be a physical device , the student usually deals with a program model of such a device and observes the behavior of the executive on a screen .
The actor can perform small set of commands and answer several value - returning queries .
Usually the student controls the actor first by giving isolated commands and then by writing small programs on a special miniature programming language .
This miniature language includes commands and queries of the actor and several control structures [ 1 ] .
In this paper we use the term mini-language to name a combination of an actor with a language to control it .
There are multiple worthwhile objectives for teaching mini-languages .
Mini-languages can provide a solid foundation for learning a general purpose language such as Pascal , C , or LISP .
Mini-languages also provide a sound basis for systematic problem solving for people who will program only to customize their spreadsheet , database , or CAD package , or another application program .
Mini -languages open a door to new educational opportunities .
Regardless of the student 's eventual penetration into programming and regardless of the age of the student , there is a positive residue of the study of a mini-language .
It is the acquisition of algorithmic thinking as an explicit , familiar and powerful tool .
This paper provides a review of the mini-language approach .
We outline the problems which motivate the application of this approach , present a brief history of the approach and a review of existing mini-languages and provide an extensive discussion of lessons learned .
In particular , we discuss how to choose a mini-language for a particular group of students and list some requirements to a successful mini-language .
All authors have a deep , positive experience in the design and application of mini-languages for different audiences in different countries .
Our suggestions are based on experience of teaching hundreds and thousands of real students .
We conclude with a discussion of possible future directions of the approach development .
Nowadays , most of the students who start to learn the principles of programming are taught by the old classic approach .
This approach is based on using a general - purpose programming language such as Pascal , Modula - 2 , LISP , or C , a professional programming environment for the chosen language , and a set of problems from the area of number processing and symbol processing .
We believe that the effectiveness of the classic approach is quite low in general , and the younger the students the worse the classic approach works .
In particular , using general - purpose languages creates the following three kinds of obstacles for novice programmers :
General - purpose languages are too big and too idiosyncratic .
The conceptual basis of the language together with the main principles of programming combine to form a large amount of material .
This volume alone makes it difficult to understand the material properly , thereby failing to form a strong cognitive infrastructure .
Instead of emphasizing fundamental principles , the languages evoke secondary notions which reflect the subtleties of the given language and its implementation .
General - purpose languages provide little leverage for understanding their basic actions and control structures .
The languages are not visual and their basic functions are carried out behind an opaque barrier .
Professional programming environments usually do n't provide any visualization capabilities .
With the process of program execution hidden , the student develops an input - output oriented understanding .
In this way the absence of visual feedback hampers mastery of language semantics .
Since general - purpose programming languages are oriented on number and symbol processing , the first possible problems used in teaching the language are far from the students ' everyday experience and are not attractive for them .
Developing applications that are both informative and interesting requires learning a considerable language subset and writing quite a big programs , and this introduces another distraction - the need to master the programming environment .
As a result , the first , difficult steps in learning to program are usually neither well motivated nor supported by work on the computer .
There are two reasons why mini-languages are a good alternative .
One is that they provide a good foundation for general computer science instruction .
The other is that they open a door onto new educational opportunities .
We believe that principles of computer programming is a topic which should be learned starting at the early stages of school .
It provides the basis for logical and abstract reasoning which is fundamental to the learning process .
The first advantage of mini-languages is , as the name suggests , that they are small .
Mini -languages have a small syntax and a simple semantics .
A student , even a very young one , can thus come to grips with the entire mini-language and employ it with interesting results .
In the words of Seymour Papert , students can " expropriate " the mini-language , making it their property .
The time required to master a mini-language itself is small , so the students can spend most of their efforts on more important issues : mastering algorithm development and program design in a university setting or understanding the principles of programming for a more general audience .
A second important advantage is that mini-languages are built on metaphors that are intrinsically engaging and visually appealing .
It is possible to create rich sets of problems that both cover the fundamental ideas and dovetail with the students life experiences .
This causes students to want to expropriate a mini-language .
The operations performing by the actor are always naturally visible revealing the semantics of language constructs .
Visual queues enable the novice to understand semantics of introduced constructs , elucidate principles of program structure and execution .
protecting them from developing misconceptions .
Visibility provides a feedback for exploratory learning and problem solving .
Visual metaphors make it easier to develop interesting problems for important concepts .
Problems that achieve visible and meaningful results aid concept mastery by reinforcing them with problem solving activities .
Another important advantage is that the designer of a mini-language is not restricted to the syntax and semantics of any " big " language , which may not be suitable for novices .
As a language designed especially for an educational purpose and for a well defined audience , a mini-language can take advantage of the narrow definition of the class of its users by using students ' native language for keywords and providing only data types and control structures essential for these students .
In the same way , the designer of a programming environment for a mini-language can take advantage of the small size and known audience of the language and design a highly attractive and effective environment .
The development of the mini-language approach was seriously influenced by turtle graphics of Logo ( Papert , 1980 ) .
In some sense , the turtle graphics set can be considered the first example of a mini-language .
Logo was not designed especially for the purpose of teaching programming but the " turtle subset " appears to be a good tool for introducing programming to novices , and it strongly contributes to the overall incredible success of Logo .
Logo provides genuine insight for further development of mini-languages , however Logo turtle graphics is not the best example of mini-language .
Note that unlike most of the actors of mini-languages described below , the turtle of Logo is " blind " , it can't check its microworld .
The " turtle subset " also does not support such classic control structures as Pascal - like if and while .
To introduce these constructs the language needs to contain some predicates which provide feedback when controlling the actor .
The first and still the most popular real mini-language Karel the Robot was designed by Richard Pattis as a " gentle introduction " to Pascal for university students taking their introductory programming course .
Karel the Robot was completely described in a book with the same name ( Pattis , 1981 ) written by Pattis , who also designed the first programming environment for Karel .
Karel contains all important Pascal - like control structures and teaches the basic concepts of the notions of sequential execution , procedural abstraction , conditional execution , and repetition .
The overhead of full high level programming languages is reduced as there are no variables , types or expressions in Karel .
The actor , robot Karel , performs tasks in a world that consists of intersection streets and avenues , walls , and beepers .
Karel can also carry some beepers in his " bag " .
The main actions of Karel are move , turnleft , pickbeeper , and putbeeper .
A set of 18 predicates allows Karel to check the state of his microworld .
For example , Karel can determine the presence of nearby walls , if there are any beepers in his bag or at his location , and the direction he is facing .
By writing programs that cause Karel to perform carefully selected tasks , students gain experience with the fundamentals while using a pleasant and persuasive metaphor .
Karel the Robot has been very important both as a mini-language and in stimulating other work .
The following are several mini-languages that were directly inspired by Karel and use some of its features : Martino ( Olimpo et al. , 1985 ) and Marta ( Calabrese , 1989 ) in Italy , Darel ( Kay & Tyler , 1993 ) in Australia and Karel - 3D ( Hvorecky , 1992 ) in Slovakia .
Original Karel the Robot is now in use in many universities and colledges in USA .
A new edition of the Karel the Robot book has been issued recently ( Pattis , Roberts , & Stehlik , 1995 ) .
Figure 1 : Karel the Robot
Karel - 3D ( Hvorecky , 1992 ) is an extension of the idea of Karel the Robot .
Karel - 3D expands original Karel into several directions to make it more suitable for special audiences such as preschool students or secondary school pupils .
The robot can move in the 3 - dimensional space displayed in a separate window .
Other windows are used for typing programs , for menus and for context - sensitive help .
The robot can lay a brick , stand on it and ( as a result of repeated actions ) to move up and down .
Thus , the movement of the robot is also " three - dimensional ' " .
The robot obeys either pressing keys ( in a steering or navigation mode ) or commands ( in a programming mode ) .
A family of languages is created in this way .
Small children use steering , older ones start with programming .
Many Czech and Slovak schools use Karel - 3D as their first ( and sometimes the only ) programming language .
Karel - 3D is supported by a textbook ( Gasparovicova & Hvorecky , 1991 ) .
Figure 2 : Karel - 3D
Marta ( Calabrese , 1989 ) is a screen robot based on Logo and is similar to the robot Karel .
It can be used as a soft introduction to programming from pre-school age to adults .
Being written in Logo , Marta offers the following advantages over Karel :
Marta can be driven in navigation mode with single keystrokes which makes it suitable even for preschool children ,
Marta can build her world since she can put or remove walls ,
Marta can be driven in the dark where the obstacles and beepers are not visible although they are still there ,
new commands and operations can easily be defined by writing Logo procedures ,
several levels of programming are available : one - line programs , multiple - line programs , and Logo procedures .
The only limitations with respect to Karel are that Marta 's world is bounded to a 7x15 grid and that she can not put down more than four beepers at an intersection .
Some mini-languages were designed independently of Karel but with some influence of Logo .
One example is Josef the Robot ( Tomek , 1982 ; Tomek , 1983 ) designed by Ivan Tomek .
Josef was designed at the same time as Karel and its philosophy is a combination of Logo and the ideas used in Karel namely the idea of a rich microworld of Logo and the idea of preparing the user for programming constructs of conventional languages as in Karel .
Josef provides a relatively rich microworld - a robot living on the screen and capable of graphics and other operations , particularly in a simulated real world represented by a map .
It uses constructs similar to conventional languages and advanced concepts such as interrupts .
One of the features intended to avoid syntactic difficulties that obscure the essential concepts of problem solving by programming is that variables and procedure arguments are untyped .
Several mini-languages were designed and used widely in the USSR where the book of Pattis was not available .
Three of them are Wayfarer , Turingal , and Tortoise .
Some more information about Russian mini-languages can be found in ( Brusilovsky , 1990 ) .
Wayfarer was suggested in 1980 to support a new course on programming for the students of the Mechanics and Mathematics department of the Moscow State University ( Kouchnirenko & G. , 1988 ) .
The goal was to challenge the students from the first lesson with a set of interesting problems .
This set of problems concentrated on the task of controlling a simple actor " Wayfarer " moving on a checked field with walls .
The solutions were written in a simple mini-language called MINI containing if - then - else and while - do statements , procedures without parameters , commands and queries to an actor .
Several years of experience proved that 4 - 6 weeks of work with Wayfarer give the student a solid ground for the study of general notions of programming .
The Turingal mini-language ( Brusilovsky , 1991 ) was designed in 1983 for computer science students of the Moscow State University .
This language is a way to control the well - known basis of algorithmic theory - the Turing machine which works with a tape of symbols .
The elementary operations of the mini-language are simple and visual : the movement left and right along the tape and typing the symbols on the tape .
To control the machine , Turingal offers a set of control structures ( conditional statement , loops , case ) and subroutines , with syntax and semantics similar to the structures of PASCAL ( Turingal = TURING machine + pascAL ) .
One of the main reasons for presenting the mini-language is to bring the student to the mastery of the semantics of these well - known structures before starting to learn Pascal .
The Tortoise mini-language was designed to support a part of the computer literacy course for 14 - 15 - year - old students in Russian schools .
It is similar to the Turingal , but adds some features which make it attractive for younger students .
For example , the tape of symbols was substituted by a two - dimensional field of symbols .
After more then ten years from the appearance of mini-languages it 's the time now to summarize some lessons learned .
The authors of this paper have had positive experience using different mini-languages in different countries for different audience .
Comparing and analyzing our experience can draw some generalizations .
This section discuss several aspects of mini-language development and application .
The mini-languages applied by the authors of this paper are designed for different age groups , ranging from elementary school students ( Marta and Karel - 3D ) , through secondary school ages ( Tortoise and advanced versions of Karel - 3D ) to college freshmen ( Wayfarer , Turingal and Karel ) .
All authors reported success in engaging their audiences and in teaching problem solving and fundamental principles .
In this sense the mini-language approach is a kind of " silver bullet " which gives good results in teaching the principles of programming for different audiences .
At the same time there is no " right " or perfect mini-language .
There are different mini-languages and they suit different needs , because the type of an actor and the set of mini-language control structures depend on the age , background , interests and learning goals of the student .
For example , when one of the authors tried to redesign the Turingal mini-language environment used previously in the university for school students who were three years younger , he had to redesign the executive and the microworld as well .
The Turing Machine executive with a one - dimensional tape microworld which was used in the Turingal mini-language does not seem to be interesting for the majority of 14 years old students who never had a course on the theory of algorithms .
The new mini-language called Tortoise adds two - dimensional world , color and sound to the classic Turing machine to make the microworld attractive for these students .
Another example shows that an actor can be extended to accommodate the extended learning goals .
Several years ago the paradigm of actor - executive supported originally by the Wayfarer was applied in secondary school course Foundations of Computer Science and Technology ( Kouchnirenko , Lebedev , & Svoren , 1993 ) .
The main idea was to use executives to motivate the introduction of variables , arrays , and simple calculation procedures .
To support it the Wayfarer was replaced by a more powerful executive Robot in a richer microworld .
For example , Robot can measure the " temperature " and " radiation level " at the current position of the field .
The audience can differ in the overall goal of using the mini-language .
There are two main reasons to apply the mini-language approach .
First reason is to support an introductory computer science course in a university setting .
Here a mini-language can be used to provide a " gentle introduction " into one of the general purpose programming languages ( Pattis , 1981 ) and to support mastering such general skills as algorithm development , program design , and program debugging ( Comar & Pintelas , 1989 ; Ferguson , 1987 ; Kay & Tyler , 1993 ) .
Second reason is to support the language - independent learning of the principles of programming and algorithmic reasoning ( Brusilovsky , 1991 ; Gasparovicova & Hvorecky , 1991 ; Olimpo et al. , 1985 ) .
In the early stages of mini-language application the first goal dominated .
At present , the second goal has become more important as the principles of computer programming is a topic which should be learned widely ( and probably at the early stages of school ) , since it provides the basis for logical and abstract reasoning which is important in any learning process and everyday life .
Note that the application of a mini-language is never the goal itself , but a method of mastering a set of notions and skills .
If this set contains not only programming concepts , but also some concepts from another domain , a mini-language might be useful to learn this domain ( as Logo is used to learn geometry ) .
There is , for instance the mini-language SOLO aimed at the student of psychology ( Eisenstadt , 1983 ) .
Some features of mini-languages are important for success .
The mini-language should be simple in both its syntax and semantics .
Simplicity is essential - see the classic paper ( du Boulay , O'Shea , & Monk , 1981 ) for the discussion of simplicity .
The mini-language should be naturally visible most operations performed by the actor should make visible changes in the microworld represented on the screen .
The mini-language should be attractive and meaningful for the intended category of students .
A good example for it is Japanese Algo - Arena ( Kato & Ide , 1993 ) mini-language system applying the metaphor of Sumo wrestling , which is meaningful and appealing for young Japanese students , or another system ( Comar & Pintelas , 1989 ) applying the metaphor of shopping in supermarket .
The above requirements stem from the very idea of a mini-language .
Other desired features are not so obvious and stem from experience .
The mini-language should be conversational as Basic or Logo .
It means that any mini-language command can be executed in both navigation mode ( single command execution ) and programming mode ( complete program execution ) .
Our experience shows that immediate execution and navigation modes are important for young audience .
The original Karel did not support a navigation mode , but both extensions of Karel for primary and secondary school students , Karel - 3D and Marta , add this feature .
A mini-language should be modular language .
It should contain a mechanism for creating abstract instructions ( procedures ) .
All the procedures should be independent units .
Such a procedure can be considered as a new command of the actor , which can be used in both navigation and programming mode .
The procedures designed for a particular problem can be later re-used for solving subsequent problems .
Logo , Karel , Josef and Wayfarer provide good examples of modular languages .
An important lesson is that selecting a mini-language approach is not enough for successful teaching the principles of programming .
The learning should be supported by a good programming environment .
Such an environment should keep both the microworld and the student program visible on the screen .
The program should typically be executed one instruction at a time , while the interpreter highlights programming constructs in the source code as they are being executed and the effect is simultaneously shown in the microworld .
This makes the connection between a mini-language command or construct and its effect on the microworld obvious .
The interpreter should also provide visualization for those concepts of the language that are not visualized by the microworld .
Important features include visualization of variables and the stack of subroutine calls .
The environment should also provide a structure editor , to increase student productivity , and enable the student to concentrate on the more important parts of problem - solving .
The structure editor protects the student from making most syntax errors and provides immediate diagnostics for the remaining ones .
Providing menus or hot keys , the structure editor also solves the contradiction between the requirements to enter the constructs easily and giving them meaningful names .
A related useful component of the environment is a graphical program design tool .
Such a tool makes the program structure visible and understandable for the student .
A good example of a mini-language programming environment with all the desired features is provided by Karel Genie ( Miller et al. , 1994 ) a novice programming environment for the Karel mini-language .
To support the novice programmer , the Karel Genie provides a set of specially designed tools , which include a structure editor , a program decomposition view for both looking at and editing programs , and a runtime system with advanced visualization tools .
The Karel Genie is an integrated programming environment .
Editing the program , executing the program and taking a high level view of the call structure are all presented within a single user - interface , allowing students to move from one activity to another with little cognitive overhead .
Karel Genie structure editor provides maximum support to the novice programmer since program construction can be conducted entirely through menu interaction .
As novices develop expertise they begin to exploit Karel Genie 's text edit features .
The Karel Genie graphical program design tool lets students decompose a problem into simpler sub - problems by dragging the mouse from the program root .
Karel Genie is highly visual and successfully uses multiple representations .
This is clearly illustrated in Karel Genie 's runtime system .
Code is highlighted as it is executed .
At the moment a " move " is executed in the code window , a Karel icon moves in the world .
Selection , repetition , and recursion are similarly visually reinforced .
This is extremely valuable in teaching basic concepts as well as in introducing powerful and " advanced " concepts such as loop invariance .
Karel programs can be single stepped and run either forward or backward .
The runtime environment also has a visual call stack .
This makes procedure invocation and return clear .
Figure 3 : Karel Genie : Editor + Design View Used + Run Time with Tracing Call Stack
The Karel Genie has been in use in secondary schools and universities throughout the US for nearly ten years .
In addition to CMU it has been used in computer science classes at Harvard University , New York University , Stanford University , Swarthmore College , Ohio State and a number of other institutions .
Thus a good mini-language is important , but not enough for success .
A programming environment is very important too .
In particular , just applying the Logo language with its famous Turtle graphics for teaching programming is often not enough .
In recent papers , Logo authorities argue the importance of extended programming environments for Logo with variable visualization , stepwise execution , and even a program design tool ( da Rocha , 1993 ; De Corte , 1993 ) .
We should note that most of recent successful mini-language environments ( Karel - 3D , Tortoise , KuMir ) include both a structure editor and a runtime system with extended visualization .
For example , in Karel - 3D the text of any program can be created as a combination of commands and tests taken from menus .
Problems that children have with typing are avoided this way .
The programming mode contains various debugging and visualization tools .
The execution of a program can be slowed down or speeded up , if necessary .
The executed commands can be highlighted .
A good mini-language should be complemented with a good set of attractive and meaningful problems for students to solve .
Problem solving is the most effective way of mastering the mini-language and , consequently , supporting important concepts .
The set of problems must contain the problems of various complexity ( be ready also to challenge top 10 % of your students with attractive but difficult problems ) and cover all important concepts .
These problems must be interesting for the student both from the point of the goal to be achieved , and the process of solution development .
Sometimes these problems look as a puzzle rather than a ' serious ' programming task and the problem - solving activity becomes a kind of a game .
We recommend keeping the set of attractive problems in mind when designing a mini-language .
A mini-language that looks very attractive but for which a sufficient number of problems are not available looses its attractiveness very quickly .
Often the choice of an actor is driven by the goal of making the set of problems the student is expected to solve attractive and meaningful .
Compare , for instance , two problems :
( a) For given matrix A find some pair ( i , j ) such that A ( i , j ) =0 ;
( b) Move Robot to some position where radiation level is equal to zero .
The mini-language augmented with a good set of problems can support problem - driven learning , when the student is presented with a new meaningful problem and a new language construct is then introduced which helps to solve the problem .
This approach has been used fruitfully in the textbooks ( Kouchnirenko & G. , 1988 ; Kouchnirenko , Lebedev , & Svoren , 1993 ) .
The above considerations concerns traditional minilanguages which can be described as " one microworld - many problems " .
There is however an opposite approach " one microworld - one problem " , where the microworld is oriented on solving one , though difficult , problem , like finding an exit from a labyrinth .
A good example of it are TRAPS ( Witschital , Stiege , & Kuehme , 1989 ) system where the task is to move an actor through the playing board filled with various obstacles , and Algo - Arena ( Kato & Ide , 1993 ) where the task is to control a Sumo wrestler .
Here the student learns to program by solving more and more complex subproblems of the problem , or solving the problem for more and more complex configuration of the microworld as in TRAPS , or designing more and more complex and better program solutions as in Algo - Arena .
A limited set of problems in these systems is compensated by an attractive and meaningful microworld .
We think that the systems of this kind can be suitable to support a small course on the principles of programming for a young audience .
Several mini-languages with different actors can be used sequentially or simultaneously in an introductory programming / design course for computers science university students .
It can be several regular mini-languages ( Kouchnirenko & G. , 1988 ) or several one - problem mini-languages as suggested in ( Comar & Pintelas , 1989 ; Ferguson , 1987 ) .
Different microworlds can be used to stress different aspects of the subject ( for example floating point numbers ) or to teach different parts of it .
Here the problem is that understanding of a new mini-language requires considerable amount of time and mental efforts .
The application of any additional mini-language should be justified .
Two lessons learned from the experience are : once started to use a mini-language the student expected to use it for a considerable amount of time ; the miniature languages to control different actors should be similar ( at least should have the same control structures ) .
An approach very similar to the mini-language approach is the sub- language approach .
The idea of the sublanguage approach is to design a special starting subset of the full language containing several easy to visualize operations .
Such a subset can support the first steps of learning programming and helps later in introducing more complex programming concepts .
The sub - language approach was also influenced by the turtle graphics of Logo .
A set of four " turtle " commands of Logo provides the first example of a sub-language .
Usually the sub - language approach applies the same idea of an actor in a microworld , and the starting subset is really a set of commands and queries performed by the actor .
Moreover , the same kind of actor can be controlled by a mini-language , or by a sub-language .
The sub - language approach differs from the mini-language approach in one important feature .
While the mini-language approach uses a special miniature language with its own commands and control structures , the sub - language approach provides only a set of commands and queries as an extension of some " big " programming language .
These commands and queries are used in combination with standard control structures of the " big " language .
A good experience in designing sub- languages has been accumulated in Russia .
The programming environment KuMir which supports the Russian secondary school course on " Foundations of Computer Science and Technology " ( Kouchnirenko , Lebedev , & Svoren , 1993 ) applies several interesting actors ( each one can be considered as a sublanguage ) within the same educational programming language ( E - language ) .
KuMir is an integrated educational environment , combining a text editor with zero - response - time incremental compiler and a simple debugger .
The basic philosophy which governs KuMir is that the language has a compact core which can be dynamically extended by loading one or more separately prepared modules -- executives providing new microworlds and actors , or even new numerical packages and abstract types of data .
This approach allows easy customization of the system .
The school teacher can start with one of the traditional actors like Robot then add more sophisticated options ( Kouchnirenko , Lebedev , & Svoren , 1993 ) .
On the university level the special packages like complex and rational numbers or plane geometry can be added .
During the last three years KuMir has been used at the Department of Mathematics of Moscow State University in support of undergraduate courses of mathematics .
We think that the sublanguage approach is often better when the student 's direct goal is to learn a particular big language .
The student can learn most of the control structures and operators of the language more easily with the help of the visible subset .
However , if the goal in not to learn a particular language but to learn the principles of problem solving by programming which can later be followed by learning a " real " language , the mini-language approach is better .
Using sub-languages can be recommended for the university introductory programming courses .
Here the sub - language approach can be successfully combined with using several actors for different purposes ( as in KuMir ) .
This paper discusses only the approaches related with teaching procedural paradigm languages .
The mini-language approach however can be applied successfully with other paradigms .
An example of applying the mini-language approach for teaching parallel programming paradigm is the Robot Brothers project ( Olimpo , 1988 ) .
Three good examples of mini-languages designed to support object oriented paradigm are Playground ( Fenton & Beck , 1989 ) and Gravitas ( Sellman , 1992 ) , and KidSim ( Smith , Cypher , & Spohrer , 1994 ) .
The latter mini-language can also serves en example of learning some physics concepts ( laws of gravitation ) along with the principles of programming , and as an example of how to design an attractive mini-language for a particular category of students .
Several authors consider object - oriented mini-languages as most natural and suitable way to teach introductory programming and " control technology " to younger students ( Kato & Ide , 1993 ; Resnick , 1990 ; Whalley , 1992 ) .
When teaching the principles of programming for a very young audience of 7 to 9 years old , special attention should be paid to the attractiveness of an actor .
A good way to make an actor attractive for young students is using a real world actor - some real computer controlled device as the first " real turtle " of Logo .
A good step towards real world actors is done by robotic toys as Lego - Logo .
Robotic toys can provide good motivation to learning for a very young audience .
The authors think this is an area that should receive more attention .
Special work has to be done to make real world actors not only attractive , but also really useful in learning general concepts .
In particular , robotic toys can be naturally applied to support learning the object - oriented paradigm .
Some encouraging results in this area were reported recently ( Whalley , 1992 ) .
Another example is the use of robotic toys by a concurrent extension of Logo called MultiLogo to teach the principles of concurrent programming ( Resnick , 1990 ) .
Interesting results in making " real world programs " , i.e. constructing a program as a real world artifact assembled from modules are reported in ( Kato & Suzuki , 1993 ) .
Real world actors and real world program are not only more attractive , but also support collaborative problem solving activity .
A promising way of further development of mini-language programming environments is to extend it with intelligent tutoring component and hypermedia component .
Intelligent tutors have shown impressive results in mathematics and programming .
By connecting intelligent tutoring to mini-languages it is conceivable that learning can be improved by an order of magnitude .
Intelligent computer tutors can decrease the amount of non-creative work of the human tutor and reserving the teachers time to work with students who have special needs .
Intelligent tutoring components provide the required amount of guidance : suggest the next concept to learn or the problem to solve according to the student 's current knowledge , assist the student in the problem solving process , diagnose the student 's solution .
First examples of creating an intelligent tutors for mini-languages were reported in ( Brusilovsky , 1992 ; Dion & Lelouche , 1988 ; Witschital , Stiege , & Kuehme , 1989 ) .
The hypermedia component extends the space of exploratory learning , providing student - driven access to conceptual knowledge and examples .
Recently a hypertext component was designed for KuMir programming environment and the hypertext electronic version of the textbook ( Kouchnirenko , Lebedev , & Svoren , 1993 ) is now under development .
Some ideas about integration of a programming environment , a hypermedia component , and intelligent tutoring systems into a single system can be found in ( Brusilovsky , 1993 ) .
All the authors of the paper , i.e. five university teachers , representing four different nations , using similar - but distinct mini-languages report positive results from using mini-languages .
However all our findings and recommendations are results of experience rather then rigorous empirical evaluation .
It is time to investigate such claims empirically and report the findings .
There are very few papers at present that report any results of classroom studies or special experiments with mini-languages .
For example there was special empirical evaluation to study how skills learned in Karel are transferred to other problem solving settings ( Scheftic & Goldenson , 1986 ) , or how the visual nature of the Tortoise minilanguage helps student in debugging their programs ( Brusilovsky , 1994 ) .
We believe it would be of great value to the larger educational community to study the mini-languages in a rigorous and repeatable way .
Much research and development work have been done in the field of teaching introductory programming and a number of powerful environments have been created .
Teaching programming to beginners was often used as a testbed to apply new creative ideas about how programming should be taught .
It is time now to transfer these ideas and experience to " real life " in the following two senses .
First , these excellent novice programming environments should leave laboratories and universities where they have been developed and find their way to schools , universities and homes .
Here the role of software companies is important .
Good examples are the Karel Genie and KuMir which are both used widely outside the place they were developed .
But even here additional efforts are needed to turn these environments into programming products that can be bought in a store .
Second , current " big " programming environments such as Borland Pascal should learn some lessons from best novice environment experience .
Although current programming environments provide debuggers operating at source code level and capable of step - by - step execution with display of current data values , they still lack many useful features that exist in the environments we have described above .
Good examples of programming environments for professional languages that have most of the required features discussed above are Pascal Genie ( Miller et al. , 1994 ) from Carnegie Mellon University and PascalMir and FortranMir from Moscow State University .

Most mini-languages include all basic control structures ( conditional execution , looping , recursion , etc. ) and a mechanism for creating new instructions ( or other kind of sub- programs ) .
Most fans of the popular sitcom Seinfeld recall a subplot from a November 1997 episode in which Jerry and George plied Jerry ’s girlfriend Celia with a dinner of wine and turkey in the hopes that the combination of alcohol and tryptophan ( along with some of George ’s boring home movies ) would put her to sleep , enabling them to play with her vintage toy collection ( which she otherwise would n’t let them touch ) while she snoozed :
Thus did Seinfeld reinforce to yet another generation of viewers the widespread bit of lore holding that something in turkey induces sleepiness , making those who partake of the bird unusually drowsy .
In this instance lore somewhat intersects with science , but not nearly to the extent claimed in popular belief .
Turkey does contain tryptophan , an amino acid which is a natural sedative ( to the extent that L - tryptophan has been marketed as a sleep aid ) ; but to put an ordinarily awake person into a state of slumber it would generally have to be consumed on an empty stomach , in combination with little no other protein ( which limits the absorption of tryptophan by the body ) , and in amounts larger than are typically gobbled even during a holiday feast .
That lazy , lethargic feeling so many celebrants are overcome by at the conclusion of a festive seasonal meal is usually due not specifically to the turkey on the dinner menu , but to a combination of drinking alcohol and overeating a carbohydrate - rich repast ( as well as some other factors ) :
Two other factors that contribute to the desire to sleep at the dinner table are meal composition and increased blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract .
Studies have shown that a solid - food meal resulted in faster fatigue onset than a liquid diet .
The solid - food meal also causes a variety of substances to jump into action that ultimately leads to increased blood flow to the abdomen .
This increase in blood flow and an increase in the metabolic rate for digestion can contribute to the “ coma . ”
Those who still feel wary of turkey ’s purported sleep - inducing properties should note that many other items we commonly eat contain tryptophan .
Milk , cheese , beef , chicken , pork , and beans are among the foodstuffs that house this amino acid , and experts say the average serving of chicken or ground beef contains about as much tryptophan as does a serving of turkey .
If tryptophan were truly the sandman ’s henchman , we ’d all be falling asleep at the wheel on our way home from KFC or McDonald’s .
As Drs. Carroll and Vreeman note in their book Do n’t Swallow Your Gum !:
The truth is , turkey is not to blame for your sleepiness .
Chicken and ground beef contain almost the same amount of tryptophan as turkey — about 350 milligrams per 4 - ounce serving .
While you might have heard someone claim that turkey made them drowsy , you have probably never heard someone say that chicken , ground beef , or any other meat made them sleepy .
Swiss cheese and pork actually contain more tryptophan per gram than turkey , and yet the American classic , a ham and cheese sandwich , somehow escapes blame .
The amount of tryptophan in a single 4 - ounce serving of turkey ( 350 milligrams ) is also lower than the amount typically used to induce sleep .
The recommendations for tryptophan supplements to help you sleep are 500 to 1,000 milligrams .
People still feeling anxious about the prospect of tearing into a drumstick and suddenly being overcome by an irresistible urge to nod off should consider that those who took tryptophan - based supplements as sleep aids were , on the average , ingesting between 500 and 2,000 milligrams of L - tryptophan daily .
Four ounces of turkey contains only about 350 milligrams of tryptophan , and ( unlike people taking tryptophan - based supplements , who take them every day ) most folks do n’t ingest that much turkey every day of the week .
1. initialize
To create a new object in Ruby you invoke the new class method like so : c = Car.new ( " Toyota " )
Naturally you think the constructor would be defined in a method called new , right ?
Or just maybe a method called Car like in Java ?
But no , instead it has to be called initialize .
2. Weak typing
even better
4. Global variables
Did n’t somebody tell me Ruby was an object - oriented language ?
5. puts
Do we have to copy C’s most ungrammatical , pointless method names ?
6. Zero-based arrays
C arrays began at zero to match memory addressing .
In a weakly typed scripting language , there ’s exactly no reason to do this .
There has n’t been for decades .
Ca n’t we please start the arrays at 1 where God intended ?
Has n’t anyone read Numerical Recipes ?
Are n’t we tired of fencepost errors yet ?
7. elsif
Sorry . “ elsif ” is not a word in the English language , and it should n’t have been one in Ruby .
Would typing one extra letter have been so onerous ?
e
8. $_
Global variables suck .
Did I say that already ?
Global variables you did n’t actually create and that pop up out of nowhere suck even worse .
And global variables whose names are indistinguishable from line noise suck still more .
Java ’s verbose , but that verbosity is in the service of legibility .
Ruby ’s compactness all too often serves only to obfuscate .
9 . Methods are public by default
10 .
No package access or friend functions .
There ’s no access in - between public and private .
All too often different classes in the same library / application / codebase need more detailed access to their other parts than the general public should have .
Ruby provides no way to manage this .
Just about every developer at some point has used a library or a component developed by someone else .
Just about every developer at some point has also gotten frustrated with the library to the point of being willing to find the guy who decided to make a method private and talk some sense into him .
Well , most of us would n't go that far , but it would certainly be nice to be able to change things that make our lives miserable .
It 's not that libraries are written by mean people ; it 's just that even the brightest designers are unable to foresee all the possible ways that other developers would want to use their code .
-- Hacking Java Libraries
Conclusion
Right on .
That 's annoying .
Ahhh ...
I have promised not to write the same essay more than four times in any twelve - month period .
Let 's agree that Ruby would beif there was some sort of type inference system that does n't require type declarations everywhere .
Matz was clearly in Raymond Chen mode when he put all the perlisms in the language .
As an application developer , I do n't use any of them .
But I 'll accept it on faith that there are people using Ruby as a scripting language who like them .
But I do n't have to like them .
See above .
But with extra pursing of the lips .
Zero - based arrays are a perfect example of a leaky abstraction .
Back in the days when programmers all wore beards and C was the new kid on the programming block , zero - based arrays were really just a funny kind of macro for performing a multiply and add on an integer that you hope is a pointer .
No really , it 's true .
Go ahead , look it up .
I 'll wait .
Okay , I agree with Rusty and then some .
I 'm perfectly okay with a new language using 1 - based indexing .
I think I can get over the momentary unfamiliarity as I untrain my brain to stop doing this unnatural zero - based thing .
Getting this wrong is almost a rite of passage when learning Ruby .
Annoying .
But not fatal , fortunately .
At least Ruby does n't assume elsif is a new variable declaration .
I hope .
See above , again .
I really suspect that the Perl - style stuff is of value when writing one - liners on the command line .
It probably does n't belong in an application longer than a page .
I would normally say " so do n't use them , " but there is a small problem with globals : at least one , $= , affects the default behaviour of a kernal function : regular expression matching .
For that reason , I consider it a little dangerous .
I can live with built - in global variables that are , essentially , syntatic sugar for functions .
But I 'd rather that they not be syntatic sugar for method calls that change global state .
No doubt you cannot have one without the other and thus I dislike them as well .
Now about the lack of object orientation .
It looks like other langauges have exactly the same problem .
What 's with all the singletons out there ?
And what happens when you call java.lang .
System.setProperty (...) ?
It seems that programmers like this stuff , no matter how bad it is for them .
Which reminds me , ribs for lunch today I personally do n't care one way or the other about what the default access is , but I think Rusty has been perfectly cogent when presenting his argument in favour of restricting APIs as much as possible .
And he goes further to suggest that restriction should be the default .
Shrug .
After all , you can choose what you want .
Is there something drastically wrong with assuming that if a programmer writes a method with the default ( public ) visibility , that the programmer knows what she is doing and wants it that way ?
Uh , oh .
I think I 've also written this essay before .
Let 's move on .
But I 'll put this one down as a tie .
I think Ruby would be a perfectly fine language if you had to take more care to make methods public .
By the way , is there a resonance between this perspective and with the way you can declare that certain Rails controller actions must be invoked with PUTs or via XmlHttpRequest ?
( Something I find quite interesting : most of the Java programmers I have met do not use Java 's ' default ' visibility .
But back to the subject at hand . )
There are a lot of security measures you have to put in place if your objective is to hobble programmers .
Even then you may find they are motivated to work around the constraints you are attempting to impose :
In addition to providing various access constraints , you also have to put together security mechanisms like enforcing sealed packages .
Within the Java world , researchers are also proposing sealed classes and even sealed methods .
Now I 'm not going to say that just because someone can hack around your mechanisms that the mechanisms are bad .
I 'm perfectly okay with a language that gives you nothing better than a glorified annotation , the equivalent of a post - it note on your ham sandwich saying " mine ! do n't touch !!
" It 's useful to document your intentions , even if perfect enforcement is elusive .
That being said , I 'd like to close with the wise words of another : Less is More .
For some people , fine - grained access control is important .
But adding that feature is not free .
Given the current culture of Ruby programming , I 'd say that additional access control would be expensive if you go down the rabbit hole of trying to stop people using Ruby 's meta- programming strengths to hack around your restrictions .
However , lightweight mechanisms for access control and managing name spaces could be useful .
As I suspected before I wrote this , I agree with more than half of Rusty 's observations .
Is n't this always the way ?
Most people have far more in common with each other than not .
One of the reasons I read Rusty 's work so carefully is that he has a markedly different viewpoint than my own .
It 's nice to read all the nice affirmation from people who seem to value the same things I value , but there is always an opportunity to learn something profound when looking at the same things from a different perspective .

What is a disease ?
FOR PATIENTS , disease puts a name to an affliction .
It answers that question we all face at one time or another :
What 's the matter with me ?
If there is a clear and precise explanation for what 's wrong , then surely there is an equally clear way to get better .
At 228 pounds , Karen Cunningham knew she was n't in great health .
The owner of a small transcribing business in Louisville , Kentucky , Cunningham had gained 60 pounds during pregnancy in 1991 and just could n't shake the weight .
She always felt fatigued , and her hands and feet were often swollen .
Doctors blamed it on her weight .
" They said I just needed to lose the excess and I 'd be fine , " she recalls .
Eventually , various specialists ( rheumatologists , endocrinologists , internists ) offered various diagnoses ( high blood pressure , hypothyroidism , osteoarthritis ) and prescribed various medications ( Synthroid , Celebrex ) .
But nothing worked .
" I was really at the end of my rope , really thought whatever I had was going to kill me , " she says .
" And it would have , had I not found out what the problem was .
You can't fight an enemy when you do n't know who he is . "
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
The breakthrough came last December when her new endocrinologist diagnosed her with something called metabolic syndrome .
She 'd never heard of it .
As she Googled to learn more , her chronic ailments – the weight , the high blood pressure , the lack of energy – started to make sense .
They even seemed treatable .
She 's now on Glucophage and Avandia ( which both regulate blood sugar ) and has lost 20 pounds by cutting out carbohydrates .
" Getting a diagnosis was a relief , " Cunningham says .
" I have hope now , whereas I did n't have any before . "
Cunningham is among the first wave of Americans to be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome , a condition that , though only concretely defined five years ago , is now said to afflict as many as 75 million Americans – whether they know it or not .
We sit , indeed , amid an epidemic of metabolic syndrome , a fact all the more remarkable because so few people are familiar with it .
For this is no virus on the loose , no plague that has spread unchecked .
Rather , metabolic syndrome is just a new way to think about a cluster of well - known and increasingly prevalent conditions .
Metabolic syndrome is characterized by five risk factors : high blood pressure , high blood sugar , high triglycerides ( fatty acids in the bloodstream ) , low HDL ( " good " ) cholesterol , and obesity .
Of the five , obesity – which is itself often referred to as an epidemic – is the most important , because the rise of the morbidly overweight is directly driving the rise in the syndrome .
Metabolic syndrome is , in fact , almost indistinguishable from obesity – at least 85 percent of those who have the syndrome are obese or overweight .
The tidiness of that correlation makes it tempting to view metabolic syndrome not as an emerging fact of medicine , but as a fiction , wholly devised and disseminated by the pharmaceutical industry .
After all , drug companies have long eyed obesity as the ultimate growth market – and they just happen to have an arsenal of pills poised to target it .
Such cynicism is n't misplaced .
The drug industry is among the most profitable in the world ; pharma 's knack for generating money makes oil companies look like lemonade stands .
Drug firms owe their prodigious success to doing one thing exceptionally well .
R&D ?
No – marketing .
And as perfect an opportunity as obesity might be , it 's also a legitimate health crisis that 's only getting bigger .
The one snag is that most people do n't consider being fat a disease , they see it as a lifestyle problem .
Which explains the appeal of metabolic syndrome .
It 's a simple , compelling concept that reframes the issue in scientific terms .
But is it real ?
In some ways , no .
You can't see metabolic syndrome through a microscope , or detect it through a single blood test .
Since it 's a checklist of risk factors rather than symptoms , it stretches the way we think of disease .
It 's very much a human invention , a " syndrome " – that term researchers assign to things they do n't quite understand .
But in other ways , it 's absolutely real .
Though championed by drug companies , it 's been defined and recognized by legitimate health organizations .
And it 's definitely unhealthy .
You can't die of metabolic syndrome , but you can die of what it leads to : diabetes and heart disease .
And even if metabolic syndrome is just another term for obesity , it would n't be the first condition of daily life to become a disease .
Alcoholism , clinical depression , and gastritis were all once considered personal problems that are now recognized as legitimate medical disorders , with all the trimmings of diagnosis , treatment , and pharmaceuticals .
Many of these new illnesses , like osteoporosis , are widely accepted .
Others , like fibromyalgia and female sexual dysfunction , remain fuzzy quasi diseases with shaky standing in the medical community .
The question now is whether metabolic syndrome will become accepted – or whether it will be dismissed as bad medicine , the product of an overeager illness industry .
Proponents of the concept , including the American Heart Association and the World Health Organization , say the disease illustrates the cutting edge of diagnostics .
It exists because we 're only now recognizing that some very bad conditions can cluster and compound one another .
Certainly metabolic syndrome is compelling to researchers :
In the past five years , it has been the subject of no fewer than 15,000 studies , a number that puts it among the most researched conditions in medicine .
But some wonder if metabolic syndrome really identifies anything new .
Skeptics , which include the American Diabetes Association , suggest that researchers , physicians , and pharmaceutical companies have been so hasty to embrace the disease ( each for their own reasons ) , they 've overlooked evidence that the science behind the diagnosis is flimsy and conjectural .
These critics say that so - called metabolic syndrome lumps together risks we already recognize and monitor – or worse , that it 's just a fancy way to describe obesity .
By accepting it , we medicalize a lifestyle condition that we already know how to treat : with diet and exercise .
The debate is hardly academic .
The pharmaceutical industry has spent millions of dollars developing dozens of drugs aimed at obesity generally and metabolic syndrome in particular .
Many of those drugs are now or will soon be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for approval .
At the same time , the industry is lobbying the FDA to recognize the syndrome as a disease and to reconsider its approach to obesity drugs , a shift that would accelerate demand for new drugs .
Metabolic syndrome , in other words , could be the great disease of our age .
Or it could be a sign of how diseased our age is , a demonstration of how certain we are that there is always a scientific explanation , a diagnosis , and perhaps a pill for what ails us .
Either way , metabolic syndrome is a disease whose time has come .
What is a disease ?
FOR DOCTORS , disease identifies why people are sick and suggests a course of treatment .
For researchers , disease fixes an area of investigation , a mystery to be studied in the hopes of finding a cause or , perhaps , a cure .
Scott Grundy is the Billy Graham of metabolic syndrome .
A longtime cardiologist and researcher , and director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas , Grundy is often found these days on the dais , spreading the good word .
Over the last six months , he 's discussed the syndrome at the Metabolic Diseases Drug Discovery and Development World Summit , the Obesity , Lifestyle , and Cardiovascular Disease Symposium , the Targeting Metabolic Syndrome conference , and other events worldwide .
He 's been evangelizing like this since 2001 , when he chaired a National Institutes of Health panel on cholesterol education .
The project was created to draw the public 's attention to the dangers of high cholesterol .
In its discussion of the risks for heart disease , the panel 's report ( known as the ATP III ) called out a metabolic syndrome , a condition that , as Grundy put it at the time , " is as strong a contributor to early heart disease as cigarette smoking " – a remarkable statement , considering how established the risk from cigarettes was and how few in the medical community had even heard of metabolic syndrome .
Grundy was already a recognized pioneer in heart disease and cholesterol research when the ATP III report came out .
In the early 1990s , he spearheaded the research proving that statin drugs lower cholesterol levels ( statins , which include medications like Lipitor and Crestor , now generate $ 25 billion annually in sales ) .
Now he 's back in the vanguard , having written or cowritten about 90 papers on obesity and metabolic syndrome in the past five years .
The NIH first sounded the alarm on obesity rates in 1977 , when the proportion of overweight or obese people in the US stood at about 40 percent .
Today , two out of three Americans fall into that category , a statistic that makes obesity the most pressing public health issue of our day , Grundy says .
" Have you ever been to the Orlando airport ?
Taken a look at the size of those people ?
This is n't going away . "
And , he adds , we have a good idea of their fate :
They 're more likely to develop diabetes ( the number of diabetics in the US has almost doubled in the past decade , nearly all due to obesity ) and more likely to die of heart disease than those who are not overweight .
Boosting awareness of the syndrome , Grundy believes , may be our best chance to defuse this time bomb .
By inserting a new disease into the causal chain , at a point before obesity turns into diabetes or heart disease , millions of at - risk people can be identified and treated .
For many , a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome can get them off the couch in a way that a doctor tut - tutting about their extra pounds cannot .
It was 1988 when Gerald Reaven , an endocrinologist at Stanford , saw a cluster of symptoms that seemed to arise out of insulin resistance and dubbed it " syndrome X . "
Over the next decade , researchers began using terms like " insulin resistance syndrome " and " metabolic syndrome X . "
In 1998 , the World Health Organization , noting the same cluster of risks , offered physicians a checklist of conditions that make up " the metabolic syndrome . "
The ATP III followed in 2001 , identifying five factors – low HDL , high blood pressure , high triglyceride levels , high blood - sugar levels , and abdominal obesity – as the defining criteria for the syndrome .
Meet any three of the five criteria and you have a diagnosis .
( Though the multiple - choice route seems kludgy , it 's not without precedent : Rheumatic fever and systemic lupus are likewise diagnosed through a mix - and - match of criteria . )
The ATP III codified what might have seemed like common sense into a new and suddenly dangerous ailment .
With a bit of math , it became clear that metabolic syndrome was ubiquitous :
As many as 50 million Americans fit under the umbrella ( as the definition 's cutoff points were tweaked , the number would climb to 75 million ) .
People with the syndrome are twice as likely to die from – and three times as likely to have – a heart attack or stroke compared to people without it , according to the International Diabetes Federation ( which offered its own definition of the condition last year ) .
It 's a disease more prevalent than arthritis and asthma combined .
In short order , the metabolic syndrome industry was thriving .
The WHO assigned it an International Classification of Disease code – a crucial step that let physicians diagnose and refer to it in insurance documents .
Conferences , research , and drug development followed .
" A few things came together , " Grundy says .
" One , metabolic syndrome was becoming very common ; with the rise in obesity , we 've seen a rise in all these risk factors .
Two , the drug companies saw an opportunity for new drug development , to see if they could target several things at once .
So obesity is driving the syndrome , and also driving interest in the syndrome . "
Indeed , by last year , many pharma insiders were betting that FDA recognition of the disease as a legitimate drug target was imminent .
NOT EVERYONE IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY jumped on the bandwagon .
In 2003 , Richard Kahn , chief scientific and medical officer for the American Diabetes Association , began looking into the syndrome .
He reviewed five years of research – some 10,000 papers in all – in order to assess whether the diagnosis had any clinical value .
Was the syndrome , he wondered , a better indicator of long - term risk than any of the individual risks ?
In other words , was the sum greater than its parts ?
Kahn 's results , published in September 2005 as a joint statement of the ADA and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes , stunned the medical establishment :
He found no proof that a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome better predicted long - term cardiovascular disease .
" We found that the metabolic syndrome has been imprecisely defined , " Kahn and his coauthors wrote .
" There is a lack of certainty regarding its pathogenesis , and there is considerable doubt regarding its value as a cardiovascular disease risk marker . "
The statement continued : " Our analysis indicates that too much critically important information is missing to warrant its designation as a ' syndrome . '
Until much - needed research is completed , clinicians should evaluate and treat all cardiovascular disease risk factors without regard to whether a patient meets the criteria for diagnosis of the ' metabolic syndrome . ' "
A skeptic by nature – he's a committed atheist and seems to be always itching for a debate – Kahn is proud of the work .
" We irrefutably present the evidence , " he says .
" As a way of saying you 're at risk for something , it 's a very poor predictor . "
He insists he did n't set out to take down Grundy or the American Heart Association , which has championed the concept .
And he agrees that the risks underlying the syndrome are real .
But Kahn says he grew alarmed that " a research tool " meant to draw attention to the obesity problem was hardening into a diagnostic set of rules .
" It became codified into an explicit disease , and then the train left the station .
But the definition is arbitrary , it 's pulled out of the air . "
A month after the ADA statement , the AHA fired back with a response ( written primarily by Grundy ) rejecting Kahn 's analysis and reasserting the syndrome 's value .
Reaven weighed in with a paper titled " The Metabolic Syndrome : Is This Diagnosis Necessary ? "
( No , he concluded , siding with Kahn . )
Kahn came out with another paper , titled " The Metabolic Syndrome ( Emperor ) Wears No Clothes . "
Grundy followed , declaring that " the common clustering of metabolic risk factors in obese persons is a fact of American medicine . "
As the spitballs flew , the medical community gawked at the spectacle of two of the world 's largest and most powerful medical organizations engaged in a highly public dispute .
To some degree , Kahn 's gambit has worked .
The ADA statement " really put the brakes on things , " says Donny Wong , a drug industry analyst who specializes in metabolic and obesity markets .
The lack of consensus means some physicians and insurers are n't on board – that , Wong says , prevents pharmaceutical companies from maximizing the metabolic syndrome market , which he estimates could be as big as $ 18 billion annually .
But Kahn 's crusade has n't doused enthusiasm altogether .
Time and again , physicians – scientists !
– brush off his data with a hem - haw reply that the concept helps get people 's attention .
At the ADA 's annual meeting in June , Kahn took the " con " side in a debate over metabolic syndrome .
His data and presentation impressed , even intimidated , the audience .
Until one doctor piped up that , whatever the data , his patients find the syndrome a useful concept .
Kahn was clearly exasperated : " You ca n't invent something just so you can treat patients , " he appealed to the crowd .
" Medicine is n't supposed to work that way . "
And yet it does .
Clearly , there 's something about taking high blood pressure and obesity and calling it metabolic syndrome that makes it different – even if it 's unclear what that difference is .
For Karen Cunningham and thousands like her , terminology matters .
Likewise for physicians .
In a doctor 's office , Grundy says , " physicians see a patient with diabetes or hyperglycemia and they focus so much on that , there is a real danger they will ignore blood pressure or lipids .
It becomes tunnel vision .
By saying that these all go together as metabolic syndrome , some of us believe it leads doctors to look at the whole patient and this patient 's total risk . "
Eager to paper over their dispute , executives at the ADA and the AHA have found common ground by focusing on obesity .
In a joint statement released this past summer , they referred to " many unresolved scientific issues " about the syndrome , but emphasized that the core risk factors stem from the upsurge in obesity .
" The growing prevalence of this condition , " the statement concluded , " threatens to undermine all of our recent gains to prevent and control chronic disease . "
But obesity is an old saw .
No matter how many times obesity makes the covers of Time and Newsweek , it 's been impossible to change the public 's impression that being fat is simply a lifestyle issue , one that comes down to personal responsibility .
If obesity is a health care crisis , the thinking goes , it 's one of our own making .
That 's what makes metabolic syndrome so compelling :
It takes personal responsibility out of the equation .
Turning the epidemic of obesity into a slightly smaller epidemic of metabolic syndrome puts it in the province of science , not lifestyle .
With science , we 're not confined to a futile path of diet and exercise .
With science , we get drugs .
What is a disease ?
FOR THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY , it 's a business model .
Disease offers an opportunity to develop and market drugs that help people get better and , along the way , help companies make a profit .
In the late 1980s , researchers at the St. Louis University School of Medicine were investigating a question that had inspired decades of dorm - room symposia :
Why do pot smokers get the munchies ?
The answer , the researchers discovered , is that the active ingredient in marijuana , THC , attaches itself to specific receptors in the brain , stimulating appetite .
These receptors form what became known as the endocannabinoid system – a body - wide network that interacts with pain , memory , and hunger .
Soon , pharmaceutical companies began developing endocannabinoid blockers , under the hypothesis that if engaging the receptors stimulates appetite , then blocking them would curtail it .
In 1996 , the French pharma Sanofi-Synthelabo ( now Sanofi - Aventis ) began animal trials testing an endocannabinoid antagonist known as rimonabant .
The results were encouraging : Obese mice given rimonabant ate less and lost 18 percent of their body weight .
Then , in 2001 , Sanofi began four human trials involving more than 6,600 patients ; these were the largest obesity drug trials in history .
The results were again impressive : Patients who took rimonabant for two years , combined with some diet and exercise , lost an average of almost 14 pounds – about 10 pounds more than those with the same routine taking a placebo .
What 's more , rimonabant does n't just promote weight loss .
It improves HDL cholesterol and reduces insulin resistance .
In other words , it 's an ideal match for metabolic syndrome .
Rimonabant has side effects – some patients reported increased depression and moodiness – but it 's still hailed as the blockbuster drug of the decade .
" We 've been working on this problem for 20 years ; we went through dozens and dozens of candidates , " says Lou Aronne , director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Program at Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan and a lead investigator in one of the rimonabant studies .
" Rimonabant hits the right receptors for the right problem .
It 's no different than finding the statins , " the class of drugs developed for cholesterol treatment .
The cholesterol analogy is apt in many ways .
For 50 years , high cholesterol was simply one of several risk factors for heart attack and stroke , along with high blood pressure , smoking , and stress .
You treated it by changing your lifestyle .
But the discovery of statins in the mid-1990s gave physicians a way to control cholesterol levels , and high cholesterol became more like a disease ( now called hypercholesterolemia ) .
Today , statins are the biggest drugs in the pharmaceutical industry ; Lipitor sales alone will hit $ 13 billion this year .
Metabolic syndrome is in a similar position today .
Should the right drugs come along , the metabolic syndrome market " promises to be as big or bigger " than cholesterol , Pharmaceutical Executive magazine predicted a couple of years ago .
And rimonabant , also known by its brand name , Acomplia , may well be the first of those drugs .
JP Morgan analysts predict that rimonabant sales could hit $ 5 billion a year .
That potential has spurred Sanofi , the third largest pharmaceutical firm in the world , to launch a two - tiered campaign .
First the company is promoting the drug itself , spreading the word about rimonabant in the medical and financial communities .
( The company has drawn criticism by announcing its rimonabant results at industry conferences rather than in academic peer - reviewed journals . )
But instead of offering rimonabant as just the latest obesity drug , Sanofi is laying the groundwork for the medical community to recognize metabolic syndrome – a disease that just happens to be treatable with rimonabant .
The company 's education program includes sponsoring conferences , funding research , and providing certification courses for physicians .
In the exhibit hall at this summer 's American Diabetes Association conference , for instance , Sanofi set up a multimedia display on the endocannabinoid system , complete with polarized glasses and a 3 - D movie .
There was plenty of literature on cardiometabolic risk and metabolic syndrome on hand , but there was no mention of the drug that might treat it .
" Being the first one to come out , the burden of education is on us , " a Sanofi spokesperson says .
Sanofi's campaign was supposed to culminate this year with the FDA 's approval of rimonabant to treat obesity , and perhaps this new disease , metabolic syndrome .
But in February , Sanofi announced that while the FDA had found rimonabant " approvable , " the agency had additional questions and conditions before rimonabant could actually be approved .
The company and the FDA wo n't comment , but there 's speculation that the drug 's reported depressive side effects might be a concern .
In early August , the company told financial analysts it remains " hopeful and confident " that rimonabant will be approved in the US ( it went on sale in Europe this summer ) .
But that 's unlikely to happen until 2007 .
In the drug industry , finding disorders like metabolic syndrome is known as " developing new disease markets " or " branding a condition . "
Industry critics have their own term for it : " disease mongering , " they say , shaking a finger at pharmaceutical firms for devising treatments for normal conditions of life – menopause , anxiety , obesity .
But as tempting a villain as the drug industry makes , it 's not so clear that obesity is , in fact , a normal part of life .
Blame corn subsidies or videogames or PepsiCo , but obesity has transformed our nation in the past 30 years .
Diet and exercise ?
It 's easy to recommend , and it 's good in theory , but there 's surprisingly little proof that lifestyle intervention actually works as a weight - loss strategy .
In the late 1990s , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initiated its Diabetes Prevention Program , a $ 174 million study hoping to prove that behavioral changes can induce weight loss .
To make the point , the program went to extremes .
The 3,000 participants received gym memberships and personal trainers , had their food provided , and were coached with daily phone calls from nutritionists – all for two years or more .
After all that hand - holding , patients lost an average of 7 percent of their body weight .
The CDC hailed the study as proof that diet and exercise work , but it just as readily proves the opposite .
After all , how likely is the average American to stick with – let alone be able to afford – such an intensive program ?
" It 's very easy to point the finger and blame people for not exercising enough , " says Aronne .
" But we 're beginning to understand that there are metabolic issues going on . "
" THE FUTURE OF OBESITY IS DRUGS . "
So proclaims Richard Atkinson , pathologist at Virginia Commonwealth University and president of the American Obesity Association , a drug industry - supported advocacy group .
Atkinson is among the increasing number of scientists and physicians convinced that the body 's propensity to store fat is n't something mere diet and exercise can correct .
" We do n't consider obesity a disease because it 's easy to see , " he says .
" But obesity is biochemistry , and drugs change biochemistry . "
Obviously , the emphasis on drug therapies is a huge boon to the pharmaceutical industry , which has more than 350 obesity and metabolic drugs in the pipeline , many far along in clinical trials .
Pfizer has CP 945598 , its own cannabinoid antagonist .
Manhattan Pharmaceuticals has a drug known as OE , which induces weight loss and matches up favorably with the components of metabolic syndrome .
Eli Lilly has half a dozen drugs in Phase I trials .
And so on .
" The trouble is , it is extremely expensive and difficult to get an obesity drug to market , " Atkinson says , pointing the finger at the FDA , among others .
That could be about to change .
For several years , the drug industry has been lobbying the FDA to make it easier to get obesity drugs to market .
In 2003 , the agency started to relent , announcing it would revise its Guidance for the Clinical Evaluation of Weight - Control Drugs , the agency 's checklist of standards for developing obesity drugs .
First issued in 1996 , the guidance has long vexed the drug industry , starting with the title itself ( " weight control " implies a lifestyle problem , rather than a public - health issue ) .
When the FDA invited public comments in 2004 , 17 companies and two trade groups offered critiques of the guidance .
( The American Obesity Association rewrote the entire guidance , line by line . )
Almost unanimously , the industry called on the FDA to redefine obesity as a disease .
" Obesity is a chronic disease , which may require pharmacotherapy , " Pfizer 's director of global R&D wrote .
Others , including Merck and PhRMA , the pharmaceutical industry 's lobby group , went further , urging the FDA to recognize metabolic syndrome as a disease , too .
" Given the association of Metabolic Syndrome with obesity , and the clear link with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality , " Merck 's vice president of global regulatory policy wrote , the company " proposes that FDA consider an indication for this syndrome . "
The FDA has yet to issue its new guidance , saying only that it 's still under review .
Getting an indication is key , because it would further establish metabolic syndrome as a bona fide disease .
So goes the domino effect of recognition : First the National Institutes of Health and the American Heart Association identify metabolic syndrome as a disease , then the FDA creates an indication , and then the HMOs – which have largely refused to reimburse patients for obesity treatments – agree to pick up the tab for metabolic syndrome prescriptions , thus making physicians more likely to prescribe them for their patients .
The only drawback is that the market could be too big :
If the HMOs see a diagnosis that fits 75 million Americans and a potential bill for $ 18 billion , they might simply refuse to pay it .
That , of course , is the demographic ripple effect of diseases like metabolic syndrome .
As the medical establishment reaches further down the causal chain to identify more risk factors and spot them earlier , and as it assigns names , definitions , and treatments to these diagnoses , more and more people are swept into the disease net .
Add in our genetic biomarkers and it's clear that disease wo n't be something we can avoid anymore .
It will be something we simply have , just as we have freckles or wear glasses .
We will all carry our disease portfolios and will be identified through our ailments – or more precisely , our inclinations toward certain ailments .
Metabolic syndrome is just the latest step on this path .
On one level , this is the inevitable progress of medicine .
But on another , it makes the idea of disease – or of health , for that matter – a meaningless abstraction .
" We all already have a disease , " Kahn says .
" Life – it's a terminal disease , you know . "

Tigers , among the planet 's most iconic and secretive creatures , have been near the top of the endangered list for some time .
But yesterday , a landmark study by leading conservationists warned that their plight is even more serious than previously feared .
The big cat , the report warns , is close to extinction and the area in which it lives has been nearly halved in the last 10 years .
The area occupied by tigers is 41 % smaller than 10 years ago and is just 7 % of its historical " range " before habitat loss and hunting slashed its numbers , according to scientists at the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York , the World Wildlife Fund and the Smithsonian National Zoological Park in Washington .
Tigers once ranged across Asia from eastern Turkey to the Russian far east .
In India , for example , where 60 % of the world 's tigers live , the population fell from 100,000 in the 19th century to 3,600 now .
Many researchers believe the true figure is less than half the official estimate .
" The current trajectory will surely cause wild populations to disappear in many places , or shrink to the point of ' ecological extinction ' - where their numbers are too few to play their role as the top predator , " the authors write .
" Now more than ever , tigers need homeland security . "
This grim prediction will come true in 20 years , the authors estimate , unless urgent action is taken .
The study is a follow - up to similar work carried out in 1995 .
It draws together satellite data on habitat type , information on poaching in different regions and data on tiger numbers .
Counting tigers is notoriously difficult because they are extremely secretive and very spread out .
Data is collected either by counting paw prints or setting camera traps which snap unsuspecting tigers on their nightly prowl .
The study , paid for by the Save the Tiger Fund , identifies 76 " tiger conservation landscapes " - places with habitat which has the best chance of supporting viable tiger populations .
Half would be able to support 100 tigers or more .
The grim headline figure is not simply a measure of how much tiger habitat has been destroyed since 1995 , although much has been lost .
The data take into account whether habitat that has become fragmented would be big enough to support a tiger population .
The cats are reluctant to cross open areas and so need well connected forest .
Also , it takes into account whether heavy poaching of the tigers ' prey means that there would not be enough food for females to raise cubs .
" The last decade has been catastrophic for tigers and they simply can't afford another one like that , " said Eric Dinerstein , chief scientist with WWF and one of the study 's authors .
But the news is not all bad , he said .
" Like the Dow Jones , there are some stocks that are up while the rest are down . "
The tiger population in the Russian far east , for example , has increased over the past half century from around 50 to 500 .
Also , the survey shows that targeted conservation efforts can pay off .
" Just by applying a little bit of protection , they can rebound dramatically , " said Dr Dinerstein .
Tigers breed quickly for a large mammal and do not require pristine habitat to survive , so preventing poaching can lead to a rapid recovery of a local population .
Apart from physical habitat destruction , the main threat comes from hunters .
A tiger skin can fetch more than £ 5,000 and the penises , used in traditional Chinese medicine , are worth £ 14,000 a kilo .
" A lot of money is involved and a lot of people are involved , " said Tito Joseph with the Wildlife Protection Society of India .
Criminal gangs with links to drugs and arms trading smuggle tiger parts from India to China and Tibet .
Skins are popular as garments called chubbas , and are also traded to collectors in the west .
Contrary to popular belief , tiger penises are not used as an aphrodisiac in Chinese medicine , but in cures for fevers and rheumatism .
The Chinese government and NGOs are working with traditional medicine sellers to promote alternatives .
The bones of a common mole rat called the sailong are now often used .
" There is cause for optimism , " said Sabri Zain , advocacy and campaign director of Traffic , an NGO that combats illegal wildlife trade .
" In terms of trade there is an appreciable reduction in demand for tiger bone - based medicine . "
The authors of the report - Setting Priorities for the Conservation and Recovery of Wild Tigers 2005 - 2015 - advocate a " tiger summit " , involving the heads of state of the 13 countries which still host the species .
They believe this would galvanise political will and raise funds for conservation .
To safeguard the remaining animals , the report says increased protection of the 20 most important tiger habitat areas should be a priority .
Of the six tiger sub - species , the Javan tiger , Caspian tiger and Bali tiger have already become extinct .
There is confusion over what poisoned the ex-spy
Mr Litvinenko , 43 , died on Thursday evening and the cause of his condition is still being investigated , said University College Hospital , London .
Scotland Yard said officers were now investigating " an unexplained death " .
Friends say the former KGB agent was poisoned three weeks ago because of his criticism of the Russian government .
The Kremlin has denied any involvement .
Defector
Friend Andrei Nekrasov told the Associated Press agency Mr Litvinenko's wife Marina , father Walter and his 10 - year son Anatoli were by his side when he died .
Alex Goldfarb , speaking on behalf of Mr Litvinenko 's family outside the hospital , said his death was a " terrible crime " .
LITVINENKO TIMELINE 1 Nov - Alexander Litvinenko meets two Russian men at a London hotel and then meets Italian academic Mario Scaramella at a sushi bar in Piccadilly .
Hours later he falls ill 17 Nov - Mr Litvinenko is transferred to UCH 19 Nov - Reports say Mr Litvinenko has been poisoned with thallium 21 Nov - A toxicologist says he may have been poisoned with " radioactive thallium " 22 Nov - Mr Litvinenko's condition deteriorates overnight .
Thallium and radiation ruled out 23 Nov -
The ex-spy dies in intensive care
Obituary : Alexander Litvinenko
Timeline of case in full
Mr Litvinenko had recently been investigating the murder of his friend , Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya , another critic of the Putin government .
Russian dissident Oleg Gordievsky , a former KGB colonel and friend of Mr Litvinenko , maintained that the poisoning had been the work of the Russians .
The Russian security service had " sent a man with a poisonous pill to Britain " , put a pill into Mr Litvinenko 's tea and killed him , he told BBC News .
Intelligence analyst Glenmore Trenear Harvey said Mr Litvinenko had " made a lot of enemies " when he had been tasked with fighting corruption during his time with the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) - the KGB 's successor .
Mr Harvey also said the poisoning could have been carried out by the " Russian mafia " , made up of former - KGB men who had formed the group when the service broke up .
" It 's thought that many killings , both within the financial services industry in Russia and even within the media have been lain at the foot of this rather murky bunch , " he told BBC News .
" So I think that while one could say they were trained by the KGB this is not in any way a Russian intelligence service hit . "
' Deliberate poisoning '
Since Mr Litvinenko's death , both the Kremlin and Russia 's foreign intelligence service , the SVR , have said they have nothing to add to their earlier denials of involvement .
Before Mr Litvinenko's death , police said they suspected " deliberate poisoning " was behind his illness .
Anti-terrorism police are heading up the investigation .
Investigators have been examining two meetings he had on 1 November - one at a London hotel with a former KGB man and another man , and a later rendezvous with Italian security consultant Mario Scaramella at a sushi restaurant in London 's West End .
HAVE YOUR SAY
My sincere condolences go out to this poor man 's family .
I hope the truth about his death will one day be uncovered and shared with the world .

Send us your comments
Mr Litvinenko , who was granted asylum in the UK in 2000 after complaining of persecution in Russia , fell ill later that day .
In an interview with Friday 's Telegraph newspaper , former KGB bodyguard Andrei Lugovoi said he had met Mr Litvinenko at the Millennium Hotel in Grosvenor Square but vigorously denied any involvement in the poisoning .
Mr Scaramella , who is involved in an Italian parliamentary inquiry into Russian secret service activity , said he organised the meeting because he wanted to discuss an e-mail he had received .
What caused Mr Litvinenko's illness and death is still unclear .
Initial reports from UCH at the weekend that he had been poisoned by heavy metal thallium , or some form of radioactive material , have now been dismissed by head of critical care Dr Geoff Bellingan .
Speaking in Friday 's Times , film - maker Andrei Nekrasov said that , before he fell unconscious for the last time , his friend had told him : " I want to survive , just to show them .
The bastards got me but they wo n't get everybody . "
Warren Buffett likes to play bridge and the ukulele
It is the first time a biography will have be written with his co-operation , and deal is worth $ 7 m ( £ 4 m ) , AP says .
Mr Buffett , known as the Sage of Omaha , is the world 's second richest man , said by Forbes to be worth $ 40 bn ( £ 22.6bn ) .
The book , which will focus on his investment strategy , is likely to be called The Snowball : How Warren Buffett Collected Friends , Wisdom and Wealth .
Homespun style
The book will be written by Alice Schroeder , formerly an analyst at Morgan Stanley , where she first came into contact with Mr Buffett .
Although it is claimed it will reveal the secrets of his successful investment strategy , the contract was negotiated with the writer , not with the investment star famous for his homespun style .
Warren Buffett
Wears sweatshirts in spare time Enjoys burgers , fries and cola Plays bridge and ukulele Former night school teacher
" Our deal is with her .
She is the author , " Bantam president and publisher Irwyn Applebaum told AP through spokeswoman Barbara Burg .
The returns Mr Buffett has generated have won him a loyal investor base and turned many of his followers into multi-millionaires .
Had you given Mr Buffett $ 10,000 in 1965 , by 1999 that nest egg would have been worth more than $ 50 m .
' Unprecedented access '
In 1956 Mr Buffett built a partnership of four relatives and three close friends - he now controls a holding company worth $ 100 bn ( £ 56.7bn ) .
Shares in his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway - which owns insurance , soft drink , confectionery , furniture , restaurant and carpet firms - are currently trading at $ 83,000 each .
Mr Buffett is not one for fads and has built his investment empire on the maxim that it is better to identify a good investment and hold it for a long time , rather than jump in and out of positions .
The world 's second - richest person behind Microsoft founder Bill Gates , he famously sat out the whole internet boom .
Dell says the new book will be based on the " thousands of hours " the writer spent with Mr Buffett and on " unprecedented access to his files , friends and associates " .
The Devil 's Advocate - Mac UI Ain't All That : The Future & History of the User Interface ( with Snazzy New UI Videos )
by John Kheit - August 15th , 2006

The current state - of - the - art User Interface ( UI ) we 've been enjoying has remained largely stagnant since the 1980s .
The greatest innovation that has been recently released is based on video card layering / buffering techniques like Apple 's Expose .
But , there is a large change coming .
Rev 2 of the UI will be based on multiple gestures and more directly involve human interaction .
Apple is clearly working in the area as some of the company 's patent filings demonstrate .
Nevertheless , these videos might make Mac ( and Windows ) users experience a huge case of UI envy , as a lot of UI development ( in XGL in particular ) makes the current Mac UI seem creaky and old fashioned .
I 've been collecting these links to cool new UIs for a while ( yea , I know , what a geek ) .
Despite its geekiness , I thought some of you might enjoy them as well .
It seems there is a good chance that multi-gesture / multi-input ( MGMI ) UIs will be in our future at least on some level ( apparently they will be accompanied by no dearth of techno music ) .
Basically the rest of the article has a bunch of links , and brief descriptions to those links , to cool videos of various UI that include : Wobbly Window UIs ( WWUIs ) , Multi- touch UIs , Mixed Physical UIs , Brain UIs , Art tools , and even a little bit of history on the UI .
Enjoy !
Wobbly Window UIs
The " wobbly " UIs , largely represented by XGL , all seem to use layering techniques .
All this layering of UI elements lets you see the desktop UI from more vantages .
Wobbly Window UIs seemed to have started at SUN with Project Looking Glass ( although they may have originated elsewhere , I 'm unsure ) .
It seems that Project Looking Glass " inspired " Apple 's Exposé .
Others have gone on to build on both SUN's and Apple 's progress with the current state - of - the - wobbly - art with XGL .
The ' gist ' of how these UIs seem to work is they put a bitmap into a buffered backing plane and allow you to quickly move the resulting 2D bitmap layers through 3D space .
Modern 3D video cards then allow you to move these relatively simple bit - mapped textured planes through 3D space rather easily .
WWUI Links :
Multi-touch UIs
Multi -touch UIs are much like the UIs on a touch pad or a tablet UI .
You get to touch things directly on the display surface .
However , this technology registers more than one touch , and it is capable of interpreting gestures as well .
In reality , some of these UIs do not even require touching the surface , but just interpret your gestures near the surface .
Multi-touMulti - touch UIs , along with mixed physical UIs , seems to be the direction where UI development is headed .
Multi - touch UI links :
Mixed Physical UIs
Mixed Physical
UIs build upon multi- touch UIs , but they introduce physical objects into a multi - touch input plane .
Some of the more advanced Mixed Physical UIs identify the types of physical objects that are placed onto the input surface , and then let you manipulate the computer environment when you manipulate the physical objects .
Mixed Physical UI links :
Brain UIs
Brain UIs employ techniques of reading brain impulses in order to control a computer .
Brain UI links :
Brain computer interface .
This head gear is similar to the ones we used back in my research lab and developer days ( when I was still developing using NeXT computers ) .
Art tools
Art tools use UI techniques , already discussed above , to further artistic ends .
Art tools links :
History
Sadly , a great many people in the computer field have a pathetic sense ( or rather ignorance ) of history .
They are pompous and narcissistic enough to ignore the great contributions of past geniuses .
My hope is that more will watch some of these historical videos and learn from these innovators .
Perhaps , if more learned from the great computer science innovators of the past ( who managed to make systems using computers with 192KB of memory that rival the responsiveness and features of modern systems having orders of magnitude more processing power ) , then later generations of computer scientists might adopt their elegant design philosophies , rather than the current philosophies responsible for the ill - thought out and implemented bloat software we " enjoy " today .
It might be time to add a " History of Computers " class to the computer science curriculum so as to give new practitioners this much needed sense of history .
For example , it seems rare to find someone in the computer field who knows about the contributions of Ivan Sutherland and Douglas Engelbart .
Ivan Sutherland came up with one of the earliest graphical interfaces ( and threw in objected oriented programming techniques for good measure ) ; he did this all in one year in the development of Sketchpad circa 1963 .
Amazing .
For a good historical overview of user interfaces and more , check out this video with Alan Key ; it 's fantastic .
Douglas Engelbart 's demonstration of the online system , NLS , is THE demo that started them all .
Most think that Apple / Microsoft stole their UI ideas from Xerox , but in reality , Douglas Engelbart and his team at Stanford made most of the conventions responsible for current computing ( as well as current UIs ) .
This is really the mother of all computer demos ; Steve Jobs and others have basically copied this format , but no demo has ever equalled the thermonuclear impact of the NLS demo .
Keep in mind , it was made in 1968 !
Douglas Engelbart is known as having invented the mouse , which is true , but that 's a bit of a backhanded compliment as he did so much more .
In reality , he and his team came up with our current paradigm of computer interactions , abstractions and development .
It is beyond bizarre that he is not commonly credited with more .
Although a lot has come from Mr. Engelbart 's work , I think he is actually disappointed with our current state of the art .
I do n't think he believed we should make UIs that are " simple " ( or dumbed down ) , but instead , he was trying to develop UIs that empower us to embrace and engage in complexity ; blame Jobs and team for our going astray with the one button mouse et al .
Anyway , this is a long video and is somewhat tedious to those without a computer science background or sense of history as the technologies are not as whizbang by today 's standards ( and no techno track to keep you distracted ) .
For its time , however , this was incredible ; after this demo , many at the presentation left not believing the technology was real .
Keep in mind this was achieved on a 192 Kilobyte ( not Megabyte , not Gigabyte , but Kilobyte ! ) time share computer ( that supported 20 users ) with 0.5 MIPS of processing power .
This video is really the precursor to all modern demos and systems .
In so many ways , it 's frightening .
Just setting up the demo was a technological marvel ; it was projected on a huge display ( using a very rare projector for the time ) that they hacked to work with NLS ; they even conducted a video teleconference with custom microwave based modem communications that they " just whipped up " to enable the demo .
How Douglas Engelbart , Ivan Sutherland , Doug Ross , and others have not collectively received a Nobel Prize for bringing forth modern computing is a mystery .
Xerox Smalltalk environment ( one of the Xerox UIs from which everyone " borrowed " ) .
Restart
I get the feeling we are about to enter a computer user interface renaissance .
My guess is that somewhere in the next 2 years ( and maybe as soon as with Mac OS X 10.5 ) , we 'll see the revitalization of the entire computer field because of UI advances .
And with any UI renaissance , we will also see increases in new hardware sales supporting the new paradigms , which in turn will lead to further gains in personal productivity levels .

Initial filesystem design synopsis .
From : Matthew Dillon < dillon@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx > Date : Wed , 21 Feb 2007 14:22:16 -0800 ( PST )
Here is my initial outline of the filesystem design .
It is open for discussion .
Please feel to ask questions for anything you do not understand .
I do not intend to start coding anything for at least two weeks .
There are currently two rough spots in the design .
First , how to handle segment overflows in a multi-master environment .
Such overflows can occur when the individual masters or slaves have different historical data retention policies .
Second , where to store the regeneratable indexes .
Plus , I need a name for this baby .
I can't use DFS , however much I want to , because the term is already over - used .
- Matt Matthew Dillon < dillon@backplane.com >
Feature Summary : - On - demand filesystem check and recovery .
No need to scan the entire filesystem before going live after a reboot .
- Infinite snapshots ( e.g. on the 30 second filesystem sync ) , ability to collapse snapshots for any time interval as a means of recovering space .
- Multi-master operation , including the ability to self - heal a corrupted filesystem by accessing replicated data .
Multi -master means that each replicated store can act as a master .
New filesystem ops can run independantly on any of the replicated stores and will flow to the others .
This is done by giving the controller of each store a certain amount of guarenteed free space that can be filled without having to notify other controllers .
- Infinite logless Replication .
No requirement to keep a log of changes for the purposes of replication , meaning that replication targets can be offline for ' days ' without effecting performance or operation .
( ' mobile ' computing , but also replication over slow links for backup purposes and other things ) .
Certain information is still logged , but only to streamline performance .
- 64 bit file space , 64 bit filesystem space .
No space restrictions whatsoever .
- Reliably handles data storage for huge multi-hundred - terrabyte filesystems without fear of unrecoverable corruption .
- Cluster operation - ability to commit data to locally replicated store independantly of other replication nodes , with access governed by cache coherency protocols .
- Independant index .
Data is laid out in a highly recoverable fashion , independant of index generation .
Indexes can be regenerated from scratch and thus indexes can be updated asynchronously .
Segmentation :
The physical storage backing a filesystem is broken up into large 1MB - 4GB segments ( 64 MB is a typical value ) .
Each segment is self - identifying and contains its own header , data table , and record table .
The operating system glues together filesystems and determines availability based on the segments it finds .
All segments on a block device are the same size ( power - of - 2 restricted ) and the OS can probe the disk without any other information simply by locating a segment header , starting with the largest possible segment size .
Segment size is typically chosen such that a scan of all segment headers takes no longer then a few seconds .
-
The segment header contains all the information required to associate the segment with a filesystem .
Certain information in the segment header is updated with an ordered write to ' commit ' other work already flushed out into the segment .
The segment header also contains a bit indicating whether the segment is ' open ' or not , to aid in on - demand recovery .
The segment ID is stored in the segment header , allowing segments to be easily relocated .
That is , the segment 's location in the physical backing store is irrelevant .
-
The data table consists of pure data , laid out linearly in the forward direction within the segment .
Data blocks are variable - sized entities containing pure data , with no other identifying information , suitable for direct DMA .
The segment header has a simple append index for the data table .
-
The record table consists of fixed - sized records and a reference to data in the data table .
The record table is built backwards from the end of the segment .
The segment header has a simple pre-append index for the record table .
Each record consists of : * an object identifier ( e.g. inode number ) * creation transid * deletion transid ( updated in - place ) * indexing key ( offset or filename key ) * data table reference ( offset , bytes ) ( up to a 1GB contiguous ref ) * integrity check
All data elements are completely identified by the record table .
All modifications are historical in nature ... that is , no actual data is destroyed and one can access a ' snapshot ' of the segment as of any transaction id ( i.e. timestamp ) simply by ignoring those records marked as deleted prior to the specified time or created after the specified time .
Certain updates to the object table occur in - place .
In particular , the deletion transaction id is updated in - place .
However , such updates are not considered ' committed ' until the segment header itself is updated with the latest committed transaction id and a recovery operation will undo any deletion transaction id greater then the committed transaction id in the segment header , as well as free any uncommitted objects and their related data .
The entire filesystem can be recovered from just the record and data tables .
Indexing and cross-segment spanning is described in later sections .
Physical space recovery : Physical space recovery requires actually destroying records marked as deleted .
Snapshots can be collapsed by destroying records whos creation AND deletion id's fall within the collapsed space .
The oldest data is freed up by destroying records whos deletion id is less then the terminal timestamp .
Record destruction creates holes in both the data table and the record table .
Any holes adjacent to the data table append point or the record table prepend point are immediately recovered by adjusting the appropriate indices in the segment header .
The operating system may cache a record of non-adjacent holes ( in memory ) and reuse the space , and can also generate an in - memory index of available holes on the fly when space is very tight ( which requires scanning the record table ) , but otherwise the recovery of any space not adjacent to the data table append point requires a performance reorganization of the segment .
Locating Data objects , and the Master Record .
Data objects are basically the amalgamation of all records with the same 64 bit object identifier .
The top N bits of this identifier indicate the segment the master record for the data object resides in .
All 64 bits are made available to userland .
The filesystem needs to be free to relocate the master record for a data object on the fly .
Relocation is a dynamic process whereby the master record in a segment becomes a forwarding record to another segment .
Any references to a forwarding record is adjusted on the fly in order to collapse the chain , and any intermediate forwarding records can be physically destroyed once all references to them have been adjusted .
However , the ORIGINAL forwarding record must be retained for all time in order to maintain the uniqueness of the originally assigned user - visible inode number and to give us a way to locate the master record given the inode number .
We can not change the inode number .
Overhead is minimal .
A forwarding record is created in two situations : ( 1 ) To move the master record to improve performance and ( 2 ) If the current segment does not have sufficient space to increase the size the master record if it becomes necessary to do so .
A forwarding record is a degenerate case of a master record and the forwarding information is embedded in the record itself , with no data table reference at all .
The space used is only the space required to store a record table entry .
The master record for a data object is a special record in the record table .
It is special because it is NOT part of the historical data store .
The creation and deletion transaction ids represent the creation or deletion of the entire data object , and the data block contains information on where to find the other bits and pieces of the data object ( in particular , if the data object spans more then one segment ) .
A CORRUPTED MASTER RECORD CAN BE COMPLETELY RECONSTRUCTED BY SCANNING THE FILESYSTEM .
The master record can be thought of as a persistent cache .
It gives the filesystem a way to quickly locate all the segments that might contain records for the data object and reserves a limited amount of space for the filesystem to store direct references to data residing in the same segment as the master record .
Master record updates are fairly rare .
For the most part a master record must only be updated if a file or directory grows into a new segment .
Performance reorganization : Segments can be repacked in order to clean up fragmentation and reorganize data and records for more optimal access .
Repacking is accomplished by copying the segment 's data into a wholely new segment on the physical disk , then destroying the old segment .
Since a segment is identified by its header the actual location of the segment on the physical media is irrelevant .
For example , master records can wind up strewn about the record table for a segment .
Repacking would pack all of those master records next to each other .
Similarly , a file or directory might have bits and pieces of data strewn about a segment .
Repacking would de-fragment those entities , as well as pack together the data related to small files and separate out the larger chunks related to larger files .
Segment Allocation : Remember that since the actual physical location of a segment is independant of the segment identifier ( typically an 8 or 16 bit number ) , the allocation of segment numbers does not have to be linear .
The filesystem will typically be generous in its allocation of segment numbers in order to allow for spill over growth of files into logically adjacent segments , thus simplifying the segment range stored in the master record that describes which segments might contain data records for a data object .
For example , the first segment allocated by the filesystem when using a 16 bit segment id would not be 0x0000 or 0xffff , but probably 0x8000 .
The next segment allocated ( when not doing a spill - over ) might be 0x4000 or 0xc000 , and so forth .
The entire segment space is used even if there are fewer actual ( physical ) segments .
Large cross-segment objects : A Data object can wind up being far larger then a segment .
For that matter , even a small data object with a lot of history can wind up being far larger then a segment .
The filesystem does its best to organize the data for such objects to reduce the size of the master records required to describe them and to separate historical data from current data , to maintain the performance of the live filesystem .
Indexing :
An object 's master record generally describes the segments containing the data for the object , and may contain direct references to data in the same segment as the master record ( an optimization or performance reorganization that is desireable for files smaller then a single segment ) .
However , data objects can grow to be many records due to fragmentation , simply being large files , or due to the retention of a great deal of history .
The records pertaining to these objects may have to be indexed beyond the space the filesystem is willing to reserve in the master record in order to improve access .
To make it clear , indexing is an optimization .
The index is not required to recover a segment or to recover a filesystem .
The intent is for the master record to always contain sufficient information to reduce the number I / O's required to resolve a file access request to a reasonable number , even if no index is available .
Indexing can occur in three places : * First , it can occur in the segment itself to organize the records in that segment .
Such indexes are usually persistently cached in the dead space between the data table and the record table , and the filesystem heuristically determines how much space is needed for that .
If the data table or the record table grows into the index the filesystem can choose to relocate , regenerate , or shift the index data , or to disallow the growth ( extend the data object into a new segment ) .
These heuristics are fairly simple .
* Second , it can occur in the master record to roughly organize the data space ... for example so the filesystem does not have to check all segments if a particular file offset ( or offset range ) and all of its history is known to reside in just one .
The filesystem typically is only willing to allow so much space in the master record for a data object to store such an index .
If this level of index becomes too large it is basically simplified in - place and starts requiring the use of the per-segment index to further resolve the location of data records for the object .
*
Third , it can be generated and cached in memory .
When dealing with very large multi-segment files it may be beneficial to scan the relatively few records in the record table for the related segments and simply index them in memory , rather then store an index on - disk .
For example if you are using 64MB segments and have a 20 GB file , literally only 320 disk accesses ( with a few data records read in each access ) are required to construct an index of the entire 20 GB file and the index itself would require very little memory .
Indexes are asynchronous entities .
The ' official ' filesystem store is the data table and the record table .
The host can cache updates in memory , and asynchronously update the performance - improving index .
Indexes residing in segments are regenerated if the segment is marked open on initial access ( due to an unclean shutdown ) .
This allows persistent per-segment indexes to be updated without requiring any particular transactional disk synchronization or block ordering .
Indexes are generally implemented using a B + Tree structure .
Replication : Data and record elements are only directly referenced by their offset within a segment when referenced from within that same segment .
This means that replication is possible on a segment - by - segment basis .
Segment headers contain asynchronously updated record update log areas for deletion events ( because these modify the deletion timestamp in an existing record rather then append a new record ) .
These log areas are of limited size and can overflow under normal operation .
They are ONLY used to streamline replication .
If a replication target is not fast enough , it will have to resynchronize by scanning the records on the source ( which itself does n't usually take very long to do so it is n't considered a big deal ) .
But otherwise it can check the log area and simply pick up where it left off .
The intention is to completely support both very slow replication slaves and mostly off - line slaves .
The only thing that is actually replicated are the record table entries and ( with the exception of a master record ) the data table entries .
The data table entry for a master record is never replicated , but ( re ) generated by the replication target .
The replication target is responsible for maintaining its own indexes and managing its own physical segment space .
This gives any replication target a great deal of robustness and flexibility .
Also note that the physical location of the logical segments on the replication target is entirely up to the replication target .
Replication is done logically , not physically .
Segment Expansion - Virtual segments
A replication target may wish to retain historical data that the replication source has not , or destroy historical data that the replication source intends to retain .
This can result in the replication target running out of room in a logical segment , and can also complicate recovery operations if the replication source needs to self - heal a corrupted segment .
This presents a problem because all filesystem accesses and all replication and recovery activities are segment - centric .
To deal with this situation a logical segment can be turned into a virtual segment .
A virtual segment is made up of multiple logical segments , all with the same identifier plus additional information in the segment distinguishing the pieces from each other .
Each logical segment is maintained independantly but API accesses check both ( or all N such segments ) when doing lookups , and write to whichever one has free space .
Virtual segments are pretty standard fare on replication slaves which are intended to archive a great deal more history then replication masters , but are intended to be very rare features of replication masters .
If a virtual segment must be created on a replication master the filesystem does all it can to shift data off the virtual segment in order to be able to collapse it back into a logical segment .
Virtual segmentation is not space efficient .
Files and Directories
As has been described , a data object ( which can be a file or directory or other filesystem entity ) is identified by a data object id , which is effectively its inode , and a 64 bit key field .
The key field is typically a base offset for a file or a sortable key for a directory entry .
Negative numbers are used for meta -data .
For example , - 1 will be used for the inode data & stat information .
Other negative numbers will be used to support other meta - data such as ACLs .
Since records support variable - length data , the data storage for a file is effectively extent - based .
Minimum granularity will be something like 32 bytes .
Files are thus fairly straight forward .
From the point of view of the filesystem each directory entry will be a data record .
The data record will basically just contain the inode number , type , and filename .
It will be variable - length insofar as the filename is variable length .
Most files will be representable in a single extent ( or at least can be optimized into a single extent ) , and so will not depend very heavily on indexing .
Directory lookups WILL depend on the indexing of the directory records for efficiency , otherwise every record would have to be scanned to lookup a filename .
In this regard a B + Tree is probably the best solution .
Inode Number Uniqueness
Inode numbers are 64 bits where the top N bits represent the segment in which the inode was originally allocated , identifying the master record for the data object .
Inode numbers do not change even if the master record is relocated and the original master record replaced with a forwarding record .
The forwarding record must be retained in order to guarentee the uniqueness of the inode number .
This also allows inode numbers to be allocated on a per-segment basis , with 48 bits of uniqueness ( one trillion file creates & deletes ) within each segment .
The filesystem will always allocate new inode numbers using a sequence number maintained in the segment header .
When all 48 bits are used up , however , the filesystem must check new inode numbers against existing numbers ( including any deleted historical objects ) .
Inode number uniqueness over all time can no longer be guarenteed , but inode number uniqueness over a period of time CAN still be guarenteed by retaining the master record for deleted files for a period of time EVEN AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN DESTROYED .
The system operator can specify the retention time with the caveat that certain benchmarks might cause the disk to fill up or become somewhat less efficient even when historical data is purged .
It is recommended that any exported or clustered filesystems set the inode number retention time to at least a week .
Inode number uniqueness is crucial to cluster operation .

Putting to rest a 200 - year - old mystery , scientists say Napoleon Bonaparte died from an advanced case of gastric cancer and not arsenic poisoning as some had speculated .
After being defeated by the British in 1815 , the French Emperor was exiled to St. Helena -- an island in the South Atlantic Ocean .
Six years later , at the age of 52 , Bonaparte whispered his last words , " Head of Army ! "
An autopsy at the time determined that stomach cancer was the cause of his death .
But some arsenic found in 1961 in the ruler 's hair sparked rumors of poisoning .
Had Napoleon escaped exile , he could have changed the balance of power in Europe ; therefore murder speculations did n't seem outlandish .
However , a new study -- combining current medical knowledge , autopsy reports , Bonaparte 's physician memoirs , eyewitness accounts , and family medical histories -- found that gastrointestinal bleeding was the immediate cause of death .
" This analysis suggests that , even if the emperor had been released or escaped from the island , his terminal condition would have prevented him from playing a further major role in the theater of European history , " said lead study author , Robert Genta of University of Texas Southwestern .
" Even today , with the availability of sophisticated surgical techniques and chemotherapies , patients with gastric cancer as advanced as Napoleon 's have a poor prognosis . "
A four - inch lesion
The original autopsy descriptions indicated that Bonaparte 's stomach had two ulcerated lesions : a large one on the stomach and a smaller one that had pierced through the stomach wall and reached the liver .
Genta and his colleagues compared the description of these lesions with current images of 50 benign ulcers and 50 gastric cancers and found that the emperor 's lesions were cancerous .
" It was a huge mass from the entrance of his stomach to the exit .
It was at least 10 centimeters [ 4 inches ] long . "
Genta said .
" Size alone suggests the lesion was cancer . "
A severe case
Bonaparte , the researchers said , had a very severe case of the cancer which had spread to other organs .
" Even if treated today , he'd have been dead within a year , " Genta said .
Although the emperor 's father also died from stomach cancer , Bonaparte 's cancer most likely stemmed from an ulcer - causing bacterial infection , the researchers said .?
A diet full of salt - preserved foods but sparse in fruits and vegetables -- common fare for long military campaigns -- increased Napoleon 's risk for gastric cancer , Genta said .
The study is detailed in the January edition of Nature Clinical Practice Gastroenterology & Hepatology .

Startups happen in clusters .
There are a lot of them in Silicon Valley and Boston , and few in Chicago or Miami .
A country that wants startups will probably also have to reproduce whatever makes these clusters form .
I 've claimed that the recipe is a great university near a town smart people like .
If you set up those conditions within the US , startups will form as inevitably as water droplets condense on a cold piece of metal .
But when I consider what it would take to reproduce Silicon Valley in another country , it 's clear the US is a particularly humid environment .
Startups condense more easily here .
It is by no means a lost cause to try to create a silicon valley in another country .
There 's room not merely to equal Silicon Valley , but to surpass it .
But if you want to do that , you have to understand the advantages startups get from being in America .
1. The US Allows Immigration .
For example , I doubt it would be possible to reproduce Silicon Valley in Japan , because one of Silicon Valley 's most distinctive features is immigration .
Half the people there speak with accents .
And the Japanese do n't like immigration .
When they think about how to make a Japanese silicon valley , I suspect they unconsciously frame it as how to make one consisting only of Japanese people .
This way of framing the question probably guarantees failure .
A silicon valley has to be a mecca for the smart and the ambitious , and you can't have a mecca if you do n't let people into it .
Of course , it 's not saying much that America is more open to immigration than Japan .
Immigration policy is one area where a competitor could do better .
2. The US Is a Rich Country .
I could see India one day producing a rival to Silicon Valley .
Obviously they have the right people : you can tell that by the number of Indians in the current Silicon Valley .
The problem with India itself is that it 's still so poor .
In poor countries , things we take for granted are missing .
A friend of mine visiting India sprained her ankle falling down the steps in a railway station .
When she turned to see what had happened , she found the steps were all different heights .
In industrialized countries we walk down steps our whole lives and never think about this , because there 's an infrastructure that prevents such a staircase from being built .
The US has never been so poor as some countries are now .
There have never been swarms of beggars in the streets of American cities .
So we have no data about what it takes to get from the swarms - of - beggars stage to the silicon - valley stage .
Could you have both at once , or does there have to be some baseline prosperity before you get a silicon valley ?
I suspect there is some speed limit to the evolution of an economy .
Economies are made out of people , and attitudes can only change a certain amount per generation . [ 1 ]
3 . The US Is Not ( Yet ) a Police State .
Another country I could see wanting to have a silicon valley is China .
But I doubt they could do it yet either .
China still seems to be a police state , and although present rulers seem enlightened compared to the last , even enlightened despotism can probably only get you part way toward being a great economic power .
It can get you factories for building things designed elsewhere .
Can it get you the designers , though ?
Can imagination flourish where people can't criticize the government ?
Imagination means having odd ideas , and it's hard to have odd ideas about technology without also having odd ideas about politics .
And in any case , many technical ideas do have political implications .
So if you squash dissent , the back pressure will propagate into technical fields . [ 2 ]
Singapore would face a similar problem .
Singapore seems very aware of the importance of encouraging startups .
But while energetic government intervention may be able to make a port run efficiently , it can't coax startups into existence .
A state that bans chewing gum has a long way to go before it could create a San Francisco .
Do you need a San Francisco ?
Might there not be an alternate route to innovation that goes through obedience and cooperation instead of individualism ?
Possibly , but I 'd bet not .
Most imaginative people seem to share a certain prickly independence , whenever and wherever they lived .
You see it in Diogenes telling Alexander to get out of his light and two thousand years later in Feynman breaking into safes at Los Alamos . [ 3 ]
Imaginative people do n't want to follow or lead .
They 're most productive when everyone gets to do what they want .
Ironically , of all rich countries the US has lost the most civil liberties recently .
But I 'm not too worried yet .
I 'm hoping once the present administration is out , the natural openness of American culture will reassert itself .
4. American Universities Are Better .
You need a great university to seed a silicon valley , and so far there are few outside the US .
I asked a handful of American computer science professors which universities in Europe were most admired , and they all basically said " Cambridge " followed by a long pause while they tried to think of others .
There do n't seem to be many universities elsewhere that compare with the best in America , at least in technology .
In some countries this is the result of a deliberate policy .
The German and Dutch governments , perhaps from fear of elitism , try to ensure that all universities are roughly equal in quality .
The downside is that none are especially good .
The best professors are spread out , instead of being concentrated as they are in the US .
This probably makes them less productive , because they do n't have good colleagues to inspire them .
It also means no one university will be good enough to act as a mecca , attracting talent from abroad and causing startups to form around it .
The case of Germany is a strange one .
The Germans invented the modern university , and up till the 1930s theirs were the best in the world .
Now they have none that stand out .
As I was mulling this over , I found myself thinking : " I can understand why German universities declined in the 1930s , after they excluded Jews .
But surely they should have bounced back by now . "
Then I realized : maybe not .
There are few Jews left in Germany and most Jews I know would not want to move there .
And if you took any great American university and removed the Jews , you 'd have some pretty big gaps .
So maybe it would be a lost cause trying to create a silicon valley in Germany , because you could n't establish the level of university you 'd need as a seed . [ 4 ]
It 's natural for US universities to compete with one another because so many are private .
To reproduce the quality of American universities you probably also have to reproduce this .
If universities are controlled by the central government , log- rolling will pull them all toward the mean : the new Institute of X will end up at the university in the district of a powerful politician , instead of where it should be .
5. You Can Fire People in America .
I think one of the biggest obstacles to creating startups in Europe is the attitude toward employment .
The famously rigid labor laws hurt every company , but startups especially , because startups have the least time to spare for bureaucratic hassles .
The difficulty of firing people is a particular problem for startups because they have no redundancy .
Every person has to do their job well .
But the problem is more than just that some startup might have a problem firing someone they needed to .
Across industries and countries , there 's a strong inverse correlation between performance and job security .
Actors and directors are fired at the end of each film , so they have to deliver every time .
Junior professors are fired by default after a few years unless the university chooses to grant them tenure .
Professional athletes know they 'll be pulled if they play badly for just a couple games .
At the other end of the scale ( at least in the US ) are auto workers , New York City schoolteachers , and civil servants , who are all nearly impossible to fire .
The trend is so clear that you 'd have to be willfully blind not to see it .
Performance is n't everything , you say ?
Well , are auto workers , schoolteachers , and civil servants happier than actors , professors , and professional athletes ?
European public opinion will apparently tolerate people being fired in industries where they really care about performance .
Unfortunately the only industry they care enough about so far is soccer .
But that is at least a precedent .
6 . In America Work Is Less Identified with Employment .
The problem in more traditional places like Europe and Japan goes deeper than the employment laws .
More dangerous is the attitude they reflect : that an employee is a kind of servant , whom the employer has a duty to protect .
It used to be that way in America too .
In 1970 you were still supposed to get a job with a big company , for whom ideally you 'd work your whole career .
In return the company would take care of you : they 'd try not to fire you , cover your medical expenses , and support you in old age .
Gradually employment has been shedding such paternalistic overtones and becoming simply an economic exchange .
But the importance of the new model is not just that it makes it easier for startups to grow .
More important , I think , is that it it makes it easier for people to start startups .
Even in the US most kids graduating from college still think they 're supposed to get jobs , as if you could n't be productive without being someone 's employee .
But the less you identify work with employment , the easier it becomes to start a startup .
When you see your career as a series of different types of work , instead of a lifetime 's service to a single employer , there 's less risk in starting your own company , because you 're only replacing one segment instead of discarding the whole thing .
The old ideas are so powerful that even the most successful startup founders have had to struggle against them .
A year after the founding of Apple , Steve Wozniak still had n't quit HP .
He still planned to work there for life .
And when Jobs found someone to give Apple serious venture funding , on the condition that Woz quit , he initially refused , arguing that he 'd designed both the Apple I and the Apple II while working at HP , and there was no reason he could n't continue .
7. America Is Not Too Fussy .
If there are any laws regulating businesses , you can assume larval startups will break most of them , because they do n't know what the laws are and do n't have time to find out .
For example , many startups in America begin in places where it 's not really legal to run a business .
Hewlett - Packard , Apple , and Google were all run out of garages .
Many more startups , including ours , were initially run out of apartments .
If the laws against such things were actually enforced , most startups would n't happen .
That could be a problem in fussier countries .
If Hewlett and Packard tried running an electronics company out of their garage in Switzerland , the old lady next door would report them to the municipal authorities .
But the worst problem in other countries is probably the effort required just to start a company .
A friend of mine started a company in Germany in the early 90s , and was shocked to discover , among many other regulations , that you needed $ 20,000 in capital to incorporate .
That 's one reason I 'm not typing this on an Apfel laptop .
Jobs and Wozniak could n't have come up with that kind of money in a company financed by selling a VW bus and an HP calculator .
We could n't have started Viaweb either . [ 5 ]
Here 's a tip for governments that want to encourage startups : read the stories of existing startups , and then try to simulate what would have happened in your country .
When you hit something that would have killed Apple , prune it off .
Startups are marginal .
They 're started by the poor and the timid ; they begin in marginal space and spare time ; they 're started by people who are supposed to be doing something else ; and though businesses , their founders often know nothing about business .
Young startups are fragile .
A society that trims its margins sharply will kill them all .
8. America Has a Large Domestic Market .
What sustains a startup in the beginning is the prospect of getting their initial product out .
The successful ones therefore make the first version as simple as possible .
In the US they usually begin by making something just for the local market .
This works in America , because the local market is 300 million people .
It would n't work so well in Sweden .
In a small country , a startup has a harder task : they have to sell internationally from the start .
The EU was designed partly to simulate a single , large domestic market .
The problem is that the inhabitants still speak many different languages .
So a software startup in Sweden is still at a disadvantage relative to one in the US , because they have to deal with internationalization from the beginning .
It 's significant that the most famous recent startup in Europe , Skype , worked on a problem that was intrinsically international .
However , for better or worse it looks as if Europe will in a few decades speak a single language .
When I was a student in Italy in 1990 , few Italians spoke English .
Now all educated people seem to be expected to -- and Europeans do not like to seem uneducated .
This is presumably a taboo subject , but if present trends continue , French and German will eventually go the way of Irish and Luxembourgish : they 'll be spoken in homes and by eccentric nationalists .
9. America Has Venture Funding .
Startups are easier to start in America because funding is easier to get .
There are now a few VC firms outside the US , but startup funding does n't only come from VC firms .
A more important source , because it 's more personal and comes earlier in the process , is money from individual angel investors .
Google might never have got to the point where they could raise millions from VC funds if they had n't first raised a hundred thousand from Andy Bechtolsheim .
And he could help them because he was one of the founders of Sun .
This pattern is repeated constantly in startup hubs .
It 's this pattern that makes them startup hubs .
The good news is , all you have to do to get the process rolling is get those first few startups successfully launched .
If they stick around after they get rich , startup founders will almost automatically fund and encourage new startups .
The bad news is that the cycle is slow .
It probably takes five years , on average , before a startup founder can make angel investments .
And while governments might be able to set up local VC funds by supplying the money themselves and recruiting people from existing firms to run them , only organic growth can produce angel investors .
Incidentally , America 's private universities are one reason there 's so much venture capital .
A lot of the money in VC funds comes from their endowments .
So another advantage of private universities is that a good chunk of the country 's wealth is managed by enlightened investors .
10 . America Has Dynamic Typing for Careers .
Compared to other industrialized countries the US is disorganized about routing people into careers .
For example , in America people often do n't decide to go to medical school till they 've finished college .
In Europe they generally decide in high school .
The European approach reflects the old idea that each person has a single , definite occupation -- which is not far from the idea that each person has a natural " station " in life .
If this were true , the most efficient plan would be to discover each person 's station as early as possible , so they could receive the training appropriate to it .
In the US things are more haphazard .
But that turns out to be an advantage as an economy gets more liquid , just as dynamic typing turns out to work better than static for ill - defined problems .
This is particularly true with startups .
" Startup founder " is not the sort of career a high school student would choose .
If you ask at that age , people will choose conservatively .
They 'll choose well - understood occupations like engineer , or doctor , or lawyer .
Startups are the kind of thing people do n't plan , so you 're more likely to get them in a society where it's ok to make career decisions on the fly .
For example , in theory the purpose of a PhD program is to train you to do research .
But fortunately in the US this is another rule that is n't very strictly enforced .
In the US most people in CS PhD programs are there simply because they wanted to learn more .
They have n't decided what they 'll do afterward .
So American grad schools spawn a lot of startups , because students do n't feel they 're failing if they do n't go into research .
Those worried about America's " competitiveness " often suggest spending more on public schools .
But perhaps America 's lousy public schools have a hidden advantage .
Because they 're so bad , the kids adopt an attitude of waiting for college .
I did ; I knew I was learning so little that I was n't even learning what the choices were , let alone which to choose .
This is demoralizing , but it does at least make you keep an open mind .
Certainly if I had to choose between bad high schools and good universities , like the US , and good high schools and bad universities , like most other industrialized countries , I 'd take the US system .
Better to make everyone feel like a late bloomer than a failed child prodigy .
Attitudes
There 's one item conspicuously missing from this list : American attitudes .
Americans are said to be more entrepreneurial , and less afraid of risk .
But America has no monopoly on this .
Indians and Chinese seem plenty entrepreneurial , perhaps more than Americans .
Some say Europeans are less energetic , but I do n't believe it .
I think the problem with Europe is not that they lack balls , but that they lack examples .
Even in the US , the most successful startup founders are often technical people who are quite timid , initially , about the idea of starting their own company .
Few are the sort of backslapping extroverts one thinks of as typically American .
They can usually only summon up the activation energy to start a startup when they meet people who 've done it and realize they could too .
I think what holds back European hackers is simply that they do n't meet so many people who 've done it .
You see that variation even within the US .
Stanford students are more entrepreneurial than Yale students , but not because of some difference in their characters ; the Yale students just have fewer examples .
I admit there seem to be different attitudes toward ambition in Europe and the US .
In the US it 's ok to be overtly ambitious , and in most of Europe it 's not .
But this can't be an intrinsically European quality ; previous generations of Europeans were as ambitious as Americans .
What happened ?
My hypothesis is that ambition was discredited by the terrible things ambitious people did in the first half of the twentieth century .
Now swagger is out .
( Even now the image of a very ambitious German presses a button or two , does n't it ? )
It would be surprising if European attitudes were n't affected by the disasters of the twentieth century .
It takes a while to be optimistic after events like that .
But ambition is human nature .
Gradually it will re-emerge . [ 6 ]
How To Do Better
I do n't mean to suggest by this list that America is the perfect place for startups .
It 's the best place so far , but the sample size is small , and " so far " is not very long .
On historical time scales , what we have now is just a prototype .
So let 's look at Silicon Valley the way you 'd look at a product made by a competitor .
What weaknesses could you exploit ?
How could you make something users would like better ?
The users in this case are those critical few thousand people you 'd like to move to your silicon valley .
To start with , Silicon Valley is too far from San Francisco .
Palo
Alto , the original ground zero , is about thirty miles away , and the present center more like forty .
So people who come to work in Silicon Valley face an unpleasant choice : either live in the boring sprawl of the valley proper , or live in San Francisco and endure an hour commute each way .
The best thing would be if the silicon valley were not merely closer to the interesting city , but interesting itself .
And there is a lot of room for improvement here .
Palo
Alto is not so bad , but everything built since is the worst sort of strip development .
You can measure how demoralizing it is by the number of people who will sacrifice two hours a day commuting rather than live there .
Another area in which you could easily surpass Silicon Valley is public transportation .
There is a train running the length of it , and by American standards it 's not bad .
Which is to say that to Japanese or Europeans it would seem like something out of the third world .
The kind of people you want to attract to your silicon valley like to get around by train , bicycle , and on foot .
So if you want to beat America , design a town that puts cars last .
It will be a while before any American city can bring itself to do that .
Capital Gains
There are also a couple things you could do to beat America at the national level .
One would be to have lower capital gains taxes .
It does n't seem critical to have the lowest income taxes , because to take advantage of those , people have to move . [ 7 ]
But if capital gains rates vary , you move assets , not yourself , so changes are reflected at market speeds .
The lower the rate , the cheaper it is to buy stock in growing companies as opposed to real estate , or bonds , or stocks bought for the dividends they pay .
So if you want to encourage startups you should have a low rate on capital gains .
Politicians are caught between a rock and a hard place here , however : make the capital gains rate low and be accused of creating " tax breaks for the rich , " or make it high and starve growing companies of investment capital .
As Galbraith said , politics is a matter of choosing between the unpalatable and the disastrous .
A lot of governments experimented with the disastrous in the twentieth century ; now the trend seems to be toward the merely unpalatable .
Oddly enough , the leaders now are European countries like Belgium , which has a capital gains tax rate of zero .
Immigration
The other place you could beat the US would be with smarter immigration policy .
There are huge gains to be made here .
Silicon valleys are made of people , remember .
Like a company whose software runs on Windows , those in the current Silicon Valley are all too aware of the shortcomings of the INS , but there 's little they can do about it .
They 're hostages of the platform .
America 's immigration system has never been well run , and since 2001 there has been an additional admixture of paranoia .
What fraction of the smart people who want to come to America can even get in ?
I doubt even half .
Which means if you made a competing technology hub that let in all smart people , you 'd immediately get more than half the world 's top talent , for free .
US immigration policy is particularly ill - suited to startups , because it reflects a model of work from the 1970s .
It assumes good technical people have college degrees , and that work means working for a big company .
If you do n't have a college degree you can't get an H1B visa , the type usually issued to programmers .
But a test that excludes Steve Jobs , Bill Gates , and Michael Dell can't be a good one .
Plus you can't get a visa for working on your own company , only for working as an employee of someone else's .
And if you want to apply for citizenship you dare n't work for a startup at all , because if your sponsor goes out of business , you have to start over .
American immigration policy keeps out most smart people , and channels the rest into unproductive jobs .
It would be easy to do better .
Imagine if , instead , you treated immigration like recruiting -- if you made a conscious effort to seek out the smartest people and get them to come to your country .
A country that got immigration right would have a huge advantage .
At this point you could become a mecca for smart people simply by having an immigration system that let them in .
A Good Vector
If you look at the kinds of things you have to do to create an environment where startups condense , none are great sacrifices .
Great universities ?
Livable towns ?
Civil liberties ?
Flexible employment laws ?
Immigration policies that let in smart people ?
Tax laws that encourage growth ?
It 's not as if you have to risk destroying your country to get a silicon valley ; these are all good things in their own right .
And then of course there 's the question , can you afford not to ?
I can imagine a future in which the default choice of ambitious young people is to start their own company rather than work for someone else's .
I 'm not sure that will happen , but it 's where the trend points now .
And if that is the future , places that do n't have startups will be a whole step behind , like those that missed the Industrial Revolution .
Notes
[ 1 ] On the verge of the Industrial Revolution , England was already the richest country in the world .
As far as such things can be compared , per capita income in England in 1750 was higher than India 's in 1960 .
Deane , Phyllis , The First Industrial Revolution , Cambridge University Press , 1965 .
[ 2 ] This has already happened once in China , during the Ming Dynasty , when the country turned its back on industrialization at the command of the court .
One of Europe 's advantages was that it had no government powerful enough to do that .
[ 3 ] Of course , Feynman and Diogenes were from adjacent traditions , but Confucius , though more polite , was no more willing to be told what to think .
[ 4 ]
For similar reasons it might be a lost cause to try to establish a silicon valley in Israel .
Instead of no Jews moving there , only Jews would move there , and I do n't think you could build a silicon valley out of just Jews any more than you could out of just Japanese .
( This is not a remark about the qualities of these groups , just their sizes .
Japanese are only about 2 % of the world population , and Jews about .2 % . )
[ 5 ] According to the World Bank , the initial capital requirement for German companies is 47.6 % of the per capita income .
Doh .

[ 6 ] For most of the twentieth century , Europeans looked back on the summer of 1914 as if they 'd been living in a dream world .
It seems more accurate ( or at least , as accurate ) to call the years after 1914 a nightmare than to call those before a dream .
A lot of the optimism Europeans consider distinctly American is simply what they too were feeling in 1914 .
[ 7 ] The point where things start to go wrong seems to be about 50 % .
Above that people get serious about tax avoidance .
The reason is that the payoff for avoiding tax grows hyperexponentially ( x /1 - x for 0 < x < 1 ) .
If your income tax rate is 10 % , moving to Monaco would only give you 11 % more income , which would n't even cover the extra cost .
If it 's 90 % , you 'd get ten times as much income .
And at 98 % , as it was briefly in Britain in the 70s , moving to Monaco would give you fifty times as much income .
It seems quite likely that European governments of the 70s never drew this curve .

The sensor , slightly bigger than a coin , is inexpensive
The hues of a series of 36 dots detect lung cancer accurately in just under three out of four people with the disease , the researchers told Thorax .
The concept of a " gas fingerprint " for lung cancer is not new , but the kit is .
The sensor , which is slightly bigger than a quarter dollar or a two pound coin , is inexpensive and easy to use .
It could revolutionise the way cancer is detected and potentially save lives , say the Cleveland Clinic doctors .
Experts have known for many years that the chemical composition of a person 's breath changes when they develop lung cancer .
Dogs - animals with a very keen sense of smell - are able to distinguish the breath of patients with lung cancer from that of healthy people , for example .
Volatile organic compounds
This is because lung cancer cells give off chemicals , called volatile organic compounds or VOCs , which are then breathed out .
In the past , scientists have used highly sensitive machines such as gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy to " read " these VOCs with extreme accuracy .
But the machines are expensive to use and require specially trained experts to interpret the results .
In comparison , the colour sensor is cheap and easy to read , say the researchers .
The spots on the sensor change colour according to the chemicals with which they come into contact .
The researchers used the colour sensor to test the breath of 122 people with different types of lung disease , including 49 with cancer , and 21 healthy people .
It was able to accurately predict the presence of cancer in just under three out of four of those with lung cancer , including very early tumours .
This is crucial because lung cancer is often silent in its early stages , making it difficult to pick up at a stage when it could be treated effectively , explained lead researcher Dr Peter Mazzone and his team .
" Ultimately , this line of investigation could lead to an inexpensive , non-invasive screening or diagnostic test for lung cancer , " they explained .
Dr Jesme Fox , medical oncologist and medical director at the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation , said : " There is a desperate need to get people diagnosed earlier .
" At the moment we rely on people coming forward with symptoms , or a suspect chest x-ray picked up purely by chance .
" In the UK our five - year survival for lung cancer is about seven out of 100 .
" That 's appalling .
Within one year from diagnosis almost 80 % are dead .
That 's because people are picked up when the disease is advanced .
" If you pick it up early these people have a good chance of survival .
" This breath test certainly looks promising , being easy to use and non-invasive . "
She said the test would require more development before it could become available clinically .
Earlier I wrote
how Google seems to have had a bad week , with some recent negative publicity
making it seem like the tipping point of Google becoming the big bad company
they do n’t want to be happening — at least perhaps in the eyes of many opinion
makers on the web .
Clearly I was n’t
alone thinking this .
But then again , I ca n’t help but note that I ’ve seen people question whether
Google has lost popular goodwill so many times over the years .
I thought it
would be useful to actually list a number of these " tipping points " that Google’s
nonetheless survived .
February 2001 : Deja Tipping Point
Google ’s first serious crisis , in my view , was when it had to alter the Deja
newsgroup service temporarily .
Acquired in February 2001 , later that month
functionality was greatly reduced .
My
article
from the time covers the " revolt " and upset that Google faced during this time .
Until then , Google pretty much had been viewed as a sweetheart company that
could do no wrong .
Despite the outcry , Google continued upward .
And the service
did get much better , as promised .
April 2002 : Scientology Tipping Point
After Google overstepped and pulled too many pages from an anti-Scientology
web site , an outcry that kicked up concerns about censorship .
Pages were
restored , and Google also instituted a policy of publicly listing Digital
Millennium Copyright
Act requests its received .
My
article
from the time has more .
August 2002 : Google Watch Born Milestone
Not really a tipping point , but a milestone worth noting .
Google gained its
first serious anti-Google web site , Daniel Brandt’s
Google Watch .
This happened during
the midst of a number of other issues making people wonder if Google was getting
too big and powerful .
From the opening of my
Google : Can
The Marcia Brady Of Search Stay Sweet ?
article at the time , covering these
developments :
Anyone who ’s ever watched the 70s television show " The Brady Bunch " knows
that eldest daughter Marcia was the star of the family .
At least , this was the
view of middle daughter Jan , who complained once that everyone was always
talking about " Marcia , Marcia , Marcia ! "
Jan ’s words have echoing through my head for the past few months , because
in matters of search , I ’ve been hearing a crescendo of " Google , Google ,
Google ! "
In the " Search Engine Bunch , " Google is Marcia Brady , the family member who
seemingly gets more attention than the others .
But while the Jans of the bunch
might be envious of Google ’s popularity , there are also serious downsides to
being at the top .
In particular , Google ’s biggest challenge may be that so many people now
see it as the only search engine that " matters , " a marketplace dominance in
search that seems akin to that which Microsoft has with operating systems ,
office software and web browsers .
Microsoft ’s supremacy as a company has caused it to be widely loathed .
Does
search dominance by Google mean that the company is destined to face general
hatred , as well ?
Such a fate is not preordained , as we shall see .
But first ,
let ’s review just a few examples of how people have viewed Google as all
powerful .
December 2002 : Listing Issues Make The New York Times Milestone
Another milestone moment .
I ’d warned that listing issues might be a potential
downfall for Google earlier this year .
So had others in the SEO space .
By the
end of 2002 , we have a first major mainstream media look at this ,
Sites Become Dependent on Google on Dec. 9 , 2002 .
This end quote from the
article sound familiar ?
The free ride may not last , however .
Ms. Johnson of Forrester says larger
companies have been discovering the power of search engines and site
optimization .
As was the case on eBay when big retailers moved in , search
listings are becoming less democratic .
" It ’s going to be more and more
difficult for small sellers to get noticed , " she said .
" The free listings
lunch may be ending soon . "
You hear small sites say the same things today , which indicates the free ride
did NOT go away over all those years despite the fears .
And the smart money , I’d
say , is that it ’s still not going to be going away for years to come .
January 2003 : Wired ’s Google Vs. Evil Article Milestone
Another milestone event .
This was the first major look
from Wired
at Google ’s " Do n’t Be Evil " philosophy , with the company somewhat arrogantly
suggesting with that philosophy that other companies are evil .
It covers many of
the things I discussed in that " Marcia Brady of search " article a half - year
before , but the questions and concerns about how Google might develop had only
grown .
The concluding paragraph :
It ’s inevitable that a company of Google ’s size and influence will have to
compromise on purity .
There ’s a chance that , in five years , Google will end up
looking like a slightly cleaner version of what Yahoo ! has become .
There ’s
also a chance that the site will be able to make a convincing case to
investors that long - term user satisfaction trumps short - term profit .
The
leadership of the Internet is Sergey Brin ’s to lose .
For now , at least , in
Google we trust .
Google - Opoly : The Game No One but
Google Can Play from Slate on Jan. 29 , 2003 also gets in on the " is Google
to be feared " action .
February 2003 : Google & Big Brother Nomination Tipping Point
In February
2003 , Google was nominated
by the Google Watch for Privacy International’s
2003 US Big
Brother Awards .
Anyone could be nominated for it .
Gandhi could have been
nominated for it .
And Google did n’t win it .
But the specter Google having an
" immortal " cookie along with other privacy allegations continue to haunt it to
this day .
Has Google
Ruined the Web ? from PC Magazine and
The Web , According to Google from BusinessWeek are just two of the negative
articles that resulted in June of that year , and I still see articles like these
continue on .
For a long
look at the allegations , see my
Google And
The Big Brother Nomination article from the time .
Despite the allegations ,
Google survived the crisis and continued to grow .
Indeed , it was the
only major
search engine to stand up to a wide - ranging request for search records from the
US government earlier this year .
AOL , Microsoft and Yahoo also gave information
that did n’t violate personally identifiable information but still raised plenty
of red flags warranting opposition .
June 2003 : Is There A Google Backlash Milestone
Another milestone .
The
Google backlash from Salon on June 25 , 2003 is the first major " is there a
backlash " piece that I can recall .
I wrote about this article at the time :
Is Google ’s popularity causing a backlash against it ?
When Salon writer
Farhad Manjoo asked me , my response was immediate .
Absolutely .
Google is no
longer some tiny , start - up company .
It ’s a search behemoth , and behemoths of
any type make some people nervous .
As always , there are some serious concerns about Google , as explained in
this article .
And as always , many of these are applicable to other search
engines , as well .
This may have been the first major mainstream " backlash " article , but it was
hardly the last
Is a Google Backlash Building ? from BusinessWeek in 2004 was another .
There
have been many since .
June 2003 : Google As God Milestone
Yet another milestone .
Is Google God ? was the name of the Thomas Friedman ’s column in the New York
Times on June 29 , 2003 .
It was one of the worst things that could happen to
Google .
That ’s because it put Google up on an impossible pedestal that it could
only slip from .
From my review of the article at the time :
Could we now make it a requirement that anyone planning to write about
Google must use at least one other search engine ?
Perhaps then we ’ll see some
perspective .
This opinion piece hits a new Google high — Google as God .
If Google is God , then someone should explain to columnist Thomas Friedman
that the search engine universe , like ancient Greece and Rome , has several of
them .
Other search engines have the incredible power to show you what people
are searching for worldwide , just like Google
November 2003 : Google ’s Florida Update Tipping Point
A major ranking algorithm update
knocks
many sites out of rankings they ’d held for months if not years , right before the
holiday season .
Panic ensues on search forums .
Google is declared scroogelike .
Despite injuring so many sites , Google survives .
April 2004 : Gmail Tipping Point
Soon after Gmail was launched , major waves of concern over ads being targeted
toward email content erupted .
Laws were even proposed specifically to stop it .
This was probably the biggest unexpected crisis Google faced outside of Deja
nearly three years before .
The company had to spend major amounts of time
convincing people it was not going to violate privacy .
Concerns remain , but
Google ’s largely overcome this particular tipping point .
April 2004 : Jew Watch Tipping Point
The high ranking of an anti-Jewish site for a search on " jew " gets Google
execs such as Sergey Brin out to defend the company plus causes the first ever
disclaimer to be posted on Google ’s search results pages , outside of DMCA
removal notices .
More from my
article
at the time .
August 19 , 2004 : Google Goes Public Tipping Point
Google forced to go public to satisfy US laws plus provide employees some
payoff .
It ’s a tipping point simply because it led to the inevitable loss of
trusted Googlers who ’d been with the company from the start and built its
culture ( Google ’s marketing chief Cindy McCaffrey was one of the
first to go ) .
It also leaves the company forced to respond to Wall Street pressures ,
already illustrated before it goes public by lowering its initial bid price .
It ’s an ongoing crisis where the outcome remains unknown .
It ’s naive to think
Google post -IPO could stay as the fairly innocent company it once was .
But can
it be a major corporation yet still enjoy large popularity and trust .
Despite blogosphere opinion , I ’d say that so far with rank - and - file ordinary
users , that ’s remained the case .
It ’s self - evident in the continued usage of
Google .
Here ’s a recent New York Times article
also finding users still loving Google even when aware of its growth .
Will
that opinion stay strong ?
February 2005 : Click Fraud Tipping Point
Click fraud was going to be the death of Google , with advertisers bringing it
down .
Just over
a year later , a $ 90 million settlement was reached , not even pocket change to
the Big G .
April 2005 : Grand Plan Tipping Point
Newsweek looks
at concerns that Google does n’t seem to have any rhyme or reason to what
it ’s doing , especially after the idea that Yahoo somehow has
gained the
product mojo ( and see
here ) .
Google ’s Marissa Mayer responds , " We definitely have a grand plan . "
Despite
that , the concerns do n’t go away .
Google does n’t help when Google CEO Eric
Schmidt has this
exchange with Information Week in May 2005 :
InformationWeek : … people outside the company like to imagine that
there ’s some sort of grand strategic vision that ’s driving everything .
Schmidt : [ laughs ]
They ’ve obviously not visited Google .
We delight
in the lack of such strategy .
We ’re very careful to say we ’re not trying to
build one thing .
We ’re trying to innovate in all these interesting spaces .
The crisis is n’t resolved .
There ’s a stream of speculation that Google can ’t
have another big homegrown success as with search , such as in this Fortune
article from October 2006 .
Google also recent
called for a
pause on new products to improve existing ones .
August 2005 : Portal Tipping Point
" Google does not do horoscopes , financial advice or chat . "
That was part of
Google ’s original philosophy pitch when it said it was n’t going to be like all
those portals that neglected search .
By August 2005 ,
it was clear
even to Google that it was doing these things , so the philosophy page was
changed .
Despite becoming a portal ( it still wo n’t admit to being a portal , but
stealth portal it
is ) — despite putting ads on its home page ( like
here and
here ) Google
continues to draw traffic and thus seems to still be surviving the crisis .
September 2006 : Copyright Tipping Point 1
The first of several lawsuits over Google scanning in copyright books from
libraries is
filed .
The program continues to draw fire from all types of publishers , and
the controversy shows no sign of abating .
Arguably , it ’s one of the worst PR
problems that Google faces .
Then again , its program where publishers
participating in the book search project has plenty of supporters .
January 2006 : Google Censors In China Tipping Point
One of the biggest issues Google has faced continues to dog it .
The search
engine censors
( and see here ) its
results in order to try and become a more successful business in China .
The spin
that this ensures many people have access to at least lots of information still
does n’t wash in many quarters , especially when Google is self - admittedly evil
using its own
EvilRank scale .
Still , despite the censorship , Google has continued onward
and upward — though ironically , still not so successfully in China .
September 2006 : Copyright Tipping Point 2
This deserves separate attention over copyright , since it deals with content
being found through automated fashion , rather than scanning — the core of how
Google operates .
Belgium news publishers win a case to get themselves removed from Google ,
something that could have happened without a lawsuit .
But the
point is
really to try and force Google to pay them for inclusion .
Perhaps it works .
Google strikes an
agreement with some , though not the main party .
An agreement with the
Associated Press happened earlier this year .
Google denies these are specifically about protecting the right to crawl ,
though the agreements stave off those lawsuits .
Whether many more publishers
will force it to come up with agreements remains to be seen .
December 2006 : Tips Tipping Point
Small " tips " promoting Google products
create a fairly
large uproar , almost seeming to be a straw that broke the camels back over
growing concerns about Google .
Is this the real tipping point where trust is
lost ?
Is it just the latest in a series of tipping points Google overcomes ?
Or
is the real tipping point simply that each of these tipping points in totally
reduce the company down into something more ordinary , more typical company like .
I ’m sure I ’m probably missing some big tipping points here .
Not everyone will
agree with what I ’ve written , of course .
Please share your thoughts and opinions
below .
Correction Appended
By reconstructing ancient genes from long - extinct animals , scientists have for the first time demonstrated the step - by - step progression of how evolution created a new piece of molecular machinery by reusing and modifying existing parts .
The researchers say the findings , published today in the journal Science , offer a counterargument to doubters of evolution who question how a progression of small changes could produce the intricate mechanisms found in living cells .
" The evolution of complexity is a longstanding issue in evolutionary biology , " said Joseph W. Thornton , professor of biology at the University of Oregon and lead author of the paper .
" We wanted to understand how this system evolved at the molecular level .
There 's no scientific controversy over whether this system evolved .
The question for scientists is how it evolved , and that 's what our study showed . "
Charles Darwin wrote in The Origin of Species , " If it would be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have formed by numerous , successive , slight modifications , my theory would absolutely break down . "
SCIENCE , being a human activity , is not immune to fashion .
For example , one of the first mathematicians to study the subject of probability theory was an English clergyman called Thomas Bayes , who was born in 1702 and died in 1761 .
His ideas about the prediction of future events from one or two examples were popular for a while , and have never been fundamentally challenged .
But they were eventually overwhelmed by those of the “ frequentist ” school , which developed the methods based on sampling from a large population that now dominate the field and are used to predict things as diverse as the outcomes of elections and preferences for chocolate bars .
Recently , however , Bayes 's ideas have made a comeback among computer scientists trying to design software with human - like intelligence .
Bayesian reasoning now lies at the heart of leading internet search engines and automated “ help wizards ” .
That has prompted some psychologists to ask if the human brain itself might be a Bayesian - reasoning machine .
They suggest that the Bayesian capacity to draw strong inferences from sparse data could be crucial to the way the mind perceives the world , plans actions , comprehends and learns language , reasons from correlation to causation , and even understands the goals and beliefs of other minds .
These researchers have conducted laboratory experiments that convince them they are on the right track , but only recently have they begun to look at whether the brain copes with everyday judgments in the real world in a Bayesian manner .
In research to be published later this year in Psychological Science , Thomas Griffiths of Brown University in Rhode Island and Joshua Tenenbaum of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology put the idea of a Bayesian brain to a quotidian test .
They found that it passes with flying colours .
Prior assumptions
The key to successful Bayesian reasoning is not in having an extensive , unbiased sample , which is the eternal worry of frequentists , but rather in having an appropriate “ prior ” , as it is known to the cognoscenti .
This prior is an assumption about the way the world works — in essence , a hypothesis about reality — that can be expressed as a mathematical probability distribution of the frequency with which events of a particular magnitude happen .
The best known of these probability distributions is the “ normal ” , or Gaussian distribution .
This has a curve similar to the cross-section of a bell , with events of middling magnitude being common , and those of small and large magnitude rare , so it is sometimes known by a third name , the bell - curve distribution .
But there are also the Poisson distribution , the Erlang distribution , the power - law distribution and many even weirder ones that are not the consequence of simple mathematical equations ( or , at least , of equations that mathematicians regard as simple ) .
With the correct prior , even a single piece of data can be used to make meaningful Bayesian predictions .
By contrast frequentists , though they deal with the same probability distributions as Bayesians , make fewer prior assumptions about the distribution that applies in any particular situation .
Frequentism is thus a more robust approach , but one that is not well suited to making decisions on the basis of limited information — which is something that people have to do all the time .
Dr Griffiths and Dr Tenenbaum conducted their experiment by giving individual nuggets of information to each of the participants in their study ( of which they had , in an ironically frequentist way of doing things , a total of 350 ) , and asking them to draw a general conclusion .
For example , many of the participants were told the amount of money that a film had supposedly earned since its release , and asked to estimate what its total “ gross ” would be , even though they were not told for how long it had been on release so far .
Besides the returns on films , the participants were asked about things as diverse as the number of lines in a poem ( given how far into the poem a single line is ) , the time it takes to bake a cake ( given how long it has already been in the oven ) , and the total length of the term that would be served by an American congressman ( given how long he has already been in the House of Representatives ) .
All of these things have well - established probability distributions , and all of them , together with three other items on the list — an individual 's lifespan given his current age , the run-time of a film , and the amount of time spent on hold in a telephone queuing system — were predicted accurately by the participants from lone pieces of data .
There were only two exceptions , and both proved the general rule , though in different ways .
Some 52 % of people predicted that a marriage would last forever when told how long it had already lasted .
As the authors report , “ this accurately reflects the proportion of marriages that end in divorce ” , so the participants had clearly got the right idea .
But they had got the detail wrong .
Even the best marriages do not last forever .
Somebody dies .
And “ forever ” is not a mathematically tractable quantity , so Dr Griffiths and Dr Tenenbaum abandoned their analysis of this set of data .
The other exception was a topic unlikely to be familiar to 21st - century Americans — the length of the reign of an Egyptian Pharaoh in the fourth millennium BC .
People consistently overestimated this , but in an interesting way .
The analysis showed that the prior they were applying was an Erlang distribution , which was the correct type .
They just got the parameters wrong , presumably through ignorance of political and medical conditions in fourth - millennium BC Egypt .
On congressmen 's term - lengths , which also follow an Erlang distribution , they were spot on .
Indeed , one of the most impressive things Dr Griffiths and Dr Tenenbaum have shown is the range of distributions the mind can cope with .
Besides Erlang , they tested people with examples of normal distributions , power - law distributions and , in the case of baking cakes , a complex and irregular distribution .
They found that people could cope equally well with all of them , cakes included .
Indeed , they are so confident of their method that they think it could be reversed in those cases where the shape of a distribution in the real world is still a matter of debate .
To prove the point , they actually did such a reversal in the case of telephone - queue waiting times .
Traditionally , these have been assumed to follow a Poisson distribution , but some recent research suggests they actually follow a power law .
Analysing the participants ' responses suggests that a power law , indeed , it is .
How the priors are themselves constructed in the mind has yet to be investigated in detail .
Obviously they are learned by experience , but the exact process is not properly understood .
Indeed , some people suspect that the parsimony of Bayesian reasoning leads occasionally to it going spectacularly awry , with whatever process it is that forms the priors getting further and further off - track rather than converging on the correct distribution .
That might explain the emergence of superstitious behaviour , with an accidental correlation or two being misinterpreted by the brain as causal .
A frequentist way of doing things would reduce the risk of that happening .
But by the time the frequentist had enough data to draw a conclusion , he might already be dead .
The Six Most Feared but Least Likely Causes of Death
by www.SixWise.com
Deepak Chopra , M.D. , a pioneer of alternative medicine , once said that everything we fear has already happened .
In other words , there 's no need to fear most of what we spending time fearing .
Still , many Americans have intense fears of death by certain causes that are actually very unlikely to occur .
On the contrary , the most likely causes of death are rarely sources of fear for most of us .
What follows is a list of some of those common , yet unfounded , causes of death that are most feared ... yet least likely to occur .
Then , at the end of the article take a look at the real most common causes of death , and see if your fears are justified .
Airplane crashes : Some 30 million Americans describe themselves as " anxious " flyers .
What makes them anxious is the fear of dying in a plane crash .
What 's the actual risk of being involved in a fatal airline accident ?
According to Arnold Barnett , a statistical expert in the field of aviation safety , it 's once every 19,000 years -- and that is only provided the person flew on an airplane once a day for 19,000 years !
Being killed by a shark is a common fear , but one that 's totally unfounded :
Your odds of being attacked by a shark are just one in 11.5 million .
Shark attacks :
Do you refuse to go near the movie Jaws for fear that you 'll never go back in the water ?
You 're not alone , as many Americans fear getting killed by a shark .
According to the International Shark Attack File ( ISAF ) , though , only 1,909 confirmed shark attacks have occurred around the world -- between 1580 and 2003 !
Of these , 737 happened in the United States , and 38 people died as a result .
That said , what are your real odds of being attacked by a shark ?
One in 11.5 million , says the ISAF .
Being killed by a shark ?
Zero in 264.1 million .
Being murdered : According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , one person is murdered about every 60 seconds worldwide , and in 2000 , an estimated 520,000 people were murdered in the world .
Although this sounds like a lot , let us put things into perspective :
In 2000 , over 6 million people died of cancer .
Falling to death :
In 2001 , more than 11,600 people aged 65 and older died from fall - related injuries , representing a very real concern .
Children are also at risk of falling if they 're not being properly supervised .
But the type of fall we 're talking about here is the kind that occurs from a height and to adults .
While falling from a height is a leading cause of work - related death among construction workers , it kills only an estimated 80 people each year .
And , the risk to the general population , who are exposed to heights less often , is likely to be lower than that .
Terrorist attack :
With the recent London bombings and September 11th not too far behind , death by terrorist attack is fresh in many people 's minds .
A poll in Conde Nast Traveler in February 2003 found that one - third of respondents feared a terrorist attack .
What are your real odds of dying this way ?
Historically speaking , it 's a one in 9.3 million chance -- which is a slightly greater risk than you have of dying in an avalanche .
Natural disaster : Earthquakes , tornados , hurricanes , floods , storms , heat , cold ... all of these are perceived as a threat looming overhead at any time .
Your real lifetime odds of dying from a natural force like those listed above ?
One in 3,357 , according to the science and technology Web site LiveScience.com .
You 're much more likely to be killed by a fire or by committing suicide .
Actual Leading Causes of Death
An unhealthy diet is actually a leading cause of death in the United States .
Biggest fears aside , the Journal of the American Medical Association published a study that uncovered the actual leading causes of death in the United States ( in 2000 ) .
Overwhelmingly , these causes stem from our own , modifiable behaviors .
Tobacco ( 435,000 deaths , 18.1 percent of total U.S. deaths )
Poor diet and physical inactivity ( 400,000 deaths , 16.6 percent )
Alcohol consumption ( 85,000 deaths , 3.5 percent )
Microbial agents ( 75,000 )
Toxic agents ( 55,000 )
Motor vehicle crashes ( 43,000 )
Incidents involving firearms ( 29,000 )
Sexual behaviors ( 20,000 )
Illicit use of drugs ( 17,000 )

Home Run time type checking A couple of items that are loosely related .
First , Sun is updating the Java Class File Specification .
The main difference is the introduction of a new verification scheme based on type checking rather than type inference .
This scheme has inherent advantages in performance ( both space ( on the order of 90 % savings ) and time ( approximately 2x ) ) over the previous approach .
It is also simpler and more robust , and helps pave the way for future evolution of the platform .
I have n't read through the fine print of the changes yet - at some point I need to update my class file
The type rules that the typechecker enforces are specified by means of Prolog clauses .
English language text is used to describe the type rules in an informal way , while the Prolog code provides a formal specification .
On a different note , there is a new thesis paper on
Type analysis needs to compare dynamic types , which have to be computed from ( probably higher - order ) type expressions that may contain types from other modules .
If lazy linking has delayed the loading of these modules so far , then the corresponding types are represented by free type variables .
For the type - level computation in our model this means that it may encounter free type variables whose denotation depends on yet unevaluated term - level expressions .
To proceed , it inevitably has to eliminate these variables by triggering the necessary evaluations on term - level .
In other words : type - level computation has to account for lazy types .
We give two strategies for this and show soundness properties for the resulting calculi .
In general , it means you still have to with dynamic type checking in static languages - though the meaning is different than the runtime typing that occurs with dynamic PLs .
I have n't read through the fine print of the changes yet - at some point I need to update my class file disassembler - but then I still have n't gotten around to the changes in Java 5 which were much less involved .
One thing that I found interesting was the use of Prolog in the specification ( predicates and horn clauses ) .
On a different note , there is a new thesis paper on A Semantics For Lazy Types related to the Alice ML project .
The specifications for runtime type checking are in the more formal operational specs of ML and the runtime type checking is more ambitious than that associated with Java .
In general , it means you still have to with dynamic type checking in static languages - though the meaning is different than the runtime typing that occurs with dynamic PLs .

RESEARCHERS in the field of artificial intelligence have long been intrigued by games , and not just as a way of avoiding work .
Games provide an ideal setting to explore important elements of the design of cleverer machines , such as pattern recognition , learning and planning .
They also hold out the tantalising possibility of fame and fortune should the program ever clobber a human champion .
Ever since the stunning victory of Deep Blue , a program running on an IBM supercomputer , over Gary Kasparov , then world chess champion , in 1997 , it has been clear that computers would dominate that particular game .
Today , though , they are pressing the attack on every front .
They are the undisputed champions in draughts and Othello .
They are generally stronger in backgammon .
They are steadily gaining ground in Scrabble , poker and bridge .
And they are even doing pretty well at crossword puzzles .
There is one game , however , where humans still reign supreme : Go .
Yet here too their grip is beginning to loosen .
Go was invented more than 2,500 years ago in China ( Confucius considered it a waste of time ) .
It is a strategic contest in which two players take turns to place stones on the intersections of a grid with 19 lines on each side .
Each player tries to stake out territory and surround his opponent .
The rules are simple but the play is extraordinarily complex .
During a game , some stones will “ die ” , and some will appear to be dead but spring back to life at an inopportune moment .
It is often difficult to say who is winning right until the end .
Deep Blue and its successors beat Mr Kasparov using the “ brute force ” technique .
Rather than search for the best move in a given position , as humans do , the computer considers all white 's moves — even bad ones — and all black 's possible replies , and all white 's replies to those replies , and so on for , say , a dozen turns .
The resulting map of possible moves has millions of branches .
The computer combs through the possible outcomes and plays the one move that would give its opponent the fewest chances of winning .
Unfortunately , brute force will not work in Go. First , the game has many more possible positions than chess does .
Second , the number of possible moves from a typical position in Go is about 200 , compared with about a dozen in chess .
Finally , evaluating a Go position is fiendishly difficult .
The fastest programs can assess just 50 positions a second , compared with 500,000 in chess .
Clearly , some sort of finesse is required .
In the past two decades researchers have explored several alternative strategies , from neural networks to general rules based on advice from expert players , with indifferent results .
Now , however , programmers are making impressive gains with a technique known as the Monte Carlo method .
This form of statistical sampling is hardly new : it was originally developed in the Manhattan project to build the first nuclear bombs in the 1940s .
But it is proving effective .
Given a position , a program using a Monte Carlo algorithm contemplates every move and plays a large number of random games to see what happens .
If it wins in 80 % of those games , the move is probably good .
Otherwise , it keeps looking .
This may sound like a lot of effort but generating random games is the sort of thing computers excel at .
In fact , Monte Carlo techniques are much faster than brute force .
Moreover , two Hungarian computer scientists have recently added an elegant twist that allows the algorithm to focus on the most promising moves without sacrificing speed .
The result is a new generation of fast programs that play particularly well on small versions of the Go board .
In the past few months Monte Carlo - based programs have dominated computer tournaments on nine - and 13 - line grids .
MoGo , a program developed by researchers from the University of Paris , has even beaten a couple of strong human players on the smaller of these boards — unthinkable a year ago .
It is ranked 2,323rd in the world and in Europe 's top 300 .
Although MoGo is still some way from competing on the full - size Go grid , humanity may ultimately have to accept defeat on yet another front .

“ President Likens Dewey to Hitler as Fascist Tool . ”
So ran the New York Times headline on Oct. 26 , 1948 , after what Dewey biographer Richard Norton Smith called a “ particularly vitriolic attack in Chicago ” by Harry Truman .
What brings this to mind is President Bush ’s assertion that we are “ at war with Islamic fascism ” and “ Islamo - fascism . ”
After the transatlantic bomb plot was smashed , Bush said the plotters “ try to spread their jihadist message I call â€ “ it ’s totalitarian in nature , Islamic radicalism â€ “ Islamic fascism ; they try to spread it , as well , by taking the attack to those of us who love freedom . ”
What is wrong with the term Islamo - fascism ?
First , there is no consensus as to what “ fascism ” even means .
Orwell said when someone calls Smith a fascist , what he means is “ I hate Smith . ” By calling Smith a fascist , you force Smith to deny he ’s a sympathizer of Hitler and Mussolini .
As a concept , writes Arnold Beichman of the Hoover Institution , “ fascism … has no intellectual basis at all nor did its founders even pretend to have any .
Hitler ’s ravings in ‘ Mein Kampf ’ … Mussolini ’s boastful balcony speeches , all of these can be described , in the words of Roger Scruton , as an ‘ amalgam of disparate conceptions . ' ”
Richard Pipes considers Stalinism and Hilterism to be siblings of the same birth mother : “ Bolshevism and fascism were heresies of socialism . ”
Since the 1930s , “ fascist ” has been a term of hate and abuse used by the left against the right , as in the Harry Truman campaign .
In 1964 , Martin Luther King Jr. claimed to see in the Goldwater campaign “ dangerous signs of Hitlerism . ”
Twin the words “ Reagan , fascism ” in Google and 1,800,000 references pop up .
Unsurprisingly , it is neoconservatives , whose roots are in the Trotskyist - social Democratic left , who are promoting use of the term .
Their goal is to have Bush stuff al - Qaida , Hamas , Hezbollah , Syria and Iran into the same “ Islamo - fascist ” kill box , then let Strategic Air Command do the rest .
But the term represents the same lazy , shallow thinking that got us into Iraq , where Americans were persuaded that by dumping over Saddam , we were avenging 9/11 .
But Saddam was about as devout a practitioner of Islam as his hero Stalin was of the Russian Orthodox faith .
Saddam was into booze , mistresses , movies , monuments , palaces and dynasty .
Bin Laden loathed him and volunteered to fight him in 1991 , if Saudi Arabia would only not bring the Americans in to do the fighting Islamic warriors ought to be doing themselves .
And whatever “ Islamo - fascism ” means , Syria surely is not it .
It is a secular dictatorship Bush I bribed into becoming an ally in the Gulf War .
The Muslim Brotherhood is outlawed in Syria .
In 1982 , Hafez al - Assad perpetrated a massacre of the Brotherhood in the city of Hama that was awesome in its magnitude and horror .
As with Gadhafi , whom Bush let out of the penalty box after he agreed to pay $ 10 million to the family of each victim of Pan Am 103 and give up his nuclear program , America can deal with Syria as Israel did after the Yom Kippur War â€ “ for an armistice on the Golan that has stuck , as both sides have kept the deal .
America faces a variety of adversaries , enemies and evils .
But the Bombs - Away Caucus , as Iraq and Lebanon reveal , does not always have the right formula .
Al - Qaida , Hamas , Hezbollah , Syria and Iran all present separate challenges calling forth different responses .
Al - Qaida appears to exist for one purpose : Plot and perpetrate mass murder to terrorize Americans and Europeans into getting out of the Islamic world .
Contrary to what Bush believes , the 9/11 killers and London and Madrid bombers were not out to repeal the Bill of Rights , if any ever read it .
They are out to kill us , and we have to get them first .
Hamas and Hezbollah have used terrorism , but , like Begin ’s Irgun and Mandela ’s ANC , they have social and political agendas that require state power to implement .
And once a guerrilla - terrorist movement takes over a state , it acquires state assets and interests that are then vulnerable to U.S. military and economic power .
Why did the ayatollah let the American hostages go as Reagan raised his right hand to take the oath of office ?
Why did Syria not rush to the rescue of Hezbollah ?
What did Ahmadinejad not rocket Tel Aviv in solidarity with his embattled allies in Lebanon ?
Res ipse loquitor .
The thing speaks for itself .
They do n’t want war with Israel , and they do n’t want war with the United States .
“ Islamo - fascism ” should be jettisoned from Bush ’s vocabulary .
It yokes the faith of a billion people with an odious ideology .
Imagine how Christians would have reacted , had FDR taken to declaring Franco ’s Spain and Mussolini ’s Italy “ Christo - fascist . ”
If Bush does not want a war of civilizations , he will drop these propaganda terms that are designed to inflame passions rather than inform the public of the nature of the war we are in , and the war we are not in .

1. Cat-and - Mouse Warfare Equipment
Jeff De Boer is a Calgary - born artist with the fully unique approach to sculpture and design .
His fusion of industrial and whimsical styles is most evident in the " Armor for Cats and Mice " series showcased on his web site .
For those of you who pitied cats in their increasingly violent struggle against mice ( witness " Tom & Jerry " cartoons ) , now you can add an extra layer of protection for both parties .
Here is a tournament cat :
... and a gladiator mouse :
Copper Conquistador style :
Jeff admits that he has not yet put a mouse into a suit of armour .
He did , however , try it with one of his cats .
" I have the scars to prove it " , he admits in one interview , " Yes , it can be done , but that 's not the point . "
And on a side note , Jeff De Boer also creates very attractive " steampunk " - ish ray - guns :
weird helmets :
and larger installations , like the flying train sculptures in Calgary 's Chinook Mall :

Older teenage girls are far more likely than younger girls , or boys of any age , to use social - networking sites like MySpace or Facebook , according to a recent study by the Pew Internet & American Life Project .
The study found that , while older girls use such sites the most , older boys are more likely to meet new people through them .
Sixty percent of older boys , for example , say they use the sites to make new friends , while only 46 percent of older girls do .
And older boys are more than twice as likely to say they use the sites to flirt .
“ Older boys are much more expansive in their use of the sites , ” said Amanda Lenhart , one of the study ’s two authors .
“ I believe that it has a lot to do with socialization .
A lot of the media messages about safety tend to be aimed more at girls than boys . ”
The study was conducted over a month last fall , through telephone interviews with households with minor children , who were identified from random calls over the last three years .
The data was weighted to be nationally representative in terms of sex , age , education , race and other factors .

EVER since the Census Bureau released figures last month showing that married - couple households are now a minority , my phone has been ringing off the hook with calls from people asking : “ How can we save marriage ?
How can we make Americans understand that marriage is the most significant emotional connection they will ever make , the one place to find social support and personal fulfillment ? ”
I think these are the wrong questions — indeed , such questions would have been almost unimaginable through most of history .
It has only been in the last century that Americans have put all their emotional eggs in the basket of coupled love .
Because of this change , many of us have found joys in marriage our great - great - grandparents never did .
But we have also neglected our other relationships , placing too many burdens on a fragile institution and making social life poorer in the process .
A study released this year showed just how dependent we ’ve become on marriage .
Three sociologists at the University of Arizona and Duke University found that from 1985 to 2004 Americans reported a marked decline in the number of people with whom they discussed meaningful matters .
People reported fewer close relationships with co-workers , extended family members , neighbors and friends .
The only close relationship where more people said they discussed important matters in 2004 than in 1985 was marriage .
In fact , the number of people who depended totally on a spouse for important conversations , with no other person to turn to , almost doubled , to 9.4 percent from 5 percent .
Not surprisingly , the number of people saying they did n’t have anyone in whom they confided nearly tripled .
Linguist records one of world 's vanishing languages By Joann Loviglio , Associated Press PHILADELPHIA 
It is estimated that half the 6,800 human languages spoken worldwide could be extinct within 100 years , and a Swarthmore College linguist 's work documenting endangered tongues led him to one that was largely unknown to the outside world .
K. David Harrison spent two weeks in the summer in central Siberia in search of a language that he was n't sure still existed .
The last words of Middle Chulym might have been uttered long before , but there was no way to know without finding the small hunter - gatherer community last visited by scientists more than 30 years earlier and whose language was never documented .
A two - person camera crew accompanied Harrison and fellow researcher Gregory Anderson on their trek into deep Siberia , where they found the Middle Chulym living in a half - dozen villages that are interspersed among a larger Russian population , Harrison said .
They were living in much the same way as their ancestors have for centuries , but their ancestral language is dying .
" Of the 426 members of the community , our best estimate was that only 35 to 40 are fluent speakers of the language and the youngest fluent speaker we found was 52 years old , " Harrison said .
Harrison , who will present his findings on the Middle Chulym at the American Association for the Advancement of Science 's annual meeting on Feb. 15 in Seattle , stresses that he has n't " discovered " a " new " language .
It may be new to science but it has lived and breathed for centuries .
Harrison 's work with the Middle Chulym will appear in an upcoming PBS documentary " Vanishing Voices . "
" We 're also heading to the Southwest , where indigenous people are trying to save their own languages here in the States as well , " said filmmaker Seth Kramer at Ironbound Films Inc. , who traveled to Siberia with Harrison .
" There are parallels between the Native American community and the Chulym community ... losing their autonomy and losing their language . "
The Middle Chulym language echoes their way of life , with an abundance of words related to hunting and fishing , plants and flowers , weather and family relations .
But for many reasons , most have made Russian their sole spoken language .
As the Russian empire spread east in the 16th and 17th centuries , tribes along their path were subjugated .
In Soviet times , they had to join collective farms and abandon traditions ; they were n't educated in their native tongue ; they were n't recognized as a distinct ethnic group ; and their language was incorrectly lumped with others .
Social , political and economic pressures led many Middle Chulym to conclude that their ancestral language was inferior — even embarrassing .
It is now considered a " moribund " language , meaning children no longer speak it and it likely will become extinct .
Middle Chulym also was n't a written language .
However , the community 's 52 - year - old speaker created a writing system he used for two years in a hunting journal — the first and only book ever written in the language .
He destroyed the journal after being ridiculed by fellow villagers , but he recreated the script for Harrison .
" It was stunning , " Harrison said .
The writing system was " so clever , so perfect " that Harrison is producing a grammar of the language and plans to return to Siberia next year to develop a children 's storybook with the Middle Chulym — as a source of community pride and as a way of documenting the language for posterity before it vanishes .
" There is a catastrophic decline in the number and diversity of languages spoken in the world , " Harrison said .
" Every time we lose a language without documenting it , it leaves a huge gap in our understanding of the complex structures the human mind is capable of producing . "
Ethnologue.org has more information on Chulym , as does UNESCO Red Book entry .

The United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) says 99 % of maternal deaths are preventable yet every minute a woman dies from pregnancy - related causes .
This loss impacts not only on the family and society , but also on the economy , its latest report says .
UNFPA says investment in reproductive health and gender equality could spur growth and sustainable development .
Preventable killers
An estimated 529,000 women died from complications of pregnancy and childbirth in 2000 , virtually all in developing countries .
For every woman who dies , roughly 20 more suffer serious injury or disability - between 8 million and 20 million a year .
Experts agree that the majority of maternal deaths are preventable through family planning to reduce unintended pregnancies , skilled attendance at all deliveries and timely emergency obstetric care in all cases where complications arise .
If women are healthy then they can jump start the life of their family and the economy
Executive director of UNFPA Thoraya Obaid
Being pregnant in Africa
One of the eight Millennium Development Goals set by world experts in 2000 was to reduce by three quarters the maternal mortality ratio by 2015 .
Major reductions in the number of deaths have taken place in countries with either low or moderate levels of maternal mortality .
Similar progress , however , has not been made in countries where maternal mortality is high .
Executive director of UNFPA Thoraya Obaid said : " The problem is implementation and monitoring implementation .
" You have to spend more on healthcare and on looking after women .
" If women are healthy then they can jump start the life of their family and the economy . "
She called for the " utterly immoral " gap between the reproductive health of rich and poor women to be closed .
" In no other area of health are the disparities between rich and poor so wide and the tragic consequences so utterly immoral , " she told a news conference at the Foreign Press Association in London to launch a population report .
HIV / Aids
She said another big area of health affecting women was HIV / Aids .
Worldwide , young women aged 15 - 24 are 1.6 times as likely as young men to be HIV positive .
" In Africa , HIV / Aids has a young woman 's face and many of them are married .
It is their husband who brings HIV into the house .
Part of the problem is that developing countries are facing critical shortfalls of contraceptives and condoms .
She said that in sub-Saharan Africa : " One man has access to six condoms a year .
Certainly that is not sufficient to protect against HIV . "
Giving mothers , babies and children the care they need is an absolute imperative
Dr Lee Jong - Wook , director general of WHO
She believes the solution to the HIV problem is combination of sex education , abstinence , couples remaining faithful to their partners and greater use of condoms .
Other gender inequalities that need to be addressed include violence , education and human rights , says UNFPA .
" When women are educated , healthy and employed , and able to make decisions about childbearing and reproductive life , everyone benefits , " it says .
The World Health Organization has already warned that unless concerted effort is undertaken to meet global healthcare goals , the 2015 deadline set by the governments of the world will be missed .
Its World Health Report 2005 , back in April , said being poor or being a woman was often a reason for being discriminated against .
WHO 's director general Dr Lee Jong - Wook said : " Giving mothers , babies and children the care they need is an absolute imperative . "
Deborah Jack , chief executive of the National AIDS Trust said : " The UNFPA is right to focus on the need for greater effort to tackle gender inequality .
" Worldwide , millions of women are unable to protect themselves from HIV infection due to lack of prevention methods that can be controlled by women , causing unneccessary suffering and death .
" One of the most urgent actions is to increase funding for microbicide and vaccine development and invest in education that will ensure they are accepted within communities . "
Your comments :
This is not about birth rates , this is about the lack of meaningful investment in proper medical care , hygiene , education , and proper nutrition .
If you think the forced abortions in China are superior to democracy , I 'm surprised you even care about starving millions .

A progressive society can be measured by the way that its women are treated

It is sad seeing mothers and kids dying every minute from a cause that can be prevented .
As a student nurse , I am hoping one day I can pass on the knowledge to other women who are in the situation .
Vivian , Uesund , Norway
If all the money that has been poured into aid for third - world countries was used for contraception , there would be no hunger in the world today .
Forget about saving the starving millions , you can not even dent the surface .
Stop the runaway birth rate and a couple of generations will see the answer .
China is leading the way - democracy is preventing governments from making the difficult decisions
Devon Fletcher , Australia
Self supporting , self sufficient , independent and educated .
This should be the mantra for women today .
Only then can we hope to see a change in the situation .
Karl Irani , Bombay , India
These are such very basic common - sense recommendations that it 's appalling they 're not already in place .
Compare the situation to the US , where we have all these measures ( or , at least , the middle classes and rich do ) , but where the powerful " religious right " is lobbying to take them away .
Kaz , Briton in NJ , USA
I think we should see more articles like this .
Women 's health has always been at the bottom of everyone 's list .
Articles like this bring to the fore front the seriousness of this issue .
The reality that if women are not looked or looking after themselves our whole society pays the bill .
We need to hear more on the subject .
Deirdrie Ellis , London Canada
Health is not a gender issue but a poverty issue .
It effects men as women and depends on the area they live .
For this to be seen as a woman issue is typical of the real discrimination .
Western women will use this sort of article to further discriminate against men .

Automatische Erkennung von gefälschten wissenschaftlichen Texten Florian Rötzer
Nachdem Informatiker ein Programm zur Erzeugung scheinbar wissenschaftlicher , aber unsinniger Texte geschrieben haben , haben nun andere ein Programm vorgestellt , um Fake - Texte zu identifizieren
In der Technik kennt man das Phänomen , dass Probleme , die von einer Technik verursacht werden , durch eine andere beseitigt werden sollen , die dann womöglich erneut unvorhergesehene Probleme verursacht .
Solche Zirkel oder auch dialektische Dynamiken gibt es auch woanders , beispielsweise in den Wissenschaften .
Da mit der Digitalisierung von Texten und dem Internet die Suche nach Inhalten und die Reproduktion von Textteilen sich wesentlich vereinfacht hat , wird vermutlich mehr denn je plagiiert und geklaut ( Copy & Paste - Epidemie an Schulen und Universitäten ) .
Dagegen wurden Programme entwickelt , die Plagiate feststellen sollen , was die geschickteren Kopierer nur dazu bringt , ihre kognitionsreduzierenden Strategien etwas feiner als mit der brutalen Cut&Paste - Methode auszuführen , also zumindest Kopien mit Variationen durch Shaken , Umformulieren oder Neukombination herzustellen .
Wissenschaftler , besonders junge , die erst ins Geschäft kommen und sich einen Namen machen wollen , brauchen Veröffentlichungen und die Teilnahme an Konferenzen als Belege ( Unethische Autorenschaften in den Wissenschaften ) .
Daraus hat sich eine Art Wissenschaftszirkus entwickelt , wie er beispielsweise von den überall auf der Welt stattfindenden Nagib - Callaos - Konferenzen bedient wird , die mehr oder weniger direkt etwas mit Informatik zu tun haben ( Konferenz - Spam wird rekursiv ) .
Für eine dieser Konferenzen , der " World Multiconference on Systemics , Cybernetics and Informatics 2005 " in Orlando , hatten Informatiker vom MIT mit einem Programm ein Paper für die Teilnahme eingereicht , das zwar syntaktisch richtige Sätze mitsamt Titel , Kurzzusammenfassung , Gliederung , methodischen Anmerkungen , Diagrammen , Literaturverweisen und Literaturverzeichnis enthielt , aber unsinnig war .
Das Paper wurde von den Gutachtern , die es angeblich geben soll , zugelassen , weil offenbar nicht wirklich gelesen ( Kopiert statt gelesen ) oder verstanden , die jungen Wissenschaftler hatten ihren Spaß , wurden aber dann ausgeladen , so dass sie ihren Fake nicht zur Blamage der Veranstalter vortragen konnten ( " Rooter " , Sokal und die fabelhafte Welt der Kybernetik ) .
Aber natürlich ist es für Informatiker nicht nur eine reizvolle Aufgabe , ein Programm zu schreiben , das täuschend echte wissenschaftliche Artikel mit allen nötigen Formalien erstellen kann , es ist ebenso spannend , ein Gegenprogramm zu produzieren , dass die Fakes entlarven kann .
Ein solches Programm , genannt : Inauthentic Paper Detector , haben nun aufgrund des Vorfalls im letzten Jahr einige Informatiker der Indiana University vorgestellt .
Mehmet Dalkilic erklärt , es gebe noch kein Programm , das bedeutungsvolle Texte von Nonsense - Inhalten unterscheiden kann .
Bei Texten , die von Menschen erzeugt wurden , gebe es aber im Unterschied zu computererzeugten Texten subtile Wiederholungen von Worten oder Wortfolgen , die sich dazu benutzen lassen könnten .
Die Wissenschaftler suggerieren , was sofort einen Zweifel an ihrem eigenen Paper hervorruft , das sie natürlich als „ sehr authentisch “ einstufen , dass Leser von Texten normalerweise unterstellen , dass diese bedeutungsvoll sind , während man trotz der gewaltigen Textmengen etwa im Web nicht davon ausgeht , dass es auch völlig sinnfreie Texte geben könne .
Das sei eigenartig , weil beispielsweise die Eingabe eines beliebigen aber bedeutungslosen Satzes wie : „ Colorless green ideas sleep furiously “ ( Farblose grüne Ideen schlafen wütend ) in eine Suchmaschine viele Ergebnisse hervorrufe .
Dieser berühmte Satz von Noam Chomsky demonstriert , dass grammatikalisch korrekte Sätze unsinnig sein können – und dass sie wie in diesem Fall auch gefunden werden .
Unsinnige Texte nennen die Wissenschaftler inauthentisch .
Demgemäß sind die „ bedeutungsvollen “
Texte – oder sollte man sagen : die zumindest als bedeutungsvoll gemeinten ?
– authentisch .
Sie haben als gesamte Sinn , während die syntaktisch korrekten inauthentischen Texte im gesamten keine Bedeutung haben .
Solche Texte könnten von Programmen wie dem der MIT - Informatiker beliebig erzeugt und ins Netz gestellt werden , wo sie über Suchmaschinen gefunden und von nicht wirklich kundigen oder oberflächlich vorgehenden Lesern nicht als Unsinn erkannt werden .
Das ist bekanntlich auch in der sogenannten Sokal - Affäre geschehen , als der Physiker einen unsinnigen , parodistischen Artikel mit dem anspruchsvollen Titel Die Grenzen überschreiten : Auf dem Weg zu einer transformativen Hermeneutik der Quantengravitation , strotzend vor dekonstruktivistischer Terminologie , einer bekannten geisteswissenschaftlichen Zeitung einreichte , die ihn auch veröffentlichte .
Schwerwiegender ist allerdings , dass viele Texte nur von Experten verstanden werden können und für eine entsprechende Community geschrieben wurden .
Manche
Texte werden auch nur deswegen als bedeutungsvoll geachtet , weil sie kaum oder nicht verständlich sind , beispielsweise in der Literatur oder in der Philosophie .
Wie sollte ein Programm den jeweiligen Kontext erfassen können , in dem ein Text bedeutungsvoll ist , der in einem anderen Kontext vielleicht nicht nur völlig unsinnig erscheint , sondern dies auch ist ?
Die Informatiker gehen einmal davon aus , dass die meisten Texte im Internet „ authentisch “ sind – zumindest noch , denn „ Informationsverschmutzung “ könne jederzeit zunehmen , weswegen eine Unterscheidung zwischen „ authentischen “ , eigentlich von Menschen verfassten , und von „ inauthentischen “ , von Computerprogrammen erzeugten Texten in ihren Augen sinnvoll wäre .
Sie können zwar nicht allgemein zwischen Unsinn und Bedeutung unterscheiden , sehen aber einen Ansatz in der „ semantischen Kohärenz “ , die einen authentischen von einem computergenerierten Unsinnstext unterscheide , wobei es einen Zusammenhang zwischen der Bedeutung und der Kompressionsmöglichkeit gebe .
Für ihren Ansatz haben sie 1.300 bedeutungsvolle , aber inhaltlich unterschiedliche Texte aus wissenschaftlichen Zeitungen genommen und diese mit 1.000 Texten verglichen , die mit dem Programm der MIT - Informatiker und mit anderen Methoden ( Permutation der Worte von wissenschaftlichen Texten , Montage von Abschnitten aus verschiedenen Texten etc. ) erzeugt wurden .
Alle Texte wurden vorbearbeitet , beispielsweise wurden Großbuchstaben in kleine umgewandelt , alle Worte mit weniger als 2 oder mehr als 20 Buchstaben oder alle Zeichen , die keine Buchstaben darstellen , weggelassen .
Dann wurden die Texte mit Algorithmen ( Lempel - Ziv und Bender - Wolf ) komprimiert .
Angeblich konnten dann die „ authentischen “
Texte fast mit 100 prozentiger Wahrscheinlichkeit von den mit dem MIT - Programm erzeugten erkannt werden .
Auch bei den anderen unsinnigen Textarten sei die Erkennungsrate von 60 Prozent aufwärts gelegen .
Was freilich nicht nur ein wenig skeptisch stimmt , ist die Tatsache , dass der „ authentische “ Text der Informatiker , wenn man ihn in ihr eigenes Erkennungsprogramm eingibt , als inauthentisch klassifiziert wird .
Ihm wird nur eine Wahrscheinlichkeit von 18,5 % zugebilligt , authentisch zu sein .
Angeblich könnten aber viele Klassen inauthentischer Texte aufgrund der verwendeten Komprimierungsalgorithmen erkannt werden .
Das liege vermutlich daran , dass in authentischen Texten irgendwelche Worte zusammen auftreten und sich Muster wiederholen .
Das freilich scheint bei ihrem
Text nicht der Fall zu sein .
Die große Frage ist nun , ob es sich wirklich um einen „ authentischen “
Text handelt und , wenn ja , ob er eine Bedeutung hat , und , wenn auch dieses Mal ja , welche Bedeutung er für wen besitzt ?
Vorgestellt haben es die Informatiker auf der 2006 SIAM Conference on Data Mining , die am letzten Wochenende stattgefunden hat .

Robert asked this question in a comment on a previous post :
If I remember correctly Alexander , I read on your site here that one of your companies did not have any managers ?
Do you elaborate on that anywhere and if not could you ?
It seems that a lot of the problems seem to come from low to middle management and as someone who is looking to start my own software company I do n’t want this to happen in my organization .
A no managers approach seems pretty appealing .
You ’re right Robert .
In Enterprise Systems , the IT company I co-founded back in 1997 , we decided not to have any managers .
We wanted plenty of leadership , but we wanted dynamic leadership that could change as the situation warranted .
So rather than have presidents , vice presidents and managers , all employees had an equal say in running the company .
This was backed up by the fact that all employees were also co-owners , every new hire being offered a stake in the company after six months on the job .
While I and my two co-founders retained a majority of the shares , this gave us no greater power in making day - to - day decisions .
So how did we make decisions ?
We had two major structures in place :
Areas of responsibility
We sat down and made a list of all the categories of tasks we had in the company .
Sales , finance , intranet , our website , personnel , etc .
There were around 20 in all .
Then instead of appointing managers responsible for each of these , we asked who in the company would like to do it , and let people choose for themselves where they wanted to be involved .
Interestingly , everyone signed up for at least a couple of these and every single task got at least one person assigned to it .
The result was that all these tasks were done by people who liked doing it – and who therefore invariably did a great job .
The people who took on such an area of responsibility were responsible for making a lost of all tasks , for making a budget if required and for making sure that everything worked as it should .
Company meetings
Every two weeks we had a company meeting for all employees .
This was also important because many of us did n’t work out of the office but at a customer ’s site .
At these meetings , we made larger decisions or any decisions that did n’t readily fall under one of the established areas of responsibility .
When we voted , it was one man , one vote , regardless of seniority or number of shares .
So how did this work in practice ?
Here ’s an example :
When it looked like we needed a new and larger office , we raised the issue at a company meeting .
Did we need new offices ?
Yes !
What were our preferences for size , price , location , etc . ?
Discussion ensued .
We then appointed a task force and asked them to go look at offices and return with some options .
Who was in the task force ?
The people who volunteered to be , of course .
The group came back with some ideas , and we all voted on which one we preferred .
We had ourselves a new office .
The task force went on to find us a designer to spruce up the place and some cool furniture .
This being a major ( ! ) expense , the budget was approved at another company meeting .
The advantages of this model are :
Ownership .
Everyone is as involved as they want to be .
No one is sulking because a decision was made over their head .

Motivation .
People are insanely motivated , because they ’re a part of running the company – they do n’t just work there .

Implementing decisions .
Because people are involved in making decisions , it becomes much easier to implement them .
You do n’t have to sell decisions to reluctant employees .
The disadvantages are :
Time .
Sometimes it takes time to arrive at a decision .
This was never a problem for us , but if your business climate requires constant quick leaderhip decisions , this may not be the right model .

This was never a problem for us , but if your business climate requires constant quick leaderhip decisions , this may not be the right model .
Petty discussions .
If you ’re not careful , meetings can devolve into endless , petty talk about mindless minutiae .
In this case it ’s important to stop and delegate or to trust someone who cares to make a good decision .
The proudest moment for our model came in the company ’s darkest hour .
We were never a dotcom company , but when that era ended , we were in trouble too .
Suddenly about half our customers were no longer buying from us , and we were in deep trouble .
Basically we were out of money and it did n’t look like new customers were coming in .
In a traditional company this is where the CEO steps in and makes the tough decisions needed , and I have to tell you , we were sorely tempted to offload this decision onto one person who could then call the shots .
Luckily we held onto our process and in a series of company meetings that ranged from playful to painful we talked about how we would handle it .
We narrowed it down to two choices : Taking a 25 % pay cut or firing 5 people .
Discussions raged .
I , for one , held out for the pay cuts .
That became a unanimous decision .
And a good one too – just 6 months later we had signed new customers , and every single consultant was back in business .
If we had fired people back then , we would have missed them sorely .
I realize that this experiment worked for an IT company of just 20 people and that you can’t possibly generalize from that to larger companies in other fields .
And yet I believe that this is certainly a viable way to go .
That what companies really need is leadership that is dynamic , distributed and entirely voluntary .
Leadership that switches from person to person , depending on who has the will and the energy , rather than what it says on somebody ’s business card .

Careful use of domain - specific languages such as SQL and XSLT can dramatically ease development .
David Chisnall looks at SWI - Prolog , an open - source implementation of a language used heavily in the AI community , and describes how it can help in development of knowledge - based systems .

*** Production codes : - Title Page
A good programmer knows a lot of languages , and which one is particularly suited to a task .
Some languages work well in a lot of different settings , while others are very domain - specific .
XSLT , for example , is a Turing - complete language that ’s useful for translating XML documents into different formats , but not a good choice for most other applications .
Prolog is another language that falls into this category .
It ’s a general - purpose language , but one that ’s particularly well - suited to some problems and very difficult to use for others .
Prolog , short for PROgramming in LOGic , is a high - level language based on predicate logic .
A full explanation of predicate logic would take far more space than this article is allowed .
For now , if you ’re unfamiliar with predicate logic , think of a predicate as a function returning a Boolean value .
NOTE
The examples in this article can be downloaded in the accompanying source .zip .
Building Blocks
Like all good languages , Prolog is syntactically simple .
There are four basic components of the language :
Numbers .
Atoms are analogous to nouns — things that exist .
A Prolog atom begins with a lowercase letter .
Variables in Prolog have more in common with variables in mathematics than with most other programming languages .
In mathematics , you ca n’t say x = 5 , and then later say x = 6 in the same context .
The same is true of Prolog ; variables can have only one value during their lifetime .
To distinguish variables from atoms , Prolog variables begins with capital letters .
Predicates look a lot like functions in other languages .
A simple predicate simply asserts something : is Mammal ( cat ) .
This line has two components .
The first is the predicate name , isMammal .
In documentation , this will usually be written as isMammal / 1 , meaning that it ’s a predicate that takes one argument ( also called a unary predicate ) .
The argument given here is an atom , cat .
Note that neither the isMammal predicate nor the cat atom has any special semantic meaning to Prolog ; you could just as easily say isMammal ( fish ) , and have valid Prolog .
An English - speaking human , however , would likely regard this statement as a bug .
You can define other predicates with similar structure easily in the same file :
isMammal ( cat ) . is Mammal ( dog ) . is Mammal ( tiger ) . is Mammal ( mouse ) . is Mammal ( elephant ) . is Domesticated ( cat ) . isDomesticated ( dog ) .
A good way to boost your chances of pregnancy ?
Harvard researchers found women who frequently ate these foods were 85 % more likely to have ovulation problems .
In contrast , the Human Reproduction study found eating full - fat dairy foods , including ice cream , cut the risk of this type of infertility .
However , UK experts insist there is scant evidence of a link .
The research used a database of 116,000 US nurses which is regularly updated with information about their lifestyle , diet and health .
I 'm not convinced that there is any reason for women who are trying to conceive to alter their diet , unless they are obese
Dr Richard Fleming
Glasgow Centre for Reproductive Medicine
They were asked whether they had been trying , and failing , to conceive , and whether a diagnosis of ' ovulatory failure ' - infertility due to irregularity in the normal monthly cycle - had been made .
Over an eight year period between 1991 and 1999 , 438 women reported this set of circumstances , and their answers to questions about their diet were analysed .
If the women ate two or more portions of low - fat dairy produce a week , the risk of infertility due to ovulatory failure appeared to be 85 % higher .
When women eating two or more portions of full - fat dairy produce such as whole milk or ice cream were compared with those eating one or fewer , they had a 27 % lower risk of infertility due to lack of ovulation .
Food swap
Dr Jorge Chavarro , who led the project , said that the link needed further investigation .
He said that women trying to conceive should think about their diet : " They should consider changing low - fat dairy foods for high - fat dairy foods ; for instance , by swapping skimmed milk for whole milk and eating ice cream , not low fat yoghurt . "
He believes the key may be that there is a substance vital for healthy ovarian function that requires the presence of fat for it to be properly absorbed into the body .
However , other scientists say that the only compelling evidence of a link between diet and infertility involves obesity , which is linked to a significant reduction in the chances of conception .
Dr Richard Fleming , from the Glasgow Centre for Human Reproduction , pointed out that women reporting a low - fat ' healthy ' diet might be those already aware of fertility issues and trying to improve their chances .
He said : " Women with ovulatory failure make up a relatively small proportion of cases of female infertility .
" I 'm not convinced that there is any reason for women who are trying to conceive to alter their diet unless they are obese , and I would not advise any woman to do this . "
While humans have been a spacefaring species for more than 50 years , it 's quite possible we have yet to perform that most basic of acts — sex — beyond terra firma .
Yet .
Rumors have long swirled that astronauts may have hooked up in orbit , perhaps even as part of secret sex - in - space experiments run by the Russian or American governments .
But those stories are likely the product of overactive — and overheated — imaginations , experts say .
A Russian space official , for example , has categorically denied any such weightless shenanigans by his countrymen , the news agency AFP reported Friday ( April 22 ) .
" There is no official or unofficial evidence that there were instances of sexual intercourse or the carrying out of sexual experiments in space , " Valery Bogomolov , the deputy director of the Moscow - based Institute of Biomedical Problems , told the news agency Interfax , AFP reported .
" At least , in the history of Russian or Soviet space exploration , this most certainly was not the case . " [ 10 Surprising Sex Statistics ]
What about NASA astronauts ?
Bogomolov also addressed the rumors of American hanky - panky , though with considerably less authority .
" As for American space exploration , well , I just do n't have the information to categorically deny that , " Bogomolov told Interfax , according to AFP .
" There are just anecdotal rumors , which are not worth trusting . "
But those in the know say NASA astronauts have likely been as chaste as their Russian counterparts while zipping around Earth at 17,500 mph ( 28,164 kph ) .
While NASA apparently does n't explicitly forbid sex in orbit , its astronaut code of conduct calls for " relationships of trust " and " professional standards " to be maintained at all times .
" I 'm not aware of an official NASA policy on this , " said former astronaut Leroy Chiao , a veteran of four space missions between 1994 and 2005 .
" It was not discussed when I was there , it was simply understood .
Nobody brought it up — it simply was n't a consideration . "
Despite the advent of mixed - gender crews in 1983 , NASA astronauts seem to have behaved themselves in orbit , according to Chiao .
" As for any couple having had sex in space , I seriously doubt it , " Chiao told SPACE.com in an email interview .
Chiao , who spent more than 229 days in space , explained some of his reasoning in a blog post for the tech website Gizmodo back in 2009 .
" Guys are guys .
If a guy had sex in space , he would not be able to stand not bragging about it , " Chiao wrote .
" Sorry to disappoint you , but there it is .
We would all know about it .
Or , I should say , we will all know about it when it happens . "
Other astronauts have backed Chiao 's viewpoint , saying that NASA 's spaceflyers have thus far been too focused on their missions to risk any romantic entanglements in orbit .
That 's not to say that such entanglements do n't unfold back on Earth , however , as the messy love triangle involving then - astronauts William Oefelein and Lisa Nowak demonstrates .
Nowak was arrested in 2007 for allegedly attacking a woman she viewed as a rival for Oefelein 's affections .
She ultimately received probation .
It will happen
Sex in space will happen eventually , if it has n't already .
It 's one thing for a space shuttle crew to contain themselves for a few weeks , or astronauts aboard the station to remain chaste for five or six months .
But manned missions to Mars would last years , so abstinence for that long would be a tall order for most people .
And sex would likely be a natural part of life at a lunar or Mars base , especially if the aim is to one day establish a self - sustaining colony .
The rise of private spaceflight should open the door even more to sex in space .
Space tourists would not be bound by NASA 's code of conduct , or as restricted by the demands of a complicated mission .
And some people will probably even fly to space just to join the " 220 - mile - high club . "
Virgin Galactic , which hopes to start flying tourists to suborbital space as early as next year , has already turned down a $ 1 million offer from an unidentified party to aid in the production of a sex - in - space movie .

Friday
WALKING back to the office from lunch earlier this week , I came across one of those quintessentially Parisian scenes .
Outside the Dior shop on Avenue Montaigne , the Paris showcase of designer fashion , some 30 gendarmes in full riot gear appeared to be blocking the way in .
Three rather chic male bouncers , armed only with silk ties and charcoal - grey pinstripes , were gingerly closing the steel security gate across the entrance .
A lady , dangling from her fingertips a shopping bag the size of a suitcase , hurried inside to safety .
Stepping closer to see what was going on , I caught sight of a sea of highly polished silver helmets behind the shoulder - to - shoulder ranks of riot policemen .
They were sapeurs - pompiers , or firemen , about 50 in number , and they were not out for a spot of early Christmas shopping .
Some were yelling at the gendarmes , who were beginning to edge slowly forwards in neat formation past the mannequins in Dior 's window .
I approached a policeman sitting in a nearby police car , which had a line of gendarmerie vans parked behind it .
He explained that this was a one - day firemen 's strike .
“ Why are there so many gendarmes ? ” I asked .
He gave a wry smile .
“ When the firemen demonstrate , we always call in the gendarmes .
There can be trouble , ” he replied .
“ A few years ago , one of them exploded a hand grenade and had to be taken to hospital . ”
While the stand - off between the firemen and the gendarmes continued , I looked across the broad tree - line street towards L'Avenue , a restaurant that is best summed up by the French phrase “ m' as - tu vu ? ” .
A haunt of the fashion and advertising crowd , it is one of those places where the chairs on the terrace face the street , to maximise people - watching .
As gendarmes herded angry firemen away from the entrance to Dior , past the suddenly vulnerable - looking plate - glass picture windows , a row of women in large designer shades and fur wraps sat watching the scene from the tables on the terrace , quite unmoved , sipping Perrier .

The battle of Austerlitz
When I got back to the office I discovered that several thousand firemen from across the country had joined the strike in Paris that afternoon .
They were demanding the reinstatement of a monthly bonus of € 72 for all fire - fighters , as well as the option of retirement on full pension at 55 .
Near the Gare d'Austerlitz there had been a stand - off far more violent than the one I witnessed .
Gendarmes were pelted with glass bottles , flares and stones .
Three ended up in hospital and a gendarmerie van was torched .
By the evening Nicolas Sarkozy , the interior minister , was visiting the wounded gendarmes at the Pitié - Salpêtrière hospital .
For all that , the episode failed to make the headlines of that evening 's main television news .
What to make of this fleeting scene from Paris life ?
I have compiled a short list :
1 . The French sapeurs - pompiers are thorough professionals when on the job .
They are para - medically trained , and I can vouch for this , having had to call them out recently to deal with an accident at home .
Their sympathy capital among ordinary people is high .
2 . The sight of one public service designed to ensure citizens ' safety , attacking another service also designed to ensure citizens ' safety , saps that capital .
3. Street demonstrations in Paris pass almost unnoticed .
On any given day you can expect to stumble across a crowd of banner - waving protesters .
This street theatre is the wallpaper of French political life .
4 . There really are two Frances .
One demonstrates ; the other shops .
5 . When I accompany my son and a group of 20 more six - year - olds to our local fire station next week to learn about fire safety , I will not carry a Dior shopping bag .

Thursday
ON THE way home from work yesterday evening , in an inexplicable fit of adventurousness , I decided to try out a different boulangerie when buying my baguette .
On the short high street in our western Paris suburb there are no fewer than two boulangerie - patisseries and two patissier - chocolatiers .
You need to know your supplier .
One of the patissier - chocolatiers sells baguettes , as well as an exquisite selection of fresh gâteaux .
The one across the road , however , which is squeezed with rather delightful symbolism between a lingerie shop and a funeral parlour , sells cakes and croissants , but definitely not baguettes .
A few months ago one of the boulangeries shut its doors .
At the time I put this down to the onward march of American - style out - of - town hypermarkets at the expense of small local shopkeepers .
A short drive away across the Seine stands a vast , modern illustration of the challenge : a Carrefour hypermarket , the second - biggest in France , with parking for 3,000 cars .
It takes longer to cross the floor of this store than it does to walk down our high street .
Shopping there is a test of footwear as well as stamina .
You can pile a flat - screen television or a microwave into your trolley as readily as a lapin à la moutarde .
Outside central Paris , the French have taken to this suburban drive - in life with abandon .
Within minutes of our high street you can find a drive - in McDonald 's , a KFC , a Buffalo Grill , even a second Carrefour superstore .
All of this seemed to me to explain why the traditional high - street boulanger might be folding .
In fact , it turned out that the boulangerie in question , Fabien Ledoux , was not closing for good , only for refurbishment .
Recently it re-opened its doors .
It has been transformed into a chic temple of temptation .
The colours are elegant neutrals , the lighting is dim .
As for a baguette , well , for 85 cents you can buy the humble stick , but the place now offers , if my hasty count last night was right , 27 different sorts of bread .
I splashed out on a tradition , for €1 .
For conspicuous consumption
Is my high street typical ?
No , in the sense that it is a fairly bourgeois sort of place .
But I would argue that it is has much in common with small - town France , a claim you could not easily make for central Paris .
There is a heaving twice - weekly street market selling produits du terroir , frequented by old and young alike , where pigs ' snouts nuzzle up to freshly skinned rabbits .
On the high street there is an épicerie , two traiteurs , one fromager , and two butchers , whose windows are dressed with offerings such as rôti de pintade farci aux pommes flambées à l'armagnac .
Every Sunday morning the queues at the butchers spill out on to the pavement .
The professionals behind the counters at these shops are authentic craftsmen , not the faux - artisans that man the boutique cheese - sellers in smart bits of London .
Up to a point , the French high street is protected by laws preventing hypermarkets from selling goods below cost , and restricting the number that can be built .
That reduces price competition between out - of - town stores and the high street , and pretty much eliminates it between the hypermarkets themselves .
But my unscientific observation of suburban French shopping habits suggests that price is only half the battle .
I hear a lot of French indignation about price inflation for basic goods , especially since the introduction of the euro .
According to a survey in Le Parisien , the average price of a baguette ( 80 cents ) has jumped 23 % since 2001 , way in excess of inflation .
But when it comes to quality , the French are prepared to pay more — and queue for longer .
The importance of gastronomie , the refusal to accept bland substitutes , guides retail habits .
The same shoppers who steel themselves for a draining two - hour trawl round Carrefour will also drop in on the high - street butcher and pay top prices for a côte de boeuf .
If this is so , then the government 's reluctance to ease restrictions on hypermarkets , for fear of hurting the high street , could well be misplaced .

A FAVOURITE Parisian parlour game is to try answering the question : Will Jacques Chirac stand again ?
It gained a new edge when the president 's wife , Bernadette , hinted at a possible third term in an interview last week with Le Nouvel Observateur .
“ Have you seen what good shape he 's in ? ” she declared ―adding , just a touch too insistently , “ my husband is not senile . ”
On leaving the Elysée Palace Mr Chirac would be entitled to a seat on the Constitutional Council .
Would he take it up ?
“ Yes , he 'll go ... in five years ! ” , Mrs Chirac replied .
“ Do you hear me ?
In five years ! ”
I first stumbled across the idea that Mr Chirac might stand again three years ago , from one of his advisers at the Elysée .
That was when he was riding high in the opinion polls thanks to his defiant opposition to the war in Iraq , and before he ceded control of his Gaullist party to Nicolas Sarkozy , now the centre - right 's front - runner for the presidency .
Mr Chirac is surely correct , for his own purposes , to keep his options open .
He says he will announce his decision early next year .
It is hard to picture him , after 40 years in politics , pruning roses in a country garden .
All the same , I find the idea of his standing again hard to take seriously .
Perhaps age alone should not disqualify him , but you can scarcely overlook the fact that he will be 74 on November 29th .
( Word from the Elysée is that no celebrations are to be organised . )
Besides , his poll numbers are dismal .
When TNS Sofrès asked the French public this month who should be running for the presidency , Ségolène Royal ( 63 % ) and Nicolas Sarkozy ( 57 % ) topped the list .
Mr Chirac came in a lowly 17th , trailing the McDonald 's - trashing José Bové and the far right 's Jean - Marie Le Pen .
Reuters
The head of state reflects
Yet in recent days the Chirac camp has been waging a fresh campaign to revive enthusiasm for its flagging champion .
In the current issue of Paris - Match we are treated to ten pages entitled “ A week at the Elysée ” .
The president is photographed at his desk , on the telephone , chairing defence meetings , talking with army chiefs , looking generally statesmanlike and worldly .
He arrives in his office , were are told , between 7.30 am and 7.45 am , after two hours spent reading the papers and listening to the radio .
He calls his diplomatic adviser first thing , even on a Sunday .
The message of the piece is as clear as it is unstated : here is a man in control and on the go — just the ticket for another five years .
Last week I asked somebody who knows Mr Chirac well whether this pre-campaign was for real .
“ It depends what 's going on internationally , ” came the reply .
“ If there were a crisis comparable to Iraq again , and his popularity climbed , he could well go for it . ”
This seemed to be what Bernadette Chirac was suggesting when she said , “ The situation in the world is complex .
And sometimes that upsets everything . ”
In any event , Mr Chirac 's supporters dismiss polls taken so far in advance of election day , and perhaps rightly .
I 've just looked up the polls for January 1995 , three months before that year 's presidential election .
Edouard Balladur was a runaway favourite , expected to get 29 % in the first round against 16 % for Mr Chirac .
On polling day Mr Chirac beat Mr Balladur into the run-off .
It is not only Mr Chirac who seems to be manoeuvring on the right , where , if Mr Sarkozy stumbles , a space may open up .
Dominique de Villepin , the prime minister , insisted in a television interview at the weekend that “ the game is n't over yet ” .
Michèle Alliot - Marie , the defence minister , turned up at her own party 's convention last week and torpedoed some of Mr Sarkozy 's hallmark policies .
So will Mr Chirac stand again ?
I can't see it happening , unless the balance of power on the centre - right is radically upset .
I 'm inclined to agree with a French politician who told me last week : “ Does Chirac want to stand again ?
Of course he does .
He 's lived in official palaces for 30 years .
He even spends his weekends at the Elysée .
He has nowhere else to hang his clothes .
But the odds are absolutely against his doing so . ”

ONE of the most perplexing issues in contemporary France is this : when to use “ tu ” instead of “ vous ” .
When I first arrived in Paris three years ago I consulted an expert on linguistic etiquette .
She told me it was simple : “ ' Tu ' is always used when you know someone well . ”
That sounded straightforward .
“ Except , ” she added , “ when it is n't . ”
It turns out that Jacques Chirac and his wife , Bernadette , call each other “ vous ” .
Yet the president addresses Nicolas Sarkozy , whom he introduced to Gaullist politics 30 years ago , and who is now his interior minister , as “ tu ” .
The use of “ tu ” can confer intimacy , but also disrespect .
During the rioting in the suburbs a year ago I remember talking to a group of young men in a Turkish café in Evry .
They complained that when the police stopped them on the streets for an identity check , they did so with the insulting use of “ tu ” : “ qu'est - ce que tu fais là toi ? ”
In new - media start - ups or ad agencies , on the other hand , using vous , even to a superior , is about as acceptable as wearing a neck - tie .
Jacques Séguéla , the grand homme of French advertising and a former adviser to both François Mitterrand and Mr Chirac , famously uses “ tu ” to strangers .
So I was rather disarmed last week when I rang a government official whom I 've known for a while , and always addressed as “ vous ” .
“ Ah bonjour ! ” , he said , “ Tu vas bien ? ”
It felt like a breakthrough .
I saw a whole new horizon opening up , of insider confidences and frank exchanges .
Penetrating the formality of French life , after all , is a daily ordeal .
I finished off a note to a minister the other day with a simple “ Je vous prie de croire , Monsieur , à l'assurance de mes sentiments distingués . ”
My French assistant was horrified , seized the note from my hands , and plonked a copy of “ Who 's Who in France ” on my desk .
It lists 25 different ways of finishing a letter depending on the recipient 's title : minister , ambassador , general , pope .
A minister , she insisted , needs a “ Je vous prie de bien vouloir agréer , Monsieur le ministre , l'expression de mes sentiments dévoués ” .

Et toi , Nicolas
Such conventions are being challenged , though , by a combination of high - technology and teenage culture .
Even in French the use of email legitimises a degree of informality : “ Cordialement ” is a handy all - purpose sign - off .
Text - messaging demolishes the language outright .
Our French teenaged babysitters readily adulterate their language with “ c ” for “ c'est ” , “ A2m1 ” for “ à demain ” , or “ Kdo ” for “ cadeau ” .
Mangling the language and using the “ tu ” form are obviously not quite the same thing .
But both carry a certain symbolic informality .
Politicians ( and journalists ) who casually tutoie each other in private still address each other in the “ vous ” form before the television cameras or at an official event .
The only time that the French authorities have intervened in the use of “ vous ” was in 1793 , shortly after the revolution , when a decree was issued that temporarily made the use of the “ tu ” form compulsory in the administration .
Speaking of the revolution , Ségolène Royal , like most Socialist camarades , also uses the “ tu ” form liberally .
During her campaign meetings for her party 's presidential nomination she did not flinch when questions from the audience were put to her in the “ tu ” form .
In another era , that would have been unthinkable .
If the new France that she promises were to phase out the “ vous ” form altogether , at least this would rescue foreigners like myself from frequent gaffes — as well as unfounded presumptions of intimacy .
The government official rang me back this morning .
“ Bonjour , ” he said , “ Vous allez bien ? ”

Monday
THE scale of Ségolène Royal 's triumph in the Socialist Party 's presidential primary last week has left the political class reeling .
What the French call le microcosme , which is the Paris equivalent of the Westminster village or inside - the - beltway Washington , has been abuzz ever since .
Had she scraped through with a narrow margin , it would have been historic enough .
But with 61 % of all members ' votes , and over 80 % in some regional federations , her crushing victory has knocked le microcosme sideways .
For most of this year pouring scorn on Ségolène 's candidacy has been a favourite political hobby in Paris .
A few months ago , I asked one Socialist grandee , who was incensed by the way she was using her popularity to impose herself on the party , whether he thought she would win .
“ This is not a beauty contest , ” he snorted .
Like many others , he consistently underestimated her .
Earlier this year , I read a book by Alain Duhamel , a veteran political analyst , called “ Les Prétendants 2007 ” .
In it , he profiled no fewer than 15 potential candidates — but managed to leave her out altogether .
What does her overwhelming victory say about how France is changing ?
Endless radio talk shows over the weekend have dwelt on the fact that she is a woman .
A poll yesterday in Le Journal du Dimanche suggested this to be the single most important reason for her appeal .
One commentator tried to argue to me the other day that she embodied softer , maternal values from which the French drew comfort in this harsh , globalised age .
I find this nonsense .
For one thing , she is about as cuddly as Margaret Thatcher .
“ Everybody thinks she is nice and not clever , ” a former class - mate from her days at ENA told me last week , “ but the truth is she is very clever and absolutely not nice . ”
If the fact that she is a woman has any relevance at all , it is only in one sense : that she is different .
AP
A Royal with the common touch
To my mind , the appeal of Ségolène has always been that she is Not One Of Them .
She has exploited this with ruthless professionalism .
After her image was relooké just over a year ago , she has increasingly chosen to wear virginal - white suits , while her rivals turn up to television studios in sombre shades of grey .
She made her victory announcement last week from the rural village of Melle , in her constituency , keeping well away from the leafy boulevards of the Paris left bank , home to the Socialist Party headquarters .
She may stumble over questions touching on policy towards Iran 's nuclear programme or Turkish membership of the European Union , but she talks concretely about everyday concerns such as paying the rent or the cost of school books .
I also think that the vote for Ségolène carries a certain vote of sanction .
If , by electing her , Socialists were saying " it 's time for a change " , then in some ways she taps into that same popular dissatisfaction with French politicians exploited by Jean - Marie le Pen , the leader of the far - right National Front .
That may seem a preposterous comparison .
But Mr Le
Pen 's electoral appeal rests not only on his obnoxious xenophobia , but on his anti-establishment populism .
He readily denounces the Paris political class as a self - serving , out - of - touch elite .
When Ségolène says that her policy towards Turkey is “ that of the French people ” , she is building a brand as a politician who listens .
Curiously , when I interviewed Mr Le Pen a few months ago , he told me that he had been the first to spot Ségolène 's potential as a presidential candidate three years earlier .
Will she be able to keep up the momentum for a further five months ?
The word from Nicolas Sarkozy 's camp is that the right is steeling itself for a bruising contest .
They always said it would be harder to take on a female opponent .
Already , Ségolène seems to have a glow about her .
And everyone loves a winner .
Can the increase in Chinese liquid fuel consumption be maintained ?
Even in the face of a nearby world oil production peak ?
Or will China have to cope with a liquid fuel crisis in the near term future ?
This post focuses on whether China will or will not be able to meet their increasing demand for liquid fuels until 2015 .
The underestimation of exponential growth
The increase in Chinese oil consumption in the past years is mostly seen as a recent development , supposedly driven by the industrial development of China .
In reality , the growth in Chinese oil consumption has been the same in the past two decades .
Between 1990 and 1999 annual oil consumption growth in China was 6 % on average .
Between 2000 and 2006 the average annual oil consumption growth in China was 7 % .
Also the 2004 anomaly of 13 % growth in a single year is nothing new .
In 1993 Chinese oil consumption growth happened to be 10 % .
Figure 1 - Chinese oil consumption and production , source : EIA
This misconception of Chinese oil consumption growth is a typical example of underestimating the power of exponential growth .
Between 1990 and 1999 , absolute growth was around 2 million barrels per day ( mb/d ) , from 2.3 mb/d in 1990 to 4.4 mb/d in 1999 .
In the past seven years , absolute growth has been 3 mb/d per day according to preliminary figures , from 4.4 mb/d in 1999 to 7.36 mb/ d in 2006 .
If this present trend continues , the demand for oil ( and other liquid fuels ) in China will grow to 9.2 mb/d in 2010 and 12.4 mb/d in 2015 .
Figure 2 - Exponential growth trend in Chinese oil consumption
The influence of the Chinese Peak in oil Production
Currently China produces around half of their own oil needs domestically while the rest is imported .
This situation will not last for very long .
China is a very mature oil producer , most of the largest Chinese oil fields have peaked .
This means that peak oil for China is not very far away .
Colin Campbell , one of the main geologists of ASPO international , expects the Chinese peak to happen in the coming years .
Professor Pang Xiongqi of ASPO
China holds a slightly more optimistic view , foreseeing the peak in China in 2012 as shown in figure 3 below .
Figure 3 - Chinese oil production forecast in million tonnes , Source : ASPO China
As a reaction to the lack of domestic energy resources in relation to growing energy demand , the Chinese government has embarked on a very aggressive oil exploration program .
In the first years of the 21st century this has led to a substantial increase in discoveries .
That now seems to have halted .
In 2005 proven reserves did not increase and in 2006 they declined with 12 % to 16 billion barrels .
Such a sharp drop in reserves is not a good sign with respect to Chinese oil production .
Making it more likely that production will peak sooner then later .
This is bound to aggravate the already tight situation in China .
To meet the needs of the many , China will have to obtain other fuel sources besides crude oil at a massive scale , and soon .
A short summary of alternatives
If we assume that Chinese oil production will peak in the coming years , around 9 mb/d of liquid fuels or alternatives need to be supplied from other sources than domestic oil production by 2015 , such as oil imports , bio - fuels , coal - to - liquids , gas - to - liquids , energy savings , electric transport and so forth .
The largest source of these will in the short term remain to be oil imports , which currently amount to 3.5 mb/d .
With sufficient aggressive foreign policy , China could very well be in the position of increasing that rate significantly , to maybe 6 mb/d by 2015 .
However , if the world production of oil peaks by 2010 or 2012 , it is more likely that imports will not increase significantly and remain at the present level .
The second best option would be to shave of as much of the increasing fuel usage as possible by implementing efficient technology in all sectors that use oil .
It is not impossible to obtain an annual reduction in present oil usage of 1 % on top of which demand growth occurs .
By doing so , the increase in oil consumption would be reduced with 800.000 b/d by 2015 .
The third best option that China has in the short run is to continue with massive development of coal - to - liquid technologies .
The research program in this field is focused on direct liquefaction without the creation of syngas , as is done with the Fischer - Tropsch process .
Direct liquefaction is possible by pulverizing and blending the coal with synthetic oil , then treating it with hydrogen while heating the coal to 450 °C in the presence of an iron catalyst .
In doing so , shorter chains of hydrocarbon are obtained which are suitable for refinement into liquid fuels .
By the end of this year , the Chinese company Shenhua hopes to have a factory that will produce 20.000 barrels per day of synthetic fuel by using the process described above .
However , there are many doubts that the process will work , since it has not been tested at such a large scale .
If it does work , China has a technology that can produce synthetic fuels from coal in a very efficient manner at a cost between 30 to 45 dollars per barrel .
The Chinese synthetic fuel program has the potential to produce about 1 million barrels of synthetic fuels per day by 2015 .
The fourth best option that China is aggressively pursuing is the development of bio-fuels .
The focus in this field has shifted from the domestic production of bio-ethanol to bio - diesel as the fuel of choice .
Recently , the Chinese government announced that it intends to plant an area the size of England , 13 million hectares , with Jatropha curcas trees of which the nut can be turned into a fuel .
The new governmental five year plan foresees a production of 120.000 barrels per day from bio-fuels by 2010 of which 60 % from bio-ethanol and 40 % from bio - diesel .
Next to that , addition bio-fuels might be imported , but the amount is very uncertain .
More interesting then imports would be ethanol production from cellulose .
This technology is on the brink of commercial application in various factories in Japan , Spain and the United States .
By 2015 domestic production of bio-fuels could very well be doubled to 240.000 barrels per day or maybe even tripled .
Gas - to - liquids does not seem to have much potential .
Domestic gas in China is intended for electricity generation .
Imports of liquids produced by gas are also unlikely in the given time period , since most of the gas - to - liquids plants under construction will not start up much earlier then 2010 .
The potential for electric transport replacing liquid demand in the short term is not very large , unless there is a large shift in governmental policy towards huge systems for public transport .
Scenario conclusion - soft or hard landing ?
If the assumptions above are taken including the possibility that China will be able to keep increasing their imports of crude oil , the following scenario is the result :
Figure 4 - Chinese liquid fuel scenario with increasing imports in case of later world oil production peak
In this case the resulting gap between sustained liquid demand and supply is quite small and will not result in any problems for China .
Demand in this case will be dampened slightly by market factors without great economic loss .
However , if oil production peaks around 2010 , making it virtually impossibly to increase the amount of imported oil , the situation would severely dampen economic growth .
Supply in that case would fall short with 3 mb/d by 2015 , and consumption can only increase with around 2 % annually .
While this would cause hardship for the industrialising of China and the end of " business as usual " , it does entail the continuation of Chinese development at a far slower pace .
Figure 5 - Chinese liquid fuel scenario with restricted imports due to early world oil production peak
From the look of things , it seems that China is in pretty good shape thanks to their aggressive coal to liquids program and foreign policy which has led to an increasing supply of imported oil .
While this will come with an environmental pricetag to future generations , the need for liquid fuels in the short term is vastly higher than the environmetal damage caused by the usage of fossil fuels .
Humument is Tom Phillips treated version of the Victorian novel ” A Human Document ” by W.H. Mallock .
Phillips transforms the text by drawing and painting over it and revealing just selected words .
You can view the converted text online or in book form ( Amazon ) .
In the mid-1960s , inspired by William Burroughs ’s “ cut- up ” writing technique , Tom Phillips bought an obscure Victorian novel for three pence — W. H. Mallock ’s 1892 novel , A Human Document .
He began cutting and pasting the extant text , treating the pages with gouache and ink , isolating the words that interested him while scoring out unwanted words or painting over them .
The result was A Humument , and the first version appeared in 1970 .
The artist writes , “ I plundered , mined , and undermined its text to make it yield the ghosts of other possible stories , scenes , poems , erotic incidents , and surrealist catastrophes which seemed to lurk within its wall of words .
As I worked on it , I replaced the text I ’d stripped away with visual images of all kinds .
It began to tell and depict , among other memories , dreams , and reflections , the sad story of Bill Toge , one of love ’s casualties . ”
Deciding what to do with your life is n’t remotely easy .
Most people never make this decision at all .
But since we all end up doing something , if we do n’t make this decision consciously , then a decision will still be made , but it will be an unconscious one .
If you do n’t decide how you ’re going to live , then someone or something else will decide for you .
Most likely you ’ll yield your life to a combination of unconscious influences , including your genetic predispositions , your upbringing , your social conditioning , your environment , the other people in your life , and perhaps pure chance .
This might be a good way for pets to live , but not for human beings .
We can do better .
Allowing your fate to be decided by external influences will , historically speaking , produce absolutely pathetic results compared to what you could achieve with your life by consciously deciding what you ’re going to do with it and why .
You might get lucky if you let fate handle the details , but it ’s more likely you ’ll end up spending your precious time here serving other forces whose plans you probably would n’t agree with .
As you grow in awareness and become more fully conscious , at some point you ’ll come face to face with the question , “ What the heck am I going to do with my life ? ”
Obviously there ’s a lot riding on your answer .
It ’s not even just about your own life but also the lives of everyone else you might affect during your lifetime .
You could choose to be insignificant , but you might also be able to play a hugely significant role in the future direction of this planet .
Conscious choice gives you that option .
And yielding this option to others does n’t relieve you of any responsibility whatsoever .
Once your awareness has reached a certain level , it becomes clear that it ’s better to answer this question consciously than to allow someone else to answer it for you .
However , as you begin tackling this question , there ’s a good chance you ’ll find it such a daunting task that you soon yield to the temptation of returning to unconscious living .
Please do n’t do that .
Although answering this question is indeed one of the major challenges you ’ll face as a human being , it ’s a problem you ’re capable of solving – and well worth the effort .
Let me share with you some ideas on how to approach this question that might make it easier for you to answer intelligently .
Strive to understand reality as accurately as possible .
A key component of deciding how to live is developing an understanding of how this universe you find yourself in actually works .
You need to know the rules of play before you can devise a basic strategy .
So the search for purpose begins with the search for truth .
Ideally once you develop an understanding of how the universe works , enough that it makes sense to you intellectually , emotionally , and intuitively , then you can begin figuring out what role you ’ll play within this universe .
If you do n’t have an accurate enough model of reality , you ca n’t intelligently decide how to live .
You can still make such a decision , but most likely it will be a poor one .
Imagine that you ’re playing a game of checkers and decide how you ’re going to play .
But what happens if it turns out you ’re really playing chess ?
Your strategy simply is n’t going to work .
It ’s the same with deciding what to do with your life .
If your model of reality is too inaccurate , then all your decisions will be bug - ridden , and most likely you ’ll crash a lot .
In practical terms this means you ’ll have a hard time making progress towards your goals .
Weak results will become the norm for you .
I ’ve written previously about how I perceive reality , and I ’ll certainly write more about it in the years ahead .
By experimenting with different belief systems over the past 15 years , I ’ve seen radical changes in my results .
Last year was my best year ever by far , and I attribute this to developing a model of reality that appears to be in sync with the way reality actually seems to work .
My model certainly is n’t perfect , but it ’s accurate enough that I ’m starting to achieve my goals more and more easily .
I ’m working with the rules of the game instead of fighting and resisting them .
As I mentioned in a previous post , three key qualities to develop in your pursuit of personal growth are self - trust , awareness , and fearlessness .
Together these three components make up my definition of intelligence .
While there are many ways to understand reality , my approach is basically that of Jnana Yoga .
This means that I try to comprehend reality through the mind .
I try to use my intellect to figure it out .
Ultimately this boils down to running a lot of personal experiments and noting the results .
But there are other valid paths to an understanding of reality too .
If you ’re a more heart - focused person , then intuition may be a more powerful guide for you than the mind .
If you encounter difficulties in choosing a life purpose , the problem may be further upstream .
Dive deeper into your understanding of reality .
Question your beliefs , especially the ones you were taught never to question .
What if you ’re wrong ?
My current beliefs about reality bear little resemblance to those I was raised to adopt .
Through interaction with the real world , I found my initial beliefs to be inaccurate .
And that led to more than a decade of searching for truth , one that still continues to this day but which has gotten a lot easier .
When you understand reality accurately enough , your purpose will practically jump out at you .
Ultimately when you understand reality , you understand yourself .
Your role in the world then becomes clear .
For example , based on my understanding of reality , it ’s clear to me what I should do with my life .
I ’m here to grow and to help others grow .
Does your purpose make sense in the short term ?
In this very moment , are you happy ?
I ’m not referring to mere contentment .
A potted plant is content .
I mean … are you passionate about your life ?
Do you get more excited about going on vacation than you do about doing your real work ?
Are you in love with your existence ?
Are you delighted to be here on earth at this particular time ?
I was on vacation about 10 days ago , and honestly I was just as excited to return to work as I was to leave for the trip in the first place .
My work is so pleasurable to me that I ’m overjoyed to have the privilege of sitting here at my desk , turning thoughts into words that will be seen by thousands of people around the world before this day is up .
Does that sound like suffering to you ?
If you ’re the type of person who goes around saying that passion just is n’t your thing , then you ’ve sacrificed too much .
If you ’re living on purpose , an intense inner excitement will be your normal modus operandi .
Do n’t be afraid – this passion wo n’t suddenly transform you into an emotional moron that bounces around like a fairy on drugs .
Passion is emotional fuel .
It will push you to live at full capacity .
Without passion you ’ll frequently stop short and let opportunities pass you by again and again for lack of will .
Mere intellect can only get you so far .
There ’s a difference between deciding to achieve a goal and actually achieving it .
Your intellect can handle the former , but it ’s pathetic at achieving the latter .
Would n’t it be nice to achieve some goals instead of just setting them again and again ?
Paper goals are nice to look at , but would n’t you rather have the real thing ?
Passion will help you get there , sometimes at a pace that will make people ’s heads spin .
In order to do your best , you must learn to harness the fuel of passion .
If you were an android , you would n’t need passion .
Use your powerful intellect to recognize that you do have emotions whether you want them or not , and accept that a Vulcan lifestyle is suboptimal for human beings .
As you develop emotional intelligence , you can learn to utilize the powerful fuel of passion without running afoul of your intellect .
You want to be passionate and smart , not passionate and confused .
Passion + intelligence is a powerful combination .
If your decision about what to do with your life does n’t take advantage of the daily fuel of passion , then you ’ve made the wrong decision .
Go back and try again .
When you experience passion , it means that at least in this present moment , your decision about how to live makes sense .
It ’s congruent with reality .
Your body will begin burning the fuel of passion because it believes you ’re heading in the right direction .
It ’s worth the effort to light that fuse and to keep it burning instead of conserving energy by turning you into a couch potato .
But if your decision looks too dumb , your body will hold back .
It wo n’t expend the energy – it ’s saying , “ Nope , not worth it . ”
If you find the passion is gone from parts of your life , see the message behind its absence .
Listen to the , “ Nope , not worth it ” signal you ’re getting .
Maybe it ’s a dead - end job , a dead - end relationship , or a dead - end exercise program .
Whatever it is , if your body has n’t kicked into high gear with the fuel of passion , you ’ve made the wrong choice .
It ’s time to make a different decision .
Passion is a force multiplier .
With passion you become much stronger than without it .
It ’s truly amazing what a single passionate individual with a clear purpose can achieve .
If you were to subtract perhaps the top 100 such people from history ( out of billions of humans ) , we ’d probably still be living in caves .
And I ’d be chipping away with my stone tools an article on how to organize your rock collection .
Does your purpose make sense in the long term ?
Many decisions seem fairly intelligent in the moment , but when you imagine how they ’ll play out over the next 10 , 20 , or 50 years , their weaknesses become apparent .
When choosing a life purpose , it should not only fuel you with passion in the present moment – it should look even better across a variety of time frames .
Consider your job , for example .
Where will it lead you in the long run ?
Think about where it will take you between now and the end of your life .
Imagine you ’ve reached your final day on earth , and you look back upon your career .
How do you feel about it ?
If you ’ve made the correct decision about what to do with your life , then you should feel that overall , this was the best possible choice you could have made without the benefit of specific hindsight .
You will see some mistakes you made along the way , but you ’ll also see that given what you knew at the time , they were largely unavoidable .
When you look back over your life , your dominant thought will be , “ I did my best .
I may not have lived a perfect life , but I did the best I could .
And for that reason , I have no major regrets .
If my life must now end , then so be it . ”
If , on the other hand , this scenario scares the bejesus out of you , then you ’ve got some work to do .
It means your current direction is n’t sound .
It will not pass the test of time , and at some point you ’ll have to face reality .
It ’s better to do it now than to wait , since the longer you put it off , the more catastrophic the results will be .
Yesterday I watched a documentary called The Smartest Guys in the Room , which is the story of Enron .
Enron was the 7th largest corporation in the U.S. , employing tens of thousands of people .
Instead of focusing on value creation , its leaders put making themselves rich as their highest goal .
The company lost money year after year , yet it kept reporting substantial profits .
Its stock price went higher and higher with no value to back it up .
Obviously this was a house of cards that was doomed to eventually collapse , and over a period of just 24 days , the company spiraled down into bankruptcy .
The trial of Enron CEO Ken Lay is just beginning .
Is your life an Enron ?
What do you see when you project your current momentum years , even decades , into the future ?
Are you building a house of cards that will eventually collapse ?
Are you hiding from the truth ?
It can be very hard to face the truth today when the consequences may be years away .
But eventually you will have to face that truth at some point .
In fact , it ’s with you right now .
When you clog your consciousness with the burden of falsehood , you lower your awareness .
By refusing to face what you perceive to be the unfaceable , you begin living a lie , just like Enron .
And then instead of living honestly , your energies are consumed by the perpetuation of that lie .
Perhaps your sins are n’t as great as those of Enron ’s leaders .
It does n’t matter .
If you do n’t feel you can be honest with the rest of the world just yet , at least begin by being honest with yourself .
You need n’t experience a crash if you can learn to raise your consciousness instead of lowering it .
This is the gentlest path out of falsehood and towards truth .
If your relationship is dead , at least admit that truth to yourself even if you ca n’t admit it to anyone else .
Journal about it privately and explore your honest feelings .
If your career is unfulfilling and you work just to pay the bills , admit that to yourself , and also admit that you want something better .
It ’s OK to be weak and helpless .
It ’s not OK to lie to yourself .
Being weak will not lower your consciousness , but being false will .
Your decision about how to live needs to make sense from ALL time perspectives , including now , yesterday , today , tomorrow , next year , 10 years from now , and at your death .
It also has to make sense from the perspective of different scenarios , including : you die tomorrow , you die a year from now , you die in 50 years , you live forever , you become disabled , you get married , you stay single , you have children , you remain childless , your country ’s government collapses , all your possessions are destroyed in a fire , etc .
While there will be implementation issues that depend on the specifics of your current situation , your high - level decision about what to do with your life should n’t be based on elements outside your control .
It should be flexible enough that you can adapt it to changing circumstances , even when the changes are massive or brutal .
My choice of living to grow and to help others grow has a terrific outlook across all time perspectives and scenarios .
In order for me to be unable to continue pursuing it , either all of us would have to achieve perfection , or my consciousness would have to become frozen or damaged in some way such that further growth would be impossible .
And in those situations , any other decision would be corrupted as well .
So I genuinely feel this is the best I can do .
It was only in 2004 that I really began embracing this purpose consciously .
And when I look back over the time that has passed since making this decision , I have no major regrets .
I made plenty of mistakes along the way , but I still feel I did my best .
This feeling also leaves me at peace with the possibility that I could die unexpectedly at any time .
I do n’t know when my time here on earth will come to an end , but I ’m OK with that because my decision about how to live is n’t time - bound .
It works for me in the present moment while also helping me devise a long - term plan for what to do over the next 50 years , should I live that long .
I often ask myself , “ How would I feel about my life if it were to end this very minute ? ”
If I do n’t like my answer , I know it ’s time to make some changes .
But lately I ’ve been feeling really good about my answers .
I just hope that if it does happen this minute , my wife can finish this article for me and post it , since I ’ve spent a lot of time on it and would hate for it to go to waste . 😉
Does your purpose make sense at different levels of consciousness ?
Long - term inconsistency used to be a serious problem for me as I explored different belief systems .
Every time I changed my beliefs , parts of my life would rupture because they were dependent on the old belief system .
That paralyzed me to some degree .
I had to chose between pursuing my own growth ( and experiencing great upheaval in my actions and results ) , or I could try to hold my beliefs fixed ( thereby suspending my growth ) in order to complete certain projects .
Ultimately I chose to pursue growth and just deal with the upheaval , figuring that eventually I would stabilize at a higher level , and that approach seems to have worked out nicely , although it certainly was n’t easy adapting to so much change .
Suppose you work for a company that develops software .
When you first begin working there , you may be focused on the idea of landing a good job , doing interesting work , and beginning a career with strong long - term potential .
Or perhaps you ’re just a geek who loves coding .
At first you may be happy , even fulfilled in this situation .
But as you mature and your values change , you may begin searching for more meaning in your life , and this could lead you to raise your standards about the type of work you ’re willing to do .
The same old projects no longer seem as interesting as they once were , so you look for more challenging and interesting assignments .
As you continue along this path , you may begin looking more critically at the overall contribution you ’re making , both to your company and to the world .
Suppose you know that your company ’s real motivation is simply to make a profit and that the software it develops is n’t really needed .
Perhaps it generates income largely from market inefficiencies and buyer ignorance rather than by providing genuine unique value .
Now you have a tough decision to make .
Do you stay with the company and try to justify your decision ( thereby lowering your awareness ) , do you leave ( thereby keeping your awareness high ) , or do you attempt to transform the company from within ( thereby using your awareness to raise the awareness of others ) ?
This is n’t an easy decision to make , but the key to living in a way that works in the long run is that you need to keep yourself from becoming stuck at a fixed level of consciousness .
If you pursue the development and expansion of your consciousness , you will experience some upheaval in your life .
But that does n’t mean your purpose is poorly chosen – it just means you need to go through a process of shedding that which is incongruent with your purpose .
And if you ’re like most people , that ’s going to mean a lot of shedding .
It will probably take years .
But you ’ll come out the other side much stronger and a lot happier .
The tunnel is hard , but it does n’t last forever , and it leads to a wonderful place that you ’ll never want to leave once you experience it .
In truth we go through multiple tunnels as we raise our awareness .
These tunnels are what has been referred to as the “ dark night of the soul . ”
This is what happens when your awareness elevates to the point where you ’re now out of sync with your current life situation , but you do n’t see any viable alternatives just yet .
The alternatives will eventually present themselves if you continue to focus on raising your awareness and allowing the incongruence to exist for a while .
A well - formed life purpose should be able to survive your passage through these tunnels of awareness .
Each tunnel should only clarify and strengthen your purpose , not force you to throw it out .
If you feel your purpose will not survive the growth of your consciousness , you ’re probably right .
A life purpose that is tied to a particular level of awareness is no purpose at all .
It will only keep you trapped at that level of awareness .
For example , if your purpose is tied to making money , then what will happen if your awareness reaches the point that money holds a completely different meaning to you ?
Perhaps it will become meaningless .
Try to imagine how you might continue to grow , and choose a purpose that is flexible enough to grow with you .
For example , if your purpose is to create abundance for yourself and others , then that is much more likely to survive the growth of your consciousness than a purpose based solely on making money .
What I really love about my purpose is that it adapts well to changes in my core beliefs , including my spiritual beliefs .
It ’s hard for me to imagine a belief system in which it ’s impossible for me to grow or to help others to grow .
If I can experience something , I can grow from that experience , and if I can communicate with others , I can share some of that growth as well .
What will become of your purpose after you die ?
Ideally your purpose should be deep enough that it even has the possibility of surviving your own death .
Let ’s consider the perspective of what happens to you after death and what happens to the rest of the world after you ’re gone .
First , consider what happens to you .
There are after - death scenarios where decisions you make today wo n’t matter and other scenarios where they will matter .
But the first case is irrelevant because if you go to oblivion after you die or enter some immovable state of consciousness independent of your earthly life , then any decisions you make here and now wo n’t make a difference beyond your own death .
So unless you can be 100 % certain of the first type of scenario , you must at least consider the second case when deciding how to live .
When you imagine what it might be like to continue to exist in some form after your physical body dies , does your purpose still make sense ?
Can you continue your purpose even after you die ?
If this subject interests you , you may enjoy reading the article Life After Death , which goes into these various scenarios in more detail .
Since my purpose is to grow and to help others grow , then if I still have some form of consciousness and there are other conscious beings around , I should still be able to continue my purpose in some form .
“ Personal Development for Smart People ” will become “ Personal Development for Dead People . ”
And instead of turning bears into eagles , I ’ll work on turning demons into angels .
Sounds like a fun job to me .
So if I ’m already dead when you ’re reading this , look me up when you get there , and I ’ll continue torturing you for all eternity . 😉
Next , what will happen to the rest of the world after you die ?
Can your purpose continue on after your death ?
Can you plant enough of a seed that it can continue to grow even after you ’re gone ?
Part of the reason many motivational speakers build their own corporations is so that they can institutionalize their work in a way that will allow it to survive their own death .
Their purpose then becomes almost immortal .
I remember hearing Tony Robbins say that institutionalizing his work was very important to him – I think he said it on one of the bonus CDs included with his Personal Power II program .
It ’s the whole idea of leaving a legacy .
I ’d like to leave behind enough of a legacy that even after my death , my work can still continue .
One thing I love about my writing is that it can actually outlive me .
That ’s a conceit , but it ’s a healthy one .
( Yes , that ’s a line from Star Trek : TNG , and 1000 points to anyone who knows which episode . )
( Plus another 1000 points to anyone who knows the source of the 1000 points reference . )
Every year that passes , I want to leave behind a stronger legacy .
This even gives meaning to my very survival .
The longer I live , the greater the legacy I can leave behind .
I ’m only 16 months along this path , but I already like what I see .
I ’ve created some small ripples already , it will be nice to see where they lead .
Ultimately I ’d also like to institutionalize the work I ’m doing in order to give it more of a life of its own .
And I ’m certainly not the only one doing this sort of thing , but from what I can see , I ’m one of the youngest .
What kind of legacy would you like to leave behind ?
If you were to die today , how will your contribution to the world be remembered ?
Will it be remembered at all , or will you simply be replaced like a burned out light bulb and soon forgotten ?
What ripples are you creating today that have the potential to continue oscillating after you ’re gone ?
Your own death is something your decision about how to live needs to address .
You can not decide how to live without also deciding how to die .
I ’m not talking about whether you ’re going to die of cancer or be gutted by an axe murderer .
I mean that you need to live in such a way that death will not rob your life of its meaning .
Your purpose must be so strong that even death cannot stop it .
Do n’t give up !
I know it ’s not easy to discover your life purpose .
It may take years for you to figure it out .
But no one who has discovered their purpose will tell you it was n’t worth the effort .
It ’s a long journey , sometimes over difficult terrain , but the rewards you will experience along the way are without equal .
If you do n’t yet know what your purpose is , then your purpose for right now is to figure it out .
At some point you ’ll hit one of those big obstacles that makes you want to give up and slink back down into low awareness living .
You ’ll catch yourself thinking that maybe you should just model your life after the fictional characters you see on the TV , or perhaps you ’ll long to just be “ normal ” and fit in like everyone else .
But that kind of life is n’t for you , and you know it .
If you ’ve read this much without turning away , then your awareness is already too high for you to be happy living like the sleeping masses .
It ’s time to wake up .
The bright light will hurt your eyes at first , even make your eyes water , but you ’ll get used to it .
And then you ’ll receive your own high - powered awareness flashlight .
And I have to tell you that it ’s oodles of fun shining that thing in people ’s eyes when they least suspect it … for kicks and giggles , you know .
Of course it ’s great for helping people raise their awareness too . 😉

Hubble Catches Up With Distant Supernovae
11.16.06
These snapshots , taken by NASA ’s Hubble Space Telescope , reveal five supernovae , or exploding stars , and their host galaxies .
Click image to enlarge
The arrows in the top row of images point to the supernovae .
The bottom row shows the host galaxies before or after the stars exploded .
The supernovae exploded between 3.5 and 10 billion years ago .
Astronomers used the supernovae to measure the expansion rate of the universe and determine how the expansion rate is affected by the repulsive push of dark energy , a mysterious energy force that pervades space .
Supernovae provide reliable measurements because their intrinsic brightness is well understood .
They are therefore reliable distance markers , allowing astronomers to determine how far away they are from Earth .
Pinpointing supernovae in the faraway universe is similar to watching fireflies in your back yard .
All fireflies glow with about the same brightness .
So , you can judge how the fireflies are distributed in your back yard by noting their comparative faintness or brightness , depending on their distance from you .
Only Hubble can measure these supernovae because they are too distant , and therefore too faint , to be studied by the largest ground - based telescopes .
These Hubble observations show for the first time that dark energy has been a present force for most of the universe 's history .
A spectral analysis also shows that the supernovae used to measure the universe ’s expansion rate today look remarkably similar to those that exploded nine billion years ago and are just now seen by Hubble .
These latest results are based on an analysis of the 24 most distant known supernovae , most of them discovered within the last three years by the Higher-z SN Search Team .
The images were taken between 2003 and 2005 with Hubble ’s Advanced Camera for Surveys . +

Here 's the scenario : your application is frequently customized per customer , and that means the database has to accomodate new types of information .
My question to you is what do you think is the best ( least bad ) way ?
Here are the strategems I 've used or seen before :
Allow custom fields to be added to the database tables .
Slippery slope to Hell in my experience .
As an internal IT architect , customizing 3rd party code filled me with dread because our upgrade path was shot and support was often harder .
Inside a product company that kind of customization adds maintainability costs , especially if you have to keep customer specific branches .
I have seen some systems accomodate this with custom data dictionaries and metadata driven architectures .
Needless to say , it 's complex .
Use wildcard fields at the end of tables like " string_field_1 " or " int_field_1 " that can be used for anything .
I refer to this kind of design as the " Mystery Meat " antipattern because it 's never obvious what 's in there .
Store extended information in name / value extension tables .
Flexible , but often clumsy in execution .
More Mystery Meat .
Drives DBA 's nearly insane .
Wait , that might be a plus .
Serialize the extended properties as Xml or some other sort of Memento representation in a column .
Presupposes an Object Oriented Domain Model approach .
Requires some customization of the persistence layer , but I think some O/R tools support this ( ActiveRecord in RoR does at least ) .
Does n't work all that well for reporting needs .
Mystery Meat again .
On a tangential note , is anybody using a true OODB ?
Do you think it 'll ever be feasible / practical / common ?
Maybe the XML hybrid databases will end up being better .
Now that Smalltalk and its variants seem to be making a bit of a comeback , I wonder it that ends up making OODB 's practical if they can just use continuations to take quick snapshots of an object .
All the OODB 's I 've ever read about were Smalltalk .

This is the account of my interview experience with Google in 2006 .
This article discusses Google Job Interview Questions – my experience and why I rejected their offer .
This is my story .
PS : Also while you ’re here , feel free to :
Preamble : Google Job Interview
google contacted me about a position with the print team .
i was well paid and was doing well at the company i was with at the time , but i agreed to interview with google anyway .
the head of global print operations was under a lot of pressure due to the lawsuits , etc. yet , he needed headcount , especially they needed help with the actual print operation and the quality problems they were having at the time .
the job was for a permanent position – why else would they go through a grueling 2 days of interviews for a contractor ?
but when i pressed him on salary and asked him to match and provide much more than what i was making and i anchored at an amount , he buckled and made it contractual instead .
he waffled , so i said “ no thanks ” .
the people i met were nice , very bright , and focused on their work .
several of them complained to me about their frustrations that “ google was so big and stuck in its ways ” .
i thought that was interesting .
i declined because of the iffy - ness of a contractual job ( though the cash would be very good ) ; the high cost of the bay area was n’t appealing to me at the time ; and , the future of the print effort seemed unsure to me – but the vision and promise of google print is very good .
those were my reasons .
now , back to the google interview below
The Google Job Interview
back in october 2005 , i interviewed with google , for a position with google print .
my interview was over 2 days , on 10/12/2005 and 10/13/2005 .
i did n’t do much to prepare for the interview , except read - up on all the google print controversy regarding the n lawsuits against google print .
unlike most companies that fly their candidates out for an onsite interview , google ’s policy was for me to pay for my flight , hotel , and food , but that they would reimburse me later .
i thought that was lame and unprofessional ; after all , they are the ones that contacted me for an interview and i never applied for a job with them .
luckily , i was going to be in that area anyway for business , so i just scheduled my business trip for that week .
Google Interview Questions : Day 1 , 4 interviews
in the lobby reception desk , i typed my name on this little widget and signed the dotted line .
then , this little widget prints a self - adhesive name tag with my name , google , and my location .
i gladly took that self - adhesive and put in on my shirt breast .
then , i met with the hr people , both of whom were very nice .
they were very , very late , but i had fun hanging out in the lobby of 1625 charleston road , building # 44 .
in the lobby were 4 refrigerators full of odwalla drinks ; i helped myself to a couple .
on the wall was a large flat monitor that showed , in real time , the current google searches .
this was really amusing .
i remember the following searches :
web hosting reviews
size d bra
how to advertise
how to make a bomb
osama
italian mob + hbo
catholic anger
Find a Math Tutor
this was really cool .
finally , the hr folks were ready and brought me into a room next to the korean and chinese speaking engineers .
my first interviewer came in late and was really sweaty .
he had just ridden his bike to work .
he was sorry he was late .
he was super nice and his questions were easy .
the next person was a little tougher ; she had been with sun microsystems for several years and was in charge of their warehouse and distribution side .
she asked some tough questions , was very open about her frustrations with google , but ended up very nice to me .
she was very frustrated that the engineering received so much priority and attention , but operations and business did n’t .
she was very open about what irritated her as an employee at google .
the next person came in had a background in library science and an mba from michigan .
he was really nice too and asked fluffy questions .
he was n’t an engineer and i do n’t think he knew what to ask me , so he asked me lame conversational - type questions .
i do n’t think it was a fit interview either ; i think he was just clueless – not in a bad way , just that he just did n’t know what was going on .
the next person i interviewed with was sharp ; he was a stanford mba and had been in the print industry for a while .
he was n’t quantitative at all , but was nice .
he asked me hypothetical questions about potential problems that they face in the print group .
the problems were very interesting .
there is true innovation going on at google , for sure .
that was it for day 1 .
there was no lunch , but i was free to raid the fully - stocked kitchen whenever i wanted to ; i helped myself to a healthy dose of mountain dew and stopped by the cafeteria for a veggie sandwich .
the atmosphere there is very cool and i felt energy and could visually see the innovation going on .
very cool .
that evening , i went to my hotel and did some work for the company i was with at the time .
Google Job Offer : day 2 , 7 interviews
i did the whole self - adhesive , name tag thing again .
got an odwalla ( 2 of them ) , then waited .
eventually , the hr people came and got me .
this day was much tougher than day 1 . my first interview was with a former nasa scientist - turned googler .
my interview with him was fun and interesting ; he proposed several real case studies and problems that they face in the print team .
my second interview was with another engineer ; he asked me basic questions and one brain teaser .
the brain teaser goes something like this , if i remember it right :
you are at a party with a friend and 10 people are present including you and the friend .
your friend makes you a wager that for every person you find that has the same birthday as you , you get $ 1 ; for every person he finds that does not have the same birthday as you , he gets $ 2. would you accept the wager ?
i had fun trying to solve this one .
the answer has to do with the number of days in the year and the probability the person ’s birthday falls on the same day as mine ( without replacement ) .
i eventually solved it , but it took time learning how to apply probability with no replacement .
i tried using 10 ! ( factorial ) , for some reason , but that was totally the wrong approach .
we ended the interview ; i did n’t feel as good about that one , because i struggled a little bit through that brain teaser .
my next interviewer asked a lot of algorithm questions .
he made me write pseudo - code for a binary search ; he had me uml a system ; he made me explain cron , diff , the permission system in unix , and had me write a bunch sql queries .
this guy was a scientist at epson , the printer company .
he was sharp ; quantitative but warm .
i liked that interview .
my next interview was with a nice lady who had been with google for a few years .
she was cold , but not mean ; observant , but not expressive .
i felt that i answered her questions fine and our interview was done .
my next couple of interviews were with people that i had interviewed with the previous day , in day 1 . those went fine and uneventful .
but , by this time of day , i was getting really tired , physically and just tired of interviewing .
alas , the last interviewer came , the head of global operations for the google print team .
he was very nice , open , and direct .
that interview went fine and he openly shared his strong interest in my background and said that i’d be a great addition to the team .
he also shared how living in the bay area is so nice and seemed to be trying to sell the location and the company .
i saw this as a good sign .
our time ended ; i left , but before i walked out the building , i managed to steal a few more of those odwalla drinks .
i drove to the san jose airport , caught my flight , and went home .
Google Human Resources : Weeks Later
the hr guy called and gave me an offer !
but , it was n’t what i was expecting .
i was excited for the google stock units ( gsu ) and the phat salary that would barely keep me alive with the bay area cost of living , but that ’s not what i got .
instead , google offered me a contractual position , with a very high hourly rate .
of course , because it was contractual , there would be no benefits or google stock units .
on the phone , on the spot , i declined the job offer .
moving to the bay area was n’t that appealing to me , especially if the job did n’t have google stock units and benefits .
the cash was good , but my family needed more than that .
all in all , the experience was okay .
there is certainly more hype about google than i believe it really merits .
true , they hire sharp — really sharp people ; i felt a lot of energy and could see the innovation happening there , but many of them seemed really unhappy .
i ca n’t put my finger on it , but many employees i met really seemed unhappy and many mentioned the intense bureaucracy present at google — the people i interviewed with did n’t seem happy to me .
they looked tired and grumpy .
i did n’t get a feeling that google treats their people very well .
i’m glad for my decision not to join google .
but , i’ll always wish i had free reign on those odwalla drinks 🙂
Google Job Interview Update
yes , i recited that brain teaser from memory , so i’m sure i shared it incorrectly .
the approach , though , is this : thinking now of probability without replacement ,
( 364/365 ) * ( 363/365 ) . . .
this is the approach to the problem .
given this , would i take the wager ?
no ; it ’s a bad bet .

Home Composable memory transactions Composable memory transactions .
Tim Harris , Simon Marlow , Simon Peyton Jones , and Maurice Herlihy .
Submitted to PPoPP 2005 .
Writing concurrent programs is notoriously difficult , and is of increasing practical importance .
A particular source of concern is that even correctly - implemented concurrency abstractions cannot be composed together to form larger abstractions .
In this paper we present a new concurrency model , based on transactional memory , that offers far richer composition .
All the usual benefits of transactional memory are present ( e.g. freedom from deadlock ) , but in addition we describe new modular forms of blocking and choice that have been inaccessible in earlier work .
The work is in the context of Concurrent Haskell ( of course ) .
The authors work from the assumption that a purely functional ( they use the term declarative ) language is a perfect setting for transactional memory .
The reason is that mutable state is rare and explicit .

Back to terror funding our enemy .
Do they really believe by feeding the crocodile , they wo n't get eaten ?
While those have been the Israeli and American demands of the Palestinian Arabs since Hamas won legislative elections in January , two diplomatic sources yesterday who requested anonymity said the State Department would be willing to accept a government that included some Hamas members if a majority of the cabinet agreed to the terms laid out in the 2003 road map document signed by both sides as well as America , Europe , Russia and the United Nations .
Accepting Hamas ?
Perhaps Hamas will blow up State .
Someone has to .
“ We are looking at creative ways to get around this , ” one diplomat said .
“ I would not call this ‘ Hamas lite , ’ but if we could get a government of negotiators instead of terrorists we ’d take it . ”
First , kill all the diplomats ( before they get us killed . )
Television evangelist and Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson 's suggestion that a nuclear device should be used to wipe out the State Department was " despicable , " department spokesman Richard Boucher said Thursday .
" I lack sufficient capabilities to express my disdain , " Boucher said .
" I think the very idea is despicable " . . . .
" I read your book , " Robertson said .
" When you get through , you say , ' If I could just get a nuclear device inside Foggy Bottom , I think that 's the answer , ' and you say , ' We 've got to blow that thing up . '
I mean , is it as bad as you say ? "
Robertson said .
UPDATE
UPDATE II
Pam Atlas , spawn of Little Green Footballs , personal blogger to Bush nominee / U.N. Ambassador John Bolton , hard - core Lieberman supporter , and general good friend to the right - wing blogosphere , yesterday called for the State Department to be bombed and for American diplomats to be murdered ( emphasis in original ) : Atlas , of course , is not the first person to advocate State Department bombings as a result of its " appeasement " policies in the Middle East :
As I have said before , the ugly bile and extremism that fuels much of the right - wing blogosphere is a story waiting to be written .
This week , for instance , it was revealed that the individual who sent white powder to Keith Olbermann , Nancy Pelosi and others was an active Free Republic poster and an avid fan of Michelle Malkin , Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham .
The intense hate - mongering which is offered up in much of the right - wing blogosphere on a daily basis is the primary or even exclusive information diet for many people , and that is going to have consequences .
Should n't they be examined ?
For some reason , journalists are eager to talk endlessly about the handful of foolish right - wing extremists who march around wearing swastikas and Nazi costumes .
That gets the media excited , despite their total isolation and lack of consequence .
But right - wing hate - mongering that is fueled by religious extremism ( Christian and Jewish ) is infinitely more dangerous and significant in the U.S.
A strong argument can be made that religious fanaticism constitutes a significant motivating force for much of our foreign policy and certainly for the support of many people for those policies , including -- to one degree or another -- the President himself .
Yet that topic makes the media very uncomfortable and it is therefore almost never discussed .
It ought to be . :
For those not understanding the point of this post , allow me to emphasize that I am not ( a ) arguing that Pam Atlas herself or anything she writes , in and of itself , has any sort of significant impact on anything or ( b ) advocating that she should be legally barred from saying things of this sort or even held legally accountable if someone inspired by her rantings acts on them ( the First Amendment bars such liability and it should ) .
The point is that Pam Atlas , like Ann Coulter , is the exposed id of the Bush movement .
She continues to be embraced by the right - wing blosophere because , for many of them , the sentiments she is expressing -- as extreme and attention - seeking though they may be -- are not at all objectionable to them because the same sentiments motivate them .
There have been enormous amounts of ink spilled on the so - called " Angry Left " and the allegedly rabid liberal bloggers ( mostly based on the fact that some delicate pundit received e-mails with bad words in them ) , but the pulsating and ever - increasing hate - mongering in the right - wing blogosphere has been all but ignored .
Independently , John Bolton has spent an unusual amount of time with her , including giving her an hour - long exclusive interview in the middle of negotiating a U.N. Resolution to end the Israel - Lebanaon war , making her extremism independently notable for that reason .
Finally , for purely tactical reasons , there is much value in highlighting -- rather than ignoring -- the most extremist elements of the Bush movement .
Why would anyone think it 's a good idea , tactically if in no other way , to allow them to court the Pam Atlases of the world and be able to do so without any attention being brought to that ?
Opponents of the Bush movement should do all they can to tie people like Pam Atlas to it .
This Glenn Beck interview of newly elected Rep. Keith Ellison ( D - MN ) , the first Muslim ever to serve in the U.S. Congress , is one of the most reprehensible things I 've ever seen on a television news program ( outside of Fox ) .
Watch the video ; does CNN have anything to say about this ?
Hilzoy has some observations worth reading about this .
The first American to be able to claim descent from Genghis Khan has been discovered .
He is Thomas R. Robinson , an associate professor of accounting at the University of Miami in Coral Gables , Fla .
Dr. Robinson 's descent from Genghis Khan emerged in a roundabout way .
The Y chromosome of that Mongol emperor was identified in 2003 by geneticists at the University of Oxford in England .
Surveying the chromosomes of Asian men , they noticed a distinctive genetic signature in populations from Mongolia to Central Asia .
Their common feature was that all but one lay within the borders of the former Mongol empire .
The geneticists concluded that the far - flung Y chromosome must have belonged to Genghis Khan and had become so widespread because of the vigor with which he and his sons labored in their harems , a fact noted by contemporary historians .
While the geneticists were collecting blood samples from the Oxus to Xanadu , Dr. Robinson was researching his family tree and had established that his great - great - grandfather , John Robinson , had emigrated from Cumbria in England to Illinois .
Reaching a dead end , in 2003 he submitted a scraping of cells from the inside of his cheek to Oxford Ancestors .
The company traces people 's ancestry to specific regions of the world based on their Y chromosomes , which track paternal descent , or on their mitochondrial DNA , which is inherited through the female line .

Are There Genes That Made Us Human ?
The HAR1 gene and its role during brain development -
An Analysis of Scientific and Popular Literature
This question has been asked many times by researchers of human evolution .
Like many questions in biology , the answer is probably not simple .
For example , our brain is roughly three times bigger than that of chimpanzees and contains many more levels of organization than their brains , including a greater degree of asymmetry between sides of the brain ( Hill and Walsh , 2005 ) , but many of the mechanisms behind our unique brain development are unknown .
One previous way to study the evolution of brain development has been to identify brain defects that lead to diseases , such as dyslexia , and determine their genetic backgrounds , thereby determining which genes control which functions in the brain ( Hill and Walsh , 2005 ) .
Aside from learning about brain development , this method can also help develop better ways to combat brain disease .
Comparative Genomics Led to The Discovery of HAR1
Comparative genomics , which can study minute differences between human genomes and those of other species in both coding and non-coding regions , can provide a new way of studying human brain evolution .
A recent paper published in Nature ( Pollard et al. , 2006 ) uses statistical analysis of various genomes to identify genes that changed rapidly from chimpanzees to humans , thereby providing a new method to study human evolution at the genomic level .
Around the time of the publication in Nature , multiple news articles were written , including one from USA Today , an article written for BBC News , and a Philadelphia Inquirer editorial .
These three sources show different approaches taken by the news media when covering scientific discovery .
The Scientific Article -
" An RNA gene expressed during cortical development evolved rapidly in humans . "
Published on August 17 , 2006 in Nature ( link to the abstract here ; full text available by subscription )
The article begins with a discussion of the methods used to determine which genes evolved more quickly in human evolution as opposed to other times in evolutionary history .
The researchers compared the chimpanzee genome to mouse and rat genomes to determine segments of sequence identity greater than 96 % ( Pollard et al. , 2006 ) .
They aligned these sequences with segments of the human genome to determine which sequences mutated in the evolution from chimpanzees to humans .
Those segments that had changed rapidly were labeled human accelerated regions ( HARs ) .
In particular , they identified a region , labeled HAR1 , that significantly differed from the chimpanzee genome , displaying a total of 18 mutations over 118 base pairs as compared to a background substitution rate of 0.27 mutations in this segment of the chromosome ( Pollard et al. , 2006 ) .
So what is HAR1 ?
HAR1 is a 118 bp region of chromosome 20 that lies in the conserved region of two different RNA genes .
Both of these genes , labeled HAR1F and HAR1R , code for an mRNA but no protein .

Five human mRNAs can be transcribed from this region – the first two are splicings of a gene labeled HAR1R , while the last three are different splicings of HAR1F .
According to the conservation and species comparison graphs , only a small portion of the gene , the overlap region between the two HAR1 genes , is conserved in multiple animals , pinpointing this region as the 118 - bp HAR1 region ( Kent et al. , 2002 ) ( http://genome.ucsc.edu/ ) .
The Human Genome Browser shows that there are two main mRNAs transcribed from HAR1 , labeled HAR1R and HAR1F .
The researchers were able to predict the structure of the conserved section of HAR1F by predicting the folding pattern of the mRNA .
The paper also noted that the RNA structures of the human and chimpanzee HAR1F were structurally different ( Pollard et al. , 2006 ) .

Where are HAR1R and HAR1F transcribed in the body ?
How are they different ?
To determine the location of both transcripts , researchers isolated human adult and embryonic tissue and used in situ hybridization , whereby complementary sequences of labeled RNA are inserted into tissue to locate and illuminate the target RNA .
The study found that “ HAR1F is strongly and specificallly expressed in the developing neocortex early in human embryonic development ” ( Pollard et al. , 2006 ) , specifically in cells called Cajal - Retzius neurons .
These cells secrete reelin during development , which is a protein that helps coordinate proper brain structure and organization .
Although HAR1F was expressed alongside reelin in the developmental stages of the brain , suggesting some interaction between the two compounds , researchers did not conclude that HAR1F influences reelin expression or vice versa ( Pollard et al. , 2006 ) .
In macaque monkeys , HAR1F is expressed in the same places in the developing brain , showing that the compound could have the same basic function in other vertebrates but could act differently in performing that function ( Pollard et al. , 2006 ) .
The Nature article reports that in contrast to HAR1F , HAR1R is not produced in high levels until later in the developmental stages of the brain .
At the end of the article , a hypothesis was given that HAR1R could help to downregulate the action of HAR1F during later parts of the brain development cycle , although research in this area is inconclusive ( Pollard et al. , 2006 ) .
When studying the mouse genome , the team found different levels of transcription of both HAR1F and HAR1R in the brain during development , showing that levels of transcription of these genes could have changed during evolution and could have some effect on brain development .
Were there any other interesting findings ?
One of the more curious things found in the article was that “ all 18 human - specific changes in [ HAR1 ] are from A or T [ weak nucleotides with 2 H - bonds ] to G or C [ stronger nucleotides with 3 H - bonds ] .
This has the effect of strengthening RNA helices in the predicted RNA structure ” ( Pollard et al. , 2006 ) .
This finding shows that the HAR1 proteins could have become stronger through the mutations , although we can only guess how this would affect the in vivo action of the transcript .
This fact becomes even more curious when the paper continues to note that “ among the 49 most accelerated [ human genes ] , the frequency of weak to strong substitutions is 77 % higher ” than vice versa ( Pollard et al. , 2006 ) .
Again , we do not know the implications of this finding , only that it is a curious pattern in the mutations of the HAR genes .
After reading this paper , one conjectures that the HAR1 gene and its two RNA products could contribute to what makes our brain more organized than that of other animals .
However , researchers were hesitant to make these conclusions in the final words of the paper .
Instead they simply showed that theirs was a good method of studying HARs .
By focusing on methods in their conclusions , the paper left it up to others to hypothesize on the implications of the research .
The USA Today Article -
" Scientists Find Brain Evolution Gene "
Published August 16 , 2006 ( Link to the article )
The USA today article simplifies the issue and changes the focus of the findings about HAR1 .
While the abstract of the Nature article begins and ends with a discussion of new methods to study human evolution through comparative genomics , the USA Today article begins with conclusions .
The inclusion of the word ‘ key ’ in the opening sentence of the article embellishes the findings of the researchers .
Although it draws the reader into the story , it may not be scientifically accurate .
In addition , the article simplifies , misstates , or even omits many of the findings of the Nature article .
The article implies that the gene has something to do with the rapid growth of our brain instead of its complexity .
The Nature article seems to conclude that HAR1 could interact with reelin , a protein that is responsible for brain organization , not brain size .
Although it is possible that HAR1 deals with our brain growth , this is mentioned nowhere in the Nature article .
It is n’t until the last paragraph of the USA Today article that the writer admits that the function of the HAR1 gene is unknown .
How can the RNA bey a ' key ' molecule if its exact function is unknown ?
USA Today also notes that the gene evolved “ 70 times faster ” than the rest of our genes ( Borenstein , 2006 ) ; although this approximation can be calculated by dividing the number of mutations in this gene ( 18 ) by the expected mutations ( 0.27 ) , it is mentioned nowhere in the scientific paper and does not discuss the statistical significance of the findings .
The article omits findings that do not lead to definite conclusions , such as those about weak - strong mutations and about two different RNA transcripts .
It therefore skews the findings of the article by removing the qualifiers and intricacies of the data , simplifying it to a single conclusion about brain evolution .
A final flaw in the USA Today news story concerns its lack of discussion of methods .
There is no mention of the methods that were used to determine these findings , such as in situ hybridization or computer analysis of genomes ; instead , the article conjectures as to the findings of the paper without letting the reader make conclusions by his or herself .
In contrast , the HAR1 paper in Nature concludes by stating that this method of studying and determining human accelerated regions is useful ; even at the end it focuses on the validity of methods , not the implications of the research .
The Philadelphia Enquirer Editorial -
" Smarter than Fido "
Published August 21 , 2006 ( Link to the article )
While the USA Today article was printed in the news section of the paper , this article from the Philadelphia Enquirer appeared as an editorial .
However , its was more true to the scientific publication than the USA Today article , mainly due to its more appropriate word choice and content .
It was not without flaw , but explained the information in the Nature article without as much hyperbole .
The editorial , like the USA Today article , starts with a sensationalist catch - line , by stating that this new gene may give us “ a direct glimpse into the very mechanism that makes us human ” ( Philadelphia Inquirer , 2006 ) .
However , the article soon states that there is not just one gene that controls brain development and that HAR1 contributes to the complexity , not just the size , of the brain .
These two statements help make the editorial more similar to the Nature article , at least in language .
The editorial still makes some errors in language and focus , focusing on implications and not the reasoning behind the science .
During a discussion of brain development toward the end of the article , the author rewords detailed explanations of brain development and the location of HAR1 RNA in an attempt to help non-scientists to understand the gene but also includes sentences that are unrelated to the article and seem to sensationalize the topic , such as the claim that the development of the human brain is an “ explosive and decisive ” issue ( Philadelphia Inquirer , 2006 ) .
The language when describing scientific aspects of the study seems to explain some concepts behind the study while ignoring other key concepts .
For example , the editorial goes into detail about the expression of HAR1 but does not discuss the methods that the researchers used to determine whether this region was a human accelerated region or not .
Overall , the editorial effectively communicates some of the findingds in the Nature publication using simplified language , which is one of the goals of a non-scientific publication , but tends to gloss over methods and the reasoning behind the researcher ’s findings , two areas that are important parts of the original scientific article .
The BBC News Article -
" Research finds ' unique human DNA ' "
Published August 17 , 2006 ( Link to the article )
This article , written online for BBC News , paints the Nature article in a different way from the other popular press articles .
Instead of beginning with a sensational sentence , the article uses much more subdued language at the beginning , describing how scientists have found a gene that “ appears to play a central role ” in brain development ( BBC News , 2006 ) .
The other unique aspect of the article was its focus on the methods of the researchers .
Although it does not mention the statistics of the Nature article , it notes that the researchers used “ sophisticated computer analysis technique[s ] ” ( BBC News , 2006 ) , thereby putting an emphasis on the scientists ’ methods , not on their conclusions .
They continue throughout the article to discuss the paper ’s methods of determining where the gene was expressed , though without going into the details of in situ hybridization .
In this way , the article led the reader through the reasoning of the researchers by describing what they did to get to their conclusions .
By presenting a methods - focused review of the paper , avoiding the use of sensationalist language that blurs the findings of the scientific paper , and illustrating the preliminary nature of the data presented , the BBC News article provides a much more accurate source of information than the other popular press articles described above .
Discussion
These three examples of popular news media articles about a scientific paper show that news outlets often summarize , omit , and sensationalize information that comes from the scientific community .
Kua reports that in a previous study , the most common errors made by the popular press when reporting on scientific papers were “ omission of qualifying statements … , a lack of discussion of the methodology … , a change of emphasis… , and an overstatement of the generalizability of the data ” ( Kua et al. , 2004 ) .
All four of these flaws can be found in the previous discussions in the popular press of the original article by Pollard , et al .
However , the BBC article did present information in a more complete fashion than the others , showing that popular press articles , when written correctly , can effectively summarize a study ’s methods and findings .
News articles are read by people with different interests and backgrounds , including those who may not be knowledgeable about scientific research .
Accordingly , the news article must draw its readership into the article by employing exciting language .
This style of reporting , however , is in contrast to the goal of scientific literature , which is to present unbiased methods and findings .
These three news articles show multiple ways to reconcile the tradeoff between the two types of articles .
These articles illustrate the need to study a variety of sources in the popular press when assimilating information about scientific works .
Although some articles may generalize or embellish , effective popular press articles do exist – they just may not be as easy to find .

The fireweed began each spring as tufts of hairy growth and spread across the seafloor fast enough to cover a football field in an hour .
When fishermen touched it , their skin broke out in searing welts .
Their lips blistered and peeled .
Their eyes burned and swelled shut .
Water that splashed from their nets spread the inflammation to their legs and torsos .
“ It comes up like little boils , ” said Randolph Van Dyk , a fisherman whose powerful legs are pocked with scars .
“ At nighttime , you can feel them burning .
I tried everything to get rid of them .
Nothing worked . ”
As the weed blanketed miles of the bay over the last decade , it stained fishing nets a dark purple and left them coated with a powdery residue .
When fishermen tried to shake it off the webbing , their throats constricted and they gasped for air .

After one man bit a fishing line in two , his mouth and tongue swelled so badly that he could n’t eat solid food for a week .
Others made an even more painful mistake , neglecting to wash the residue from their hands before relieving themselves over the sides of their boats .
For a time , embarrassment kept them from talking publicly about their condition .
When they finally did speak up , authorities dismissed their complaints — until a bucket of the hairy weed made it to the University of Queensland ’s marine botany lab .
Samples placed in a drying oven gave off fumes so strong that professors and students ran out of the building and into the street , choking and coughing .
Scientist Judith O’Neil put a tiny sample under a microscope and peered at the long black filaments .
Consulting a botanical reference , she identified the weed as a strain of cyanobacteria , an ancestor of modern - day bacteria and algae that flourished 2.7 billion years ago .

O’Neil , a biological oceanographer , was familiar with these ancient life forms , but had never seen this particular kind before .
What was it doing in Moreton Bay ?
Why was it so toxic ?
Why was it growing so fast ?
The venomous weed , known to scientists as Lyngbya majuscula , has appeared in at least a dozen other places around the globe .
It is one of many symptoms of a virulent pox on the world ’s oceans .
In many places — the atolls of the Pacific , the shrimp beds of the Eastern Seaboard , the fiords of Norway — some of the most advanced forms of ocean life are struggling to survive while the most primitive are thriving and spreading .
Fish , corals and marine mammals are dying while algae , bacteria and jellyfish are growing unchecked .
Where this pattern is most pronounced , scientists evoke a scenario of evolution running in reverse , returning to the primeval seas of hundreds of millions of years ago .
Jeremy B.C. Jackson , a marine ecologist and paleontologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla , says we are witnessing “ the rise of slime . ”

For many years , it was assumed that the oceans were too vast for humanity to damage in any lasting way .
“ Man marks the Earth with ruin , ” wrote the 19th century poet Lord Byron .
“ His control stops with the shore . ”
Even in modern times , when oil spills , chemical discharges and other industrial accidents heightened awareness of man ’s capacity to injure sea life , the damage was often regarded as temporary .
But over time , the accumulation of environmental pressures has altered the basic chemistry of the seas .
The causes are varied , but collectively they have made the ocean more hospitable to primitive organisms by putting too much food into the water .
Advertisement
Industrial society is overdosing the oceans with basic nutrients — the nitrogen , carbon , iron and phosphorous compounds that curl out of smokestacks and tailpipes , wash into the sea from fertilized lawns and cropland , seep out of septic tanks and gush from sewer pipes .
Modern industry and agriculture produce more fixed nitrogen — fertilizer , essentially — than all natural processes on land .
Millions of tons of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide , produced by burning fossil fuels , enter the ocean every day .
These pollutants feed excessive growth of harmful algae and bacteria .
At the same time , overfishing and destruction of wetlands have diminished the competing sea life and natural buffers that once held the microbes and weeds in check .

The consequences are evident worldwide .
Off the coast of Sweden each summer , blooms of cyanobacteria turn the Baltic Sea into a stinking , yellow - brown slush that locals call “ rhubarb soup . ”
Dead fish bob in the surf .
If people get too close , their eyes burn and they have trouble breathing .
On the southern coast of Maui in the Hawaiian Islands , high tide leaves piles of green - brown algae that smell so foul condominium owners have hired a tractor driver to scrape them off the beach every morning .
On Florida ’s Gulf Coast , residents complain that harmful algae blooms have become bigger , more frequent and longer - lasting .
Toxins from these red tides have killed hundreds of sea mammals and caused emergency rooms to fill up with coastal residents suffering respiratory distress .

North of Venice , Italy , a sticky mixture of algae and bacteria collects on the Adriatic Sea in spring and summer .
This white mucus washes ashore , fouling beaches , or congeals into submerged blobs , some bigger than a person .
Along the Spanish coast , jellyfish swarm so thick that nets are strung to protect swimmers from their sting .
Organisms such as the fireweed that torments the fishermen of Moreton Bay have been around for eons .
They emerged from the primordial ooze and came to dominate ancient oceans that were mostly lifeless .
Over time , higher forms of life gained supremacy .
Now they are under siege .
Like other scientists , Jeremy Jackson , 63 , was slow to perceive this latest shift in the biological order .
He has spent a good part of his professional life underwater .
Though he had seen firsthand that ocean habitats were deteriorating , he believed in the resilience of the seas , in their inexhaustible capacity to heal themselves .

Then came the hurricane season of 1980 .
A Category 5 storm ripped through waters off the north coast of Jamaica , where Jackson had been studying corals since the late 1960s .
A majestic stand of staghorn corals , known as “ the Haystacks , ” was turned into rubble .
Scientists gathered from around the world to examine the damage .
They wrote a paper predicting that the corals would rebound quickly , as they had for thousands of years .
“ We were the best ecologists , working on what was the best - studied coral reef in the world , and we got it 100 % wrong , ” Jackson recalled .
The vividly colored reef , which had nurtured a wealth of fish species , never recovered .
Advertisement
“ Why did I get it wrong ? ” Jackson asked .
He now sees that the quiet creep of environmental decay , occurring largely unnoticed over many years , had drastically altered the ocean .
As tourist resorts sprouted along the Jamaican coast , sewage , fertilizer and other nutrients washed into the sea .
Overfishing removed most of the grazing fish that kept algae under control .
Warmer waters encouraged bacterial growth and further stressed the corals .
For a time , these changes were masked by algae - eating sea urchins .
But when disease greatly reduced their numbers , the reef was left defenseless .
The corals were soon smothered by a carpet of algae and bacteria .
Today , the reef is largely a boneyard of coral skeletons .
Many of the same forces have wiped out 80 % of the corals in the Caribbean , despoiled two - thirds of the estuaries in the United States and destroyed 75 % of

California ’s kelp forests , once prime habitat for fish .
Jackson uses a homespun analogy to illustrate what is happening .
The world ’s 6 billion inhabitants , he says , have failed to follow a homeowner ’s rule of thumb :
Be careful what you dump in the swimming pool , and make sure the filter is working .
“ We ’re pushing the oceans back to the dawn of evolution , ” Jackson said , “ a half - billion years ago when the oceans were ruled by jellyfish and bacteria . ”
The 55 - foot commercial trawler working the Georgia coast sagged under the burden of a hefty catch .
The cables pinged and groaned as if about to snap .

Working the power winch , ropes and pulleys , Grovea Simpson hoisted the net and its dripping catch over the rear deck .
With a tug on the trip - rope , the bulging sack unleashed its massive load .
Plop .
Splat .
Whoosh .
About 2,000 pounds of cannonball jellyfish slopped onto the deck .
The jiggling , cantaloupe - size blobs ricocheted around the stern and slid down an opening into the boat ’s ice - filled hold .
The deck was streaked with purple - brown contrails of slimy residue ; a stinging , ammonia - like odor filled the air .
“ That ’s the smell of money , ” Simpson said , all smiles at the haul .
“ Jellyballs are thick today .
Seven cents a pound .
Yes , sir , we ’re making money . ”
Advertisement
Simpson would never eat a jellyfish .
But shrimp have grown scarce in these waters after decades of intensive trawling .
So during the winter months when jellyfish swarm , he makes his living catching what he used to consider a messy nuisance clogging his nets .
It ’s simple math .
He can spend a week at sea scraping the ocean bottom for shrimp and be lucky to pocket $ 600 after paying for fuel , food , wages for crew and the boat owner ’s cut .
Or , in a few hours of trawling for jellyfish , he can fill up the hold , be back in port the same day and clear twice as much .
The jellyfish are processed at the dock in Darien , Ga. , and exported to
China and Japan , where spicy jellyfish salad and soup are delicacies .

“ Easy money , ” Simpson said .
“ They get so thick you can walk on them . ”
Jellyfish populations are growing because they can .
The fish that used to compete with them for food have become scarce because of overfishing .
The sea turtles that once preyed on them are nearly gone .
And the plankton they love to eat are growing explosively .
As their traditional catch declines , fishermen around the world now haul in 450,000 tons of jellyfish per year , more than twice as much as a decade ago .
This is a logical step in a process that Daniel Pauly , a fisheries scientist at the University of British Columbia , calls “ fishing down the food web . ”
Fishermen first went after the largest and most popular fish , such as tuna , swordfish , cod and grouper .
When those stocks were depleted , they pursued other prey , often smaller and lower on the food chain .

“ We are eating bait and moving on to jellyfish and plankton , ” Pauly said .
In California waters , for instance , three of the top five commercial catches are not even fish .
They are squid , crabs and sea urchins .
This is what remains of California ’s historic fishing industry , once known for the sardine fishery attached to Monterey ’s Cannery Row and the world ’s largest tuna fleet , based in San Diego , which brought American kitchens StarKist , Bumble Bee and Chicken of the Sea .
Overfishing began centuries ago but accelerated dramatically after World War II , when new technologies armed industrial fleets with sonar , satellite data and global positioning systems , allowing them to track schools of fish and find their most remote habitats .
Advertisement
The result is that the population of big fish has declined by 90 % over the last 50 years .
It ’s reached the point that the world ’s fishermen , though more numerous , working harder and sailing farther than ever , are catching fewer fish .
The global catch has been declining since the late 1980s , an analysis by Pauly and colleague Reg Watson showed .
The reduction is n’t readily apparent in the fish markets of wealthy countries , where people are willing to pay high prices for exotic fare from distant oceans — slimeheads caught off New Zealand and marketed as orange roughy , or Patagonian toothfish , renamed Chilean sea bass .
Now , both of those fish are becoming scarce .
Fish farming also exacts a toll .
To feed the farmed stocks , menhaden , sardines and anchovies are harvested in great quantities , ground up and processed into pellets .

Dense schools of these small fish once swam the world ’s estuaries and coastal waters , inhaling plankton like swarming clouds of silvery vacuum cleaners .
Maryland ’s Chesapeake Bay , the nation ’s largest estuary , used to be clear , its waters filtered every three days by piles of oysters so numerous that their reefs posed a hazard to navigation .
All this has changed .
There and in many other places , bacteria and algae run wild in the absence of the many mouths that once ate them .
As the depletion of fish allows the lowest forms of life to run rampant , said Pauly , it is “ transforming the oceans into a microbial soup . ”
Jellyfish are flourishing in the soup , demonstrating their ability to adapt to wholesale changes — including the growing human appetite for them .
Jellyfish have been around , after all , at least 500 million years , longer than most marine animals .

In the Black Sea , an Atlantic comb jelly carried in the ballast water of a ship from the East Coast of the United States took over waters saturated with farm runoff .
Free of predators , the jellies gorged on plankton and fish larvae , depleting the fisheries on which the Russian and Turkish fleets depend .
The plague subsided only with the accidental importation of another predatory jellyfish that ate the comb jellies .
Federal scientists tallied a tenfold increase in jellies in the Bering Sea in the 1990s .
They were so thick off the Alaskan Peninsula that fishermen nicknamed it the Slime Bank .
Researchers have found teeming swarms of jellyfish off Georges Bank in New England and the coast of Namibia , in the fiords of Norway and in the Gulf of Mexico .
Also proliferating is the giant nomurai found off Japan , a jellyfish the size of a washing machine .
Most jellies are smaller than a fist , but their sheer numbers have gummed up fishing nets , forced the shutdown of power plants by clogging intake pipes , stranded cruise liners and disrupted operations of the world ’s largest aircraft carrier , the Ronald Reagan .
Of the 2,000 or so identified jellyfish species , only about 10 are commercially harvested .
The largest fisheries are off China and other Asian nations .
New ones are springing up in Australia , the United States , England , Namibia , Turkey and Canada as fishermen look for ways to stay in business .

Pauly , 60 , predicts that future generations will see nothing odd or unappetizing about a plateful of these gelatinous blobs .
“ My kids , ” Pauly said , “ will tell their children : Eat your jellyfish . ”
The dark water spun to the surface like an undersea cyclone .
From 80 feet below , the swirling mixture of partially treated sewage spewed from a 5 - foot - wide pipe off the coast of Hollywood , Fla. , dubbed the “ poop chute ” by divers and fishermen .
Fish swarmed at the mouth — blue tangs and chubs competing for particles in the wastewater .

Marine ecologist Brian Lapointe and research assistant Rex “ Chip ” Baumberger , wearing wetsuits and breathing air from scuba tanks , swam to the base of the murky funnel cloud to collect samples .
The effluent meets state and federal standards but is still rich in nitrogen , phosphorous and other nutrients .
By Lapointe ’s calculations , every day about a billion gallons of sewage in South Florida are pumped offshore or into underground aquifers that seep into the ocean .
The wastewater feeds a green tide of algae and bacteria that is helping to wipe out the remnants of Florida ’s 220 miles of coral , the world ’s third largest barrier reef .
In addition , fertilizer washes off sugar cane fields , livestock compounds and citrus farms into Florida Bay .
“ You can see the murky green water , the green pea soup loaded with organic matter , ” said Lapointe , a marine biologist at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution in Fort Pierce , Fla .
“ All that stuff feeds the algae and bacterial diseases that are attacking corals . ”

Government officials thought they were helping in the early 1990s when they released fresh water that had been held back by dikes and pumps for years .
They were responding to the recommendations of scientists who , at the time , blamed the decline of ocean habitats on hypersalinity — excessively salty seawater .
The fresh water , laced with farm runoff rich in nitrogen and other nutrients , turned Florida ’s gin-clear waters cloudy .
Seaweed grew fat and bushy .
It was a fatal blow for many struggling corals , delicate animals that evolved to thrive in clear , nutrient - poor saltwater .
So many have been lost that federal officials in May added what were once the two most dominant types — elkhorn and staghorn corals — to the list of species threatened with extinction .
Officials estimate that 97 % of them are gone .
Sewage and farm runoff kill corals in various ways .

Algae blooms deny them sunlight essential for their survival .
The nutrients in sewage and fertilizer make bacteria grow wildly atop corals , consuming oxygen and suffocating the animals within .
A strain of bacteria found in human intestines , Serratia marcescens , has been linked to white pox disease , one of a host of infectious ailments that have swept through coral reefs in the Florida Keys and elsewhere .
The germ appears to come from leaky septic tanks , cesspits and other sources of sewage that have multiplied as the Keys have grown from a collection of fishing villages to a stretch of bustling communities with 80,000 year - round residents and 4 million visitors a year .

Scientists discovered the link by knocking on doors of Keys residents , asking to use their bathrooms .
They flushed bacteria marked with tracers down toilets and found them in nearby ocean waters in as little as three hours .
Nearly everything in the Keys seems to be sprouting green growths , even an underwater sculpture known as Christ of the Abyss , placed in the waters off Key Largo in the mid-1960s as an attraction for divers and snorkelers .
Dive - shop operators scrub the bronze statue with wire brushes from time to time , but they have trouble keeping up with the growth .
Lapointe began monitoring algae at Looe Key in 1982 .
He picked the spot , a 90 - minute drive south of Key Largo , because its clear waters , colorful reef and abundance of fish made it a favorite site for scuba divers .
Today , the corals are in ruins , smothered by mats of algae .
Although coral reefs cover less than 1 % of the ocean floor , they are home to at least 2 million species , or about 25 % of all marine life .
They provide nurseries for fish and protect oceanfront homes from waves and storm surges .

Looe Key was once a sandy shoal fringed by coral .
The Key has now slipped below the water ’s surface , a disappearing act likely to be repeated elsewhere in these waters as pounding waves breach dying reefs .
Scientists predict that the Keys ultimately will have to be surrounded by sea walls as ocean levels rise .
With a gentle kick of his fins through murky green water , Lapointe maneuvered around a coral mound that resembled the intricate , folded pattern of a brain .
Except that this brain was being eroded by the coralline equivalent of flesh - eating disease .
“ It rips my heart out , ” Lapointe said .
“ It ’s like coming home and seeing burglars have ransacked your house , and everything you cherished is gone . ”
The ancient seas contained large areas with little or no oxygen — anoxic and hypoxic zones that could never have supported sea life as we know it .
It was a time when bacteria and jellyfish ruled .

Nancy Rabalais , executive director of the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium , has spent most of her career peering into waters that resemble those of the distant past .
On research dives off the Louisiana coast , she has seen cottony white bacteria coating the seafloor .
The sulfurous smell of rotten eggs , from a gas produced by the microbes , has seeped into her mask .
The bottom is littered with the ghostly silhouettes of dead crabs , sea stars and other animals .
The cause of death is decaying algae .
Fed by millions of tons of fertilizer , human and animal waste , and other farm runoff racing down the Mississippi River , tiny marine plants run riot , die and drift to the bottom .
Bacteria then take over .
In the process of breaking down the plant matter , they suck the oxygen out of seawater , leaving little or none for fish or other marine life .
Years ago , Rabalais popularized a term for this broad area off the Louisiana coast : the “ dead zone . ”
In fact , dead zones are n’t really dead .
They are teeming with life — most of it bacteria and other ancient creatures that evolved in an ocean without oxygen and that need little to survive .

“ There are tons and tons of bacteria that live in dead zones , ” Rabalais said .
“ You see this white snot - looking stuff all over the bottom . ”
Other primitive life thrives too .
A few worms do well , and jellyfish feast on the banquet of algae and microbes .
The dead zone off Louisiana , the second largest after one in the Baltic Sea , is a testament to the unintended consequences of manufacturing nitrogen fertilizer on a giant scale to support American agriculture .
The runoff from Midwestern farms is part of a slurry of wastewater that flows down the Mississippi , which drains 40 % of the continental United States .
The same forces at work in the mouth of the Mississippi have helped create 150 dead zones around the world , including parts of the Chesapeake Bay and waters off the Oregon and Washington coasts .

About half of the Earth ’s landscape has been altered by deforestation , farming and development , which has increased the volume of runoff and nutrient - rich sediment .
Most of the planet ’s salt marshes and mangrove forests , which serve as a filter between land and sea , have vanished with coastal development .
Half of the world ’s population lives in coastal regions , which add an average of 2,000 homes each day .
Global warming adds to the stress .
A reduced snowpack from higher temperatures is accelerating river discharges and thus plankton blooms .
The oceans have warmed slightly — 1 degree on average in the last century .
Warmer waters speed microbial growth .
Robert Diaz , a professor at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science , has been tracking the spread of low - oxygen zones .
He has determined that the number is nearly doubling every decade , fed by a worldwide cascade of nutrients — or as he puts it , energy .
We stoke the ocean with energy streaming off the land , he said , and with no clear pathways up the food chain , this energy fuels an explosion of microbial growth .

These microbes have been barely noticeable for millions of years , tucked away like the pilot light on a gas stove .
“ Now , ” Diaz said , “ the stove has been turned on . ”
In Australia , fishermen noticed the fireweed around the time much of Moreton Bay started turning a dirty , tea - water brown after every rain .
The wild growth smothered the bay ’s northern sea-grass beds , once full of fish and shellfish , under a blanket a yard thick .
The older , bottom layers of weed turned grayish - white and started to decay .
Bacteria , feeding on the rot , sucked all of the oxygen from beneath this woolly layer at night .
Most sea life swam or scuttled away ; some suffocated .
Fishermen ’s catches plummeted .

Most disturbing were the rashes , an outbreak often met with scoffs from local authorities .
After suffering painful skin lesions , fisherman Greg Savige took a sealed bag of the weed in 2000 to Barry Carbon , then director - general of the Queensland Environmental Protection Agency .
He warned Carbon to be careful with it , as it was “ toxic stuff . ”
Carbon replied that he knew all about cyanobacteria from western Australian waters and that there was nothing to worry about .
Then he opened the bag and held it close to his face for a sniff .
“ It was like smearing hot mustard on the lips , ” the chastened official recalled .

Aboriginal fishermen had spotted the weed in small patches years earlier , but it had moved into new parts of the bay and was growing like never before .
Each spring , Lyngbya bursts forth from spores on the seafloor and spreads in dark green - and - black dreadlocks .
It flourishes for months before retreating into the muck .
Scientists say it produces more than 100 toxins , probably as a defense mechanism .
At its peak in summer , the weed now covers as much as 30 square miles of Moreton Bay , an estuary roughly the size of San Francisco Bay .
In one seven - week period , its expansion was measured at about 100 square meters a minute — a football field in an hour .
William Dennison , then director of the University of Queensland botany lab , could n’t believe it at first .

“ We checked this 20 times .
It was mind - boggling .
It was like ‘ The Blob , ’ ” Dennison said , recalling the 1950s horror movie about an alien life form that consumed everything in its path .
Suspecting that nutrients from partially treated sewage might be the culprit , another Queensland University scientist , Peter Bell , collected some wastewater and put it in a beaker with a pinch of Lyngbya .
The weed bloomed happily .
As Brisbane and the surrounding area became the fastest growing region in Australia , millions of gallons of partially treated sewage gushed from 30 wastewater treatment plants into the bay and its tributary rivers .
Officials upgraded the sewage plants to remove nitrogen from the wastewater , but it did not stop the growth of the infernal weed .

Researchers began looking for other sources of Lyngbya ’s nutrients , and are now investigating whether iron and possibly phosphorous are being freed from soil as forests of eucalyptus and other native trees are cleared for farming and development .
“ We know the human factor is responsible .
We just have to figure out what it is , ” Dennison said .
Recently , Lyngbya has appeared up the coast from Moreton Bay , on the Great Barrier Reef , where helicopters bring tourists to a heart - shaped coral outcropping .
When the helicopters depart , seabirds roost on the landing platform , fertilizing the reef with their droppings .
Lyngbya now beards the surrounding corals .

“ Lyngbya has lots of tricks , ” said scientist Judith O’Neil .
“ That ’s why it ’s been around for 3 billion years . ”
It can pull nitrogen out of the air and make its own fertilizer .
It uses a different spectrum of sunlight than algae do , so it can thrive even in murky waters .
Perhaps its most diabolical trick is its ability to feed on itself .
When it dies and decays , it releases its own nitrogen and phosphorous into the water , spurring another generation of growth .
“ Once it gets going , it ’s able to sustain itself , ” O’Neil said .
Ron Johnstone , a University of Queensland researcher , recently experienced Lyngbya ’s fire .
He was studying whether iron and phosphorous in bay sediments contribute to the blooms , and he accidentally came in contact with bits of the weed .
He broke out in rashes and boils , and needed a cortisone shot to ease the inflammation .
Advertisement
“ It covered my whole chest and neck , ” he said .
“ We ’ve just ordered complete containment suits so we can roll in it . ”
Fishermen say they cannot afford such pricey equipment .
Nor would it be practical .
For some , the only solution is to turn away from the sea .
Lifelong fisherman Mike Tanner , 50 , stays off the water at least four months each year to avoid contact with the weed .
It ’s an agreement he struck with his wife , who was appalled by his blisters and worried about the long - term health consequences .
“ When he came home with rash all over his body , ” Sandra Tanner said , “ I said , ‘ No , you are not going . ’
We did n’t know what was happening to him . ”
Advertisement
Tanner , a burly , bearded man , is frustrated that he cannot help provide for his family .
Gloves and other waterproof gear failed to protect him .
“ It ’s like acid , ” Tanner said .
“ I could n’t believe it .
It kept pulling the skin off . ”
Before the Lyngbya outbreak , 40 commercial shrimp trawlers and crab boats worked these waters .
Now there are six , and several of them sit idle during fireweed blooms .
“ It ’s the only thing that can beat us , ” Greg Savige said .
“ Wind is nothing .
Waves , nothing .
It ’s the only thing that can make us stop work .
When you ’ve got sores and the skin peels away , what are you going to do ? ”

In 1995 I was working for an AT&T spinoff , Unix System Labs , in the kernel group , but USL was n't doing too well .
It looked like Windows was winning the OS wars ( remember those ? ) and was going to scrape Unix from the face of the earth .
My buddy Tom had been trying to get me to come out to the west coast to work for Sun .
He was working in a group that did network security .
He said that it did n't matter what OS won , we 'd always have network security to worry about .
That made sense to me .
He set up the interviews , and since I did n't know anything about security , told me to buy a copy of Applied Cryptography and read it before I got there .
So I got hired into Sun 's group developing firewalls and IP - level encryption .
This was great work .
Security is really intellectually challenging and rewarding .
Little unseen errors in apparently simple code or protocols can lead to collapse of the entire system .
Rigor and thought count .
But commercially our group was a bust .
In addition to our firewall product , the Sun sales force was reselling a third - party product too .
And they seemed to like to sell the third party product better than Sun 's homegrown one .
We were also trying to sell an add - on security workstation package .
The sales force did n't seem to think much of the commission on our $ 99 software bundle when they were pushing their multi-million dollar hardware orders .
Furthermore , the US government did n't seem to want to let us sell our stuff .
International sales of cryptographic products are regulated , since they 're classified as " munitions " .
We had Swiss banks that wanted to buy our encrypting firewalls .
We 'd have to meet with the NSA to get export approval , but were never able to sell the full strength versions .
There was a dark story about a rebuffed offer to include a backdoor in the crypto for the powers - that - be , which lead them to subsequently look on us unfavorably .
We tried all sorts of shenanigans to loophole around these restrictions but it was an uphill battle .
The final nail in the coffin came when Sun 's crypto protocol lost out to another faction 's in the IETF .
I was just an engineer in this group , but the reality of what was happening in the market to our product line started to seep in .
Here I was putting all of this effort into stuff that never would be used by anyone .
It was still intellectually challenging ... like doing crossword puzzles or something .
But it had no utility to the world .
I started to look around and I saw many other examples of groups working on stuff that no one would ever use or care about .
Mobile IP initiatives , endless work around standards that nobody cared about , research from the labs that would never be applied or even cited .
Yikes .
I had written stuff that people actually used , before .
It felt good .
I had written a usenet newsreader that was used by hundreds of thousands of people .
I was running an online game , as a commercial hobby on the side , which had several hundred paying customers .
Sheesh , I thought .
My side projects have more customers than my day job .
So I made a simple resolution .
I wanted to work on stuff that people would actually use .
This sounds simple .
But if you walk the halls of Sun , AOL , HP , IBM , AOL , Cisco , Siebel , Oracle , any university , many startups , and even Google and Yahoo , you 'll find people working on stuff that is n't going to ship .
Or that if it does ship , it wo n't be noticed , or wo n't move the needle .
That 's tragic .
It 's like writing a blog that nobody reads . :-)
People make fun of bloggers who are writing " only for their mother " .
But what about the legion of programmers writing code paths that will never be traversed .
Wasted effort !
Some of that may be inevitable .
You try experimental things .
Sometimes they do n't work .
Everyone can't be maximally productive 100 % of the time , so there may be lesser - value tasks that still keep the engine warm and have some marginal utility .
But still .
Evolutionarily , frustration is useful .
It kicks us out of non-productive ruts .
People should get frustrated more easily .
Frustration should be driven by an awareness of futile effort .
* * *
Without business models , bizdev deals for distribution , and market economics that afford a place for your product , it does n't matter how pretty the code is .
Ugly code and awful products win all the time .
From an engineering perspective , it 's simply zooming out the field - of - view to include the entire market , including the users , competitors , and so on .
They 're part of the total engineering solution .
If you 've written an app with some web forms and a database , but you have n't solved the problem of how to get users to come to the web form , then you 've left part of the problem unsolved .
Greg Linden details some of the tricks that have been used by startups to get a leg up in a crowded world .
He wonders if you have to be , perhaps , a little bit evil to have a hope .
I 'm not sure , but you should have some idea of how you 're going to launch the bird , and the market and distribution economics that let it stay aloft .
All of this is a long - winded way of explaining why I include all this gunk about network effects and switching costs and distribution and brand perception on my blog .
Because the world , full of competitors and networked humans with their set of behavior patterns , is part of the spec .
If you 're designing a product , but do n't understand how the system of networked humans will work around it , you really can't understand how your product will work either .
No minute lost comes ever back again
Take heed and see ye nothing do in vain
A companion article , " Coping with Speech Noise in the Modern Workplace " [ 1 ] , examined the problem of office noise and the resulting stress , distraction and loss of productivity .
Irrelevant speech was found to be the most distracting type of sound , because the mind tends to follow the unwanted conversation instead of the worker 's own thoughts .
The article reviewed the acoustical limitations of cubicles and open - plan offices and recommended a number of possible remedies , including minimizing the problem at the source ( by encouraging a culture of acoustic courtesy ) and masking unwanted conversations with nature sounds , instrumental music , and / or distant chatter .
This article will focus on a complementary approach to the problem .
Since some people are less disturbed and distracted by extraneous conversation than others , it seems possible that the ability to tune out noise might be a learnable skill .
We will explore the practice of mindfulness as a way of learning to reducing the stress and distraction of office noise .
A Startling Discovery
The startle reflex is just that — a reflex , an involuntary response to a sudden unexpected stimulus .
Within the first third of a second after a surprising sound , everyone responds in the same way : the same five facial muscles contract , and we experience an increase in heart rate , blood pressure and sweating .
Since it is a function of the reptilian brain , the startle reflex cannot be suppressed by force of will . [ 2 , 3 ]
At least , that 's what scientists believed until they tested Öser , a European - born Tibetan monk , in the laboratory .
When a very loud sound ( equivalent to a firecracker or gunshot ) was played while Öser practiced " one- pointed " meditation , his facial movements were quite small , and his heart rate and blood pressure actually decreased .
And when the sound was played while he practiced " open state " meditation , his face did not move a muscle [ 3 ] .
Öser said , " When I went into the open state , the explosive sound seemed to me softer , as if I was distanced from the sensations , hearing the sound from afar ....
If you can remain properly in this state , the bang seems neutral , like a bird crossing the sky . " [ 3 ]
While these are impressive findings , suggesting that the ability to tune out noise may indeed be a learnable skill , what are the implications for those of us who are unlikely to spend months or years in intensive meditation practice ?
Meditation for the Rest of Us
" Attention is the key to learning , and meditation helps you voluntarily regulate it . " — Richard Davidson , director of the Laboratory for Affective Neuroscience , University of Washington [ 29 ]
Since occupational stress is a leading cause of disease , absenteeism and lowered productivity , research has focused primarily on meditation 's ability to reduce stress at work [ 4 ] .
Numerous studies have shown that even a relatively short training in meditation can reducing stress , anxiety and burnout , while increasing employee satisfaction and creativity [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] .
Less research has been done regarding meditation 's impact on the ability to concentrate , but studies have shown :
Increased concentration scores after 20 minutes of meditation each day for six weeks [ 9 ]
Improved academic performance when meditating prior to studying and taking exams [ 10 , 11 ]
More alertness , productivity , and willingness to collaborate with others [ 12 ]
Improved attention scores [ 13 , 14 ]
A decline in mental acuity after a mid-afternoon nap , but a significant increase after 40 minutes of meditation , even though none of the volunteers were experienced meditators [ 15 , 29 ]
Other research has focused on the structure of the brain .
Just as MRI studies have found that in violinists , the part of the brain that controls finger movements grows in size [ 3 ] , recent experiments have shown that meditation actually increases the thickness of the part of the cortex relating to attention and sensory processing [ 15 ] .
Since a common element in all meditation is the retraining of attention [ 13 ] , it seems likely that the practice of meditation could be helpful in learning to focus on one 's own thoughts and tune out distractions .
Meditation at Work
" There 's no question employees who do this are more relaxed , and some are even more productive . " — George Bennett , CEO of Symmetrix [ 16 ]
While some companies ( and employees ) are skeptical about the idea of meditation in the workplace , others are being won over by its benefits .
Given that 70 % to 90 % of employee hospital visits are stress - related [ 18 ] , the value of stress - reduction should be apparent .
Articles in The Washington Post [ 19 ] and Business Week [ 16 ] have emphasized that meditation - based stress reduction programs can improve corporate productivity and reduce expenses from health care , employee turnover and absenteeism .
Insurance companies , which have a clear financial incentive to minimize health care costs , have begun offering meditation classes and stress - reduction seminars [ 16 ] .
After a majority of Tower Companies ' employees began meditating , health care costs dropped so much that Great West Insurance covered most of the costs of the meditation course and dropped the company 's premium by 5 % [ 19 ] .
Tech companies like Google , Apple and Yahoo have begun offering meditation courses , as have Nike , Toyota , Walt Disney , AT&T , Deutsche Bank , Hughes Aircraft , the Chicago Bulls , General Electric , and many others [ 18 , 20 ] .
When the chemical manufacturing company R.W. Montgomery instituted a meditation program in 1983 , they found that over the next three years productivity rose 120 % , absenteeism fell 85 % , injuries and sick days declined , and profits increased by 520 % [ 19 ] .
Work as Meditation
" I 'm able to sort through work challenges in this state of calm much faster than trying to fight through it .
And I make fewer mistakes . " — Dave Jakubowski , VP of Business Development , United Online Inc . [ 18 ]
Peak performance at complex tasks such as programming , engineering and writing often involves a state of " flow , " defined by Csikszentmihalyi as :
" Being completely involved in an activity for its own sake .
The ego falls away .
Time flies .
Every action , movement , and thought follows inevitably from the previous one , like playing jazz .
Your whole being is involved , and you 're using your skills to the utmost . " — Mihaly Csikszentmihaly i [ 21 ]
The workday is most productive and least tedious when you are in flow , " in the zone . "
The capacity to focus attention and achieve a flow state can be cultivated by training in mindfulness meditation , yoga , martial arts and other disciplines . [ 22 , 23 ]
Peak performance is , itself , a type of meditation , where you are at one with the present moment , focused on your task with a one - pointed awareness .
The state of flow is somewhat fragile , however , and can be disrupted by boredom ( too easy a task ) or frustration ( too hard a task ) , as well as by noise and other distractions .
Internal and External Chatter
" Meditation is based on the simple principle that clearing a clutter is enough for clarity to surface spontaneously . " [ 24 ]
Irrelevant speech distracts in two separate ways .
First , our minds start listening to the unwanted speech instead of our own thoughts .
Then , when we notice that a co-worker has disrupted our task , we have an emotional reaction .
Especially if we are under a deadline , we may feel angry or frustrated .
We may think , " I should n't have to listen to this , " or " Why can't I just be left alone to work in peace and quiet , " or " Now I 'll never get this done on time . "
Often the emotional reaction is more distracting , and certainly more stressful , than the speech sound itself .
Similarly , beginning meditators often get frustrated when their minds wander , and blame themselves for meditating incorrectly .
In reality , wandering is what minds tend to do ( just as chatting is what co-workers do ) , and the essence of meditation is the practice of gently , repeatedly , bringing the mind back to the breath or other object of meditation .
Instead of getting frustrated or angry at the intrusion of unwanted thoughts or sounds , simply return the attention to the meditation object , over and over .
Mindfulness Meditation , as practiced in the Mindfulness - Based Stress Reduction course taught in over 200 medical centers in the United States , promotes an attitude of acceptance , which means seeing things as they actually are in the present [ 25 ] .
Some of the exercises involve listening :
" ... try just listening to sound when you meditate .
This does not mean listening for sounds , rather just hearing what is here to be heard , moment by moment , without judging or thinking about them .
Just hearing them as pure sound . " [ 25 ]
If you notice unwanted sounds during the practice , pay attention to your reaction to the sounds .
How can these sounds disrupt your meditation , if the object of the meditation is to be mindful of sounds and your reactions ?
This practice can help desensitize us to intrusive speech and defuse our emotional response .
Other meditation exercises involve withdrawing the attention from external sounds and internal chatter , focusing instead on a specific object or one 's own breathing :
" Sounds abound even in a quiet environment ....
Pratyahara involves a gentle withdrawal of attention from these sounds in an attempt to cultivate a studied indifference to the source and significance of these sounds .
In addition to thoughts triggered by sensory stimuli , is the spontaneous flow of thoughts often manifesting as rumination .
The person learns to ignore these thoughts as well during pratyahara . " [ 24 ]
Meditations on Work
A recent study showed that the average American worker wastes over two hours per 8 - hour workday , not counting lunch and breaks .
The biggest distraction was personal Internet use ( surfing the web , like you 're doing right now ) at 45 % , followed by socializing with co-workers ( 23 % ) , conducting personal business ( 7 % ) and the ever - popular " spacing out " ( 4 % ) [ 26 ] .
Not all of the wasted time is intentional .
But just as the mind tends to wander from one thought to the next , the mouse clicks from one web link to the next , and soon an hour has passed .
The primary time - wasting excuses were " Not enough work to do " ( 33 % ) , " I 'm underpaid for the amount of work I do " ( 23 % ) , and " My co-workers distract me " ( 15 % ) [ 26 ] .
" Wasted time " is not necessarily a bad thing , of course ; we all need some play and a little slack .
Furthermore , a good deal of problem solving happens while socializing with co-workers , spacing - out , etc .
However , there is something about the boss - employee relationship that can induce a sullen , adolescent resentment , an ongoing , unspoken slow - down strike consciously or unconsciously intended to make up for perceived injustices , such as being underpaid , overworked , underworked or forced to work on pointless projects .
This is not an ideal situation for either the boss or the employee .
Instead of withdrawing from a boring or unpleasant situation , which is the usual response , we might try paying closer attention , looking for any parts of the job that might engage our curiosity and interest .
We owe it to ourselves , and perhaps to our employers , to seek " right livelihood , " either by looking for meaningful work or by searching for the meaning within our current work .
Attention can add interest to even the most mundane job .
Those who manage to achieve a state of flow , working steadily during the day at projects for which they are well - suited , tend to be happier and less stressed than those who drag their heels and goof off at every opportunity .
If we can learn to relax our bodies and focus our minds while working , we may be able to achieve the same or better results with less struggle , less cursing at the computer , less setting the office on fire and shooting our co-workers .
Muscle tension does not increase our productivity ; it just causes burnout .
Mindfulness practice can help us relax and stay focused on our most important goals , gently bringing us back on - task when we get sidetracked by unimportant activities .
Reminders to Be Mindful
" No matter what is chosen as a reminder , our real work is to remember .
This remembering is called mindfulness . " [ 27 ]
As another way of assisting the quest for mindfulness , we might borrow the technique of " experience sampling , " which involves randomly sampling people 's activities to see how they actually spend their time in daily life .
Experience sampling was originally used by Csikszentmihalyi and Larson as a research tool [ 28 ] .
For example , it could be used to provide a more accurate measure of wasted time than that obtained when employees reconstruct their experiences from memory .
A modified version of this method can be employed as a tool to promote mindfulness .
For example , an occasional bell sound ( perhaps once or twice per hour ) could be used a cue to remind yourself to take a deep breath , relax , and adjust your posture .
When you hear the bell , you could ask yourself , " Am I working , relaxing , or killing time ?
Am I focused on a worthwhile task ? "
Aldous Huxley 's novel Island featured hundreds of parrots that repeated the word " Attention , " reminding the inhabitants to pay attention to the present moment [ 30 ] .
Over time , we may habituate to such reminders , or they may even become new distractions , but reminders can be useful if we take the effort to seek out small moments of mindfulness .
An article called " Mindfulness and Mastery in the Workplace " offered an excellent list of 21 ways to reduce stress during the workday [ 27 ] .
It provided suggestions such as :
Use everyday cues in your environment ( such as the telephone ringing ) as reminders to " center " yourself .
Stop for one to three minutes every hour during the workday to become aware of your breathing and bodily sensations , allowing the mind to settle in and regroup / recoup .
Use your breaks to truly relax rather than simply " pausing . "
ChatterBlocker
ChatterBlocker™ is a personal computer application intended to reduce distraction from unwanted speech .
It offers a variety of speech - masking nature sounds , vocal sounds and music , which can be played individually or in any combination .
It also includes mindfulness meditation tracks of various lengths :
A " listening meditation " intended to desensitize you to office noise by helping you minimize judgments and emotional reactions that can be more distracting and stressful than the noise itself
A " breathing meditation " intended to enhance focus and concentration by teaching you to bring your mind back to your breathing each time it wanders or is distracted by office noise
A meditation on work and distraction
While the speech - masking sounds help block out distractions , the guided meditations are meant to help you minimize your distractibility .
By practicing selective attention , you learn to focus on the " sound " of your own thoughts within a chaotic environment , without being disturbed by internal or external chatter .
Ultimately , the goal is to help workers achieve a state of flow by getting totally absorbed in their work , which can be a type of meditation in itself .
The application also includes bell sounds that repeat at various intervals , such as once per hour .
Workers can use these sounds in various ways ; for example , the bell could be a reminder to
take a deep breath and relax , without necessarily dropping whatever else you 're doing
sit in a more ergonomic posture
practice mindfulness
ask yourself if what you 're doing is useful — are you in a state of flow ?
Conclusion
Office noise , particularly extraneous conversation , is a common cause of stress and distraction in the workplace .
Sometimes it is possible to address the problem at the source or mask the unwanted speech with other sounds .
However , we may also want to consider ways of tuning out the noise or minimizing our reaction to it , since our emotional response can be even more distracting than the original sound .
The practice of mindfulness can help increase concentration and reduce stress .
An organized course , such as the Mindfulness - Based Stress Reduction classes taught in many hospitals and medical centers , can be an excellent way to make mindfulness part of your daily life .
Guided meditations like those included in ChatterBlocker can serve as an introduction to meditation or a way of integrating mindfulness practice into your workday .

Rebecca Riley is the 4 year old who died of psychiatric drug overdose -- she was on 3 of them -- supposedly with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder .
If you want the scoop from a psychiatric perspective , you should read this post from the resident blogger ( no pun intended ) at intueri .
But I 'll add two things .
Let me be very clear : it is not unlikely a 4 year old has bipolar -- it is absolutely impossible .
This is because bipolar disorder is not a specific disease with specific pathology that one can have or not have ; it is a description of symptoms that fall together .
We decide to call a group of behaviors bipolar disorder -- and meds can help them , for sure -- but this decision is completely dependent on the context of the symptoms .
Being four necessarily removes you from the appropriate context , in the same way as having bipolar symptoms during , say , a war , also excludes you from the context .
You might still have bipolar , but you can't use those symptoms during the battle as indicative of it .
If I transplant you to Brazil , and you can't read Portugese , does that make you an idiot ?
I do n't mean that 4 year olds can't have psychiatric symptoms .
I 'm saying you must be more thorough , more attentive to the environment .
As soon as a person -- a kid-- is given a diagnosis , it automatically opens the flood gates for bad practice that is thought to be evidence based .
That 's what makes the diagnosis so dangerous .
Instead of , " should I use Depakote in this kid ? " it becomes " It 's bipolar , so therefore I can use Depakote . "
Secondly , we must all stop saying these drugs are not indicated for kids .
That 's meaningless .
We can debate whether they should be used or not in kids , but you can't say they should n't be used because they 're not indicated .
To quote myself ( lo , the narcissism ) :
Thus , categorizing a medication based on an arbitrary selection of invented indications to pursue — and then restricting its use elsewhere — may not only be bad practice , it may be outright immoral .
I do not make the accusation lightly .
Consider the problem of antipsychotics for children .
It is an indisputable fact that some kids respond to antipsychotics .
They are not indicated in kids .
But do n’t think for a minute there will be any new antipsychotics indicated for kids .
Who , exactly , will pursue the two double blind , placebo controlled studies necessary to get the indication ?
No drug company would ever assume the massive risk of such a study -- let alone two -- in kids .
And which parents will permit their child in an experimental protocol of a “ toxic ” antipsychotic ?
Rich parents ?
No way .
The burden of testing will be undoubtedly born by the poor — and thus will come the social and racial implications of testing on poor minorities .
Pharma is loathed by the public and doctors alike , and the market for the drugs in kids is ( let ’s face it ) is effectively already penetrated .
There will not be any new pediatric indications for psych meds .
Not in this climate .
Think this hurts Pharma ?
It 's the kids that suffer .
It 's funny how psychiatry always tries to appeal to a higher authority ( FDA , " studies " , clinical guidelines , thought leaders , etc ) except when it gets in trouble .
And then it 's always the same refrain : " no one can tell me how to practice medicine . "
After posting the list of things that Christians do in church that annoy me , here is something slightly different .
I should say that not all Christians do all these things .
And not all the items are positive .
But atheists could learn a lesson from Christians regarding some of these …
Doing charity work .
( I ’m not saying atheists do n’t do it .
Of course we do .
But Christians do it more frequently and they are much more visible in this realm , even if we exclude the proselytizing missionaries .
Most atheist groups rarely do this work on a consistent basis .
Some do .
That ’s great .
Let ’s do more of it . )
Giving money .
( Sometimes , it ’s the “ required ” tithe .
But often , it ’s more .
Christians give back to the community they love .
It ’s a part of their budget .
Many atheists might pay their organizations ’ membership dues , but they do very little else to support them .
Even college students can afford to give a donation of $ 5 / month to a secular group .
And adults can do more .
But it ’s frustrating to have to pull teeth to get them to do it . )
Getting their base fired up about elections , social issues , etc .
( Atheists have differing opinions on many issues , so it ’s not easy to get them to vote in a bloc , but even when we have a need to be politically motivated about something , I just do n’t see the drive and sense of urgency to take action that I see from Christian groups .
We spend too much time arguing about the details .
As a result , we forget the big picture . )
Welcoming those who are new to the fold .
( They have the swag , the pastor ’s welcome , possibly a dinner with church leaders , books , etc. Oh .
They have Heaven , too .
When I joined American Atheists and the ACLU , I got a wallet - sized membership card from both .
And nothing from my local chapters . )
Marketing .
( I got a nifty - looking postcard from a local church telling me about its upcoming sermons : I was ready to go until I saw that I disagreed with everything they were talking about– that ’s how enticing this postcard was .
Christian conferences get several thousand attendees .
Yes , these churches and Christian organizations have both the money and the numbers , but if they want you to know about something , they ’ll find a way to get the information out .
Quick :
How many atheists have heard of Christianity Today ?
Now , how many non-atheists have heard of Free Inquiry ? )
Getting the media to cover them .
( It does n’t matter if it ’s a local church cleaning a sidewalk or a pastor making a statement on a particular issue .
The newspapers and news programs will be covering it .
We had thousands of atheists marching in Washington a few years ago .
If you ’re religious , did you hear about it ?
Hell , I ’m guessing many atheists had n’t heard about it , either .
The lack of coverage was embarrassing .
If we were a group of evangelicals , though , you can bet the media would have been there . )
Public speaking .
( Those pastors can get you excited about anything .
But listening to lectures by prominent atheists just does n’t get you fired up .
Here : Watch Sam Harris speak .
And then watch Random - Pastor - I - Found - On- YouTube .
Forget the words for a second .
Who gets you more pumped up ?
I ’m not talking about content– atheists are great at content .
But if we had atheists saying the words of Sam Harris with the energy level of Random - Pastor , we might get somewhere . )
Spreading disinformation .
( Intelligent Design is not science .
Abstinence - only sex education has not stopped teens from having sex and has left them with more problems than before , Terri Schiavo was not responsive , and atheists were never declaring a “ War on Christmas ” – not until it became satirical to do so . )
Setting the language we use .
( George Lakoff can attest to this .
Which do you hear more often : Anti-choice or pro-life ?
“ Teach Intelligent Design ” or “ Teach the controversy ” ?
When did “ family values ” come to mean “ Christian values ” ? )
Eating their words .
( Pat Robertson .
Jerry Falwell .
Need I say more ? )

Bush today told Ed Henry of CNN , as I noted in the post below , that he has no idea if the senior levels of the Iranian government know anything about supposed weapons being supplied to insurgents in Iraq .
Bush today :
We know the Quds Force is part of the Iranian government .
I do n't think we know who picked up the phone and said ' the Quds Force go do this , ' we know it 's a vital part of the Iranian government .
At issue was a weekend briefing in Baghdad at which three senior U.S. military officials said that the ' ' highest levels ' ' of the Iranian government had ordered the smuggling into Iraq of high - tech roadside bombs that have been killing American soldiers .
The problem is , this outright contradicts what Bush 's own " senior military " advisers told the American media just three days ago .
They said they knew quite well who told the Quds force to " do this .
" Highest levels .
When in fact , during today 's press conference , Bush had no idea if the highest levels in the Iranian government knew or directed the weapons infiltration , and he outright admitted it .
So , congrats to CNN's Ed Henry - the only journalist to actually do his job during the press conference and catch Bush in an outright lie .
Virus writers have created a spyware package that poses as an extension to the Firefox web browser .
FormSpy , which poses as the legitimate NumberedLinks 0.9 extension , is programmed to steal confidential information from compromised machines including passwords , credit card numbers , and ebanking login details .
The malware is also capable of sniffing passwords from ICQ , FTP , and email traffic before sending this data to a hacker - controlled website .
FormSpy is normally downloaded onto compromised machines already infected with another Trojan program , called Downloader - AXM .
It can also spread as a drive - by download from compromised websites .
Downloader - AXM began spreading via virus infected spam messages ( example here ) earlier this week .
Fortunately , the attack is not yet widespread , according to net security firm McAfee , which has published a detailed write - up of the threat here . ®

I 'm sure I 'm not the only person here who finds Ashton Kutcher extremely annoying ( and his show , Punk'd ) but it 's interesting how many failures the show has had and how much hot water Ashton has gotten into because of them .
Read on !
Failed Pranks
Not Yet Aired on MTV / Stars Denied Broadcasting Rights
* In December 2003 , Kutcher attempted to " punk " WWE wrestlerby having him think a truck had run over his prized motorcycle , when really it was a replica , but the stunt went wrong when the truck clearly missed the bike .
Goldberg quickly realized what was going on , and asked " Who do I have to kill ? " .
Kutcher then revealed himself , as the joke had failed . *
In June 2005 , Kutcher failed to punk self - proclaimed King of Crunk .
He was boarding a plane headed for Las Vegas , but Kutcher had actors playing customs agents tell him that he was actually headed for Ecuador .
Lil Jon quickly identified members of the " customs agents " from previous episodes of the program , and asked for Kutcher to reveal himself . *
According to Kutcher himself , he failed to punktwice until he finally succeeded on his third try in season 6 .* According toin the March 3 , 2006 People magazine , Ashton grew frustrated because he failed to fool Cannon about 4 times , with last attempt involving a man pretending to be trapped in a gas station .
Cannon saw through the joke because he noticed the cameras and was not convinced by the actor 's performance .
- Claimed in an interview that they were punk'd , noticed the ' cops ' were n't real and got into a fight because they suspected them of being out to rob them -
They noticed that Ashton Kutcher was behind this harassment - Denied Punk 'd broadcasting rights .
JoJo did not sign the release form to air her episode because she did n't want her young fans to see her swearing -
Some people said that she was punk'd by Kutcher or his crew members - MTV forgot to air her on Season 4 - Claimed he was punk'd by Ryan Cabrera , who staged a national public radio show offering him 100 million dollars to pose nude in Playgirl - Denied Punk 'd broadcasting rights - Denied Punk 'd broadcasting rights .
According to Norton , she will sue Kutcher if the prank is aired - Denied Punk 'd broadcasting rights - MTV forgot to air him on season 6 - They noticed the cameras - Denied Punk 'd broadcasting rights , although he thought it was a good idea - Denied Punk 'd broadcasting rights .

Being a web developer is n’t always exciting .
There are lots of tedious things you end up doing over and over again : writing code to talk to a database , writing code to handle page templating , writing an administrative interface …
Sooner or later you start to wish someone would just come along and wrap up all that repetitive code in nice , integrated , reusable packages , right ?
Well , today ’s your lucky day , because someone finally has .
Say hello to Django .
In this article , I ’ll be walking through the process of creating a simple application — a to - do list — with Django ; this tutorial will only cover a small portion of what Django can do for you , but it ’ll be a good start and ( hopefully ) enough to whet your appetite for more .
An Integrated Web Framework
In a nutshell , Django is a rapid web development framework .
Like a number of other frameworks that have been making news recently ( for example , Ruby on Rails ) , Django is designed to take care of tedious and repetitive tasks for you , freeing you up to write interesting code again .
However , unlike most of the other frameworks , Django goes a few steps further and tries to provide generic building blocks that you can stick together to accomplish common tasks ( like building administrative interfaces or RSS feeds ) .
Everyone who works to develop Django also uses the framework , so anything it can do to make our jobs easier is a candidate for inclusion .
Django started life at the Lawrence Journal - World , a newspaper which serves a small town in northeastern Kansas , growing from the need to develop full - featured web applications to meet newsroom deadlines .
The Journal - World released Django under an open - source license in July 2005 , after it had been under development , and in use , at the paper for a couple of years .
Django is written in Python , a modern , object - oriented programming language ; that means that the applications you write with Django will be in Python , too .

Python : the Five - minute Tour
If you ’re used to languages like PHP or Perl , Python might look a little strange to you , but once you get to know it , it ’ll be like a breath of fresh air .
There are two big things you ’ll notice when you start using Python for the first time .
First , there are n’t any curly brackets marking blocks of code ; you ’ll more than likely indent your code inside functions , for loops , if statements and such regardless of which language you use , so Python relies on this indentation to tell it where those blocks of code begin and end .
Second , the core Python language is deliberately kept small and lightweight , with functions that might be built into the core of other languages ( for example : regular expressions ) instead supplied in " modules " that you can import into your programs .
Python comes with a solid set of standard modules to cover a programmer ’s most common needs .
If you ’re new to Python , it ’d probably be a good idea to read through the official tutorial to get a feel for the basics of the language .
The official documentation for Python also includes a complete listing of all the standard modules and explanations of how to use them , so browse through that list to see what Python can do out - of - the - box .
Getting Django
Since it ’s written in Python , Django requires you to have Python installed before you can use it .
If you ’re on Mac OS X or Linux , you probably already have Python installed , but if you ’re on Windows or if ( for some strange reason )
Python was n’t preinstalled on your computer , you can download it from python.org .
As I write this article , the latest version of Python is 2.4.3 , but version 2.5 should be released any day now ; there should n’t be any incompatibilities between the two versions , but if you ’re going to install Python , it ’s probably safest to stick with version 2.4.3 until any bugs in 2.5 have been ironed out .
The only version restriction that Django imposes is a requirement that you use Python 2.3 or higher .
Once you have Python , the official Django install documentation will step you through the process of downloading and installing Django .
As part of this process , you ’ll need to download and install a Python database adapter module for the database you ’ll be using .
I ’ll be using MySQL in this article ; you can download the adapter ( a module called mysqldb ) directly from SourceForge ( at the time of publication , this package will not work with Python 2.5 ; you ’ll have to use Python 2.4.3 until the SourceForge project is updated ) .
Windows users should just grab the .exe version , Mac users can grab a pre-built Mac installer package from the PythonMac site , and Linux users should be able to get a pre-built package from their Linux distributor , or manually build the module using the .tar.gz download from SourceForge .
If you ’d prefer to use a different database , the Django installation documentation has links to download the adapter modules for PostgreSQL and SQLite , which are the two other databases Django officially supports ( support for Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server is in development , but at this point is still experimental ) .
Once you ’ve got Python installed , you ’ll need to get set up Django itself .
The official Django documentation provides good instructions for Linux and Mac users , but Windows users will have to adapt the directions slightly :
In order to open the Django tarball , use a program such as WinZip instead of tar .
You ’ll need to add C : Python24 to the PATH environment variable .
You can do this either through the My Computer Properties dialog , or by entering the following at the command line :
SET PATH=%PATH %;C: Python24
Of course , this command will only affect the current command line , so you ’ll have to retype it every time you work with Django .
Your best bet is to set the PATH variable once and for all in My Computer Properties .
There ’s no equivalent to sudo in Windows .
To set up Django , enter the following commands :
cd path - to - django
setup.py install
After setting up Django , add the django / bin directory to the PATH environment variable .
Again , you can do this once through the My Computer Properties dialog , or each time you work with Django by entering the following at the command line :
SET PATH=%PATH %;path-to-djangodjangobin
Diving In
Let ’s explore Django by writing a simple application .
" Getting things done " is a popular mantra these days , so we ’ll build an easy tool to help with that : a to - do list manager .
Now that you ’ve got Django installed , simply open up a command line , navigate to the directory in which you want to keep your code , and type this command :
django - admin.py startproject gtd
That will start a new Django " project " for you ; Django draws a distinction between an " application , " which usually provides a specific set of features , and a " project , " which is usually a collection of different applications working together on the same web site .
Running the startproject command will automatically create a new directory with the name gtd , and place a few files inside it : a blank file called __init__.py , which tells Python that the directory is a Python module ; a Python script called manage .py , which contains some utilities for working with your project ; a settings file called settings.py ; and a URL configuration file called urls.py .
At this point , you can test that everything was set up properly by typing this command ( run this from a command line , inside the " gtd " directory ) :
manage .py runserver
Django includes a lightweight web server for testing purposes , so you do n’t have to set up Apache just to work on your project .
The command manage .py runserver will start it up .
By default , the built - in server runs on port 8000 , so you should be able to type http://127.0.0.1:8000 into your browser and see a nice page telling you that Django is working .
To stop the built - in server , press Ctrl + Break on Windows , or Ctrl +C on Mac OS X or Linux .
Now that we know Django is set up properly , we can start working on our to - do list application .
Type this command :
manage .py startapp todo
This will create a directory called todo , and automatically drop in a few files for you : __init__.py , again to tell Python that the directory is a Python module ; and two files for application code : models.py and views.py .
Writing Models
One of the more tedious parts of web development is laying out all the database tables you ’ll need , figuring out which types of columns you ’ll want , and working out how to get data into and out of them .
Django solves these problems by letting you define " models . "
Django ’s models are just Python classes that inherit from Django ’s own base Model class , and they let you specify all the attributes of a particular type of object in code .
The Model class knows how to translate its properties into values for storage in the database , so most of the time you do n’t have to think about that — you just interact with the objects as you would in any other object - oriented language .
For this application , we ’ll need two models : one representing a list , and one representing an item in a list .
In database terms , these models will end up being two tables : one for lists , and one for the items in those lists .
Each of the list items will have a foreign key that specifies the list to which it belongs .
Let ’s start with the model for the list .
Open up the models .
py file that Django created for you , and below the line that says " Create your models here , " add this code :
class List ( models .
Model ) :
title = models .CharField( maxlength=250 , unique=True )
def __str__(self ) :
return self .
title
class Meta :
ordering = [ ' title ' ]
class Admin :
pass
In a moment , when we tell Django to create our database tables , the above will translate into a table called list , with two columns :
An integer primary key column called id ( Django generates this automatically for you ; you do n’t have to specify it explicitly ) .
( Django generates this automatically for you ; you do n’t have to specify it explicitly ) .
A 250 - character - wide VARCHAR column called title .
Additionally , a UNIQUE constraint will be created on this column , ensuring that we ca n’t create two to - do lists with the same title .
You ’ll notice there ’s also a method in the class called __str__ .
This method is just like toString in Java or .NET — whenever Python needs to show a string representation of an object , it calls that object ’s __str__ method .
The one we ’ve defined here will return the to - do list ’s title , which is probably the most useful way to represent it as a string .
The class Meta part allows us to set options that will tell Django how we want the model to behave .
We can set a lot of options here , but for now we ’ll just let Django know we want our lists to be ordered by their titles .
When Django queries the database for to - do lists , it will order them by the title column .
The class Admin bit allows us to set options for Django ’s automatic administrative interface , which we ’ll see later .
The pass keyword tells Django to just use its defaults .
Now let ’s write the model for the items in the to - do lists .
It looks like this :
import datetime
PRIORITY_CHOICES = (
( 1 , ' Low ' ) ,
( 2 , ' Normal ' ) ,
( 3 , ' High ' ) ,
)
class Item ( models .
Model ) :
title = models .CharField( maxlength=250 )
created_date = models.DateTimeField(default=datetime.datetime.now )
priority = models .
IntegerField(choices=PRIORITY_CHOICES , default=2 )
completed = models.BooleanField(default=False )
todo_list = models .ForeignKey( List )
def __str__(self ) :
return self .
title
class Meta :
ordering = [ ' - priority ' , ' title ' ]
class Admin :
pass
This model is a little more complicated , but should be easy enough to understand .
There are a couple of neat tricks we ’re using here that deserve a quick mention , though .
The item ’s priority will be stored in the database as an integer , but using the choices argument and passing it the PRIORITY_CHOICES list tells Django to only allow the values we ’ve specified in PRIORITY_CHOICES .
The PRIORITY_CHOICES list also lets us specify human - readable names that correspond to each value , and Django will take advantage of those for displaying HTML forms .
created_date will be a DATETIME column in the database , and datetime .
datetime.now is a standard Python function which , as its name implies , returns the current date and time .
To use this function , we need to include the line import datetime before the model ’s definition .
We ’ve specified that list items should be ordered by two columns : priority and title .
The - in front of priority tells Django to use descending order for the priority column , so Django will include ORDER BY priority DESC title ASC in its queries whenever it deals with list items .
Now that our models are completed , it ’s time to get Django to create database tables based on them .
In Django parlance , this is called installing the models .
Installing the Models
The first step in installing our models is to tell Django which database we ’re using , and that we want the models we just created to be installed .
To do this , open up the settings .py file in your project directory , and change these settings .
DATABASE_ENGINE
should be changed to whatever type of database you 're going to use .
As I mentioned earlier , I 'm using MySQL as I write this , so I 'll change the setting like so :
DATABASE_ENGINE = " mysql "
DATABASE_NAME should be changed to the name of the actual database you 're using :
DATABASE_NAME = " djangotest "
Make sure that this database exists !
If you choose to use SQLite , Django can automatically create a database file for you , but that ’s not possible with MySQL and PostgreSQL .
DATABASE_USER and DATABASE_PASSWORD should be changed to the username and password of a user who has full access to the database .
For example : GA_googleFillSlot ( " Articles_6_300x250 " ) ;
DATABASE_USER = ' django '
DATABASE_PASSWORD = ' swordfish '
If you ’re using SQLite , these settings do n’t need to be filled in , as SQLite does n’t have a user / password system .
If your MySQL database is hosted on a separate machine , you ’ll have to set DATABASE_HOST .
If MySQL is running on the same server , you can leave this empty .
If MySQL is not set up to listen to its default port , you ’ll need to set DATABASE_PORT to MySQL ’s port number .
Down toward the bottom of the settings file is a list called INSTALLED_APPS , which lists all the applications you ’re using .
By default , several of the applications bundled with Django will be listed here .
Add gtd.todo to the list like so :
INSTALLED_APPS = (
' django.contrib.auth ' ,
' django.contrib.contenttypes ' ,
' django.contrib.sessions ' ,
' django.contrib.sites ' ,
' gtd.todo ' ,
)
Once these settings are changed and saved , type this command in the gtd directory :
manage .py syncdb
You ’ll see some output scroll past as Django sets up the database tables .
It will also prompt you to create a " superuser " ; Django ’s authentication system is installed by default , and creating a superuser account at this point means you ’ll be able to log in to Django ’s automatic administrative interface when we set that up .
Go ahead and create a superuser now .
Automatic Administration
At this point , we could write our own code to interact with the models we ’ve set up , but Django provides a free , built - in administrative application that lets us start playing with the data immediately .
To use it , you only need to do a couple of things :
In the settings.py file , add django.contrib.admin to the list INSTALLED_APPS .
file , add to the list .
In the project ’s urls .
py file , locate the line that says " uncomment this for admin " , then remove the # from the start of the following line of Python code to uncomment it .
Run manage .py syncdb again , and the administrative interface will be installed .
Now start up the testing server again ( by running manage .
py runserver ) and load http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
in your browser , which should show you a login screen .
Log in with the username and password you specified for your superuser , and you ’ll find yourself in Django ’s admin interface .
The main page of the admin system shows a list of installed models , classified by the application of which they ’re part .
If you click on one of the models , you ’ll see a list of objects for that model .
From this page , you can also change existing objects or add new ones .
Let ’s create a to - do list .
On the main admin page , click the " Add " link next to " Lists " .
Fill in any value you like for the list ’s title , then save it .
Go back to the main admin page , click the " Add " link next to " Items , " and fill in the details for your list ’s first item .
Each item has to be related to a to - do list , and Django will automatically create a drop - down menu that shows all the to - do lists that have been created so far .
This is a pretty nice interface to have — especially considering how little work was involved in setting it up — but this is just the default admin interface that Django provides .
There are a ton of options ( all covered in Django ’s official documentation ) you that can tweak in order to have the admin interface behave the way you want , and you never have to " rebuild " or re-generate any files to use them — the admin interface is generated on the fly , and changes you make to the configuration can take effect immediately .
If you ’d like to learn more about customizing this admin interface , check out the official documentation — this documentation includes details of how you can enable a very nice edit - in - place feature , which you could use to edit many list items in a single page .
Delving into Views
Now that we have a nice little admin interface , let ’s talk about views .
As nice as the admin interface is , you ’re probably always going to need at least a couple of additional pages to get your data to appear exactly as you want it to .
Views are the functions that generate these pages in your application .
For example , one thing that would be nice to have in this application is a page that shows all of our to - do lists , along with the percentage of items in those lists that have been completed .
It would be sort of a " status report " that we could check in on every once in a while .
So let ’s write a view that gives us this status report .
Django views are , for the most part , just ordinary Python functions .
The URL configuration file ( urls.py ) decides which URL goes to which view ; Django then calls the correct view function , passing it the incoming HTTP request as an argument .
Here ’s the code for our " status report " view ; it should go into the views .
py file in the todo directory :
from django.
shortcuts import render_to_response
from gtd.todo.models import List
def status_report ( request ) :
todo_listing = [ ]
for todo_list in List.objects.all ( ) :
todo_dict = {}
todo_dict [' list_object ' ] = todo_list
todo_dict [ 'item_count ' ] = todo_list.item_set.count ( )
todo_dict ['items_complete ' ] = todo_list.item_set.filter(completed=True ).count ( )
todo_dict ['percent_complete ' ] = int ( float ( todo_dict [ 'items_complete ' ] ) / todo_dict [ ' item_count ' ]
* 100 )
todo_listing.append(todo_dict )
return render_to_response('status_report.html ' , { ' todo_listing ' : todo_listing })
As Python functions go , this one ’s pretty simple , but it does show off a few of the nice things that Django can do :
List.objects.all , as you might guess , is a method that returns all of our to - do lists so that we can loop through them .
Django will figure out the correct SQL and execute it for you automatically .
, as you might guess , is a method that returns all of our to - do lists so that we can loop through them .
Django will figure out the correct SQL and execute it for you automatically .
Each to - do list has an item_set property , which represents the list ’s items .
We can use the item_set . all method to get all of the items in the list , or we could use the item_set .
filter method to get only a certain subset of the items in the list .
We could also use List.objects .
filter to get only the to - do lists that match a certain set of criteria .
property , which represents the list ’s items .
We can use the method to get all of the items in the list , or we could use the method to get only a certain subset of the items in the list .
We could also use to get only the to - do lists that match a certain set of criteria .
The function render_to_response handles the business of returning an actual web page .
It takes the name of a template to use ( more on that in a moment ) , and a dictionary ( " dictionary " is Python ’s name for an associative array ) of variables and values to which the template should have access , and takes care of rendering the template and sending an HTTP response .
The actual logic involved here is n’t very complex ; we ’re building a list called todo_listing , and each item in it will be a dictionary that contains information about one of the to - do lists .
The only really complex part of that is figuring out the percentage of items completed .
You ’ll notice that it does a little bit of typecasting .
That ’s needed because , by default , Python does " integer division " when both of the numbers are integers — integer division always returns an integer .
But we want a decimal number that we can convert into a percentage , so I ’ve explicitly coerced the number of completed items to a floating - point number .
Writing the Template
We ’ve told the view to use a template called status_report .
html , but we have n’t created that yet .
Luckily , creating templates for Django is incredibly easy .
In the todo directory , create a new directory called templates , and in it , create the file status_report. html .
Here ’s the code for the template :
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN " " https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd " >
< html xmlns= " https://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " >
< head >
< meta http -equiv= " Content - Type " content = " text / html ; charset=utf - 8 " />
< title > To - do List Status Report </ title >
</head >
< body >
< h1 > To - do list status report</ h1 >
{ % for list_dict in todo_listing %}
< h2 >{{ list_dict.list_object.title }}</h2 >
< ul >
< li>Number of items : {{ list_dict.item_count }}</li>
< li>Number completed : {{ list_dict.items_complete }} ( { { list_dict.percent_complete }}%)</li>
</ul >
{ % endfor %}
</ body >
</html >
For the most part , Django templates look like HTML with just a couple extra things mixed in .
There are " template tags , " which let you perform some rudimentary logic in the template , and there are variables , which will automatically be filled with values passed in to render_to_response .
Tags start with { % and end with %} , while variables start with {{ and end with }} .
In this particular template , we ’re using two tags : { % for list_dict in todo_listing %} and { % endfor %} .
These tags tell the Django template system that we want to loop through each item in this list and do something with it .
When we ’re done with the code in the loop , we use the { % endfor %} tag to say so .
Within the loop , we retrieve the values we set in the view in order to display the to - do list ’s title , the number of items in the list , and so on .
Making it Work
Now that we have our view and template , we just have to give Django a couple pieces of information and it ’ll all work !
First , we need to tell Django where we ’re storing the templates for our application ; this is controlled by the TEMPLATE_DIRS setting in the settings .py file .
Just go in and add a line with the path to the location at which you put the " status_report.html " template .
In my case , I added this :
' / Users/jbennett/django-projects/gtd/todo/templates ' ,
It ’s important to put the comma on the end of this line .
Once that ’s done , we just need to set up a URL for our view , which we do in the urls .
py file .
Immediately below the line you un-commented earlier for the admin interface ’s URLs , add this line :
( r' ^report / $ ' , ' gtd.todo.views.status_report ' ) ,
Again , the comma is important .
Now , start up the testing server ( manage.py runserver ) , and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/report/ .
You should see something like this :
Django ’s URL configuration is pretty simple ; each line in the urls .
py file has at least two things in it :
a regular expression that specifies the URL or URLs to match
the view function to use on URLs matching that regular expression , or a call to include , which can pull in other lists of URLs ( the admin interface , for example , has its own urls .
py file , and just uses include to tell Django to use that file for any URL that starts with admin )
Where to Go from Here
So far we ’ve written around fifty or sixty lines of code , and we ’ve got the beginnings of a pretty nice little to - do application :
We have database tables set up to store the to - do lists and their items .
We have a nice administrative interface for creating and managing the lists .
We have a quick " status report " page that tells us how we ’re progressing on each list ’s items .
That ’s not bad at all , but it barely scratches the surface of what Django can do ; there ’s a ton of features rolled into Django already , and more are under development .
Here are some of the highlights :
a full - featured database API
a built - in authentication and permissions system for user accounts
" Generic views , " which save you from having to write code for common things like date - based content archives
a built - in cache system to help you squeeze every possible ounce of performance out of Django
an internationalization system to make it easy to translate your application ’s interface into other languages
easy , automatic generation of RSS feeds and Google sitemaps
easy serialization of data to XML or JSON , for easy use with AJAX
plus a whole lot more

The bug allows attackers to take over Windows machines
In particular it warned about one bug fixed in the latest batch of security updates that , if exploited , could put a PC under the control of an attacker .
Microsoft 's recent update fixed 23 flaws found in Windows software .
Many of these bugs are known to malicious hackers and some are already actively exploited on the net .
Fast fix
Microsoft typically issues security updates for Windows and its associated programs on the second Tuesday of every month .
In the August update , seven of the fixes were rated as " critical " - the highest rating .
The DHS was most concerned about the flaw identified in the MS06 - 040 security report .
This identified a problem with the Windows server service that allows attackers to take over machines without users doing anything to help .
A worm written to exploit this bug " could enable an attacker to remotely take control of an affected system and install programs , view , change , or delete data , and create new accounts with full user rights , " said the DHS in a statement .
As well as overseeing efforts to combat terrorism the DHS also has a role in cybersecurity .
It said it expected the bug to be exploited within 24 hours of its existence becoming known .
Microsoft reported via its security blog that it had already seen a " limited " attack using this bug .
It also said that there had been more than 100 million downloads of the MS06 - 040 fix since it was made available .
The server service bug is found in Windows 2000 , XP and Windows Server 2003 .
The vulnerabilities fixed by other patches are found in a variety of Windows programs including the Office software suite and the Internet Explorer browser .
One bug being patched is found in Microsoft 's PowerPoint presentation software and an exploit code is known to be circulating online .
Security experts said 11 other flaws were known to malicious hacking groups .
Users can get hold of the fixes via the Windows Update site or by using the update tool on Windows .
I ’m happy to finally be able to let the cat out of the bag .
Darron Schall and myself have been working on a low level 6502/ 6510 emulator and , based on that , on a Commodore C64 emulator / simulator .
The emulator is completely written in Actionscript 3 and runs on Flash Player 9 .
It loads the original binary C64 Kernel ROMs at runtime , and executes them just like the original hardware would do .
The sources are released under GPL , get them here :

Quoting Darrons blog post from today :
I have voicemail , and I hate it .
No , I 'm not aiming for that easy target - how dire it is to be directed when you call to a robot voice that does n't care if you leave a message or not .
I mean picking up voicemail .
Every day that I come in to find the red light on my office phone flashing is another day that the lost messages in there will go unlistened to .
That 's right - I do n't listen to the voices .
How ridiculous has the cult of voicemail become , that writing a sentence like that is frowned on , rather than applauded as a sign of good mental health ?
Leaving voicemail is such a spectacularly inefficient way of getting in touch with people .
I have a mobile phone and the number 's no secret .
But some companies prefer to ring an office number .
OK , fine , but when I 'm not out , it really would save us all a lot of time to just ring me on the phone that I carry around with me , rather than a number I attend only periodically .
I used to try to discourage people from leaving voicemails by having a message that said : " Please do n't leave messages here ; instead , send me an email . "
Hearing it , people would ring off and send an email .
But the voicemail treated the ringoff as " a message " lasting 10 seconds , so when I came to check my voicemail there were lots of pauses , followed by the announcement " End of message .
To hear the message again ... "
This was slightly annoying the first time .
But after a few hundred times ( say , following a two - week holiday before which you might have changed the message to say " I 'm away for two weeks - please do n't leave a message " ) , I was ready to kill the programmers .
Especially because while deleting all the non-messages , someone would always ring in ; and while we spoke , someone else would ring in , go to voicemail , and leave a message at the end of all those dead air clicks .
And while I tried to delete those to reach the new message , someone else would ring ...
That 's the real killer about voicemail : it takes much longer to deal with the voicemail than the original message .
People ramble .
They say their phone number veryquicklyindeedinonebreath .
They mumble .
They use phones that seem to be located underwater .
It 's all wasted time .
Most maddening of all , though , are the beautifully spoken ones that take three minutes of introduction and then say , " It 's about an email I sent you . "
Good grief .
One thing I do is read emails , even if only the subject line .
Some people hate to take silence as an answer .
Is it really so impossible to write even an average speech - to - text converter ?
I 'd settle for anything at the moment .
But if you 've invented it , for God 's sake just email me .

Retail Secrets : Best Buy Wall Numbers
You ever noticed the big weird numbers on the wall at Best Buy ?
They 're usually just to the right of the exit , by the registers .
They 're yellow .
Of course they look like goofy price tags .
And they 're just up there on the wall , for everyone to see .
Some stores have only one or two sets of numbers , while some have quite a few .
And they look something like this :
Well , let me tell you — if you put numbers on a wall of your store , with no clear indication of what they mean , I will go insane and become obsessed with them .
It 's just how it works !
Seeking meaning , I started occasionally asking " so , uh , what are those numbers , anyway ? " when I checked out .
Usually , I got the shrug - and - sigh double - punch .
But sometimes , I got an interesting answer .
And , eventually , it came together , helped tremendously by a conveniently annotated store — as well as some serious Googling .
Thus , I present to you , dear reader , a Best Buy Wall Number display — annotated !
Let 's start at the top !
( Feel free to correct any of this if you actually work for Best Buy )
Shrink Percent : Ahh , shrink .
You probably call it " stealing " .
And this store is doing pretty good with handling it .
The shrink percentage is , presumably , the percentage of Best Buy merchandise that is simply prancing right out the door .
A shrink percentage of .50 % is ,
Shrink Payout : Keep shrink low , and the shrink payout increases !
Well , I have no idea how this shrink payout ( $ 469 ) is distributed to employees ( anyone know ? ) , but I 'd wager it winds up being a few extra dollars in your paycheck every now and then .
PRP Dollars :
That 's right : the dreaded product replacement plan , also known as the extended warranty nobody ever buys .
Or do they ?
On this day , they 've made a pretty impressive $ 77 ( of almost - all - profit ) on product replacement plans .
Wow .
PRP Percent :
That means that people bought the product replacement plan 2.22 % of the time .
Apparently , this is n't so good — the other store ( pictured above ) was rockin ' a mighty 10.50 % on the PRP .
Wow again .
EWSI : I like this one .
Extended Windows Sales Initiative ?
Enhanced Wireless Secure Internet ?
Nope , it 's better — Entertainment Weekly / Sports Illustrated !
That 's right , good old magazine subscriptions !
You know how Best Buy always
Apps : Simple .
Best Buy credit card applications .
Looks like three have been filled out and turned in so far .
MC Percent : Master Card .
Yes , every Best Buy card application includes surprise bonus offer for , uh , a Master Card .
Yeah , it 's two card applications in one , and this store has successfully up - sold the card 100 % of the three times .
AS Percent : Account Shield is another Best Buy card up - sell option .
Apparently a unemployment - protection feature that might generate
So that 's it !
The great , one - person - cared mystery has been solved .
The next time you 're at Best Buy , keep an eye out for these numbers — perhaps useless , perhaps interesting , but always telling , I hope they give you insight into your store , your neighborhood , or even America itself .
Although probably not .

DIGG THIS
Whenever some disaster resulting in massive property damage occurs , the media will always find some economist to quote who says that it 's really a blessing in disguise .
The devastation , he claims , will actually benefit the economy , because of all the economic activity necessary to rebuild and the jobs this creates .
When buildings are destroyed , construction workers and tradesmen get work , sellers of raw materials do brisk business , and all sorts of goods need to be manufactured in great quantities for people to resume their lives .
Earthquakes , Hurricane Katrina , violence in Iraq , war in general , and even the 9/11 terrorist attack have been said to have this upside .
This position is endorsed by many , including such luminaries as New York Times economics columnist Paul Krugman .
Other economists , and especially libertarians , have disputed this by saying that it is an example of Frdric Bastiat 's Broken Window Fallacy .
They argue that the productive energies channeled into rebuilding destroyed property could otherwise have been used elsewhere .
The labor and capital that are used to repair the damage left by disasters do not spring into existence from nowhere , they claim ; they are diverted from resources that would have been used for other goods and services .
Thus , they say , it is fallacious to claim that the destruction of wealth can make us wealthier
But it occurs to me that these critics are , perhaps , being too hasty .
Maybe opportunity costs are n't an issue in these situations .
Maybe mass destruction of property really does create prosperity .
Some fairly popular and respected economists have said so .
Therefore , using the best in modern economic science , I have devised a brilliant plan to stimulate the economy , create thousands of jobs , and bring prosperity for years to come , for my home state of Illinois and for the entire nation .
Let 's nuke Chicago !
Not with the people still there , obviously .
That would be inhumane .
No , we would of course evacuate everyone first .
Ideally , for maximum economic benefit , everyone would evacuate empty - handed and on foot or on mass transportation , leaving all cars and possessions behind .
The government can compensate them .
Once that 's done , the city and everything in it would be destroyed utterly .
If the economists the media always loves to quote are right , the result would be an economic bonanza like none we 've ever seen before .
Housing would have to be built for millions of displaced people .
Massive amounts of infrastructure would have to be restored .
People would need to replace billions of dollars worth of consumer goods .
The amount of spending and job creation would be staggering .
The plan allows for plenty customization according to the specific needs of the economy .
If rebuilding the entire city is too much to handle at once , we can fine - tune the amount of economic boost we receive by using a larger or smaller nuclear device , as necessary .
If the long - term health effects of radiation are a concern , a bombardment of fuel - air explosives can be substituted , though that would mean foregoing major benefits to the health care industry .
Further , this need not be a one - time event .
We have a huge stockpile of nuclear weapons , so we can continue our newfound prosperity indefinitely by frying another city whenever the economy needs another boost .
On a less grand scale , smaller acts of destruction can be carried out all over the country to keep demand up and keep the economy healthy .
Local governments could periodically tear up their roads and burn down their own government buildings , then rebuild them .
Houses could be bulldozed at random .
The government could pay bounties to people to break and replace their own possessions .
The possibilities for wealth creation are endless !
The precise details can be hashed out later .
I 'm a visionary man of ideas , not a technocrat .
Whatever the details , however , the plan is sound , unless there 's some basic point of economics that economists employed by the mainstream media keep missing .
But what are the odds of that ?

The diamonds above are real - but they are cultured diamonds that were produced in a laboratory , and might cost up to 75 % less than similar diamonds from the DeBeers diamond cartel , and some have fewer flaws than natural diamonds .
From today 's WSJ :
" The $ 143 billion jewelry business -- and the would - be fiancés , Valentines and lovers of bling that it caters to -- are facing a shakeup .
Lab - produced diamonds , once suitable only for industrial use , are being produced with color and clarity that match -- or exceed -- the quality of diamonds dug out of the earth .
These lab - made diamonds have begun trickling into retailers at prices below those for natural diamonds of similar size and sparkle .
The long - term threat to established diamond producers : that mined diamonds could suffer the same fate as naturally occurring pearls .
Cultured pearls , made when a small bead is inserted into a mollusk and grown , destroyed the natural pearl industry .
Cultured pearls now account for more than 95 % of all pearls sold globally , according to estimates by Gem World International , a research firm . "
Read the WSJ article

.
" The larger question is whether lab - grown diamonds will gain acceptance with consumers ..... "
Prediction : Given the general acceptance , by both men and women , of breast implants , is n't the general acceptance of " fake diamonds " probably inevitable ?
After all , would n't it be irrational behavior to accept synthetic , artificial breasts , but reject synthetic artifical diamonds ?

A prototype of a new hybrid battery , created at Brown University , that combines elements of a standard battery and a capacitor .
Credit : John Abromowski / Brown University
Brown University engineers have created a new battery that uses plastic , not metal , to conduct electrical current .
The hybrid device marries the power of a capacitor with the storage capacity of a battery .
A description of the prototype is published in Advanced Materials .
" Batteries have limits , " said Tayhas Palmore , an associate professor in Brown 's Division of Engineering .
" They have to be recharged .
They can be expensive .
Most of all , they do n't deliver a lot of power .
Another option is capacitors .
These components , found in electronic devices , can deliver that big blast of power .
But they do n't have much storage capacity .
So what if you combined elements of both a battery and a capacitor ? "
That 's the question Palmore set out to answer with Hyun - Kon Song , a former postdoctoral research associate at Brown who now works as a researcher at LG Chem , Ltd .
They began to experiment with a new energy - storage system using a substance called polypyrrole , a chemical compound that carries an electrical current .
Discovery and development of polypyrrole and other conductive polymers netted three scientists the 2000 Nobel Prize in Chemistry .
In their experiments , Palmore and Song took a thin strip of gold - coated plastic film and covered the tip with polypyrrole and a substance that alters its conductive properties .
The process was repeated , this time using another kind of conduction - altering chemical .
The result : Two strips with different polymer tips .
The plastic strips were then stuck together , separated by a papery membrane to prevent a short circuit .
The result is a hybrid .
Like a capacitor , the battery can be rapidly charged then discharged to deliver power .
Like a battery , it can store and deliver that charge over long periods of time .
During performance testing , the new battery performed like a hybrid , too .
It had twice the storage capacity of an electric double - layer capacitor .
And it delivered more than 100 times the power of a standard alkaline battery .
But Palmore said the new battery 's form , as well as its function , is exciting .
In width and height , it is smaller than an iPod Nano .
And it 's thinner , about as slim as an overhead transparency .
" You start thinking about this polymer and you start thinking that you can create batteries everywhere out of it , " Palmore said .
" You could wrap cell phones in it or electronic devices .
Conceivably , you could even make fabric out of this composite . "
Palmore said some performance problems – such as decreased storage capacity after repeated recharging – must be overcome before the device is marketable .
But she expects strong interest .
Battery makers are always looking for new ways to more efficiently store and deliver power .
NASA and the U.S. Air Force are also exploring polymer - based batteries .
" What we 've got is a good concept , " Palmore said .
" Put electroactive molecules into conducting polymers and you can come up with all sorts of interesting materials that store energy . "

We ’ve all been there : the pivotal meeting in which you push forward a new idea or proposal you ’re passionate about .
A fast - paced discussion leads to an upwelling of support that seems about to reach critical mass .
And then in one disastrous moment , your hopes are dashed when someone weighs in with those fateful words : “ Let me just play devil ’s advocate for a minute .
. . . ”

Having invoked the awesome protective power of that seemingly innocuous phrase , the speaker now feels entirely free to take potshots at your idea and does so with impunity .
Because he ’s not really your harshest critic .
Instead , he ’s essentially saying , “ The devil made me do it . ”
Devil ’s advocates remove themselves from the equation and sidestep individual responsibility for the verbal attack .
But before they ’re done , they ’ve torched your fledgling concept .
The devil ’s - advocate gambit is extraordinary but certainly not uncommon since it strikes so regularly in the project rooms and boardrooms of corporate America .
What ’s truly astonishing is how much punch is packed into that simple phrase .
In fact , the devil ’s advocate may be the biggest innovation killer in America today .
What makes this negative persona so dangerous is that it is such a subtle threat .
Every day , thousands of great new ideas , concepts , and plans are nipped in the bud by devil ’s advocates .
Why is this persona so damning ?
Because a devil ’s advocate encourages idea wreckers to assume the most negative possible perspective , one that sees only the downside , the problems , the disasters - in - waiting .
Once those floodgates open , they can drown a new initiative in negativity .
Why should you care ?
And why do I believe this problem is so important ?
Because innovation is the lifeblood of all organizations , and the devil ’s advocate is toxic to your cause .
This is no trivial matter .
There is no longer any serious debate about the primacy of innovation in the health and future strength of an organization .
As the general manager of Ideo , I have worked with clients from Singapore to San Francisco to São Paulo , and witnessed firsthand how innovation has become recognized as a pivotal management tool across virtually all industries and market segments .
And while we at Ideo used to spend the majority of our time in the world of product - based innovation , we have more recently come around to seeing innovation as a tool for transforming the entire culture of organizations .
Sure , a great product can be one important element in the formula for business success , but companies that want to succeed today need much more .
They need innovation at every point of the compass , in all aspects of the business , and in every team member .
Building an environment fully engaged in positive change , and a culture rich in creativity and renewal , means creating a company with 360 degrees of innovation .
And companies that want to succeed at innovation will need new insights , new viewpoints , and new roles .

All good working definitions of innovation pair ideas with action , the spark with the fire .
Innovators do n’t just have their heads in the clouds .
They also have their feet on the ground .
The company 3 M , one of the first to fully embrace innovation as the essence of its corporate brand , defines it as “ new ideas–plus action or implementation –which result in an improvement , a gain , or a profit . ”
It is not enough to just have a good idea .
Only when you act , when you implement , do you truly innovate .
Ideas .
Action .
Implementation .
Gain .
Profit .
All good words , of course , but there ’s still one piece left out .
People .
That ’s why I prefer the InnovationNetwork consultancy ’s definition : “ People implementing new ideas that create value . ”
The classic 3 M definition might leave you with the impression that , as a bumper sticker might put it , “ Innovation Happens . ”
But unfortunately , there ’s no spontaneous combustion in the business world .
Innovation is definitely not self - starting or self - perpetuating .
People make it happen through their imagination , willpower , and perseverance .
And whether you are a team member , a group leader , or an executive , your only real path to innovation is through people .
You ca n’t really do it alone .
“ Innovation is all about the roles people can play , the hats they can put on . ”
Innovation is all about people .
It is about the roles people can play , the hats they can put on , the personas they can adopt .
It is not just about the luminaries of innovation like Thomas Edison , or celebrity CEOs like Steve Jobs and Jeff Immelt .
It is about the unsung heroes who work on the front lines of entrepreneurship in action , the countless people and teams who make innovation happen day in and day out .
At Ideo , we ’ve developed 10 people - centric tools , talents , or personas for innovation .
Although the list does not presume to be comprehensive , it does aspire to expand your repertoire .
We ’ve found that adopting one or more of these roles can help teams express a different point of view and create a broader range of innovative solutions .
And by adopting some of these innovation personas , you ’ll have a chance to put the devil ’s advocate in his place .
So when someone says , “ Let me play devil ’s advocate for a minute ” and starts to smother a fragile new idea , someone else in the room may be emboldened to speak up and say , “ Let me be an anthropologist for a moment , because I personally have watched our customers suffering silently with this issue for months , and this new idea just might help them . ”
And if that one voice gives courage to others , maybe someone else will add , “ Let ’s think like an experimenter for a moment .
We could prototype this idea in a week and get a sense of whether we ’re onto something good . ”
The devil ’s advocate may never go away , but on a good day , the 10 personas can keep him in his place .
Or tell him to go to hell .
The Learning Personas
Individuals and organizations need to constantly gather new sources of information in order to expand their knowledge and grow , so the first three personas are learning roles .
These personas are driven by the idea that no matter how successful a company currently is , no one can afford to be complacent .
The world is changing at an accelerated pace , and today ’s great idea may be tomorrow ’s anachronism .
The learning roles help keep your team from becoming too internally focused and remind the organization not to be so smug about what you know .
People who adopt the learning roles are humble enough to question their own worldview , and in doing so , they remain open to new insights every day .
advertisement
1 . The Anthropologist brings new learning and insights into the organization by observing human behavior and developing a deep understanding of how people interact physically and emotionally with products , services , and spaces .
When an Ideo human - factors person camps out in a hospital room for 48 hours with an elderly patient undergoing surgery , she is living the life of the anthropologist and helping to develop new health - care services .
2 . The Experimenter prototypes new ideas continuously , learning by a process of enlightened trial and error .
The Experimenter takes calculated risks to achieve success through a state of “ experimentation as implementation . ”
When BMW bypassed all its traditional advertising channels and created theater - quality short films for bmwfilms.com , no one knew whether the experiment would succeed .
Its runaway success underscores the rewards that flow to Experimenters .
3 . The Cross - Pollinator explores other industries and cultures , then translates those findings and revelations to fit the unique needs of your enterprise .
An open - minded Japanese businesswoman was taken with the generic beer she found in a U.S. supermarket .
She brought the idea home , and it eventually became the “ no brand ” Mujirushi Ryohin chain , a 300 - store , billion - dollar retail empire .
That ’s the leverage of a Cross - Pollinator .
The Organizing Personas
The next three personas are organizing roles , played by individuals who are savvy about the often counterintuitive process of how organizations move ideas forward .
At Ideo , we used to believe that the ideas should speak for themselves .
Now we understand what the Hurdler , the Collaborator , and the Director have known all along : that even the best ideas must continuously compete for time , attention , and resources .
Those who adopt these organizing roles do n’t dismiss the process of budget and resource allocation as “ politics ” or “ red tape . ”
They recognize it as a complex game of chess , and they play to win .
4 . The Hurdler knows that the path to innovation is strewn with obstacles and develops a knack for overcoming or outsmarting those roadblocks .
When the 3 M worker who invented masking tape decades ago had his idea initially rejected , he refused to give up .
Staying within his $ 100 authorization limit , he signed a series of $ 99 purchase orders to pay for critical equipment needed to produce the first batch .
His perseverance paid off , and 3 M has reaped billions of dollars in cumulative profits because an energetic Hurdler was willing to bend the rules .
5 . The Collaborator helps bring eclectic groups together , and often leads from the middle of the pack to create new combinations and multidisciplinary solutions .
Not long ago , Kraft Foods and Safeway sat down to figure out how to knock down the traditional walls between supplier and retailer .
One strategy–a way to streamline the transfer of goods from one to the other–did n’t just save labor and carrying costs .
The increased efficiency sent sales of Capri Sun juice drinks , for example , soaring by 167 % during one promotion .
advertisement
6 . The Director not only gathers together a talented cast and crew but also helps to spark their creative talents .
When a creative Mattel executive assembles an ad hoc team of designers and project leaders , sequesters them for 12 weeks , and ends up with a new $ 100 million girls ’ - toy platform in three months , she is a role model for Directors everywhere .
The Building Personas
The four remaining personas are building roles that apply insights from the learning roles and channel the empowerment from the organizing roles to make innovation happen .
When people adopt the building personas , they stamp their mark on your organization .
People in these roles are highly visible , so you ’ll often find them right at the heart of the action .
7 . The Experience Architect designs compelling experiences that go beyond mere functionality to connect at a deeper level with customers ’ latent or expressed needs .
When Cold Stone Creamery turns the preparation of a frozen dessert into a fun , dramatic performance , it is designing a successful new customer experience .
The premium prices and marketing buzz that follow are rewards associated with playing the role of the Experience Architect .
8 . The Set Designer creates a stage on which innovation team members can do their best work , transforming physical environments into powerful tools to influence behavior and attitude .
Companies such as Pixar and Industrial Light & Magic recognize that the right office environments can help nourish and sustain a creative culture .
When the Cleveland Indians discovered a renewed winning ability in a brand - new stadium , they demonstrated the value of the Set Designer .
Organizations that tap into the power of the Set Designer sometimes discover remarkable performance improvements that make all the space changes worthwhile .
9 . The Caregiver builds on the metaphor of a health - care professional to deliver customer care in a manner that goes beyond mere service .
Good Caregivers anticipate customer needs and are ready to look after them .
When you see a service that ’s really in demand , there ’s usually a Caregiver at the heart of it .
Best Cellars , a retailer that takes the mystery and snobbery out of wine and makes it simple and fun , is demonstrating the Caregiver role–while earning a solid profit at the same time .
10 .
The Storyteller builds both internal morale and external awareness through compelling narra-tives that communicate a fundamental human value or reinforce a specific cultural trait .
Companies from Dell to Starbucks have lots of corporate legends that support their brands and build camaraderie within their teams .
Medtronic , celebrated for its product innovation and consistently high growth , reinforces its culture with straight - from - the - heart storytelling –patients ’ firsthand narratives of how the products changed or even saved their lives .
advertisement
Note :
The appeal of the personas is that they work .
Not in theory or in the classroom but in the unforgiving marketplace .
Ideo has battle - tested them thousands of times in a real - world laboratory for innovation .
The personas are about “ being innovation ” rather than merely “ doing innovation . ”
Take on one or more of these roles , and you ’ll be taking a conscious step toward becoming more of an innovator in your daily life .
A 54 - year - old Doncaster unfortunate - dubbed " Britain 's unluckiest man " - has continued a lifelong tradition of mishaps by falling down a manhole , Ananova reports .
John Lyne , of Stainforth , near Doncaster suffered injuries to his back , left leg and both knees as a result of the tumble , and will be out of action for 32 weeks , according to the Doncaster Free Press .
Lyne 's career began as a child , when he fell off a horse and cart and was run over by a delivery van .
As a teenager , he fell from a tree and broke his arm .
On his way home from hospital - on Friday 13th - the bus he was in crashed , provoking another fracture in the same arm .
Since then , he 's been hit by lightning twice , fallen victim to a rock - fall in a mine , has nearly drowned and has enjoyed three car crashes .
Lyne said : " I do n't think there is any reason or explanation for it though , it has just happened really .
I have to particularly be careful on the Friday 13ths , when a few accidents have fallen . "
The poor bloke added : " Everyone thinks it is just hilarious .
My mates , family and wife Susan just laugh about it . " ®
サード→次世代ゲーム機のソフト開発費の高騰。
小売→ゲームソフト利幅の減少

小売に対しては、利幅を増加させ、
プラットフォーム企業に対しては、市場縮小を止め増加に転じさせ、逆ざやのゲームハードビジネスを終わらせ、
消費者に対しては、手ごろな価格で、シンプルな操作の面白いゲームを提供できること
ＰＳ３関連の記事漁ってたら、こんなん見つけました。ダンピング寸前の値段で売られることが決定したＰＳ３ですが、そんなＰＳ３をクラスタリングしてスパコン並みの計算力を出させるっていう試みを米Terra Soft Solutionsがやるそうです。まぁ、なんというか、ゲーム機じゃないというのを見せたいんでしょうけどね。ただね。とか読んでいると、真面目に業界の抱える問題点について、マイクロソフトやソニー、その他ゲーム業界諸々が考えてないんじゃねーかって思ってしまうんですよね。というわけで、本日はゲーム業界の問題点について、書き出してみようかと思うんですけど。
で、現時点でのゲーム業界の問題点、ボトルネック、あるいは、日本ゲーム市場縮小の原因を述べますがね。はい、以前も扱いましたが、次世代機でのゲームソフト開発費は１０億とも言われます。ゲームボーイアドバンスなら二千万円、ＤＳなら四千万円、ＰＳＰなら８０００万円、ＰＳ２なら２億円、ＰＳ３なら１０億円が相場と言われています。当たり前ですけど、この状況だと、ＰＳ３のゲームソフトの値段を上げざるを得ません。１０億かかったゲームを「動物の森」みたく4８００円では売れないでしょう。こうなると中小のゲーム会社は、そんな規模の開発はできません。又、大手もコストの上昇によって、利幅を削られます。つまり、ゲーム開発が難しくなり続けるのに歯止めがかからないってことです。現状、小さな会社は、ゲームボーイアドバンス向けだったり、ＤＳ向けにタイトルを開発しているようです。まぁ、当然ですね。億単位で開発コストがかかるんじゃ、次世代ゲーム機向けにソフトは作れませんから。プラットフォームの成功には、潤沢なソフト供給が必要不可欠なんですが、これが次世代の据置機では難しくなる一方だということです。一方で、ＤＳの大爆発によって、低いコストでソフト開発できる土台はそちらにあるわけですから、中小は、ソフト開発の主軸をそちらに移すのは当然でしょう。そうなれば、次世代据置ゲームには、以前よりソフト供給が減っていきます。「ソフトがハードを決める」って言われて久しいわけですが、潤沢なソフト資産があるハードは、このままいけば、任天堂ＤＳになるわけです。据置ゲームに対して、期待が低まる一方なのも当然かと思います。現状の据置ゲームの開発費高騰に対して、明確な解決策を出すべきなんです。次世代ゲーム機では。サードの成功なくしてプラットフォームの成功無しです。サードを苦しめつづける現状のハードの進化は、問題があるといわざるを得ません。で、ＰＳ３のソフトは５０００円から７０００円と発表されてます。あれ？と思いますよね？あれだけ開発費が高騰しているのに、これくらいの値段で売れるなんて？と。開発費が高騰しているのに、ソフト価格の値段が据え置かれると、どこかにしわ寄せが行きます。ひとつは、さっきもいったように、ゲームソフト会社の利幅を圧迫します。で、もう一つは、小売へのしわ寄せです。こちらに、ソフトの売価 / 仕入れ価格表が出されてますが、Wii本体は凄まじい利幅の薄さです。ソフトや周辺機器は小売の利幅は２０％ありますが、本体は５％たらずしかありません。大量に売れるモンでもないですし、仕入が高いので、小売にとっては、かなりキツイ。こういう状況だと、ゲーム専門店はやっていけません。利幅が少なすぎるんです。うちの周りだと、ゲーム専門店がどんどんなくなって、中古もやってる大規模なトコしか生き残ってないんですが、その原因は、これでしょうね。ソフト・ハードの利幅が薄いので、中古に頼らざるをえない小売の事情がここにあります。（一時はコンビニでもゲーム売ってましたが、最近はみません。これがその事情でしょうな）しかも、最近は中古専門店までありますからね。こうして、どんどん、新品を売る小売が減り、中古販売店のみが増えた結果、ゲームソフトの商品寿命はどんどん短くなりました。今は、発売後二週間で寿命がついえる時代となってます。ここから先は、データがないんで、憶測なんですが、開発費が高騰した結果、ゲーム会社やソニーなんかが、小売の利幅を削ったんじゃないかと思うのです。そうすれば、ソフトの価格を抑えつつ、開発費を回収しやすくなりますからね。ただ、その結果、小売の体力が弱まり、ゲーム小売が潰れるか、あるいはゲーム小売そのものをやめてしまった。そして、生き残った小売は利幅の減少を補うべく中古販売などに力をいれるようになった。うちの近所じゃ、小売店で、新品売る棚より、ずっといい棚を中古ソフトが取ってます。その結果、小売が減ってユーザーはゲームを買いにくくなり、ゲーム離れが進んだ。また、ゲームソフトの中古が、よい棚を取るようになり、ユーザーが中古ばかり買うようになって、ゲーム市場が縮小した。そういう事が進展したんだと思うわけです。これは問題です。これに対する解決策を提示しなければいけない時期まで来ていると感じます。えーと、基本的に、ゲームハードは、最初に逆ざやで出して、そこからサードからのロイヤリティ収入で凌ぎつつ、ゲームハードのコストを下げ、３年目あたりからが、ゲームハードのコスト回収期になります。で、なんですが、このやり方は、悪くないっちゃ悪くないんですが（ユーザーは安くハードかえるから）一方で、小売にとっちゃたまったもんじゃありません。Wiiの利幅をみればわかりますがね、あんな利幅じゃ、小売はなかなか熱心に売ろうとは思わないでしょう。また、ハードメーカーにとっても、もし、ハードが予想を下回る売れ行きだったら、逆ざやのまま終わってしまいます。これは据置でとくに顕著ですが、初代ファミコンが十字キーとボタン二つであったの対し、ＰＳ３では十字キーにスティック2本、ボタンが８個もついています。ソフトの操作自体も複雑なものを要求されるものが多く、初心者にはとっつきにくくなる一方です。また、ソフト価格は高くなる一方で、ゲームは気軽に遊べるものではなくなってきています。さて、ここまでゲームビジネスの問題点をあげつらってきたわけですが、プレイヤーごとにまとめてしまいましょう。まとめると、各プレーヤ―ごとの問題点は、となります。現状、業界一位になったプラットフォーム企業以外、利益が出しにくいビジネスの世界です。小売やサードは厳しくなる一方です。このままじゃね。で、ソニーとかマイクロソフトのゲーム戦略を僕がダメだと思うのは、これらを無視しているとしか思えないハードを投入してきたからなんです。今、必要とされる次世代ハードは、こそが求められているはずです。ソフトの開発費の高騰をなんとかしない限りは、消費者は高くなりつづけるソフトの値段にしり込みしますし、小売は利幅の薄い販売に苦しめられます。また、ソフトウェア開発に関しても、利幅が削られる一方です。ゲームハードの逆ざやに関しても、消費者にとってはいいのですが、一方で、小売は利幅が狭くなる一方だし、プラットフォームに関して、非常に危険です。で、ＰＳ３なんですが、サードに対しては、凄まじい開発コストの上昇をもたらしています。複雑なセルプログラミング、高くなりつづけるグラフィックコスト。サードの悲鳴が聞こえてきそうな勢いです。一方、小売に対しては、おそらくソフトの利幅を以前よりさらに削るつもりなんじゃねーかと思うんですよね。ＰＳ３のソフトの価格は５０００〜８０００円前後なんですが、これだけ開発コストが上昇しても、ソフト価格を上げないなら、小売に多かれ少なかれ影響がいくでしょう。下手すると、ソフトの利幅は２０％→１５％くらいまでいくかもしれません。そうなると、小売は、ＰＳ３ソフトを真面目に売ろうとはしないでしょう。棚の隅っこにでもおいて、あとは放置とか。マジ笑えない。しかも、ハードが恐ろしい逆ざやなので、３年程度は、小売イジメとしか思えない利幅で売ることになります。ハードの値段が下がって、逆ざやが厳しくなくなる時期までは、小売が真面目に売ろうとは思わないでしょう。そして、消費者は、５万円もするハードと５０００〜８０００円もするソフトを買わなきゃいけないときたもんです。これは、かなり尻ごみする値段です。誰も幸せにしないゲーム機ビジネスです。これではね。ソフト会社も、小売も、消費者も笑えない。万が一、売れれば、ソニーだけは笑える（かもしれない）ビジネスですがね。本来、プラットフォーム戦略というのは、自分の周りに花を咲かせるのが王道です。サードや小売が成功できて、初めて成功できたといえるビジネスです。それができないなら、ただの焼き畑にすぎません。そんなのは長続きしません。業界の体力奪って走りつづけても、長くは続かないもんです。ソニーは、それがわかっていて、音楽や映画を取り込もうとしたり、今度はサーバーに逃げようとかしていたりする風に見えて、どうも好意的には見れないわけです。で、その反面教師として任天堂の岩田社長がいるわけなんですがね。岩田社長は「ゲームハードの逆ざやビジネスは正しくない」といっているんですが、これは１００％正しい。ソニーにとってはいいですが、小売にとっては、逆ざやのゲームハードなんてのは、利幅が薄いに決まっているわけですから、そんなに売りたいもんでもないんですよ。でも、売らざるを得ない。要するに現状の据置ハード販売は小売の体力を奪う行為なんです。業界全体にとっては、これはよろしくない。こんなん続けたら、ハードを真面目に売る小売が減る一方です。そうなれば、ゲーム市場は縮小してもしょうがない。ＰＳ３は、もともと１０万円くらいで売らないと儲けがでないとも言われてますんで、逆ざやが３年前後は確実に続くでしょう。当然、小売の利幅も少ないわけで、３年間、こんなハードを真面目に売ろうっていう小売は少なくなります。一方、Wiiは、２５０００円と、ちょっとユーザーを落胆させる値段でしたが、逆ざやは１０００円程度らしいので、一年もすれば、問題なくなります。ですんで、しばらく我慢すれば、小売に魅力的な利幅を提示することが可能になります。小売も、年末商戦だけじゃなく、真面目に売ってくれる可能性がある。また、岩田社長は、これまでのリッチなソフト作りに対して、もっとカジュアルなゲーム作り（タッチジェネレーションズ）を推奨しているわけですが、このままゲーム業界が一方向の進化を続ければ、開発費はさらに高騰し、新作ソフトが高くなり、結果として、サードの利幅が減ります。サードの体力は奪われつづけます。また、小売は、ソフトの利幅が、開発費の高騰でさらに狭まるとすると、ますます中古主体に切り替えざるをえません。結果、中古ソフトが小売でいい棚とって、新作は隅っこに追いやられるような状況では、ゲーム市場は縮小して、サードはゲーム市場の縮小と開発費の高騰のダブルパンチ食らって儲からなくなる一方です。そして、何より、消費者は、高くなり続けるソフト、操作が難しくなるゲームばかりでは、ゲーム離れが進む一方です。また、開発費が高騰しつづければ、サードは、冒険的なソフトを出さなくなり、リメイクや移植ばっかだすようになります。そうなれば、コアゲーマーですら、ゲームから離れてしまう危険性があります。だから、Wiiみたいに、岩田社長が取ったソフトの価格を抑えられるハード構成、直感的なインターフェースという路線も、又正しいと思うわけです。価格を抑えつつ、コアゲーマーとライトユーザーを満足させる為の方法としてインターフェースの刷新をおこなったわけですね。グラフィックの進化だけを目指すのでは、出来ないことです。岩田社長は、ゲーム業界の問題点を的確に掴んでいるんです。だから応援もしたくなる。一方で、ソニーとクタタンは明後日の方向に突き進んでます。ＰＳ３でサーバーですかそうですか。グラフィックや性能の進化もいいんですが、ゲーム業界の問題点について、ＭＳやソニーが明確な解決策をちっとも示していない。まぁ、そうはいっても、売れれば問題ないので、頑張ってください。両者とも。僕はWii買いますがね。追記今、気付いたんですが、Wii本体のアマゾンの利幅が５％だとするとアフィ経由だと紹介料のプレミアム次第でアマゾンまで逆ざやだ。すげ―商売だ。ＤＳとかどうなんだろう。これじゃ、アマゾンは沢山入荷したりはしないかもなぁ。

Al - Hakim Targeted with Car Bomb ;
Thousands of Shiites Protest US in Najaf ;
Enormous Bomb Hits Habaniya Mosque
Late Saturday , the US Air Force launched a series of bombing raids on southeast Baghdad .
This is absolutely shameful , that the US is bombing from the air a civilian city that it militarily occupies .
You ca n’t possibly do that without killing innocent civilians , as at Ramadi the other day .
It is a war crime .
US citizens should protest and write their congressional representatives .
It is also the worst possible counter - insurgency tactic anyone could ever have imagined .
You bomb people , they hate you .
The bombing appears to have knocked out what little electricity some parts of Baghdad were still getting .
Guerrillas used a car bomb to target the residence of Shiite leader Abdul Aziz al - Hakim in Baghdad on Saturday .
Al - Hayat says that they killed 3 civilians and wounded 7 others .
This report says that they killed one guard and wounded four .
These were likely Sunni Arab guerrillas hoping that al - Hakim would see the attack as an American one .
The US arrested al - Hakim ’s son on Friday , contributing to a fraying of US relations with Shiite Iraqis , especially those loyal to the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq .
Nearly 10,000 Iraqis demonstrated in the Shiite holy city of Najaf on Saturday against the US arrest of Sayyid Ammar al - Hakim the previous day .
Smaller demonstrations were held in other southern Shiite cities , including Kut and Basra .
This young cleric is the son of Abdul Aziz al - Hakim , the leader of the largest bloc in the Iraqi parliament and an ally of the US .
Iraqi President Jalal Talabani called for the US military personnel who arrested Sayyid Ammar al - Hakim on Friday to be disciplined .
He decried al - Hakim ’s treatment at US hands .
Talabani , a Kurd , is typically a strong ally of the US .
A truck bomb devastated the congregation of a Sunni mosque in Habbaniya on Saturday , killing 45 and wounding 110 .
AP speculates that the mosque was being punished for the stance of its imam against “ extremism . ”
The Baath Party and the Salafi Jihadis that dominate al - Anbar Province frequently kill other Sunnis whom they view as “ collaborators ” with the foreign occupation forces .
This article also discusses the way that the security plan in Baghdad and al - Anbar has displaced many guerrillas into Diyala Province northeast of Baghdad , where direct attacks on US troops are up 70 percent !
In Baghdad itself , three bombings and a mortar attack contributed to a death toll of some 20 .

Haskell ’s popularity has driven the need for ever more expressive type system features , most of which threaten the decidability and practicality of Damas - Milner type inference .
One such feature is the ability to write functions with higher - rank types — that is , functions that take polymorphic functions as their arguments .
Complete type inference is known to be undecidable for higher - rank ( impredicative ) type systems , but in practice programmers are more than willing to add type annotations to guide the type inference engine , and to document their code .
However , the choice of just what annotations are required , and what changes are required in the type system and its inference algorithm , has been an ongoing topic of research .
We take as our starting point a lambda - calculus proposed by Odersky and Laufer .
Their system supports arbitrary - rank polymorphism through the exploitation of type annotations on lambda - bound arguments and arbitrary sub-terms .
Though elegant , and more convenient than some other proposals , Odersky and Laufer ’s system requires many annotations .
We show how to use local type inference ( invented by Pierce and Turner ) to greatly reduce the annotation burden , to the point where higher - rank types become eminently usable .
Higher - rank types have a very modest impact on type inference .
We substantiate this claim in a very concrete way , by presenting a complete type - inference engine , written in Haskell , for a traditional Damas - Milner type system , and then showing how to extend it for higher - rank types .
We write the type - inference engine using a monadic framework : it turns out to be a particularly compelling example of monads in action .
The paper is long , but is strongly tutorial in style .
Italian officers raided their biathlon and cross-country bases on Saturday .
The searches happened as Olympic officials conducted unannounced , out - of - competition , drugs tests on at least 10 Austrian athletes .
The World Anti-Doping Agency said it learned banned coach Walter Mayer was with the team and informed the IOC .
" The fact he was in the same area as the athletes created quite some concern to us , " said IOC medical commission chief Arne Ljungqvist .
Austrian Olympic Committee Secretary General Heinz Jungwirth said he had personally protested to IOC president Jacques Rogge .
No test results have been announced , and the Austrian cross-country team finished last in their race on Sunday .
There 's definitely no doping in the Austrian team - it 's crazy
Cross-country skier Juergen Pinter
" Suddenly the police came in and did n't let us leave on the night before the competition .
This happened without any positive result from doping control in the team . "
In the men's 4 x 10 km cross-country relay on Sunday , Austria came last after the raid left them sleepless and demoralised .
The Austrians ' third skier Roland Diethart was lapped by the leader and in accordance with the rules the team had to drop out of the race , meaning fourth runner Johannes Eder did not start .
" I did n't even get to race .
With 20 policemen standing in your bedroom in the middle of the night , how can you compete ? " he said .
Mayer was banned from Turin and the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver after the discovery of blood transfusion equipment in his accommodation in Salt Lake City four years ago .
Ljungqvist , though , defended the raids .
Holding up an official postcard of the Austrian biathlon team which included Mayer and at the back read " 2006 Olympic Games " , Ljungqvist said : " This is reason enough to act . "
While Mayer was not violating the ban imposed on him , Ljungqvist said by visiting the athletes he had violated the Olympic spirit .
" It is against the spirit of that decision .
The fact has been respected that he has not an IOC accreditation . "
An IOC statement said : " The IOC is fulfilling its responsibility to conduct anti-doping control on athletes who might have been under his ( Mayer 's ) influence . "
They 've been playing with fire in having an association with this guy
Dick Pound , World Anti-Doping Agency chairman on Mayer
Erich Wagner , a spokesman for the Austrian Ski Federation , admitted Mayer was at the Games .
" Mayer was here privately as a spectator and he visited the boys , " he said .
Doping violations carry tough sentences under Italian law with offenders facing sentences up to three years in prison .
The Italian government introduced strict doping laws before it won the right to host the 2006 Games and has refused to relax them to correspond with IOC rules .
No Austrians have won medals in biathlon or cross-country in Turin so far , the highest finish in either being Wolfgang Perner 's fourth place in the men 's biathlon 10 km sprint .
Russian biathlon star Olga Pyleva was stripped of a silver medal and expelled on Thursday after testing positive for the stimulant carphedon .
The United State ’s has one of the most admired university systems in the world and one of the most deplored k- 12 systems .
Could the difference have something to do with the fact that universities operate in a competitive market with lots of private suppliers while k- 12 is dominated by monopolistic , government provided schools ?
What would our university system look like if it operated like the k - 12 system ?
Look to France for the answer .
The riots of 1968 forced the government to offer a virtually free university education to any student who passes an
exam but as a result the universities are woefully underfunded especially for the masses .
Amazingly , with just a few exceptions
for the elites , students are required to attend the universities closest to their
high schools .
Sound familiar ?
The NYTimes sums up with a look at a typical university :
Only 30 of the library ’s 100 computers have Internet access .
The
campus cafeterias close after lunch .
Professors often do not have
office hours ; many have no office .
Some classrooms are so overcrowded
that at exam time many students have to find seats elsewhere .
By late
afternoon every day the campus is largely empty .
Sandwiched
between a prison and an unemployment office just outside Paris , the
university here is neither the best nor the worst place to study in
this fairly wealthy country .
Rather , it reflects the crisis of France ’s
archaic state - owned university system : overcrowded , underfinanced ,
disorganized and resistant to the changes demanded by the outside
world .
Thanks to Daniel Akst for the pointer .
Suppose that Adam runs a stop sign and hits Eve , who happened to be driving through the same intersection .
Who caused the accident ?
If Adam were not there , the accident would have not happened .
So it seems natural to say that he was the cause .
But it is equally true that if Eve were not there , the accident could not have happened either .
So , in a sense , Eve caused the accident as well .
Adam might have been negligent , but if either party were absent , there would have been no accident .
More generally , the more people on the road , the more accidents will occur , at least up to the point of total gridlock .
Even adding an obsessively safe driver to the road could increase total accident costs , since reckless drivers like Adam would now have one more car to run into .
When Eve decided whether to buy a car , she was forced to consider the average costs of accidents in which she could be involved since she had to pay for automobile insurance , and insurance rates by necessity reflect the average costs of accidents .
But her insurance premiums did not include the costs that other drivers might incur by running into her .
Welcome to DoubleCommand !
News
27th October 2013 - Thanks to the efforts of Adam Strzelecki DoubleCommand 1.7 is released , adding support for Mac OS X 10.9 ( Mavericks ) , and dropping support for 10.4 and 10.5 .
29th June 2011 - It has been a long time since anything has changed here , and so I 'd just like to make you aware that if DoubleCommand does not fully support a new keyboard you use ( like in a new Macbook perhaps ) , or if it does n't support a feature you need , you might find some help at pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook .
24th November 2009 - DoubleCommand 1.6.9 released , fully supporting 64 - bit for the prefpane and the kext ( for those who want to use the 64 - bit kernel ) .
This is a universal binary , so only one kext and prefpane is needed for any Mac OS X 10.4 and up computer .
2nd September 2009 - Snow Leopard ( Mac OS X 10.6 ) has been released , but I might not be able to have a copy running for a couple of weeks .
However , most reports coming in are that the existing DoubleCommand works fine on 10.6 in 32 bit kernel mode , and if you 're using DoubleCommand , chances are that 32 bit is not only the default , but is just fine for you right now .
I have been sent a patch by Ryan Walklin ( thanks ! ) that should support the 64 bit kernel , but I wo n't be able to release that until I can test that it works , which should be a couple of weeks at most .
10th March 2009 - DoubleCommand 1.6.8 just adds back the missing options from the preference pane .
5th February 2009 - Release DoubleCommand 1.6.7 is out , this fixes problems with the control key not working in certain situations , and adds an uninstaller script for when things go wrong .
9th May 2008 - New beta DoubleCommand 1.6.6b4 is out , this rolls back the control key fix from the last beta , which seemed to break some features , and adds a number of new features contributed by Sastira - Using the right Option key as forward delete , Control or Enter , swapping delete and forward delete , and using caps lock as forward delete .
25th March 2008 - New beta DoubleCommand 1.6.6b3 is out , this seems to fix kernel panics for some on Mac OS X 10.5 , and should also solve a problem with the Control key becoming stuck .
Please report whether it works for you or not , and what version of Mac OS you have , and the keyboards and type of computer you 're using it on .
22nd February 2008 - I 've just had a report that Mac OS X 10.5.2 seems to stop kernel panics when using DoubleCommand , so please post in the forum and let us all know your experience with this .
I 've also been told that there is a new Built - In Keyboard Firmware Update - please disable DoubleCommand before applying this update , you can safely add DoubleCommand back afterwards .
6th November 2007 - DoubleCommand 1.6.6b1 is available for testing , several reports of success on Mac OS X 10.5 have given me enough reason to post this here , however I have not yet tested this myself with the new OS .
Please let me know how it works for you if you try it !
30th October 2007 - Mac OS X 10.5 , Leopard , has been released , and I expect to have a copy at some point .
Until then , reports have been mixed : some have had success running the current version of DoubleCommand as is , some seem to have required uninstalling then reinstalling , and some have experienced occasional kernel panics , only possibly related to DoubleCommand .
My advice is to disable DoubleCommand before upgrading to avoid upgrade problems , then enable when you 've got everything else sorted out .
6th August 2007 - Release 1.6.5 removes the unnecessary log output .
25th July 2007 - Release 1.6.4 adds Caps lock to delete feature for the Colemak keyboard layout .
Also added internals for multiple keyboard support .
26th June 2007 - Updated website layout .
The highest priority now is having settings per keyboard , or at least only applying DoubleCommand to a single keyboard .
Also released DoubleCommand 1.6.3 , a minor update which allows using backslash as delete with Option to delete to word boundaries .

Bihar
The girl cannot be identified for legal reasons ( Photo by Prashant Ravi )
The girl from northern Bihar state said she was " unable to bear " continued threats from the family of the alleged rapist and men belonging to his caste .
The alleged rapist was arrested after the girl lodged a complaint with police last year and is now in a local prison .
His family say he has been falsely accused and deny a rape took place .
' Ostracised '
In her handwritten letter to President Kalam , the girl says she and her relatives have repeatedly been threatened by her alleged attacker 's family .
" Respected Kalam uncle .
Please save me , get me justice or give me permission to die , " she writes .
" I am unable to bear all the pain and torture by the family members of the rapist and his powerful caste men of the village . "
The girl , who cannot be identified for legal reasons , lives with her grandfather , stepmother and siblings in a village in Bihar , one of India 's most backward and lawless states .
Her mother died young , and her father works in Delhi .
The police report says the girl was raped by a neighbour last September .
She lodged a complaint with local police and the neighbour was then detained .
When district officials decided to fast track her case , she says the alleged rapist 's family began putting pressure on her family to withdraw the case .
She says she and her sisters were taunted , beaten up and even threatened with rape if she did not drop her allegations .
Her family had also been ostracised by villagers belonging to the same caste as the alleged rapist , she said .
" I want him punished so severely that he cannot rape another poor , innocent girl in the village .
I also want no further problems or harassment for my family . "
' Village politics '
The traumatised girl left the village for Delhi , returning earlier this month to renewed threats , she says .
" The alleged rapist 's elder brother beat me up and threatened he would rape my younger sister .
Life has become a burden to me forcing me to think of taking my life , " said the girl in her letter .
Why did she write to President Kalam ?
" What could I do ?
There was no way out .
I have heard that the president loves children and likes to listen to them , so I wrote to him as a last resort . "
Local authorities have now provided armed guards at the girl 's house and appealed to the villagers not to harass her family .
Police say they will protect the girl and her family .
The father of the alleged rapist told the BBC that the case was " blatantly false and a fallout of village politics " .
" The medical report clearly shows there was no evidence of the rape and there were several discrepancies in the police report on the incident , " he said .
PHILADELPHIA — Historians of science are taking a new and lively interest in alchemy , the often mystical investigation into the hidden mysteries of nature that reached its heyday in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries and has been an embarrassment to modern scientists ever since .
There was no place in the annals of empirical science , beginning mainly in the 18th century , for the occult practices of obsessed dreamers who sought most famously and impossibly to transform base metals into pure gold .
So alchemy fell into disrepute .
But in the revival of scholarship on the field , historians are finding reasons to give at least some alchemists their due .
Even though they were secretive and self - deluded and their practices closer to magic than modern scientific methods , historians say , alchemists contributed to the emergence of modern chemistry as a science and an agent of commerce .
“ Experimentalism was one of alchemy ’s hallmarks , ” said Lawrence M. Principe , a historian of science at Johns Hopkins University and a trained chemist .
“ You have to get your hands dirty , and in this way alchemists forged some early ideas about matter . ”
Jerry Yang , co-founder of internet media company Yahoo , is donating $ US75 million ( $ A96 m ) to Stanford University , which will spend most of the money on a new environmental studies center , the university said on Thursday .
Yang , who started Yahoo in 1994 with fellow student David Filo while working on his doctorate , planned to make the donations over a period of several years , said Howard Pearson , director of Stanford 's development office .
It will be the largest of several donations
Yang has made to his alma mater , although Pearson declined to say how much he has previously given .

And with the right strategy , you could become a millionaire , too .
What , exactly , does it take to become a millionaire ?

Millionaires are defined in different ways .
RBC Wealth Management and consulting firm Capgemini who produce the World Wealth Report say it is someone who has $ 1 million or more in investible assets -- not including items like your primary home or consumable goods you own .
On the other hand , international mega - bank Credit Suisse defines it as someone with a net worth of at least $ 1 million .
This net worth could include the value of your primary residence , money that 's been invested in real estate or trust funds ( known as non-liquid assets ) , and cash , stocks or bonds ( liquid assets ) [ source : Frank , Stern ] .
Using the former definition , there were 11 million millionaires in the world in 2011 .
Using the latter , you get 28.6 million millionaires on the planet [ source : World Wealth Report , Peterson ] .
If you 'd like to see how close you are to becoming a millionaire , figure your own net worth by adding the value of your assets : your home , its furnishings , your cars , bank accounts and investments .
After you have a sum total , subtract your liabilities , which include the balance of your mortgage and car loans , credit card balances and other outstanding debts .
What 's left is your net worth .
( Try this online calculator to simplify the math . )
Not a millionaire yet ?
Do n't get discouraged .
This level of wealth is attainable within a lifetime .
By making smart financial decisions and following a road map that includes a few key strategies , it 's entirely possible to become a millionaire .
It also means you 'll need to live beneath your means , which is a far cry from the millionaire lifestyle many of us have become conditioned to expect .

Large - scale concentrations of deep poverty  as was the case in New Orleans before the storm  are inherently harmful to cities .
The smaller New Orleans is almost certain to wind up with a far higher percentage of its population working than before Hurricane Katrina .
Image Dejean Lawless , 9 , plays in the Seventh Ward of New Orleans , a neighborhood nearly abandoned since the flooding from Hurricane Katrina .
Credit ... Lee Celano for The New York Times
“ Where there are high concentrations of poverty , people ca n’t see a way out , ” said William Oakland , a retired economist from Tulane University who has studied the city ’s economy for decades .
“ Maybe the diaspora is a blessing . ”
Others , however , worry that permanently losing so many people threatens the city ’s culture  its unique way of talking , parading and eating .
“ Culture is people , ” said Richard Campanella , a Tulane geographer who has written extensively about the city ’s neighborhoods .
“ If half the local people are dispersed and no longer living cohesively in those social networks , then half of local culture is gone . ”
The new doubts also take into account the current barriers to repopulation , including the well - documented failure of the state ’s Road Home aid program for homeowners , the loss of tens of thousands of jobs since the storm , the crime problem and delays in rebuilding moderately priced housing .
Official efforts  local , state and federal  to rebuild the network of hospitals , schools and public housing projects that once served the city ’s huge poor population have been faltering .
But they also look at what New Orleans was before the storm .
The low population figure , 191,000 , which was reported by the Louisiana Recovery Authority in November last year in the most credible survey to date , was about half the 444,000 count in a Census estimate before Hurricane Katrina .
The number was surprising , dashing expectations of a “ big return , ” as one economist put it , and was hotly disputed by local officials .
Still , upticks , if there are any , are imperceptible : the percentage of prehurricane gas and electric users who were getting service , for instance , remained the same between April and November 2006 , the Brookings Institution reported last month .
“ Our expectations were just wrong , ” said James A. Richardson , an economist who directs the Public Administration Institute at Louisiana State University .
“ I do n’t believe it will ever be 450,000 again .
I think New Orleans did not need 450,000 people to support the economy you had at that time . ”
As communities throughout the planet are advised to stay inside and clinic physical distancing steps , feelings of isolation and isolation are very likely to become more widespread .
To combat the possible social and psychological consequences of physical distancing , a lot of men and women are turning to video games .
Video games have been widely considered inherently anti social .
On the other hand , Bandarkiu Online the World Health Organization , which has cautioned about the dangers of too much gambling , recently established , partnering with significant gaming studios to inspire individuals to remain home .
Despite the existence of a worldwide pandemic , the video game marketplace is shocking in size , much exceeding the movie and music businesses .
People today play with video games for a lot of reasons , such as relaxation , escapism and obviously enjoyable , but they also offer spaces for folks to get together and keep connected .
This is particularly important today , when people could be feeling isolated , anxious and lonely .
As teachers and investigators of video games and video game style , we contacted many game industry insiders and scholars to supply some insight into gambling through instances of physical isolation .
Video games have several social and mental advantages .
Most online games have in - game conversation , either by voice or via text , so online spaces may be handy avenues for communication and staying connected .
As well as playing with individuals from all over the Earth , video games provide spaces where families and friends can meet almost .
Games such as Nintendo ’s recently published Animal Crossing New Horizons , let gamers to meet , socialize and finish in - game activities collectively onto a virtual island .
This enables family and friends to arrange a opportunity to play and fulfill .
Connection And Benefits Of The Game
The popular PC video game system , Steam , lately saw a record amount of users logged in to its service within the March 21 - 22 weekend .
To assist players in this challenging time , a few game developers are providing their games at no cost or at steep discounts .
In mid March , indie game programmer declared that its sport , Atomic Throne could be gotten for 90 percent off the normal cost .
When asked about the time of this reduction , Vlambeer co-founder and tactical director Rami Ismail explained .
He outlined the neighborhood response by stating .
While video games might be useful for combating isolation , but there are a number of possible dangers .
Over time spent online consequently runs the risk of greater exposure to degeneration .
While online harassment is a critical problem for adults , it ’s possibly worse for younger gamers .
In an email , Rachel Kowert , study manager of take this a psychological wellness and video games source firm , notes that parents of young children in particular should make the most of the several parental controls regarding conversation , by turning the conversation completely or by simply permitting them connect and talk with individuals they know in their lives .
Another possible concern for parents might be raised game buys , for example loot boxes , downloadable articles or micro transactions .
Kowert urges allowing parental controls to make certain that kids are not inadvertently purchasing in - game content .
For adults , higher stress may also result in improved game related spending , such as impulse buys .
To be able to maintain purchases under management , players should think about monitoring spending or disabling in app or in game buys .
Despite all these issues and with all the suitable precautions , video games stay a fun , practical way to keep social relationships and also to fight feelings of isolation and boredom .
While much of the gambling community stays concentrated mostly on gamers , Ismail from Vlambeer had any information for game programmers in this tough time
To do otherwise would be an intolerable government intrusion into employment relationships that courts have called “ the lifeblood ” of religious life and the bedrock of religious liberty , explained Edward R. McNicholas , co-chairman of the national religious institutions practice in the Washington , D.C. , office of Sidley Austin , a law firm with some of the country ’s largest religious organizations among its clients .
Judges have routinely invoked the ministerial exception to dismiss lawsuits against religious employers by rabbis , ministers , cantors , nuns and priests — those “ whose ministry is a core expression of religious belief for that congregation , ” as Mr. McNicholas put it .
But judges also have applied the exception to dismiss cases filed by the press secretary at a Roman Catholic church , a writer for The Christian Science Monitor , administrators at religious colleges , the disgruntled beneficiaries of a Lutheran pension fund , the overseer of the kosher kitchen at a Jewish nursing home and a co-founder of Focus on the Family , run by the conservative religious leader James C. Dobson .
Court files show that some of these people were surprised to learn that their work had been considered a “ core expression of religious belief ” by their employer .
Religious employers have long been shielded from all complaints of religious discrimination by an exemption that was built into the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and expanded in 1972 .
That historic exemption allows them to give preference in hiring to candidates who share their faith .
In recent years , some judges have also refused to interfere when religious groups have dismissed lesbians , unwed mothers and adulterous couples , even if they profess the same faith , because they have violated their employers ’ religious codes .
A federal court decision has given religious broadcasters an exemption from some of the fair - hiring requirements of the Federal Communications Commission , even when they are hiring secretaries and receptionists .
Two other decisions , one in federal court affecting a Mormon church and the other in a state court of appeals case involving a Roman Catholic nursing home , affirmed the right of religious employers to dismiss employees whose faith changed after they were hired .
“ These are very difficult cases because they pull at some very fundamental heartstrings , ” said Steven C. Sheinberg , a lawyer at Outten & Golden , specializing in employment law .
“ There ’s our belief that employees should be free of discrimination in their work , versus our belief that religious organizations should be free to hire people who best help them fulfill their religious mission , without the intrusion of government . ”
Employees at religious institutions face other risks as well , thanks to pension law exemptions granted by Congress and upheld by the courts .
Religious employers are exempt from Erisa , the federal pension law that establishes disclosure requirements and conflict - of - interest restrictions for employee pension plans .
That exemption has given rise to several cases in which workers at religious hospitals found that their pensions had vanished because of practices that would not have been allowed under Erisa ’s rules .

Though positive psychology is only beginning to be used as an educational tool in classrooms and secondary schools , in the nine years since Seligman ’s epiphany it has taken a firm hold in academia .
The field ’s steering committee includes a number of psychologists and psychiatrists who have done highly regarded clinical work : Ed Diener of the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , whose specialty is “ subjective well - being ” ; Christopher Peterson at the University of Michigan , who has made a study of admired character traits around the world ; George Vaillant , who has long headed a Harvard project tracking success and failure among the college ’s graduates ; and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi of Claremont Graduate University , who has spent years studying “ optimal functioning , ” or the state of being intensely absorbed in a task , what he calls “ flow . ”
Seligman ’s book , “ Authentic Happiness , ” published in 2002 , lays out the field ’s fundamental principles and has been translated into nearly 20 languages .
Last year ’s annual positive - psychology summit in Washington attracted hundreds of academics working in the field or interested in doing so , as well as a children ’s programming director , who was working to imbue her cartoons with positive psychology messages , and the Nobel Prize - winning economist Daniel Kahneman , who studies the relationship between economics and perceptions of happiness .
In addition there were a lot of “ life coaches , ” independent consultants who hire themselves out to help clients achieve their life goals .
Despite its seemingly American emphasis on self - reliance and self - expression , positive psychology is also proving popular in England and the British Commonwealth .
Nick Baylis , a psychologist at Cambridge University , helped found the Well - being Institute there last year and is consulting with Wellington College , a private boarding and day school , on how to apply positive psychology to its curriculum .
The Geelong Grammar School , a prestigious boarding and day school in Australia , is planning to shape its curriculum around the precepts of positive psychology in 2008 , and the government of Scotland has also been in touch with Seligman to see whether the discipline might help its citizens .
“ Our old nation has been renewed through our new Parliament , and if we can embrace this new science of positive psychology , we have the opportunity to create a new Enlightenment , ” one government official announced .
Positive psychology is popular with educators because if happiness is something that can be learned , it can be taught .
And because being happier seems to have positive long - term effects not just on well - being but also on health and life span .
In one often - cited study , researchers at the University of Kentucky analyzed the essays novices born before 1917 wrote on entering the School Sisters of Notre Dame and correlated them to the nuns ’ life spans .
They found that 9 out of 10 of the most positive 25 percent of the nuns were still alive at 85 , while only one - third of the least positive 25 percent were .
Overall , their study showed positive emotions correlated to a 10 - year increase in life span , greater even than the differential between smokers and nonsmokers .
Another study , by Dacher Keltner , a psychology professor at U.C. Berkeley , correlated the smiles that the female graduates of Mills College in Oakland , Calif. , displayed in two mid-20th - century yearbooks with life satisfaction and found that the bigger the smile , the more satisfying the marriage and the greater their well - being .
Inspired by studies like these , positive psychologists have developed “ interventions , ” or practices , designed to maximize positive emotions and have tested them on thousands of people .
One such intervention is to think every night about the good things that happened to you that day .
Another is to make sure in any given day that you either work or play in a new area that draws on what positive psychologists call your “ signature strengths ” to create a sense of well - being .
Gratitude visits — looking up someone who has taught or mentored you and thanking him or her — are important in positive psychology , too ; this last intervention , studies show , gives the biggest increase in happiness of all .
In the first few weeks of the semester , Kashdan asked his students to keep a record of their thoughts and experiences .
He then gave them “ experiential assignments ” to make them happier , working their emotions the way an athletic coach might work their muscles .
One week they were to report on attempts to go into “ flow . ”
“ Sex , drugs and chocolate are all highly useful avenues for people to attain flow states , ” Kashdan said .
To enter flow , students were asked to do something that they were good at , be it writing , playing basketball or talking to their friends .
According to positive psychology , your signature strengths play a special role in building your confidence and thus bringing you happiness .
Seligman ’s Web site , authentichappiness.org , has a 240 - question test to help determine whether your gift is for creativity , bravery , love or something else .
In class , one student recounted going into flow during a fistfight ; another told of being at her father ’s grave .
A third talked about being with a friend watching TV and suddenly having a profound conversation .
“ We had so much love for each other , ” the student remembered in class , “ and suddenly we were crying . ”
Several studies undertaken by positive psychologists have suggested that meditation enhances well - being , so another class assignment was to meditate for 15 minutes three days in a row , attend a free yoga class ( Kashdan ’s wife , a yoga instructor , arranged this with her studio ) , be mindful twice a day and report on the results .
The mindfulness exercises — excercises in heightened awareness and openness to experience — are central to positive psychology and made a big impression , according to Kashdan : “ Some said they just noticed for the first time how many types of trees there are on the way to campus . ”
The following week , students were asked to watch “ Before Sunrise ” and “ Before Sunset , ” movies starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy .
In the former , the two fall in love through intense conversation during one long evening in Vienna and then part .
The sequel catches up with them nine years later .
The students had to write about the first time they fell in love .
The next assignment was to pay a gratitude visit or write a gratitude letter .
After that , the students were to exercise their curiosity by doing something “ novel , complex , and uncertain . . . epistemic , sensory and social ” — that is , they were to use their signature strengths to try something new .
One student tasted a pomegranate for the first time ; another went to a book reading by Carly Fiorina , the former C.E.O. of Hewlett - Packard .
Finally , the students were asked to select one memory they would be willing to spend an eternity with , an intervention inspired by the Japanese movie “ After Life . ”
Kashdan ’s enthusiasm — he is a passionate teacher — ate up class time , and so the students never got to other parts of the syllabus , among them optimism exercises and exercises that would make them better teammates .
On the last week , students handed in their final papers , describing how they had tried to enhance their lives toward , in Kashdan ’s words , “ a specific , personally meaningful positive outcome ” during the semester .
There was no final exam ; the students ’ grades were based in large part on the paper and class participation .
Iran 's president has already called for Israel to be wiped off the map
" If European countries claim that they have killed Jews in World War II ... why do n't they provide the Zionist regime with a piece of Europe , " Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told Iranian television .
" Germany and Austria can provide the ... regime with two or three provinces for this regime to establish itself , and the issue will be resolved . "
The president 's remarks were quickly condemned by Israel and the US .
" This is not the first time , unfortunately , that the Iranian president has expressed the most outrageous ideas concerning Jews and Israel , " Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Mark Regev said .
" He is not just Israel 's problem .
He is a worry for the entire international community , " he added .
' Outrageous '
Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel , quoted by AFP agency , described the remarks as " an outrageous gaffe , which I want to repudiate in the sharpest manner " .
White House spokesman Scott McClellan said the Iranian leader 's comments " further underscore our concerns about the regime " .
" And it 's all the more reason why it 's so important that the regime not have the ability to develop nuclear weapons , " he said .
UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said : " I condemn [ the comments ] unreservedly .
They have no place in civilised political debate . "
Mr Ahmadinejad 's stance was also condemned by French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who were meeting in Berlin .
Nuclear row
In October , Mr Ahmadinejad caused an outcry by calling for Israel to " be wiped off the map " .
His latest comments come as Iran is mired in controversy over its nuclear programme , which it says is solely for the provision of fuel , but which the US says is aimed at producing nuclear weapons .
An International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) report in September said questions about Iran 's nuclear programme remained unanswered despite an intensive investigation .
DIGG THIS
Amidst all the discussion and debate about whether President Bush has violated the law by ordering the National Security Agency ( NSA ) to record telephone conversations , we must not overlook an important fact : the United States is now traveling in uncharted waters , ones in which the ruler of the nation is exercising omnipotent power over the American people .
A more appropriate word would be one that offends some Americans when it is applied to their system of government : dictatorship .
But as uncomfortable as that term might make Americans , the fact is that ever since 9/11 Americans have been living under dictatorial rule .
What is a dictator ?
A dictator is a ruler whose powers are omnipotent , that is , unconstrained by external or superior law .
A dictator has the power to take whatever actions he wants without concerning himself about whether they are legal .
Anything the dictator does is legal because he is the law .
It was n’t always that way in the United States .
When the Constitution was enacted , its goal was not only to call the federal government into existence but also to ensure that it would not be headed by a dictator .
To accomplish that , the Framers inserted language expressly limiting the president to a few well - defined powers .
If a power was n’t enumerated , the president could not legally exercise it .
The Constitution was the higher law that governed the actions of all federal officials .
What if the president intentionally violated those restrictions ?
The Constitution provided two remedies .
First , the judicial branch could declare the president ’s acts to be in violation of the Constitution and order him to comply with its judgment .
As the Supreme Court held in the famous case of Marbury v. Madison , the judicial branch ’s determination of constitutionality trumped the president ’s opinion of constitutionality .
Second , the Constitution gave the legislative branch of government — the Congress — the power to impeach the president and remove him from office .
What many Americans fail to understand is that it is entirely possible to have democracy and dictatorship at the same time .
Democracy entails the use of elections to place people into positions of power .
Dictatorship entails the extent of the powers that the ruler is able to exercise after he assumes office .
Therefore , it is entirely possible to have a democratically elected dictator — a person who has been duly elected to office who exercises dictatorial powers .
This is exactly the case of George W. Bush .
Some Americans become offended whenever critics bring up the name of Adolf Hitler in discussing the dictatorial powers that President Bush is now exercising .
They miss the point .
When critics bring up Hitler ’s name in the context of Bush ’s exercise of dictatorial powers , they ’re not suggesting that Bush and Hitler are somehow equivalent evils or that Bush has committed the horrors that Hitler committed .
What they ’re instead saying is that Hitler sets a good benchmark for what dictatorship involves .
Therefore , he provides a good means by which to measure the powers being exercised by another ruler .
If George W. Bush or any other American president exercises the same types of omnipotent powers that Hitler exercised , that should serve as a powerful wake - up call for the American people , who have long wondered how the German people could have allowed Hitler to become a dictator ( see my article  How Hitler Became a Dictator ) .
Therefore , the issue is not whether Bush is a good man , as many of his supporters contend .
The issue is whether this good man has assumed dictatorial powers in the wake of 9/11 .
The issue also is whether any man , good or evil , should ever be given dictatorial powers .
In fact , Vice President Cheney was making much the same point when he recently said that Venezuela ’s democratically elected president , Hugo Chavez , was comparable to Hitler .
Cheney was n’t suggesting that Chavez had instituted concentration camps in which millions were being killed .
What he was saying was that Chavez , albeit democratically elected , was consolidating power . 
The question that the American people must ask is : Has President Bush been doing the same thing — consolidating power — ever since 9/11 , especially as part of his war on terrorism  and his invasion of Iraq ?
Everyone would have to concede that he has .
Dictatorial powers
Consider the specific powers the president is claiming :
1 . The power to order the Pentagon to take any American anywhere in the world , including here in the United States , into custody and punish him , even execute him , without according him the protections of the Bill of Rights .
Under this power , all the Pentagon has to do is place a document in front of the president labeling any particular American a terrorist ,  and once the president signs it the Pentagon has the omnipotent power to punish the terrorist . 
Does the person who is labeled a terrorist have the right to appeal such a determination ?
No .
Even if the designated terrorist is a newspaper editor , a prominent celebrity , or a well - known anti-war critic , the president ’s determination is final .
Keep in mind that , according to the president and the Pentagon , we are at war and neither the courts nor the Congress should be permitted to interfere with the military decisions made by the Pentagon and the commander in chief .
Are there any restraints on the particular type of punishment that the military metes out to a designated terrorist ?
No .
Since the president and the Pentagon consider a terrorist to be an illegal enemy combatant , they refuse to be bound by the Geneva Convention , which provides long - established protections for prisoners of war .
No one needs to be reminded of how U.S. military personnel have subjected the terrorists  held in U.S. facilities at Guantanamo Bay , Abu Ghraib , and elsewhere to torture , sex abuse , rape , and murder .
While Americans have not been subjected to the same mistreatment , that is simply owing to a discretionary decision by the president and the Pentagon ; it could be changed at any time .
2 . The power to record telephone conversations of the American people without first securing a search warrant from a magistrate in the judicial branch , as the Bill of Rights requires .
In fact , under the president ’s rationale , there ’s nothing to prevent him from conducting any warrantless searches as long as they are part of the war on terrorism . 
3 . The power to send the entire nation into war against a foreign nation without a declaration of war from Congress , despite the fact that the Constitution expressly delegates that power to Congress , not the president .
No one can deny that those three powers are dictatorial in nature .
But it ’s important that they be considered in the context of the president ’s own justifications for exercising such powers .
It is those justifications that have sent America sailing into the uncharted waters of dictatorial rule .
The congressional justification
The president cites two primary justifications for exercising omnipotent power , which he interweaves .
First , he says that Congress authorized him to take whatever measures he deemed necessary to seek out and arrest or destroy the terrorists who were responsible for the 9/11 attacks .
Second , he says that since we are now at war — the war on terrorism — he is able to exercise omnipotent powers as the nation ’s military commander in chief .
Bush ’s first justification involves the congressional resolution that was enacted in the wake of the 9/11 attacks , which authorized him to use force against those who had conspired to carry out the attacks .
Ironically , Bush ’s justification is quite similar to the one that Hitler used to justify his dictatorial powers .
After the terrorist attack on the German parliament building , Hitler went to his legislature and argued for a temporary suspension of civil liberties .
After heated discussion and debate , including Hitler ’s suggestion that such legislation was necessary to protect the freedom of the German people , the necessary number of votes for passage was finally secured .
The law granting dictatorial powers to Hitler became known as the  Enabling Act . 
How is this different , in principle , from Bush ’s claim that the authorization - of - force resolution that Congress enacted immediately after 9/11 gave him omnipotent powers to deal with the terrorists ?
There are two major problems with Bush ’s reasoning .
One is that , unlike Germany ’s Enabling Act , which expressly suspended civil liberties , the resolution enacted by Congress did not do any such thing .
Yet Bush is effectively interpreting it to mean that Congress granted him what the German Enabling Act granted Hitler — the power to override constitutional protections of civil liberties .
More important , however , is the fact that , under the U.S. Constitution , Congress is not empowered to pass laws that nullify the protections and guarantees in the Constitution .
The only way that any provision in the document can be nullified is through constitutional amendment .
A statutory attempt to nullify jury trials , search warrant requirements , due process of law , and right to counsel has no legal effect whatsoever .
The commander in chief justification
Bush ’s other justification for the assumption and exercise of omnipotent powers is his role as commander in chief of the armed forces during a time of war .
What war ?
The war on terrorism ,  which , again ironically , was the same type of war that Hitler declared after terrorists struck the Reichstag with a firebomb .
There is one crucial difference between Hitler ’s claim of power and Bush ’s claim of power , however .
The Enabling Act was only a temporary grant of powers .
Each time it was set to expire , Hitler would duly return to the Reichstag and secure legislation temporarily  extending it .
Bush ’s rationale for his omnipotent powers , on the other hand , is that , as the nation ’s military commander in chief in the war on terrorism ,  his omnipotent powers will last as long as the war continues .
Of course , since it is impossible to know with any degree of certainty when the last terrorist is exterminated or neutralized , that means that for all practical purposes the war on terrorism is perpetual , which means that Bush ’s powers are perpetual as well ( and will as well be held by his democratically elected successor in 2009 ) .
There is no merit whatsoever , however , to Bush ’s argument that the Constitution grants omnipotent powers to a president when he puts on the helmet of a military commander in chief .
In fact , there is no suggestion whatsoever in the Constitution that war gives rise to the exercise of any powers that nullify any of the other restrictions on power in the Constitution , especially in the Bill of Rights .
What Bush is relying on is the old European notion of imperial dictatorial powers that were claimed by a ruler when he led his military forces into war against another nation .
Think about Napoleon , who became a dictator by centralizing power , especially in his role as commander in chief of French military forces .
Or , closer to home , think of the president of Mexico , Santa Anna , whose centralization of power not only made him the  Napoleon of the West  but also precipitated the insurgency in Texas .
This is how Bush views himself as the nation ’s commander in chief — as a Napoleon or a Santa Anna , along with the omnipotent powers that those two dictators exercised .
It ’s the old European notion of inherent imperial powers granted the sovereign , both as emperor and as commander in chief of the nation ’s military forces .
There ’s just one big problem with Bush ’s analysis , however .
Our American ancestors fully and completely rejected the notion of inherent imperial powers with the enactment of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
That , in fact , was one major reason for limiting the powers of the president by expressly enumerating them in the Constitution — to negate the old European notion of inherent sovereign powers .
Dictatorship or liberty ?
Of course , there are those who say ,  The situation is not really that serious .
President Bush is a good man .
He can be trusted to do the right thing .
He wo n’t abuse these powers .
He ’s exercised them against only a few Americans . 
They ’re missing some important points .
One is that no matter how good a man President Bush is , dictatorships are the opposite of liberty and , therefore , are morally wrong , no matter how good or benevolent the dictator is .
Moreover , once dictatorial powers are relinquished to a good man ,  there is no assurance that he wo n’t become a bad man or that a bad man will not succeed him .
A good test is : Would I want the most despicable character I can think of — say , Adolf Hitler , Joseph Stalin , or Mao Zedong — to have any of these powers over me and my country ?
If your answer is  No ,  then your answer should be the same with respect to George W. Bush .
As history has shown , once a ruler is given dictatorial powers , there is no assurance that the powers will not be expanded to larger groups of people and abused much more extensively , especially if there is a huge crisis that strikes fear and panic among the citizenry .
After all , keep in mind that , in the absence of the terrorist strike on the Reichstag , Hitler might well not have been able to secure passage of the Enabling Act .
Ask yourself :
How would the compliant , Republican - controlled Congress respond to a request by President Bush for an expansion of powers if terrorists exploded a massive bomb today in the middle of the U.S. Capitol ?
Unfortunately , many Americans , like other people in history , do n’t want to face the disquieting truth about the dark and ominous direction in which their nation is currently headed .
They simply wish to bury their heads in the sand and not analyze too closely the logical implications of the president ’s and the Pentagon ’s position .
They do n’t want to face that we are now traveling in uncharted waters with respect to dictatorship .
Here is the unvarnished truth that Americans are trying to avoid confronting : Both the president and the Pentagon have repeatedly emphasized that the nation is at war .
It is a war against the terrorists .
In this war , the entire world is the battlefield , including both Iraq and the United States .
In this war , the president is the nation ’s commander in chief and , as such , wields omnipotent powers to defeat the enemy and win the war .
These powers include the power to arrest and punish Americans as illegal enemy combatants  — denying them jury trials , due process , lawyers , or any federal court interference .
They have the power to take people into custody and transport them to foreign regimes for torture .
They have the power to record telephone conversations without warrants .
In other words , the president and the Pentagon have the same powers to wage their war on terrorism in the United States as they have in Iraq .
Yes , you read that right — Iraq .
That is the logical consequence of what these people are saying .
They have the power to do everything they ’re doing in Iraq right here in the United States : the power to break people ’s doors down and search their homes and businesses without warrants ; the power to arrest and indefinitely detain people ; the power to torture and abuse prisoners and detainees ; the power to fire missiles into cars or apartment complexes where the terrorists  are traveling or hiding out ; the power to confiscate guns .

The case for higher speed limits on Hwy .
401

The Case For Higher Speed Limits on Hwy .
401 ( Trans - Canada Hwy )
Local News - Gord Thompson may be the only man in Ontario ever charged under the Highway Traffic
Act for obeying the letter of the law .
The teacher from Campbellford and another motorist caused a four - kilometre traffic jam on Highway 401 seven years ago by driving side by side at the posted 100 km/h speed limit .
They were charged with obstructing traffic and had their licences temporarily suspended .
Weeks earlier , Thompson had been ticketed for going 117 km/h on the same road and staged his slow - motion protest after a judge told him he was breaking the law by going even a kilometre over the posted limit .
 It still kind of gets my blood going ,  Thompson said this week .
 The number on the [ speed limit ] sign is nt the number you re expected to drive at and no one will tell you what the tolerance actually is .
Thompsons situation may be the most ludicrous application of Ontarios speeding laws but it puts into focus what motorists prove with their right feet  that 100 km/h is often too slow for the provinces 400 - series highways .
A recent study by University of Toronto researcher Baher Abdulhai found every single driver exceeding the speed limit on some stretches of highway that he and graduate student Jaime Abraham studied .
His study recommended that the speed limit be raised to a more realistic 130 km/h .
That finding mirrors dozens of similar studies done on expressways in North America and Europe .
Studies indicate that 85 per cent of motorists drive at speeds between 110 km/h and 130 km/h on the 401 .
According to most traffic experts , such a widespread variance from the posted speed means the limit should be raised .
And a survey of almost 300 motorists in Belleville several years ago found the majority of drivers wanted the speed limit increased by at least 10 km/h .
The provincial government , however , has dismissed the latest study , saying it has no intention of raising speed limits .
 Our own research suggests that raising the speed limits would in fact lead to an increase in traffic injuries and fatalities ,  said Transportation Ministry spokesman Anser Ahmed .
The response to his study has disappointed Abdulhai .
 I have not seen any counter - arguments based on fact ,  he said this week .
 It s all been ,  You re going to kill people ,  [ or ]
 There would be blood all over the roads .
He was particularly upset by some media reports on his findings .
 What surprised me was the reaction from the public [ in TV reports ] ,  he said .
In one report , they showed a 50 - 50 split among people about the higher limit , but in some locations measured in the report , 100 per cent of people were driving over the limit .
 If 100 per cent of the people are violating [ the law ] when they drive , wheres the 50 per cent that opposes higher limits ?
The 100 km/h limit was set in the 1970s as a conservation measure during the oil crisis .
Before that , the limit was 115 km/h , even though cars had few of the safety features that todays drivers enjoy .
Scrapped limit
The United States scrapped its gas - saving 55 mph limit several years ago and left it to the states to set speed limits .
Most opted for a 65 or even 75 mph ( 105 to 120 km / h ) limit on major highways .
Since then , people on both sides of the issue have been producing studies .
Critics of higher speed limits point to an increased number of deaths on some highways with higher limits .
Supporters say raising speed limits actually makes highways safer .
They argue higher speeds encourage motorists to use the road more .
With increased traffic , the number of fatalities per 100 million miles driven  one of the basic measures of road safety  actually falls .
 It s one of those cases where you use statistics any way you want to ,  said David Leonhardt of the Canadian Automobile Association , which supported Abdulhais conclusions if combined with a program of increased speed limit enforcement .
Michael Cain , director of research for the B.C. group Safety by Education Not Speed Enforcement ( SENSE ) , said the groups efforts to raise speed limits drew the same fears of carnage on the roads .
 They said  The faster you go , the harder you hit ,  but that totally ignores the human interaction of driving ,  he said .
 The whole argument ignores the fact that if you dont have an accident , you dont get hurt . 
Abdulhai himself says higher speeds are not dangerous and that speed differentials cause accidents .
A higher speed limit , he argues , will not cause people to drive faster ; it merely reflects what they are already doing .
 It s really basic stuff ,  Abdulhai said .
 It s not rocket science . 
 Reasonable 
Jim Baxter , president of the National Motorists Association , a U.S. consumers group that supports higher speed limits , said he was familiar with Abdulhais study .
 What your professor is saying is set the speed limit at the speed at which traffic is moving , which I think is a reasonable and prudent thing to do ,  he said .
 People dont have a death wish .
You re not out to hurt yourself or to drive faster than is safe for the road . 
Most of the resistance to higher limits comes from police and the insurance companies , which both profit from speeding tickets , he said .
 Police like the low limit because it gives them a reason to stop anyone they want ,  he said .
 The insurance industry has always supported lower limits . 
The other knock at the higher limits is that cars use more fuel at higher speeds .
Baxter shrugs off that point .
 Modern vehicles dont have nearly the differential in fuel consumption that they used to ,  he said .
 It s an argument that might have held sway in  75 [ But ] the individual should be allowed to decide if the saving of time is worth it . 
Baxter said he is familiar with environmental arguments but that highway policy shouldnt be based on ideology .
 There are side elements out there who dont like people having the right to go anywhere they want however fast they want to go ,  he said .
 There are environmentalists who would like to see us walk everywhere . 
Leonhardt of the CAA said a higher limit on the 401 would allow police to concentrate on the very fast and the very slow drivers , who present the most danger in traffic .
Those who drive over the limit should receive zero tolerance ,  he said .
 And for people who want to drive 80 , maybe a 400 - series highway is not where they ought to be .
Baxter noted that realistic speed limits would be welcomed by motorists in Kingston , for it would dramatically cut down on travel times to Toronto or Ottawa .
Higher speeds are not only safer , but economically beneficial , argued SENSEs Cain .
 What we need to look at in this issue is where will society benefit ?  he said .
 [ Higher speed limits ] can reduce the number of crashes and provide benefits to the economy .
Leeds - Grenville MPP
Bob Runciman , who has had a 600 - km round - trip commute for 21 years , has publicly supported a higher speed limit on the 401 , as did former transportation minister Al Palladini , but the issue has never caught fire at Queens Park .
The last push to raise the limit dissolved after a rash of accidents involving wheels flying off heavy trucks .
As for Thompson , he has not had a speeding ticket since he and his companion set out on their legal Sunday drive , but hed love to go back in front of a judge .
 You know , when we did the protest at 100 , we did not overtake one single vehicle ,  he recalled .
 If I get a ticket for going 120 on the 401 now , Id go before the judge and say  I cant go at 100 , another judge told me I cant drive 100 on the 401.
Leonhardt said that incongruity needs to be addressed .
 That s the predicament that people are in right now , and people shouldnt be in that predicament . 

 The insurance industry has always supported lower limits . 
The insurance industry likes lower limits because it means more tickets for a wider variety of people rather than the truly dangerous drivers .
More tickets gives the insurance companies more opportunities to jack up rates on people who get charged for doing 60 in a 55 zone .
The other knock at the higher limits is that cars use more fuel at higher speeds .
Baxter shrugs off that point .
 Modern vehicles dont have nearly the differential in fuel consumption that they used to ,  Right on target .
I remember some of these environmentalist types insisting that cars get 30 % worse gas mileage at 70 than they do at 55 .
My car at the time was rated at 27 mpg highway at 55 mph .
I consistently got 30 mpg when going 70 - 75 on vacations .
By their logic my car would get 39 mpg at 55 mph , so my car must have been an anti-lemon , getting 12 mpg more than the typical model .
Of course the reality is that there 's very little difference in mileage at 55 mph vs. 70 mph .
In fact , in a car with a big engine , 70 mph is likely more efficient .
As for the safety argument , it 's laughable .
Speed differential kills more than speed does .
Making the much safer freeways less driveable with politically set speed limits and putting more traffic on the other roads leads to * more * head on collisions and more deaths ( furthermore , most freeway deaths are single - car collisions , much moreso than on " regular " roads ) .
That does n't mean that speed limits should be 90 mph .
It does mean that most drivers proceed at a safe and reasonable speed given the conditions and speed limits should be set based on what people actually are driving .
62 mph ( 100 kph ) on the 401 is ridiculously low .
It should be 115 ( 71 mph ) .

Having traveled this highway many times , I have to laugh at the inconsistency of the different cout actions .

Leonhardt of the CAA said a higher limit on the 401 would allow police to concentrate on the very fast and the very slow drivers , who present the most danger in traffic .
Those who drive over the limit should receive zero tolerance ,  I drive I5 ( in California ) daily , and its 2 - lane segments are almost a duplicate of the 401 ( the more generous shoulders and escape areas of I5 are the notable differences ) .
The mix of truck and auto traffic is similar too .
Having done it for three years now , there is no question in my mind that the slower traffic is more responsible for accidents than the occasional nut doing 95 ( mph ) .
The speed nut usually ends up doing himself in .
The slower nut usually takes several to a dozen or more vehicles into his excitement ...

typically drive at 70 - 75 Mph now .
Just for the record , NJ increased speed limits from 55 to 65 on certain roadways , as an experiment .
( Most motorists were already driving 62 - 64 mph . )
The experiment worked fine , but I 've noticed a side effect : motoristsdrive at 70 - 75 Mph now .
In some of the western states , where 70 - 75 mph limits are posted , typical speeds are well in excess of the limit .
On the basis of very limited observation , I 've tentatively concluded people tend to exceed the speed limit - no matter how high you set it .
To : serinde
Once the U.S switches over to metric speed limits , the politicians and the enviro wackos will be tempted to set them at 90 km/h regardless of the highway and particular traffic conditions .
Besides the revenue involved there 's the aim of getting every one out of their cars .
Something about the government knowing best how to take care of global warming for you and urging you to live smarter as though you did n't know how .
To : genefromjersey
Your limited observation does n't qualify as traffic engineering data , though .
The freeways in the US typically have a design speed of 75 miles per hour .
Going much faster than that in a typical auto yeilds a significantly more precarious driving sensation .
The reason people are going 70 - 75 on the freeway now that you have a 65 mph limit , is that the artificial 55 mph limit and its excessive fines exerted downward pressure on the overall speed of traffic that has been somewhat relieved by the 65 mph speed limit .
People are driving closer to the safe design speed of the roadway because they 're no longer threatened with half a dozen points on their license and three years of exhorbitant insurance rates for doing so .
If the speed limit were set to 70 - 75 , or even repealed entirely , a variety of traffic engineering studies indicate that the overall speed of traffic would settle in at the safe speed for the road , rather than increasing in 10 mph increments over the posted limit .

I understand there are some unposted roads - I think the Autobahn is one - and I 've heard there are still some drivers who can't rest unless they 've passed everyone ; with others behind them trying to pass them !

On the basis of very limited observation , I 've tentatively concluded people tend to exceed the speed limit - no matter how high you set it .
I do n't know about that .
The Autobahn in Germany still has many stretches with no speed limit at all .
Most people seem to like to drive at around 130 km/h ( approx - 78 mph ) .
There 's always the BMWs that are driving in excess of 100 mph but for the most part it seems that around 130 km/h is a speed that most people like to drive- myself included .

other people who are going as fast as they are .
I think it 's important to point out people 's inconsistencies to them .
Ah , but inconveniencing them was the only way to make them think about their situation .
100 % drive over the limit , but only 50 % want it to increase .
The other 50 % are perfectly happy driving faster , but want the cops to stoppeople who are going as fast as they are .
I think it 's important to point out people 's inconsistencies to them .
And no , I was n't one in the congestion that day .

I drive 402 and 401 a few times a year .
Even though the limit is 62 mph , I usually do my customary 75 - 78 .
Even passed a couple of OPP ( Ontario Provincial Police ) with no problems .
I contend that a driver gets bored at slow speeds and loses their concentration .
That 's when accidents occur .
When you 're kicking it a bit , you have a heightened sense of awareness and become a better driver .
On the flip side , I was intentionally run off the road by some moron in a Kenworth .
he chased me for about 5 miles at sapeeds in excess of 85 m ph .
( BTW , my wife and three kids were in the car and visible as well )
At one point , he changed lanes , so I stayed where I was and backed off .
Moron jumped into my lane and sent me off into the rocks on the shoulder .
I 'm a real good driver , but not that good .
As I was sliding down the freeway sideways at 80 , obviously the hand of the Lord was on my wheel .
I had a long talk with his boss the next day .
If you care , it was Gerth Transport out of Kitchener .
Sorry about the long post , I just get a little excited when someone tries to kill my family .

It should be noted that since most drivers tend to drive prudently , speed enforcement tends to be focused on places where speeding is not dangerous .
The places where speeding really is dangerous , most people are prudent enough to drive slowly and there are n't enough maniacs to pay for enforcement efforts .
To : paul51
This tactic of driving in tandem at precisely the posted speed limit was used to great effect in the successful efforts of the National Motorists '
Association to repeal the national 55 mph speed limit in the US .
As annoying as it may be , it 's effective .

For years , he was the booze - soaked bard of the barstool , the keeper of ' a bad liver and a broken heart ' .
But Tom Waits was saved by his wife , has n't had a drink for more than a decade and , at 56 , is making the music of his life .
Interview by Sean O'Hagan
When Tom Waits was a boy , he heard the world differently .
Sometimes , it sounded so out - of - kilter , it scared him .
The rustle of a piece of paper could make him wince , the sound of his mother tucking him in at night might cause him to curl up as if in pain .
' It was n't a cool thing , ' he says , shaking his head lest there be any doubt .
' It was a frightening thing .
I mean , I thought I was mentally ill , that maybe I was retarded .
I 'd put my hand on a sheet like this [ rubbing his shirt ] and it'd sound like sandpaper .
Or a plane going by .'
He is rocking back and forward on his seat as he recalls this and you can tell that traces of it still linger .
' I think I was having a spell , ' he says , his creased , weather - beaten face crinkling even more .
' It would descend upon me at night when the house got quiet , and I 'd say to myself , " Uh - oh , here they come again . " '
He rocks some more .
They ?
I say , surprised .
Did he think he was possessed ?
' I really did n't know .
Could n't figure it out .'
Did he tell anyone ?
' I think I told my mum .
I 'm not sure .
See , I thought I 'd outgrow it .
Like acne .
Or masturbation . '
And he did eventually , though the thought of it still haunts him .
' I 've read that other people , artistic people , have experienced it , too , ' he says , still rocking .
' They 've had periods where there was a distortion to the world that disturbed them . '
So , here we are , 50 - odd years later , and Tom Waits has made a career out of distorting the world in an often disturbing way .
His songs often sound like they have been bashed out of shape , put through a wringer , then left to dry in the sun until they are parched and somehow pure of spirit .
On his new album , Orphans , which is really three albums in one , he grabs hold of a few songs belonging to other singers .
Daniel Johnston's ' King Kong ' becomes a bestial howl of despair , even more odd than the original .
He scares the daylights out of the Disney standard ' Heigh Ho ' , from Snow White , turning it into what sounds like a slave song set to the pounding of an ogre 's hammer .
' I like to go for that broken - down feel , ' he says , ' the disintegration of it all . '
Orphans is a big , sprawling map of disintegration , a triple album containing 54 songs , 30 of which are brand new , while the rest have been gathered up from various one - off projects , film soundtracks and stage plays .
His wife , Kathleen , once said there were two types of Tom Waits songs , ' the grim reapers and the grand weepers ' , but Orphans suggest there are at least three .
' Brawlers ' is made up of blues stomps and raw rockers ; ' Bawlers ' is full of those beautiful , broken - down ballads of his that always sound oddly familiar , and ' Bastards ' is a series of fits and starts , noisy outbursts that range from the cantankerous to the unhinged .
It 's the first time in over 20 albums that Waits has divided his music along such generic lines .
I figure that , at 56 , he 's finally mellowing out .
' Do n't know ' bout that , ' he says , sounding even more gruff than usual , maybe a little offended .
' Just thought it would make for easier listening if I put them in categories .
It 's a combination platter , rare and new .
Some of it is only a few months old , and some of it is like the dough you have left over so you can make another pie . '
And one song stands out .
Called ' Road to Peace ' , it concerns the Middle East conflict .
It 's not the kind of song he usually sings , though his last album also contained an anti-war song called ' The Day after Tomorrow ' .
This one is angrier .
' I was pissed off , ' he sighs , rubbing his eyes .
' Started with a line I read in the paper one day : " He studied so hard it was as if he had a future . "
It was about this kid who got blown up in a suicide bomb on a bus in Israel .
They say God does n't give you anything he knows you can't handle .
Well , I do n't know if I believe that .'
He 'll probably get his ass kicked , I say , for the line '... why are we arming the Israeli Army with guns and tanks and bullets ? '
He nods .
' Maybe .
Maybe .
But , we are .
That 's just a fact .
I guess any time anyone from outside a situation voices an opinion , it 's going to be , " Who the fuck are you ? "
Do n't matter what side you 're on .
But this song ain't about taking sides , it 's an indictment of both sides .
I tried to be as equitable as possible .'
The places and the incidents referred to in the song are all real , and the names of the people , too .
He 's well aware , he says , of the risk of making a song carry that kind of weight .
' I do n't really know what a song like that can achieve , but I was compelled to write it .
I do n't know if any genuine meaningful change could ever result from a song .
It 's kind of like throwing peanuts at a gorilla . '
Waits talks like he sings , in a rasping drawl and with an old - timer 's wealth of received wisdom .
It 's as if , in late middle - age , he has grown into the person he always wanted to be .
His tales are often tall , and his metaphors and similes tend towards the surreal .
' Writing songs is like capturing birds without killing them , ' he quips .
' Sometimes you end up with nothing but a mouthful of feathers . '
We are sitting out the back of the Little Amsterdam oyster bar , half an hour 's drive north of Petaluma , where they filmed Peggy Sue Got Married .
It 's the only diner with a windmill out front .
Tom 's kind of place : a slightly run-down Dutch diner where Mariachi bands used to play at weekends until the owner 's entertainment licence was revoked after he got busted for having an illegal trailer park out the back .
Tom 's signed the petition like everybody else who passes through .
Outside , as far as the eye can see , there are gently rolling sun-burnished hills , tall trees , grazing cattle .
It could be Tuscany except for the sign that says ' Open for Hamburgers ' .
This is Tom 's home turf .
He lives further on up the road somewhere , on a ranch deep in Napa Valley near Santa Rosa .
These days ,
Waits does not stray far from home ; the musicians come to him .
His tours tend to be short , and not very often .
' Gotta keep 'em hungry , ' he quips .
' You know what they say , " Do n't feed the dolphins or they 'll poke a hole in your boat next time you go out . " '
Around the back of the Little Amsterdam , near the ancient rubbish bins and the furniture that has died from overuse , we are seated at a rickety table beside an old broken - down , rain - warped piano .
Waits is drinking black coffee from a paper cup , wearing a suit at least one size too small , scuffed biker boots and a weather - beaten look that says , ' I 've seen it all . '
His hair is thinner now , but still has a mind of its own .
His guitar is nestling in a case on the tarmac , on which rests a well - worn porkpie hat .
He could have just stepped out of one of his own songs .
' Just look at this piano , ' he says , the voice low and hoarse , and just the way you 'd imagine it to be from his singing .
' Why has this piano been left out in the rain ?
It will never have a song pass through its chambers again .
That 's a sad thing , right ? '
I look at the piano , discarded and battered beyond repair by the elements , and I nod .
It is a sad thing .
Sad enough to end up in a Tom Waits song .
This is exactly the kind of place where the famously wayward piano in ' The Piano has been Drinking ( Not Me ) ' might have ended up .
Coincidentally , we 've just been talking about drinking , and about losing your way in the fog that can sometimes settle on a life when a person loses track of where he is , who he is , and where the hell he was going .
Way back , when I first stumbled on Tom Waits while rooting though a friend 's record collection , every song seemed to be about drinking and losing your way in the fog .
His first record was even called ' Closing Time ' , but it sounded more like a lock - in at the loneliest bar in the world .
Just
Tom in the corner slumped over the piano serenading the last few nighthawks with his slurred songs about heartaches and hangovers , and the girl that got away .
His persona had already been perfected by the time he started living in the Tropicana Motel in Los Angeles in 1975 , a faded establishment that also housed a couple of aristocratic junkies and several call girls who worked Sunset Strip .
For six albums on Asylum Records , from his aforementioned debut in 1973 to 1980 's Heartattack and Vine , Waits was the gravel - voiced , beer - stained bard of the barstool , a latter - day beatnik with a bad liver and a broken heart , whose fans were few and far between , but utterly devoted .
And , boy , did he pay his dues .
' I opened for Frank Zappa , for John Prine , Martha and the Vandellas , Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee , ' he says now , sighing at the memory of those never - ending tours , the Godforsaken juke joints and the bounced cheques .
' I even opened for Buffalo Bob .
Got to take it where you find it .'
Buffalo Bob , for the uninitiated , was a children 's television star who made his name in the Fifties with an old - fashioned puppet show .
' Used to watch him when I was four years old , ' laughs Waits .
' Now I 'm opening for him in Atlanta .
Every night he'd fill my piano with candy .
Used to call me Tommy .
I got him in a headlock one night , said , " You call me Tommy any more , I 'll snap your head off . " '
Back then , I saw Waits die a slow death in Ronnie Scott 's , during a residency that nearly drove him over the edge .
' Supporting Monty Alexander , ' he says , dryly .
' Got in a fight with Pete King [ the promoter ] .
We did n't see eye to eye .
I was young and naive .
I was new to everything and far from home . '
For a long while , it looked like Waits would remain a cult figure , out on the furthermost horizon of the Seventies music scene , a stumblebum troubadour raised on bourbon and Bukowski .
His music suggested and , to a lesser degree , still suggests , that the Sixties utterly passed him by ; that , in his self - contained universe , the Beats were far more important than the Beatles , and Sinatra took precedence over the Stones .
' You imitate what you grow up around , ' he says , when I mention this .
' If you grow up around Sinatra , Crosby and Louis Armstrong as a kid , it goes in and stays in .
But some of that Sixties stuff went in too . '
He was born Thomas Alan Waits in Pomona , California , on 7 December 1949 .
Both his parents were schoolteachers , but his comfortable middle - class childhood was ruptured when they divorced in 1960 .
This may have been around the time when he started hearing the world differently .
It was definitely the moment he became obsessed with finding another father .
I had read somewhere that , as a child growing up in San Diego , he could n't wait to get old , that he'd even pretend to be an old guy , wearing a hat and talking to the neighbours about hi-fi and home insurance .
Salvation of a sort came when he discovered Kerouac and Ginsberg in the Sixties , literary hipsters from the previous decade .
Until his wife came along two decades later , the Beat writers were his most important influence .
He pays homage to them one more time on Orphans , singing Kerouac 's forlorn road song ' Home I 'll Never Be ' , and reciting Bukowski 's beautiful poem ' Nirvana ' , both , in their own way , odes to rootlessness , restlessness , the fleeting , irrevocable moment when things could have been different .
The essence , in fact , of a good many Tom Waits songs .
Why , I ask , were the Beats so crucial to him ?
' They were father figures , ' he says softly , his long fingers tracing small circles in the coffee spill on the table .
' They were the ones I looked to for guidance .
See , my dad left when I was 10 , so I was always looking for a dad .
It was like , " Are you my dad ?
Are you my dad ?
What about you ?
Are you my dad ? "
I found a lot of these old salty guys along the way . '
The trains that turn up again and again in his songs also hint at a childhood restlessness , an urge for going that would stay with him until he met the woman he would marry .
' When I was a kid and we went on a car trip , ' he says , sounding wistful , 'it seemed like we had to stop and wait for a train to go by every two miles .
Seemed like there were train crossings everywhere , nothing but train crossings . '
In adolescence , that restlessness grew profound .
Waits left home when he was 15 , finding temporary work first as a cook and later as a night - club bouncer .
He was constantly on the move , often living out of his car , always writing songs .
On the likes of Small Change and Blue Valentine , you can hear the lipstick traces of countless torch singers , as well as echoes of Sinatra 's gloriously woebegone album , In the Wee Small Hours .
His voice , though , kept fame at bay , and was once memorably described by a reviewer as ' that of a drunken hobo arguing with a deli owner over the price of a bowl of soup ' .
As wonderful as many of those early albums are , the act was wearing thin .
So , too , was his ambition , his spirit .
In 1977 , he fell for the singer Rickie Lee Jones , whose wayward life echoed his own , and whose most famous song , ' Chuck E's in Love ' , paid homage to their mutual friend Chuck E Weiss .
Waits and Weiss were arrested that same year for disturbing the peace in Duke 's Tropicana Coffee Shop .
His life was unravelling .
' I had a problem , ' he says , matter - of - factly .
' An alcohol problem , which a lot of people consider an occupational hazard .
My wife saved my life .'
Kathleen Brennan was a scriptwriter whom Waits met in 1978 , while just starting out on his other , more fitful career as a character actor .
The two first crossed paths on the set of Paradise Alley , a vehicle for the young Sylvester Stallone , with a bit part for Waits , who played a version of himself , a pianist called Mumbles .
Brennan and Waits were married in 1980 , just a year after he had split with Jones , who would later say , ' What Tom wanted to do was live in a bungalow with screaming kids and spend Saturday nights at the movies . '
There was a lot more to it than that , though .
An Illinois farm girl from Irish Catholic stock , Kathleen was the catalyst for the dramatic sea-change in Waits 's music that occurred with the release of Swordfishtrombones in 1983 .
' I did n't just marry a beautiful woman , ' he says , ' I married a record collection . '
The songs he writes with Kathleen are often filled with echoes of older songs .
A new song called ' Widow 's Grove ' begins with a melody borrowed from the old Irish song ' The Rose of Tralee ' .
He married Kathleen in Tralee .
On Orphans , you can also hear traces of John Lee Hooker and John McCormack , the Louvin Brothers and the Clancy Brothers .
His record collection , and her's .
' It 's all in there , ' he smiles .
' Crop failures , dad dying , train wrecks .
It all gets handed down , and everything you absorb you 're going to secrete .
A lot of those old songs stick to you , and others blow right through you , and some of them get trapped in there .
You keep hearing them every time you sit down at the piano . '
Kathleen has been his collaborator for almost 25 years now .
They have three children , Casey , Kelly and Sullivan , and Casey currently plays drums in his dad 's band .
When Waits was once asked what his wife brought to the table , he replied , ' Blood and liquor and guilt . '
Which is handy , because Waits himself has n't had a drink for 14 years .
When he says that Kathleen saved his life , he means it literally .
' Oh yeah , for sure , ' he continues , rocking back and forth again .
' But I had something in me , too .
I knew I would not go down the drain , I would not light my hair on fire , I would not put a gun in my mouth .
I had something abiding in me that was moving me forward .
I was probably drawn to her because I saw that there was a lot of hope there . '
Given that his early songs , his voice and his persona , were drenched in drink , how hard was it for him to give up ?
' Oh , you know , it was tough .
I went to AA .
I 'm in the programme .
I 'm clean and sober .
Hooray .
But , it was a struggle . '
Does he miss the odd night - cap ?
' Miss drinking ? ' he says , sounding genuinely surprised .
' Nah .
Not the way I was drinking .
No , I 'm happy to be sober .
Happy to be alive .
I found myself in some places I can't believe I made it out of alive . '
That bad , huh ?
' Oh yeah .
People with guns .
People with gunshot wounds .
People with heavy drug problems .
People who carried guns everywhere they went , always had a gun .
You live like that , ' he says , without a trace of irony , ' you attract lower company . '
I ask if he wrote a different kind of song when he was drinking .
He thinks about this for an instant , then says , ' No .
I do n't think so .
I mean , one is never completely certain when you drink and do drugs whether the spirits that are moving through you are the spirits from the bottle or your own .
And , at a certain point , you become afraid of the answer .
That 's one of the biggest things that keeps people from getting sober , they 're afraid to find out that it was the liquor talking all along . '
For a while , Waits had that fear himself , the fear that when he finally dried out the songs would dry up , too .
He worked through it , though .
' I was trying to prove something to myself , too , ' he says , revealingly .
' It was like , " Am I genuinely eccentric ?
Or am I just wearing a funny hat ? "
All the big questions come up when you get sober .
" What am I made of ?
What 's left when you drain the pool ? " '
Pushing my luck , I ask what was the first album he made when he was clean and serene .
It turns out to be a question too far .
' First sober album ? ' he says , suddenly sounding slightly tetchy .
' Well , if it matters to anybody other than me ...'
The sentence trails off and hangs in the air , unfinished .
' I do n't know if I want to answer that , ' he says finally .
' That 's a kind of personal thing . '
Instead , we talk some more about songs and songwriting , the essential mystery of it all .
You can tell he respects his gift , nurtures it , and does n't ever take it for granted ; that he has a faith in the song that is almost spiritual .
Lately , that faith has started to pay off commercially .
His last album , 2004 's Real Gone , a rugged affair even by Waits 's standards , followed 1999 's Mule Variations into the American and British pop charts .
Before that , he had only ever dented the mainstream by proxy , when other people covered his songs , most notably Rod Stewart , who took ' Downtown Train ' into the Top Ten .
The actor Scarlett Johansson has just announced her plan to record an entire album of Waits 's songs next year .
As our allotted time runs out , and Waits grows fidgety , we start trading favourite songs , stories , jokes .
He has a good one about Barry Manilow and a pair of Siamese twins .
Finally , I ask him about ' Fanning Street ' , a windswept Waitsian ballad from Orphans that has intrigued me since I first heard it , not least because it borrows a title , and maybe even a mood , from an old blues song by the legendary Leadbelly .
' Well , he died the day after I was born - 8 December 1949 , ' says Waits .
' I always felt like I connected with him somehow .
He was going out and I was coming in .
And , maybe we passed in the hall .
I would love to have seen Leadbelly play , but that 's the great thing about records , you put them on and those guys are right there in the room .
They 're back . '
He picks up his hat and slaps the dust off it .
' I think about that sometimes .
Some day I 'm gonna be gone and people will be listening to my songs and conjuring me up .
In order for that to happen , you gotta put something of yourself in it .
Kinda like a time capsule .
Or making a voodoo doll .
You gotta wrap it with thread , put a rock inside the head , then use two sticks and something from a spider web .
You gotta put it all in there to make a song survive . '
I tell him I think he 's safe enough on that score .
And they 'll be lingering in the air long after both of us are gone , the best Tom Waits songs .
Like shadows , like ghosts , like echoes .
· Orphans is released by Anti-Records on 20 November

Dealing with the millions of RSS and Atom feeds out there is hard work .
We 're not trying to make you feel sorry for the Reader team , but as anyone who has attempted to implement a feed parser knows , there are many subtle deviations from the spec that you have to handle if you want to have any hope of satisfying the needs of your users ( who should n't have to care about such things ) .
The feed generating / parsing world has had the debate about Postel 's Law , as it applies to XML and feeds , several times .
We are not here to weigh in on either side of the argument .
Instead , we hope to provide some data so that such discussions can be made on more than philosophical grounds .
Without further ado , here are the top XML errors that we have encountered when parsing all of the feeds that our users have added to Reader ( and there are a lot of them ) :
% of errors Error description 15.6 % Input claims to be UTF - 8 but contains invalid characters .
14.9 % Opening and ending tags mismatch 13.9 %
An undefined entity is used ( e.g. in an XML document without importing the HTML set ) 7.8 % Documented expected to begin with a start tag , but no < was found 5.7 % Disallowed control characters present 5.5 % Extra content at the end of the document 4.2 % Unterminated entity reference ( missing semi- colon ) 4.2 % Unquoted attribute value 3.8 % Premature end of data in tag ( truncated feed ) 3.3 % Naked ampersand ( should be represented as & ) 2.1 % XML declaration allowed only at the start of the document 1.8 % Namespace prefix is used but not defined 0.75 % Comment not terminated 0.64 % Attribute without value 0.17 % Unescaped < not allowed in attributes values 0.11 % Malformed numerical entity reference 0.11 % Unsupported / invalid encoding 0.10 % Comment must not contain '--' 0.10 % Attribute defined more than once 0.07 % Char out of allowed range 0.03 % Comment not terminated 0.02 % Sequence ] ]> not allowed in content
As a whole , about seven percent of all feeds that we know about have some of these errors ( this data is based on a one - day snapshot , so transient errors may be present ) .
Note that these are all XML errors , meaning that the feed is not well - formed .
We are not talking about complying with and validating against the RSS or Atom specs - that is an even higher bar than we have set here .
In general , our recommendation to feed producers is to use the work that the community has put into the feed validator .
On a related note , we 're aware that Reader has some issues with titles .
It 's great that there are test cases , and we will add this bug to our to - do list .
