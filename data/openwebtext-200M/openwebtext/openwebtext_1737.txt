Huckabee talks about gay marriage ' ick factor , ' jokes about Pelosi affair
In a long New Yorker profile assessing his 2012 chances , former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee explained his opposition to gay marriage : " We can get into the ick factor , but the fact is two men in a relationship , two women in a relationship , biologically , that does n't work the same . "
But Huckabee was not above joking about the issue :
At times , he seems unable to resist the force of his own funniness .
I joked with him once that I would write about his ( fictitious ) affair with Nancy Pelosi .
He e-mailed back , " The only thing worse than a torrid affair with sweet , sweet Nancy would be a torrid affair with Helen Thomas .
If those were my only options , I 'd probably be FOR same - sex marriage ! "
Huckabee earlier this year compared gay marriage to incest and polygamy .

There you are , mid-recipe , and you realize that the ingredients list does n't say milk .
It says buttermilk .
Or maybe you knew going in that it said buttermilk , but you balked at spending the money to buy a whole quart when you only needed a small amount .
Fear not .
Any of these substitutes can be used in place of buttermilk , and they 'll save you a little money , too .
What You 'll Need
All you need to create your own batch of buttermilk is regular milk — just a little less than a cup — and a tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice .
Preparation
Place the white vinegar or lemon juice in a liquid measuring cup and add enough milk to bring the liquid up to the one - cup line .
Now let the mixture stand for 5 to 10 minutes , long enough for the milk to thicken and curdle .
Voila — buttermilk !
Use as much of the batch as your recipe calls for .
If you 're cooking for someone who has a dairy sensitivity , this works with non-dairy milk , too .
If you only have soy milk or almond milk in the fridge , that 's fine , but you 'll want to stick to an unflavored variety .

You can also try one of these options in a pinch :
Yogurt :
Add regular milk or water to thin plain yogurt to achieve the consistency of buttermilk .
About 3/ 4 cup yogurt mixed with 1 /4 cup water usually works well .

Kefir : Replace the buttermilk called for in your recipe with an equal amount of kefir if you have any on hand .
It contains lactic acid , just like buttermilk does , so it will do the same job .
Why These Substitutes Work
These substitutes create a good flavor approximation of buttermilk , but they do a lot more than that .
Whenever you see a pancake , quick bread or batter recipe that calls for buttermilk , it 's there to act as the acid in the recipe .
When the acid in the buttermilk interacts with the baking soda in the recipe , it ​leavens the batter or dough .
This allows it to rise without the addition of yeast .
Your baked goods will still be light and fluffy .
This is why so many pancake recipes include buttermilk .
All the buttermilk substitutes outlined above include an acid to perform this important function in your recipe .
Never Run Out of Buttermilk Again
If you never seem to have buttermilk when you need it , or if you buy some for a recipe but most of it goes bad before you find another use for it , consider switching to powdered buttermilk .
Similar to powdered milk , it can be reconstituted whenever you need it and in whatever quantity you need .
Saco is the most common brand .
Look for it near the powdered milk at the grocery store , or order it online .
So there you have it .
Never spend your hard - earned dollars on store - bought buttermilk again .
With a little creativity and a few ingredients that are probably already in your cupboard , you do n't have to .
Crafts Knitting How to Knit Left - Handed
How to Knit Left - Handed
By Pam Allen , Shannon Okey
Learning how to knit when you ’re left - handed takes a little adjustment .
The biggest issue that left - handed knitters face is that most knitting patterns are written for right - handed knitters .
If you can master either English knitting ( the common method that has you hold the yarn in your right hand , ) or Continental knitting ( a method that requires yarn to be in the left hand ) , you wo n’t have to reinterpret patterns in order to work them in reverse .
Chances are , like most right - handed knitters , sooner or later you ’ll work out a series of movements that feel natural and easy , and your stitches will be smooth and even .
That initial awkward feeling may not go away , so try this :
Work in reverse — move the stitches from the right - hand needle to the left - hand one .
Follow the pattern instructions , substituting the word right for left and vice versa .
To make the illustrations work for you , hold a mirror up to the side of the relevant illustration and mimic the hand and yarn positions visible in the mirror image .
If you find that working in reverse is the most comfortable method , be aware that some directions in knitting patterns , such as decreases , look different when worked in the opposite direction .
This quirk will be most problematic for lace patterns , but it ’s a small price to pay for comfortable knitting .

Pretty , though I too would be happier if the sockets were coffeeproofed .
What I might have done differently :
I would have been inclined to leave the inverter box closed ( preserving the warranty ) and just design a wiring harness that plugged into it and extended the 110VAC and USB connections out to the panel .
The only problem with this approach is that your inverter has a push - on / push off switch .
If your inverter had a simple toggle switch , it could be left turned on , and power to the inverter run through a panel switch -- or , perhaps better given the peak power draw , a high - current relay could be controlled by a lower - power switch circuit .
An advantage of the latter is that the switch could be fed from accessory , or could be a three - way which tapped either accessory or an always - on circuit , to reduce the risk of leaving the inverter drawing power when it should n't and running your battery down .
( Same reason dome lights are now three - way , and many headlights go off when -- or shortly after -- key is removed . )
Given the pushbutton ...
Hm .
What happens if the button is held down before / while 12V is applied to the inverter ?
Would that be enough to cheat it into being externally switchable ?
If so , rigging something to hold the button down continuously would be easy and -- again -- would probably not void the warranty .
Yeah , the motto here is " If you ca n't open it you do n't own it " -- but if you can find a way to achieve the same result with less work and without having to open it , that 's preferable .
By the end of this year , Austinites should be able to buy the new electric car from Chevrolet , called the Volt .
By next February , hundreds of Leafs , Nissan 's plug - in car , will be on the roads around Houston , which also announced on Thursday that it would allow purchasers of the Volt to charge their cars for free .
Already , at least 30 Texans own Teslas , a high - end plug - in roadster .
The numbers are n't exactly earth - shattering — there are 21 million - plus cars on Texas roads .
But the new influx should more than double the number of plug - in vehicles in the state , estimated to be in the low hundreds by a representative for the electric vehicle consortium Plug -in Texas .
" Austin is one of America 's greenest cities , " said Edward Whitacre , Jr. , GM 's chief executive , as he announced earlier this month that Texas — starting with Austin — will be among the Volt 's first seven markets .
( Whitacre , the former chairman and CEO of San Antonio - based SBC , is a Texas Tech University graduate who was born in Ennis . )
GM also has more dealerships in Texas than in any other state .
It does not yet know how many Volts will be shipped to Austin dealers , but the initial delivery will likely number in the low hundreds .
The vehicles are touted as green because they use little if any gasoline .
A 2010 U.S. Department of Transportation analysis found that plug - in hybrid electrics like the Volt can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 49 percent and 75 percent compared with a conventional vehicle — including the emissions created by plants generating the electricity the cars use .
The Volt allows customers to go 40 miles on a charge , after which a gasoline engine kicks in , giving the car a 340 - mile range .
The project represents stark departure for the embattled GM — creator of the gas - guzzling Suburban , the national car of Texas — and a large bet that consumers will fork over an estimated $ 35,000 to $ 40,000 in a segment where long - term reliability and resale remain uncertain .
The Nissan Leaf , a smaller car , costs nearly $ 33,000 .
The Tesla Roadster , which rips through 0 - 60 in about four seconds and has become the favored celebrity toy , costs upwards of $ 100,000 .
A state program called the Texas Emissions Reduction Plan subsidizes companies with fleet vehicles , such as buses or taxis , to replace old , dirty vehicles with alternative - fuel vehicles , including plug-ins .
But the program , which pays up to 80 percent of the cost of replacement vehicles , has yet to finance any electric vehicles , according to Terry Clawson , a spokesman for the Environmental Commission on Environmental Quality , which runs TERP .
The program has , however , financed " quite a few " electric forklifts , he said .
Another TCEQ program , called Clean Fleet , is considering its first round of applications and has received one application for three electric vehicles from the city of Austin .
For individuals , the state has done little to encourage electric cars .
In his State of the State speech last year , Gov. Rick Perry voiced support for a $ 5,000 incentive for Texans buying plug-ins in " non-attainment areas , " an Environmental Protection Agency designation meaning the areas failed to meet clean - air standards .
Houston , Dallas , Fort - Worth and the Beaumont - Port Arthur area make that list .
A state Senate bill last year offered a $ 4,000 subsidy , but it failed to pass , and its sponsor , Sen. Kip Averitt , R - Waco , has since retired .
California — home to more than 1,500 electric vehicles , including 500 Teslas , according to a California electric - car group — gives buyers a tax credit of up to $ 5,000 .
Some local governments in Texas , however , have signed on enthusiastically .
Houston ’s city government has ordered 100 Nissan Leaf vehicles and already has installed 10 city charging stations , one at city hall .
It plans to use federal grant money to install 15 more stations .
" If people see these electric cars can work in Houston — which has been seen as the oil and gas capital of the nation if not the world — I think other cities will see they can do this too , " said Laura Spanjian , Houston 's sustainability director .
Austin Energy offers a modest incentive for plug-ins .
The utility also anticipates acquiring a few Volts for itself , along with about a dozen plug - in Dodge Ram pick - ups next year .
It is also converting 20 or more of its Priuses to be plug-ins , according to Karl Rábago , the utility 's vice president of distributed energy services , and plans to put in a number of charging stations around Austin ; these might also be available for electric bikes and scooters , he said .
The federal government offers a hefty tax credit worth up to $ 7,500 for purchasers of electric vehicles and pumps out additional subsidies to encourage their use .
Jenny Danieau , the senior transportation planner at the North Central Texas Council of Governments , says that so far her group has received $ 13.1 million from the Department of Energy for alternative - fuel vehicles , including electrics .
Projects receiving money include two electric recharging stations in Dallas , one at Frito - Lay , the other at Dallas - based Canteen Vending .
Federal money channeled through the state energy office had added another $ 2.5 million , and her group is also applying for still more funding for alternative - fuel vehicles through the Environmental Protection Agency .
Texas utilities , which sense an exciting new market for electricity , are preparing for the arrival of more electric cars .
NRG , which owns the retail electricity business of Reliant Energy in Houston , plans to add 40 to 50 rapid - charging stations around the city .
They will be positioned so that anyone driving on Interstate 10 in the city will never be more than five miles from a charging station , according to Mike Harrigan , the general manager of the company 's energy electric - vehicle services .
These rapid - charge stations would bring a Nissan Leaf car to 80 percent in 25 minutes , though they may be better suited to even shorter " top-ups . "
NRG has sought partnerships with such retailers as Starbucks so that drivers can get a latte while the car charges .
Other stations , to be placed in offices , would take hours to charge .
The fast - charging stations can cost up to $ 50,000 to put in place , NRG said .
The slower - charging ones would be nearer $ 5,000 .
But NRG anticipates that 80 percent of charging will be done at home , at night .
That ’s when the wind blows hardest in Texas , creating a good use of the renewable power , though utilities will need to make certain that everyone does n't start charging all at once , at 6 p.m. , when they come home from work .
Home charging stations may typically cost up to $ 2,000 , according to Harrigan — with the exact figure depending on technical issues such as whether you have space on your electric panel for an extra circuit - breaker .
NRG will offer customers a payment package that would include installation of a home charging station and electricity for charging at home and in the city .
Over the long term , Texas ' electric car boosters hope that the state and cities will pile on more incentives for the vehicles .
They dream of close - in or discounted airport parking , reduced tolls , tax credits and even HOV lanes open to solo - driven plug-ins ( California just ousted the Toyota Prius gas - electric hybrid from the HOV lanes but will keep them open for electrics ) .
" We 're going to keep working as hard as we can , ” said Spanjian , “ to show people we really want these cars . "
Again dont know the circumstance of the Pull - over other than its listed as a felony stop .
But its clear as day they are telling the police theres a dog in the car and I believe thats why they closed the doors so I guess the Cop did not believe him and went and opened the door .
Well see for yourself
They kill the dog .
It appears to go out then circle around towards a cop and the cop just shoots it dead .
Finally there ’s a piece of good news for iPhone 3G users : an iOS4 fix appears to be on the way .
While iOS4 promised many new features for iPhone 3G users , the OS was more trouble than it was worth for most .
Users saw their iPhones grind to a halt , to the degree that they were nearly unusable .
Users had held out hope that Apple ’s hasty iOS4.0.1 patch would rectify the problem .
Unfortunately for the affected users , the problems were not fixed and running iOS4 remained an unpopular option among iPhone 3G owners .
The problem may end soon , though .
In our tests , it appears that the massive slow - downs that iPhone 3G users experienced with iOS4 could become a thing of the past with Apple ’s next software update .
Tests with a beta version of Apple ’s iOS 4.1 on a well - used 3G suggest that the new OS has increased the phone ’s responsiveness .
Indeed , apps load much more quickly , text entry is much smoother and the phone no longer slows down beyond the point of usability when more than one browser window is open .
The fix is very welcome , but it brings up an interesting question .
Why did n’t Apple catch this issue ?
It seems like they barely even tested iOS4 on the iPhone3G .
Apple did limit the functionality that iOS4 provides on the iPhone3G , probably for this reason .
Yet , even with this reduced functionality , the OS runs so slowly on the device that it verges on unusable .
It ’s almost as if Apple wanted 3G users to see in vivid detail exactly what they were missing out on because they did n’t upgrade to a newer device : a smooth operating system .
The video below is a parody , but it paints a painfully accurate portrait of what grappling with iOS4.0 on the iPhone3G is like .
Before upgrading to iOS4 , most apps ran smoothly and crashes were a rare experience .
With iOS4 , the user experience is much closer to the way this video portrays it .
While iOS4.1 does fix the issue , it forces us to consider when the beta OS will become available for widespread use .
While you can download the beta today , it will essentially brick your phone unless it is registered as a developer ’s device .
Apple needs to push this update out as quickly as possible .
While not as desperate a problem as the iPhone4 ’s signal reporting problem , this issue still affects tens ( if not hundreds ) of thousands of users .
The issue probably wo n’t become the PR nightmare that the deathgrip disaster was , but it ’s certainly not looking good .
Many users are so sick of the problem that they have downgraded to iOS3.1.3 to make their phones useful again .
These users are mad , and the only way to placate them is to fix the issue by releasing this new update .
Thanks to Mahmood Andishmand for helping with the iOS beta .

Israel - protest i Stortinget
STORTINGET ( VG Nett )
En gruppe stortingsrepresentanter stilte tirsdag med palestinaskjerf for å vise sin støtte til palestinerne etter Israels angrep på den internasjonale nødhjelpskonvoien .
Oppdatert 1 . juni 2010

Det er svært uvanlig at stortingsrepresentanter bærer klesplagg eller andre politiske symboler i stortingssalen .
Initiativtaker Hadia Tajik ( Ap ) mener likevel denne saken gjør det nødvendig med spesielle virkemidler .
- Dette er vår måte å vise solidaritet med den palestinske sivilbefolkningen .
Det som har skjedd er et uakseptabelt brudd på folkeretten .
Vi mener blokaden av Gaza må oppheves og ulovlige bosetninger må fjernes , sier Tajik til VG Nett .
VGTV : Her slår aktivistene soldatene med jernstenger
Politisk standpunkt
Minst ni mennesker ble drept da israelske soldater mandag bordet flere skip med hjelpesendinger til Gaza i internasjonalt farvann .
SV - veteranen Halgeir Langeland var blant representantene som valgte å bruke det symboltunge skjerfet under dagens debatt i Stortinget .
I tillegg deltok flere av de unge Ap - representantene i aksjonen .
NUPI -DIREKTØR :- Angrepet er helt ødeleggende for Israel
Stortingspresident Dag Terje Andersen valgte imidlertid å ikke slå ned på den spesielle uniformeringen da han åpnet stortingsmøtet .
Tajik er ikke overrasket over den manglende påpakningen fra presidenten .
- Det er veldig rart hvis man ikke kan uttrykke politiske strandpunkter i stortingssalen , sier Tajik .
Nordmenn uskadd
FNs sikkerhetsråd fordømmer handlingene som førte til at sivile liv gikk tapt under bordingen av skipene utenfor Gaza natt til mandag .
SPESIAL : Se bildespesial fra angrepet her
I en uttalelse tirsdag ber rådet også om at det raskt settes i gang en uavhengig og troverdig etterforskning av hendelsen .
Videre ber Sikkerhetsrådet om at sivilpersoner og skip som nå befinner seg i Israels varetekt , umiddelbart blir løslatt .
USA og de andre medlemmene av rådet ble enige om uttalelsen etter å ha drøftet saken i over ti timer .
Også norske myndigheter har fordømt det israelske angrepet , og utenriksminister Jonas Gahr Støre har bedt FN om å iverksette full gransking av hendelsen .
Tre nordmenn var om bord i skipet som ble bordet av israelske soldater , men Utenriksdepartementet bekrefter at disse er uskadd .

Organizers of the 2015 Pan Am Games are searching for a Toronto stadium to host the showcase track and field events after scrapping plans to hold them in Hamilton .
Ian Troop , chief executive of the organizing committee , confirmed a change in location of the venue , required to hold at least 15,000 fans , in a conference call with reporters Thursday afternoon .
The track events are “ going to be in Toronto .
We ’re looking at a couple of options , finalizing some details there but that ’s probably where it ’s going to end up . ”
Troop said it appears Hamilton will get soccer games instead .
Plans to host track events in a purpose - built Hamilton stadium were shelved after a furious debate in that city over where it should be located , with city hall at loggerheads with the eventual tenant , the Hamilton Tiger - Cats .
Pan Am organizers had given them until Aug. 12 to agree on a site , but the final straw appears to have been strong opposition from Athletics Canada which , the Hamilton Spectator reported Thursday , asked for the move amid the stadium uproar and concerns the track facilities would be ripped up to make way for football .
The Star ’s Dave Perkins reported Thursday that Pan Am track was coming to Toronto and that York University is the leading candidate to host it .
Other options include Downsview or the construction of a new , small stadium , he said .
York University is open to hosting the track events but there is currently no facility anywhere near big enough , said Keith Marnoch , the university ’s associate director of media relations .
“ We ’ve consistently said that if York can be part of a solution we would be open to talking about it , ” Marnoch said .
He noted that York hosts major tennis tournaments at the Rexall Centre .
The main venue holds about 12,000 people .
The City of Toronto operates the 32 - year - old Metro Toronto Track and Field Centre on the northern edge of York ’s campus , with an outdoor facility that can hold 2,500 people .
Troop said requirements include that the track venue be in the GTA , close to mass transit , have the infrastructure to accommodate the events and spectators and that it leave a legacy in terms of sports facilities .
Organizers are looking at either an existing facility or one to be built , Troop said , adding : “ There is certainly a lot of interest so part of the process over the next little while is to work through that to get the right decision . ”

Later Thursday , the Ticats proposed at a news conference that a Pan Am park , rather than a stadium , be built on the West Harbour site , and promised to pay part of the construction and upkeep costs .
The team says the waterfront site does n’t have enough parking for a stadium and favours a suburban location .
The Ticats say the new park could include the Pan Am velodrome and a 3,500 - seat ampitheatre that would be used for about two dozen concerts and religious gatherings , says a report on the Spectator ’s website , thespec.com .

The backup plan would involve continuing to collect the oil through several systems at the wellhead and pumping it through a subsea pipeline to an existing production platform at least several miles away .
Mr. Wells said several platforms had been identified as possibilities , although no decisions had been made .
BP is currently drilling two relief wells from rigs that are each about a half - mile from the site of the blown - out well .
The first well is about a thousand feet vertically from the interception point and more than 17,000 feet below sea level .
The second well , which was started about two weeks later than the first , is not as far along , and Mr. Wells said Monday that if the first well succeeded in plugging the gusher , drilling of the second would be halted .
“ We feel very good about the progress we ’ve made , ” he said .
The company was still holding to a timetable of early August for completion of the first relief well , Mr. Wells added , barring delays due to bad weather .
Tropical Storm Alex , which is expected to become a hurricane and is on track to hit Texas , is not expected to delay the drilling effort .
Mr. Wells said that the first well had closed within about 20 feet horizontally of the damaged well , and that crews would be conducting 8 to 12 more magnetic ranging tests  each of which takes about half a day  to determine the precise location of the metal casing pipe in the damaged well bore .
The goal is to continue to drill the relief well in parallel with the damaged well to within about 200 feet vertically of the interception point , and within five feet horizontally .
Then the remaining 200 feet will be drilled , and a milling device will be used to cut into the casing pipe of the runaway well .
Once the two wells are connected , heavy drilling mud will be pumped down the relief well and into the damaged well ’s bore , building up a column of mud that would eventually exert enough downward force to overcome the pressure of the rising oil .
Mr. Wells said there were roughly 44,000 barrels of mud available at the site .
The advantage of such a “ bottom kill ” is that it immediately starts to reduce pressure in the damaged well bore as the column of mud builds up , Mr. Wells said .
This is in contrast to the “ top kill ” procedure , which was tried unsuccessfully last month , in which pressure builds as mud is pumped into the top of the well .
BP officials said one reason the top - kill effort was abandoned was out of concern that a pressure buildup might damage the well .
The technician , who has knowledge of the effort , said he was optimistic that the relief - well procedure would succeed , in part because the frictional pressure of the mud in the well bore would contribute to its ability to overcome the pressure of the oil .
But he said BP would improve its chances for success if it waited for the second relief well to be completed , so that it could pump twice as much mud into “ a well that ’s this powerful , this productive and this problematic . ”
As a designer you can't help but think about weird stuff .
I can't help but imagine that if curious space aliens with no knowledge of human artifacts came to this planet and went through my apartment , they 'd initially find little to distinguish one possession from another .
But I 'd be willing to wager that it is the iPhone 4 , amidst the clutter of objects on my desk , that they would pick up and begin inquisitively licking or running their antennae over or what have you .
The new iPhone is currently the standout object on my desk , this thing that looks like a mere black rectangle from across the room but starts to look like something very different at the range it 's meant to be used at .
Holding it , you understand at once why Apple has physical stores ; while you can watch iPhone commercials or see print campaigns about its features , when you first hold this exquisitely - crafted object you have a different experience entirely , one that cannot be adequately conveyed in two dimensions .
Having seen countless photos of the device in advance , I was still surprised by the real thing when I popped it out of the box and touched it .
" A big part of the experience of a physical object has to do with the materials , " says Jonathan Ive , Apple 's Senior Vice President of Design , during a brief chat with Core77 .
" [ At Apple ] we experiment with and explore materials , processing them , learning about the inherent properties of the material -- and the process of transforming it from raw material to finished product ; for example , understanding exactly how the processes of machining it or grinding it affect it .
That understanding , that preoccupation with the materials and processes , is [ very ] essential to the way we work . "
It is this sort of materials obsession and constant experimentation that led to a decision to use scratch - resistant aluminosilicate glass for the front and back of the phone , as well as developing their own variant of stainless steel to edge the device .
When you see the breaks , the three little black reveals that interrupt the band , in photographs , you could be forgiven for assuming you 're seeing three separate strips of metal with gaps in between ; but in fact it 's all one piece .
" Those three black splits are co-molded in , and then the band goes through more processes , " Ive points out .
" So it 's assembled first , the band , and then the final machining and grinding are performed , so the tolerances are extraordinary ....
Whatever people 's feelings are about the actual design of the product is of course subjective .
But objectively I can say that the manufacturing tolerances are phenomenal .
And we determined this , we designed it from the very beginning to meet those goals . "
The goals have been well - met , and on the subject of phenomenal tolerances , when you see the phone be sure to check out the insanely thin reveal around the hatch for the Micro SIM card on the side ; I 've never seen that kind of tolerance on something I could actually afford to buy .
Upon seeing it my first thought was I will never pop that open , because I 'm convinced it will never close again .
" I assure you , it will , " Ive laughs .
" The amount of care that went into that SIM tray is extraordinary .
To achieve this kind of build quality is extraordinarily hard work and requires care across so many teams .
It demands incredibly close collaboration with experts in certain areas , material sciences and so on . "
That last part reminds me that there must have been a sizeable team behind the iPhone 4 , and Ive confirms it , mentioning the importance of collaboration between engineering , manufacturing and design .
It is an intense interplay between these fields that can yield mastery of the material , which is where everything starts with this object .
" The best design explicitly acknowledges that you cannot disconnect the form from the material -- the material informs the form , " says Ive .
" It is the polar opposite of working virtually in CAD to create an arbitrary form that you then render as a particular material , annotating a part and saying ' that 's wood ' and so on .
Because when an object 's materials , the materials ' processes and the form are all perfectly aligned , that object has a very real resonance on lots of levels .
People recognize that object as authentic and real in a very particular way . "
For the sake of Core77's design student readership , I divert briefly into the realm of design education and ask Ive if he has any advice for students .
" While [ design schools today may have ] sophisticated virtual design tools , the danger in relying on them too much is that we can end up isolated from the physical world , " he says .
" In our quest to quickly make three - dimensional objects , we can miss out on the experience of making something that helps give us our first understandings of form and material , of the way a material behaves --' I press too hard here , and it breaks here ' and so on .
Some of the digital rendering tools are impressive , but it 's important that people still really try and figure out a way of gaining direct experience with the materials . "
It is that direct experience , the hands - on , that is the key ; like experiencing the iPhone 4 itself , it can not be done without the physical connection .
" It 's very hard to learn about materials academically , by reading about them or watching videos about them ; the only way you truly understand a material is by making things with it , " Ive explains , going on to add that years upon years of making his own models with his own hands is what gave him a deep understanding of the materials he 's worked .
" And it 's important to develop that appetite to want to make something , to be inquisitive about the material world , to want to truly understand a material on that level . "
And what about when students graduate and become working designers ?
Absent the structured assignments of a Production Methods or Materials class , how ought designers stay abreast of materials ?
The best place for it to happen , of course , is in the workplace itself .
" For a designer to continually learn about materials is not extracurricular , " Ive points out , " it 's absolutely essential . "

If you think of your home as a haven from pollution , we ’ve got some bummer news .
Levels of pollutants in indoor air can be from two to more than 100 times higher than outdoors , according to the U.S. EPA .
That indoor pollution is due in large part to volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) that evaporate , or “ offgas , ” from home decorating and cleaning products .

So if the weather cooperates , step one for green cleaners is :
Open a window and let those pollutants out !
Yet even in the spring and summer , when a vase of daffodils can fill a room with a lovely natural scent , many consumers stubbornly keep using synthetic room fresheners and fragranced cleaning products that are full of VOCs and other toxic chemicals .
These can make our indoor air unhealthy , provoke skin , eye , and respiratory reactions , and harm the natural environment .
Take those so - called air fresheners .
According to a study published in New Scientist in 1999 , in homes where aerosol sprays and air fresheners were used frequently , mothers experienced 25 percent more headaches and were 19 percent more likely to suffer from depression , and infants under six months of age had 30 percent more ear infections and 22 percent higher incidence of diarrhea .
In choosing alternatives , however , consumers need to be alert to greenwashing .
“ Just because a product says it ’s natural does n’t mean it ’s nontoxic , ” says Jeffrey Hollender , CEO of Seventh Generation , which produces genuinely eco-friendly cleaning supplies and household products .
The word “ natural ” is undefined and unregulated by the government and can be applied to just about anything under the sun — including plastic , which comes from naturally occurring petroleum .
Because no standards exist , claims such as “ nontoxic , ” “ eco-safe , ” and “ environmentally friendly ” are also meaningless , according to Consumers Reports ’ Eco-labels website .
Instead of being taken in by slogans , David Steinman , coauthor of The Safe Shopper ’s Bible , advises looking at labels for specific , eco-friendly ingredients that also perform effectively .
These include grain alcohol instead of toxic butyl cellosolve as a solvent ; coconut or other plant oils rather than petroleum in detergents ; and plant - oil disinfectants such as eucalyptus , rosemary , or sage , rather than triclosan .
You can also mix your own cleaners , as does Annie Berthold - Bond , green living editor at Care2.com and author of Clean and Green and Better Basics for the Home .
According to Berthold - Bond , a few safe , simple ingredients such as plain soap , water , baking soda ( sodium bicarbonate ) , vinegar , washing soda ( sodium carbonate ) , lemon juice , and borax can satisfy most household cleaning needs — and save you money at the same time .
If you ’re in the mood to detoxify , getting rid of germs does n’t have to mean overkill :
This is your home , not a hospital .
In 2000 , cleaning products were responsible for nearly 10 percent of all toxic exposures reported to the U.S. poison control centers , accounting for more than 206,000 calls , over half of which concerned children under the age of six .
According to Philip Dickey of the Washington Toxics Coalition , the most acutely or immediately hazardous cleaning products are corrosive drain cleaners , oven cleaners , acidic toilet - bowl cleaners , and anything containing chlorine or ammonia ( which should never be combined — see below ) .
Read on to get the dirt on various conventional products and ingredients and their eco-friendly alternatives .
With a little effort , you can make your home a truly clean haven rather than a chemical storage tank .
Dish Detergents , Laundry Detergents , and All - Purpose Cleaners

Problems :
Most conventional dish and laundry detergents are made from petroleum , a nonrenewable resource .
Some detergents contain alkyphenol ethoxylates , which are suspected hormone disruptors that do n’t readily biodegrade and can threaten wildlife after they go down your drain .
Ethoxylated alcohols in liquid detergents can contain carcinogenic 1,4 - dioxane .
The fragrances in detergents and fabric softeners can contain phthalates , chemicals that have been linked to cancer and reproductive - system harm in animal lab tests .
Fragrances may also trigger asthma and allergic reactions , with symptoms including skin and respiratory irritation , headaches , and watery eyes .
Although phosphates , which choke waterways , are no longer used in most dish and laundry soaps , they can be found in dishwasher detergents .
Phosphates are highly caustic and can be fatal if swallowed .
Other ingredients turn dangerous when combined : Diethanolamine and triethanolamine can react with nitrites ( an often undisclosed preservative ) to form carcinogenic nitrosamines .
Solutions :
Use laundry soaps labeled “ fragrance - free , ” advises Harvey Karp , a Los Angeles pediatrician and author of The Happiest Baby on the Block .
If you want to use citrus - oil products , sniff - test a small amount from a few feet away , as these products can be irritating to allergic or sensitive individuals .
Karp also advises choosing dish and laundry detergents and all - purpose cleaners that are plant - based ( corn , palm kernel , or coconut oil ) .
To remove stains from clothing , try soaking fabrics in water mixed with borax , lemon juice , hydrogen peroxide , washing soda , or white vinegar .
Or , look for “ non-chlorine bleach ” made from sodium percarbonate or sodium perborate , available from Bio Pac , Ecover , Naturally Yours , Shaklee , or Seventh Generation .
Fabric can be softened by adding one - quarter cup of baking soda to the wash cycle ; this recently worked on several pairs of catalog - bought cargo pants made of a cardboard - stiff cotton that literally scraped a teenager ’s skin .
A quarter cup of white vinegar will also soften fabric , as well as eliminate cling .
Less toxic products include Ecover and Seventh Generation laundry and dish soaps ; Aubrey Organics and Vermont Soapworks all - purpose household cleaners ; and Bioshield and Naturally Yours dishwasher detergent .
Antibacterial Soaps and Cleansers , Bleach , Stain Removers , Disinfectants , Glass Cleaners , and Bathroom Scouring Powders ( Whew ! )
Problems
Popular in liquid form , antibacterial soaps are helping to promote growth of resistant bacteria , according to a 2000 World Health Organization report .
Chlorine bleach , a common disinfectant frequently found in scouring powders and cleaning solutions , is highly caustic , meaning it can burn skin and eyes — plus it can be fatal if swallowed .
When it travels from your drain into the natural world , it can create organochlorines , which are suspected carcinogens as well as reproductive , neurological , and immune - system toxins .
And be warned : Bleach ( also known as sodium hypochlorite and sodium hydroxide ) should never be mixed with any product containing ammonia or quaternium compounds .
Doing so creates highly toxic chlorine gas .
Many conventional scouring powders and cleaning solutions contain chlorine bleach .
Solutions
Instead of using antibacterial soap , Karp recommends thorough hand - washing ( about two minutes ’ worth ) with plain soap and warm water .
To disinfect bathroom or kitchen surfaces , try Earth Power ‘s EPA - registered herbal disinfectant or Seventh Generation sanitizers .
White vinegar helps kill bacteria , mold , and viruses , according to Berthold - Bond , who uses it on everything from kitchen surfaces to toilet seats .
However , the only foolproof way to kill food - borne pathogens such as salmonella or E coli is to use hot , soapy water to wash all cutting boards , dishes , knives , and surfaces that have touched raw meat or eggs .

Scrubbing sinks , tubs , and countertops with a paste of baking soda and water effectively removes dirt rings and some stains ; if that does n’t work , try a paste of washing soda and water , and be sure to wear gloves .
Commercial non-chlorine bleach products include Bon Ami scouring powder and cream cleansers from Earth Friendly , Ecover , and Seventh Generation .
For cleaning windows , fill your own spray bottle with water and either one - quarter cup white vinegar or one tablespoon lemon juice to cut grease .
Safer commercial glass cleaners are made by BioShield , Earth Friendly , Naturally Yours , and Seventh Generation .
Drain , Oven , and Toilet - Bowl Cleaners
Problems
The corrosive ingredients in these products can severely irritate eyes , skin , and the respiratory tract , and can be fatal if swallowed .
Chemical drain cleaners are among the most dangerous of all cleaning products , containing sodium hydroxide and sodium hypochlorite ( bleach ) that can permanently burn eyes and skin .
In oven cleaners , lye and sodium hydroxide can burn skin , eyes , and the respiratory tract .
Solutions
For drains , a plunger “ snake ” plumbing tool should first be used to bring up as much of the clog as possible , giving cleaning products room to work , or perhaps eliminating the need for them entirely .
Earth Friendly and Naturally Yours drain cleaners use enzymes , rather than caustic chemicals , to dissolve obstructions .
Do n’t forget to prevent future blockage with inexpensive metal or plastic drain screens , available at most home - improvement or hardware stores .
To clean oven surfaces , coat them in a paste of water and baking or washing soda and let stand overnight , then scrub off the paste while wearing gloves .
Among commercial products , EnviroSafety ‘s plant - based multi-purpose cleaner works well .
Or you can use the non-chlorine scouring powders and creams listed above .
To prevent future buildup , line the oven floor with aluminum foil and wipe oven walls and ceiling clean after each use .
For toilets , forget the fancy stuff : Again , use the simple , non-chlorine scouring powders and creams listed above , or try AFM SafeChoice or Ecover toilet cleaners .
Furniture and Metal Polishes
Problems
These are corrosive and may cause eye , skin , or respiratory tract irritation .
They can also contain nerve - damaging petroleum distillates or formaldehyde , a carcinogen .
Solutions
Polish furniture with a mixture of one teaspoon olive oil and one - half cup white vinegar , or look for solvent - free products that use mineral or plant oils , such as Earth Friendly furniture polish or Hope ’s lemon oil .
As your grandmother probably knows , silver can be kept clean with toothpaste .
Copper can be polished using a cloth dipped in white vinegar or lemon juice with salt dissolved in it ; just rinse with water when you ’re done .
You can shine your brass with a paste made from one teaspoon salt , one cup white vinegar , and one cup flour .
Or , use Kleen King copper and stainless steel cleaner , Twinkle copper and silver polishes , or Hope ‘s brass and silver polishes .
Air Fresheners and Other Perfumed Products
Problems
Aerosol propellants contain flammable and nerve - damaging ingredients as well as tiny particles that can lodge in your lungs .
Fragrances of all kinds can provoke allergic and asthmatic reactions .
Solutions
If the air outside is clean , open your windows and ventilate the natural way .
An open box of baking soda removes odors .
( If you ’re feeling Martha Stewart - ish , you can decant it from the box into a pretty bowl . )
Cedar blocks or sachets of dried flowers and herbs provide gentle scents — but avoid any potpourri that lists unspecified “ fragrance ” on the label ; this could mean synthetic chemicals , including phthalates .
Look for products scented with essential plant oils , such as lemon , verbena , or lavender .
Finally , we cannot stress enough that you should avoid aerosol sprays in any product , as they disperse ingredients through the air and make them easy to inhale .
Even nontoxic ingredients can irritate eyes , noses , and lungs .
Carelessly shaken powders can also spread through the air and cause irritation .
Now Get to It !
Most of the eco-friendly products mentioned above can be found in supermarkets or natural - food , hardware , and home - improvement stores — or online .

And remember :
When it comes to green cleaning , less is definitely more !
Glen Pearson is the Liberal MP for London - North - Centre and is an avid blogger .
He has some criticisms of the modern Liberal Party of Canada .
I think he ’s onto something .
Here are some of his quotes :
“ Like it or not , today ’s Liberal Party is often viewed as elitist , out of touch with daily pressures of average people and groups . ”
Michael Ignatieff is currently in China , getting in touch with the lives of everyday Canadians .
“ Gone are the days when the Liberal Party could attract candidates from unions , social agencies , environmental groups , anti-poverty advocates , and even small business associations .
This hurts , but it ’s true . ”
Three Liberal candidates have quit in the past month .
“ [ T ] oday ’s Liberal Party spends an inordinate amount of time talking about institutional politics and policy as opposed to the key role of the citizen as an agent of progress . ”
Indeed , it ’s more difficult to attract candidates when the reality of forming government seems too distant , but you need to attract candidates that are in it to make the individual lives of citizens better , not for a retirement plum or for a chauffeured car .
“ One of our key weaknesses as a national party at present is our distance – physical , emotional , empathetic – from the average lives of citizens . ”
Is it a problem of leadership ?
Of abandoning rural Canada and their concerns ?
Is Pearson right ?
What do you believe plagues the Liberal Party of Canada ?
Waves of gooey tar blobs washed ashore in growing numbers on the white sand of the Florida Panhandle on Friday as a slick from the BP spill drifted closer to shore .
Spotters who had been seeing a few tar balls in recent days found a substantially larger number starting before dawn on the beaches of the Gulf Islands National Seashore and nearby areas .
The park is a long string of connected barrier islands near Pensacola .
Keith Wilkins from Escambia County emergency management said tar patties were pretty thick on parts of the beach , as much as one every foot .
IN PICTURES : Sticky mess :
The Gulf oil spill 's impact on nature
Officials have said it is inevitable oil will eventually wash up on Panhandle beaches after a slick from the Deepwater Horizon spill was spotted about 9 miles offshore this week .
The edge of the spill had moved to four miles off the coast Thursday , Gov. Charlie Crist said after a flyover .
Crist said the news of Friday 's growth in tar balls was " very disturbing . "
" Obviously , it 's not the kind of news that we want to hear , " Crist said on CNN's " American Morning . "
Escambia County emergency officials has been preparing for the oil by shoring up miles of boom .
The county plans to block oil from reaching inland waterways , but left its beaches unprotected because they are too difficult to shield and easier to clean up .
Watching the oil wash ashore on Pensacola Beach left tourists and residents saddened .
The sign leading to the sand boasts " The World 's Whitest Beaches , " but they wondered how long that claim could be made .
The Panhandle 's beaches draw thousands of tourists each summer , bringing millions of dollars to the region .
David Lucas from Jonesville , La. , and a group of friends waded into the oily water then quickly decided to continue their drive to Orlando .
" It was sticky brown globs out there , " Lucas said as the group cleaned the mess off their feet .
Henry Fairleigh , 11 , collected the half - dollar sized globs of tar into his child 's sand shovel as he ran in out of the ocean waves .
His father , Joe Fairleigh , said the family had been coming to Pensacola from their Louisville , Ky. , home for years and was heartbroken .
" It 's devastating to think how massive the ocean is and that it has n't broken it up , " he said .
Nearby , longtime beach resident Dawn Leight walked carrying two glass fish bowls in her hands to collect the sugary white sands .
" I 'm being very sentimental .
I want to save some of this white sand .
I know it does n't make any sense , " she said .
Further east in Santa Rosa County , Gordon Goodin , chairman of the county Commission , said he saw gooey tar balls , " like the consistency of petroleum jelly " on Navarre Beach .
The largest of the tar balls were about the size of a half - dollar coin , others were smaller than a dime .
" It 's an inconvenience and yeah I 'm mad about it , and it could be a lot worse , " Goodin said .
" But our neighbors to the west are getting it a lot worse . "
Goodin said he remained hopeful that the worst of the spill would not hit the area .
" I 'm may be the eternal optimist here , but I 'm hoping the more this oil becomes weatherized , the less impact we ( will ) have on our beaches , " Goodin said .

I have a confession .
Throughout my career I ’ve done a lot work with volunteers , I ’ve managed my share of programs and events , I ’ve done budgeting and reporting , I ’ve done some marketing and all kinds of connecting .
But I ’ve done very little fundraising .
There .
I said it .
I ’m a nonprofit blogger without fundraising experience .
It ’s not like I know nothing about it .
I studied fundraising and grant writing in undergrad and graduate school .
I keep up with the latest trends , I ’ve observed excellent and not - so - good campaigns and I have a pretty good idea of what works and what does n’t .
And yet , the total amount of money I ’ve raised myself falls well below the $ 5,000 mark .
That is about to change .
As of today , I ’m embarking on a public experiment .
I , a brand new fundraiser , will ( with the help of my fellow board members ) build and execute a fundrasing plan for Mach 30 Inc–a brand new , soon to be 501 ( c ) 3 nonprofit dedicated to hastening the advancement of humanity into a space - faring civilization .
Why do it in public ?
Conventional wisdom says this is a crazy idea .
First of all , announcing one ’s lack of fundraising experience is not traditionally viewed as a great way to build one ’s reputation as a well - rounded nonprofit writer .
On the other hand , every experienced fundraiser was once in my shoes .
Every nonprofit organization with a ginormous budget and thousands of donors was once just the dream of a group of people who believed the world could be better with a bit of help .
In addition , while learning from experts is valuable , its not the only path .
In fact , some of life ’s hardest lessons can only be learned through direct experience or through observing the experience ( rather than hearing the advice ) of others .
By committing to learning in public , I hope to provide opportunities for you to learn from me and to encourage you to share the experiences of your own fundraising experiences , thus increasing the learning opportunities for us all .
Finally , this decision is based on core values .
Mach 30 is committed to working in the open and sharing our learning .
Our fundraising experiences should not be exempt from that value .
Will you join me ?
Whether you are an experienced fundraiser , a beginner , or even just a curious by - stander , there is room for you on this journey .
Here ’s what I have in mind .
About once per week *
I ’ll post an update outlining my thoughts on what ’s next , give myself deadlines for completing next steps and report on the previous week ’s progress .
When plans go well , you ’ll hear about it .
When I crash and burn , I ’ll share that too .
When I get stuck , and just do n’t do what I promised , I ’ll let you know what ’s up with that .
My hope is the fundraising experts among us will add to the conversation with advice on what to try next , which traps to avoid , and insight into why experiments might be failing .
If ( ok , when ) we hit especially difficult subjects I ’ll ask some of them to do guest posts to help us get un -stuck .
For those of you who are beginners like me , I hope you will follow along at home .
Use the information you find here and apply it to your work .
Share your plans , achievements and frustrations –either in the comments here , or as part of the discussion over on the Facebook page .
If public announcements are n’t really your style , feel free to e-mail me .
I ’m looking forward to our journey together !

Quarter after quarter , J.D. Power and Associates surveys a number of cell phone users in America ( 9,690 to be exact this volume ) on how satisfied they are with their carrier ’s customer service ( they had to have come in contact with retail sales associates in stores or over the phone in the past 6 months ) .
T- Mobile ’s long been at the top of that list , and they ’re enjoying the honor again this morning so we can enjoy another three months of ads highlighting that .
Here are some of the accolades they continued to rack up in more detail :
T- Mobile is the sole highest - ranked among all wireless providers in Overall Customer Care Performance , and significantly above the industry average .
In direct interactions with customer service representatives , T - Mobile scores higher than any other wireless provider .
On calls that began with the ARS and transferred to a customer service representative , T - Mobile leads all wireless providers .
For customers walking into a retail store for service , T - Mobile scores above industry average .
If my personal experiences are anything to go by when I was with T - Mobile ever since I was a young teen ( I left for Sprint this past June ) , then they definitely deserve it .
They ’re efficient , polite , and – if you ’re a “ loyalty ” customer of theirs – they nearly treat you like royalty .
I ’m not just saying that , either , because their customer service made it very hard for me to leave them .
They were one of the first supporters of Android , and while I was more advanced than your average T - Mobile G1 / Android customer , I can tell they really cared about the platform and made a strong effort to train employees on the OS to make sure other users were n’t left in the dark .
All that said , we wish them the best as they continue to please millions of their customers at the point of sale and support .
Editor 's note : Will Okun taught high school on the West Side of Chicago for nine years and is writing a novel for young adults .
( CNN ) -- Chicago 's longstanding ban on handguns , which the Supreme Court this week ruled as unconstitutional , was a complete failure .
Two years ago , every student in my first - period English class on the West Side of Chicago claimed to have easy access to a handgun -- even the goody - two - shoes Honors student in the front row .
When I doubted her , she looked at me as if I were a fool .
" I could get you one from my uncle tonight , " she informed me with a quizzical look .
" He might ask me why I needed it , might not . "
Guns were so abundant that there was only , maybe , one big fight a year among the males in our school building because it was understood that the simplest of physical confrontations too quickly could escalate into deadly shootings .
" You have to walk away from a lot , " observed one former student of mine who has lost several friends and relatives to gun violence .
" For instance , dude deserves to be beat and I know I could beat his ass , but then what ?
No one is just going to take an ass - beating , they 're going to want to do something about it . "
And he added , " Then you got to worry about him and his guys jumping on you .
Or more than likely , he 's going to get a gun to show that he 's not a punk .
That 's how a lot of these shootings happen , it 's over nothing . "
Violence was so omnipresent that when I returned to school a few days after being shot in the arm with a .22 ( I 'd rather not discuss ) , a staggering number of students lifted their shirts to show their bullet wounds .
" What you going to do ? " they seemed to say with a shrug , as if this were everyday life .
In a city where an average of four people are shot every day , the random shooting death a few years ago of an amazing , beautiful person , Alto Brown , a friend of mine , was reduced to a single line in a three - paragraph newspaper story coldly tallying weekend homicides .
" Everything happens for a reason , " the pastor said at his funeral .
" He 's now in a better place . "
As gangs and their illegal guns held whole communities hostage , it seemed as if the only people prevented from possessing firearms were citizens like Keith Thomas , who was raised on the West Side and now works as a mentor to at - risk youth for an alternatives schools program in Chicago
" I do n't think anybody in their right mind would argue that more guns are a good thing , " said Thomas , who has the scar from a bullet wound on his right wrist .
" But I think the Supreme Court made the right decision .
I think right now , at this point , the ban is not helping to serve any real purpose . "
Thomas does not believe that the court 's decision will result in significantly more or less violence , but he does hope that the ruling will force political leaders to seek community improvements beyond just strict gun control .
" It 's not enough to just say we need more gun control .
That 's not what 's causing all these problems out here , the guns are the result , " he explained .
" If we want to stop violence , we need to make real changes .
That 's a lot harder and requires a lot more money than just saying no guns . "
In too many low - income communities of Chicago , the schools are in shambles , quality after - school programs are scarce , well - paying jobs are almost nonexistent , and the family structure is in full crisis .
It is an easy notion to disregard , but many of these children are struggling daily to thrive in an environment that fosters failure .
" We have to get them early , before they start getting lost , " Thomas said of the youth he advises , get them redirected with organizations like his and other successful mentoring interventions like the Youth Advocates Programs .
" Once they start believing there 's nothing else , that they have nothing to lose , they 're the ones most likely to do the shooting . "
After a recent weekend in which 10 people were killed and 60 wounded by gunfire , Chicago Mayor Richard Daley continued to argue the necessity of a citywide gun ban .
" Look at all the guns that shot people this weekend .
Where did they come from ?
That is the issue . "
But one must ask , truly , is it ?
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Will Okun .
On a press call hosted by a pro-Israel organization , Rep. Brad Sherman , Democrat of California , told reporters that he intends seek the prosecution of any U.S. citizens who were aboard or involved with the Freedom Flotilla .
“ The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 [ PDF ] makes it absolutely illegal for any American to give food , money , school supplies , paper clips , concrete or weapons to Hamas or any of its officials , ” Sherman said on the Israel Project call , conflating Hamas and Gaza ’s civilian population .
“ And so I will be asking the Attorney General to prosecute any American involved in what was clearly an effort to give items of value to a terrorist organization . ”
Sherman also said that he plans on working with the Department of Homeland Security to make sure that any non-U.S. citizen involved with or aboard the Flotilla are excluded from entering the U.S .
Hamas , considered a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department , won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 and has held de facto rule over the Gaza Strip since it took the area by force in 2007 in anticipation of an impending U.S. - backed coup d’etat by the rival Fatah faction .
The Freedom Flotilla was organized by the Free Gaza Movement to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza — in place since Hamas ’s takeover — and deliver tons of food aid , medical and school supplies and building materials to repair buildings damaged in the month - long Israeli assault of Gaza in Dec. 2008 and Jan. 2009 .
The Flotilla was raided by Israeli commandos in international waters during the early hours of Monday morning , leaving at least nine people , including one U.S. citizen , dead .
Though the nine were killed by the IDF , Sherman criticized the Obama administration for not directly blaming Hamas , using the logic that the militant movement brought the blockade on itself : “ I think the U.S. could be better now about condemning Hamas as responsible for those nine deaths . ”
The blockade and the land siege ( by Israel and Egypt ) have , by international consensus ( leaving out Israel and its hard - line American allies ) caused a humanitarian crisis among Gaza ’s civilian population .
The Congressman , known as a pro-Israel stalwart who has , in the past , joined as the sole Democrat on Republican criticisms of Obama ’s foreign policy toward Israel , denied that there was a “ hunger crisis ” or “ humanitarian crisis ” in the Gaza Strip .
“ The health circumstances in Gaza are better than they are in many American cities , ” he added later .
Questions about the legality of the Israeli blockade and its enforcement in international waters were quickly dismissed by Sherman , who said that the U.S. had itself blockaded Germany in both World Wars , Japan in the Second , Cuba during the missile crisis , and , curiously , the Confederacy during the Civil War .
The irony of the last example was , I ’m sure , lost on Sherman .
It was in that war , of course , that another man named Sherman , a Union officer , led a scorched - Earth campaign against the blockaded Confederacy .
There are similar examples from the recent Gaza War , which I ’d bed Rep.
Sherman also had no problem with .
( And are we really reduced to using a conflict from 150 years ago to justify military actions of the IDF ? )
While Israel alleges ties between IHH , a Turkish relief organization involved in the Flotilla , and terror groups , many credible doubts have been raised about that assertion ( see LobeLog contributors Marsha Cohen and Max Blumenthal ’s pieces on the subject ) .
Nonetheless , Sherman insisted the group has “ clear terrorist ties . ”
The California Congressman also blamed the media for the harsh criticisms of Israel since the incident on the Med ( even from tiny Central American countries ) .
Sherman employed what he called the “ Kent State Rorschach Test ” — referring to a generation of journalists who grew up in the Vietnam War-era and viewed Western governments critically because of incidents like the 1970 Kent State massacre .
“ The liberal media is misled by that Kent State Rorschach Test that is a belief that those who are poorer , less technological , and more scruffy looking are right , ” he said , alluding to skepticism of “ Westerners , Europeans , and the U.S. ”
All of Israel ’s problems , said Sherman , are a distraction from Iran ’s nuclear program , which he alleged is aimed at nuclear weapons .
If Iran acquires those weapons , he said , the U.S. itself will be in danger : “ You could smuggle one into the States in a bale of marijuana . ”
“ What really matters is the Iran nuclear program and we have a short amount of time to stop that program , ” Sherman went on .
“ And our failure to take all the action to stop that program could force Israel to take an action far more controversial than what they ’ve done this week . ”

While the rest of the world obsesses about soccer during the World Cup , Japan is reeling from a major scandal involving its own national sport : sumo wrestling .
Some of Japan 's biggest sumo stars have been accused of participating in an illegal gambling ring .
The Japanese Sumo Association is now considering suspending up to 15 wrestlers from the sport , and may take the unprecedented step of canceling an upcoming tournament in Nagoya .
( Watch a report about the sumo scandal . )
Here 's a brief guide to sumo 's gambling scandal :
What kind of gambling was taking place ?
The wrestlers are being accused of betting on baseball games , which is illegal in Japan .
Baseball gambling syndicates are often run by organized crime groups like the Yakuza .
This particular ring allegedly has links to gang affiliates .
How many wrestlers are involved ?
The Japanese Sumo Association says at least 65 of its 700 members had been involved in illegal gambling .
At least 31 members have admitted to betting on baseball .
Up to 15 wrestlers and 13 coaches face suspension or expulsion from the sport , including star wrestler Kotomitsuki , ranked second in the world .
One trainer , or " stablemaster , " allegedly racked up debts of more than $ 50,000 .
How did the gambling ring get set up ?
By a hairdresser .
The art of preparing the " top knot " — the ceremonial hairstyle adopted by wrestlers — is only practiced by 50 hairdressers in Japan .
One , named Tokoike , is suspected of acting as a middleman between wrestlers and illegal bookmakers .
What 's the big deal about canceling a tournament ?
There are only six tournaments a year , and Japan has not seen a single one canceled since 1946 .
The money lost in television rights would be a " major blow " to the sport 's finances .
The Japan Sumo Association says the Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament will go ahead , but sponsors are already pulling out and national broadcaster NHK may refuse to air the matches .
How significant is this in Japan ?
Enormously so .
Sumo is one of the oldest regularly practiced sports in the world , with a professional league that dates back to the mid-1700s .
Wrestlers are accordingly treated as elite members of society , and are " expected by the fans to live by higher standards and adhere to a rigid set of rules . "
The popularity of the sport has dwindled with the rise of soccer and baseball , but it is still revered by many Japanese as the national sport .
Are such scandals unheard of in sumo ?
No .
In fact , sumo 's image has been tarred by a number of scandals in recent years .
A top Mongolian wrestler quit recently after getting into a drunken bar fight .
Two sumo coaches were censured in May for providing seats to a crime syndicate .
And in 2007 , a 17 - year - old apprentice was beaten to death by three other wrestlers during a hazing ritual .
What happens next ?
The Japanese Sumo Association will announce the results of an internal probe on July 4 , including any suspensions or expulsions , and will make a decision on whether to cancel the July 11 Nagoya tournament .

Five Afghan soldiers have accidentally been killed in a Nato airstrike , officials in Afghanistan have said .
A spokesman for the Afghan defence ministry condemned the incident , saying it was not the first time Afghan soldiers had died in " friendly fire " .
Gen Mohammad Zahir Azimi said the soldiers had been launching an attack against insurgents in Ghazni province in eastern Afghanistan .
Nato confirmed the airstrike had gone wrong and said it regretted the deaths .
Spokesman Brig - Gen Josef Blotz said a joint investigation had been launched .
A statement released by the the Nato - led International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) said that the inquiry would determine the facts and circumstances surrounding the deaths , which occurred when " an Isaf aircrew engaged the individuals with precision - guided munitions " .
" This loss of life is tragic , and we offer condolences to all those who lost loved ones , " said Isaf spokesperson Jane Campbell .
" We work extremely hard to co-ordinate and synchronize our operations , and we deeply regret the loss of lives from our Afghan partners . "
Isaf has also extended the personal condolences of US Gen David Petraeus , the new commander of Nato forces in Afghanistan , to families of the victims .
The incident comes as international forces try to improve co-ordination with their Afghan counterparts in order to eventually transfer more security operations to them .
Ambush
Gen Azimi said the soldiers had been launching a morning ambush on militants in the Sarda dam and Rahim Khail village area when a Nato aircraft opened fire on them without warning .
He said two other soldiers were wounded in the attack .
" We condemn this action .
Unfortunately this is not the first time such an incident has happened , but we wish that at least this would be the last one , " Gen Azimi said .
Civilian casualties and " friendly fire " incidents involving Afghan troops have been a frequent source of friction between Western powers and Afghan President Hamid Karzai .

Former US and Nato commander Gen Stanley McChrystal made avoiding civilian casualties a priority in a policy known as " courageous restraint " .
His successor , Gen Petraeus , will not abandon the policy but , according to senior sources , he believes some units are interpreting its rules too cautiously .
About 140,000 international troops are fighting alongside Afghan forces to quell a Taliban - led insurgency .
The fiercest fighting is taking place in southern Afghanistan , which is the focus of a new US - led push to regain control of militant - held areas .
In other developments , Nato said three US soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan on Tuesday .
It did not give any further details .
Britain announced on Wednesday that it would withdraw its troops from the Sangin valley in the southern Helmand province , handing over responsibility to US forces .
The largest single hoard of Roman coins ever found in Britain has been unearthed on a farm near Frome in Somerset .
A total of 52,500 bronze and silver coins dating from the 3rd century AD – including the largest ever found set of coins minted by the self proclaimed emperor Carausius , who lasted seven years before he was murdered by his finance minister – were found by Dave Crisp , a hobby metal detectorist from Devizes , Wiltshire .
Crisp first dug up a fingernail - sized bronze coin only 30 cm below the surface .
Even though he had never found a hoard before , when he had turned up a dozen coins he stopped digging and called in the experts , who uncovered a pot bellied pottery jar stuffed with the extraordinary collection , all dating from 253 to 293 AD – the year of Carausius 's death .
Just giving them a preliminary wash , to prevent them from sticking together in a corroded mass as the soil dried out , took conservation staff at the British Museum a month , and compiling the first rough catalogue took a further three months .
How they got into the field remains a mystery , but archaeologists believe they must represent the life savings of an entire community – possibly a votive offering to the gods .
A Roman road runs nearby , but no trace of a villa , settlement or cemetery has been found .
Roger Bland , a coins expert at the British Museum , said : " The whole hoard weighs 160 kilos , more than two overweight people , and it would n't have been at all easy to recover the coins from the ground .
The only way would have been the way the archaeologists had to get them out , by smashing the pot that held them and scooping them out .
" No one individual could possibly have carried them to the field in the pot , it must have been buried first and then filled up . "
Bland , who heads the Portable Antiquities service which encourages metal detectorists to report all finds , said the hoard had already absorbed more than 1,000 hours of work .
He admitted his first stunned reaction when he saw the coins in the ground in April , was " oh my god , how the hell are we going to deal with this ?
Now I think it will see me out , the research will keep me going until my retirement . "
" This find is going to make us rethink the nature of such hoards , " he said .
" The traditional thinking was that they represent wealth hidden in times of trouble and invasion – the Saxons were coming , the Irish were invading as always – but that does n't match these dates . "
The archaeologists praised Crisp for calling them in immediately , allowing the context of the find to be recorded meticulously .
When a coroner 's inquest is held later this month in Somerset , the coins are likely to be declared treasure , which must by law be reported .
Somerset county museum hopes to acquire the hoard , which could be worth up to £ 1 m , with the blessing of the British Museum .
While President Obama continues to exhort Congress and the American public to move ahead with legislation that will put the U.S. on a path to rapid and sustainable development of renewable energy , China is building a formidable renewable infrastructure .
China ’s wind industry is a case in point .
In 2008 China ’s total installed capacity to produce wind power was the 5th largest in the world and by the end of 2009 China had the 3rd largest installed base of wind power in the world ( at ~ 22,000 to 24,000 MW ) .
As of year - end 2010 , China most certainly will have comfortably surpassed Germany to be the world ’s 2nd largest wind power powerhouse .
The weak performance of the United States ’ wind industry so far this year , which RenewableEnergyWorld.com ’s own Stephen Lacey described in his podcast , “ Why the Wind Market is Hurting , ” increases the likelihood that China will lay claim to the world ’s largest installed base of wind power by at least 2011 .
Recently we highlighted the invidious competition that is brewing in the Chinese wind equipment manufacturing industry and pointed out how such competition was driving down costs for wind farm developers .
Falling equipment costs coupled with an increasingly favorable policy environment for wind farm development in China is producing a rush of wind capacity development that is mind - boggling .
The case of Gansu Province breathtakingly illustrates how China ’s wind industry has hit its stride : as recently as 2006 , the total installed capacity of wind power in Gansu Province was a negligible 110 MW ; wind power development has proceeded at such a pace that since May , 2010 Gansu Province has been installing an average of 40 MW per day !
As of the end of 2010 , Gansu Province ’s total installed capacity — 5160 MW — will exceed the goal for total installed wind capacity for all of China , which Beijing established in September 2007 in the { Mid to Long Term Plan for Renewable Energy} .
Understanding that Gansu is one of seven regions in China that are all developing wind power capacity of at least 10,000 MW ( the others are the Hami region of Zhejiang , Eastern Inner Mongolia , Western Inner Mongolia , Hebei , Jilin and the coastal regions of Jiangsu Province ) , crystallizes our appreciation of the scope of wind power development in China today .
As we have demonstrated here , when China blew past the wind capacity goals for 2010 and 2020 that were first established in 2007 , Beijing simply established more ambitious goals .
The 2007 goal of 5000 MW by 2010 became 10,000 MW in 2008 , and now is 35,000 MW by year - end 2011 — seven times the original goal set less than three years ago !
And the 2007 goal of having 30,000 MW of installed wind capacity in China as of 2020 is now an astonishing 150,000 MW — a five - fold increase in planned capacity !
We have no doubt that even these lofty goals will be surpassed .
Certainly all is not roses and lavender in the Chinese wind industry .
In addition to China ’s familiar nemesis — over investment in capacity with the attendant waste of investment capital — there also are issues surrounding the growing uncertainty of the CDM regime , an important additional source of funding for the Chinese wind industry .
And setting rational prices for energy , a conundrum that has plagued Chinese policy - makers for years , continues to vex Beijing .
Perhaps the most significant issue facing the Chinese wind industry is that the explosion in installed wind capacity has outstripped the development of grid capacity in China .
This phenomenon is displayed rather starkly in Gansu Province ; while the maximum capacity of the power grid in the Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province is 600 MW , the installed capacity of the Jiuquan Wind Farm alone already has reached 2000 - 3000 MW !
As of last summer , China ’s installed capacity of wind generation was 14,740 MW nationwide , 5000 MW of which was said not to be grid - connected ; this level of wind power that is “ dozing off ” amounts to approximately 50 billion Yuan in capital investment ( or ~ $ 7.4 billion U.S. ) .
At present the estimates are that 16,000 MW of wind power is now grid connected out of a total estimated installed capacity of at least 25,000 MW .
According to Shi Pengfei , the Vice Chairman of the China Wind Power Association , more incentives by the Chinese government directed to grid companies will help alleviate such disparities .
Though the development of wind generating capacity continues to outpace the build out of a modern power grid in China and that gap is widening , a race between generating capacity and grid capacity is the type of problem most nations should relish .
The value of China ’s alternative energy development certainly has caught the attention of investors : it is not coincidental that the world ’s largest IPO of an energy company in 2009 was China Longyuan Power Group Co. , Ltd. ( 00916.HK ) , China ’s largest alternative energy developer .
At 40 MW per day , the wind equivalent of one 300 - MW coal - fired power plant is being developed in Gansu Province every week ( this compares with a construction period of one and a half years for every coal fired power plant ) .
Depending on the rate of growth of China ’s GDP and energy consumption , with the blistering pace of wind power development in China , it is conceivable that China might succeed in significantly increasing the proportion of renewable energy in its energy mix , which in turn may presage the beginning of a steady and statistically meaningful decline in energy output from coal - fired plants .

Previously indecipherable letters that provide insight into the innermost thoughts of the Victorian explorer David Livingstone are being read by scientists using ground - breaking imaging technology .
In the last years of his life when he was in remote parts of Africa , Livingstone had run out of writing paper and had to scrawl his letters on used newspapers and pages from books using ink from berries .
Most of the letters are now virtually unreadable and historians have had to rely on versions that were heavily censored by Livingstone 's friend and biographer Horace Waller .
But Livingstone 's true thoughts are being revealed by scientists using techniques that enhance the ink while suppressing the background print .
The first deciphered letter , written on 5 February 1871 from a village called Bambarre in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo , has just been made public in the first stage of a project to reveal the contents of Livingstone 's previously unpublished final diary from 1870 - 71 .
Waller , to whom the letters were addressed , omitted ( at his friend 's request ) some references to Livingstone 's ill health and weaknesses .
Livingstone wrote to him : " I am terribly knocked up but this is for your own eye only : in my second childhood [ referring to his lack of teeth – several of which he extracted himself ] a dreadful old fogie .
Doubtful if I live to see you again . "
Despite his ill health in the midst of a cholera epidemic that devastated the local population , he wrote of his determination to complete his search for the source of the Nile : " Well I am off in a few days to finish with the help of the Almighty new explorations . "
The letter also includes Livingstone 's thoughts on the " awful traffic " of the slave trade which he said could be " congenial only to the devil and his angels " .
Fiercely competitive , he was critical of the achievements of fellow explorers Samuel White Baker , Richard Burton and John Hanning Speke .
The Scottish missionary also talked about the prospects for commerce and Christianity in Africa , gave details of lakes and rivers in central Africa and expressed his disgust with the British government 's policies in Africa and the Middle East .
It is thought the Bambarre letter was only delivered to England in 1872 by the New York Herald reporter Henry Morton Stanley who met Livingstone in late 1871 with the words : " Dr Livingstone , I presume ? "
Morton had been despatched by his paper to find Livingstone , who had been lost to the outside world for six years .
Livingstone died at the age of 60 in 1873 in Zambia from malaria and internal bleeding caused by dysentery .
He suffered extreme ill health in the final years of his life , including horrific tropical ulcers on his feet and legs .
Dr Debbie Harrison , a medical historian and the project 's contributing editor , said : " His closing line to Waller indicates Livingstone 's anxious and depressed state of mind .
He did not know that in just a few months Stanley would arrive , bringing desperately needed food , medicines and the longed for news from an outside world he thought had forgotten him . "
The letter disappeared for almost a century before it was bought at a Sotheby 's auction in 1966 by the American photographer and diarist Peter Beard , in whose private collection it remains .
The work on restoring the letters is being done by researchers from Birkbeck College , University of London , the National Library of Scotland and the David Livingstone Centre .
The letters are illuminated with successive wavelengths of light , highlighting the text – a method that has also been used on documents containing Archimedes ' " Eureka " theory and parts of the US Declaration of Independence .
All the letters will eventually be made public on the Livingstone Online website .
Democracy only works if you have well - informed public debate .
So why did senior civil servants ( and a Labour minister ) believe it was legitimate to consider withholding official information simply because it might be used to criticise government policy ?
The extraordinary insight into how some Whitehall officials think the Freedom of Information
Act should operate is revealed in documents inadvertently sent to my BBC colleague Martin Rosenbaum and published on his blog today .
In advice sent to Vernon Coaker when he was a Home Office minister in 2009 , a civil servant warns of the dangers of releasing unpublished research on whether drugs policy represented good value for money .
He writes :
This seems to be run entirely counter to the principles underpinning the Freedom of Information Act .
As the Information Commission states in his introduction to the legislation , a factor that would " encourage the disclosure of information " is that it would " allow a more informed debate of issues under consideration by the Government " .
Parliament did not design this legislation in order that ministers could avoid criticism of their policies .
Quite the reverse .
One of its fundamental concerns is , as the commissioner says , " furthering the understanding of and participation in the public debate of issues of the day " .
I am sure there will be plenty of people reading this and thinking : " Well , what do you expect ?
That 's what government officials do - they are there to protect their masters or mistresses , to cover up and hide things that might leave ministers open to criticism . "
I am not going to allow myself to be that cynical .
I want to believe that our Parliamentary system is built on the idea that open , honest debate is the way to achieve good , democratic governance .
The Civil Service Code is founded on four " core values " :
• Integrity : Putting the obligations of public service above personal interests
• Honesty : Being truthful and open
• Objectivity : Basing advice and decisions on rigorous analysis of the evidence
• Impartiality : Acting solely according to the merits of the case and serving governments of different political parties equally well
That first " core value " seems the most relevant to me .
It might serve the " personal interests " of departmental civil servants to ensure citizens are deprived of information which allows people to construct cogent criticism of their policy , but what about the " public interest " ?
In the case of the Drugs Value for Money Review which had prompted the advice to Mr Coaker , the document was eventually published but only after a lengthy delay because the Home Office wanted " to avoid a focus on the gaps in the evidence base " .
When I asked the Information Commissioner what he made of the revelations today , his office was emphatic :
" Requests should not be refused simply on the grounds that disclosing the information would reveal gaps in the evidence base for a policy .
There is a public interest in openness and transparency ...
" The fact that the information may not reflect well on the public authority in question is not in itself a reason for it to be withheld . "
There is that phrase again : " public interest " .
I spoke to the Cabinet Office this afternoon to ask whether they thought civil servants had behaved properly in telling a minister to consider the " risk " that releasing information might lead to criticism of policy .
A spokesperson told me :
" We take our duties under the Freedom of Information Act very seriously .
It is also our duty to give ministers all the facts and advice in relation to the Act .
In this case , the likelihood of criticism was something they felt the minister should be informed about .
They might have been rebuked if they had not . "
But why , I pressed , did they think that informing public debate constituted a risk ?
" Maybe they should n't have used the word ' risk ' .
There is a semantic point about the word ' risk ' , " he conceded .
Perhaps when the permanent secretary at the Home Office , Sir David Normington , read the advice that releasing official documents might risk people " using information ... to criticise Government " he hauled the author over the coals .
Perhaps Vernon Coaker or the then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith demanded to know why departmental officials were apparently in favour of stifling informed debate .
One would like to imagine so because the alternative explanation is that public servants and elected ministers are content to undermine our democracy .

The violence on screen at Comic - con burst through to real life in Hall H on Saturday afternoon .
A fight broke out at the rear of the cavernous packed hall just as the “ Resident Evil : Aftermath ” panel had finished .
At least two film fans , one reportedly in a Harry Potter T - shirt , were stabbed with a pen .
One suffered a bloody laceration between the eye and the temple , a convention center worker told TheWrap .
The other was stabbed in the leg and was taken away by ambulance on a stretcher .
A dispatcher with the San Diego police said the fight broke out over hard - to - get seats at the height of Comic - Con 's main room programming .
The victim who suffered facial injuries was not badly hurt , and the man with the leg injury was taken to the hospital .
As the crowd jumped on seats to see what was happening , security lead at least one of the participants out in handcuffs .
The convention center employee said three people were led away in handcuffs ; none of those were among the injured .
( Movie blogger George " El Guapo , " of latinoreview.com , caught some video outside — watch it here . )
In a room full of bloggers , journalists and the well - wired , a flurry of reports surfaced instantly on Twitter .
" So if you did n't already know , dude got stabbed in the eye with a pen .
Fighting over … seats .
Everything delayed , " tweeted Kris Tapley , a writer for incontention.com .
" Confirmed : someone was arrested , " wrote Collider.com 's Steven Weintraub .
" Was just told someone was stabbed in the face in hall h.
Blood def. Everywhere . "
San Diego police and California Highway Patrol officers lingered around the area where the incident occurred , toward the back of the room , stage left .
The dispatcher who spoke with TheWrap could not confirm whether anyone had been arrested or booked , but described it as " a minor incident . "
Maybe so , but it caused the afternoon 's panels to be long delayed .
Officials brought the house lights up and began showing trailers , imploring people to return to their seats .
The panel for the comedy " Paul " finally took the stage , and its stars immediately began the Q&A session after footage was shown , even as police continued to talk with witnesses in the back of the hall .
No one from the panel or Comic - Con addressed what had happened .
But when " Cowboys & Aliens " came to the Hall H stage , director Jon Favreau announced the star of the show last : Harrison Ford , who was led to the stage in cuffs by security guards , much to the delight of the Comic - Con crowd .

Most people know that before Andy Warhol rose to fame as a pop artist , he was a commercial illustrator who worked for a number of stores and magazines in New York , among them Harper 's Bazaar .
A number of his lively fashion drawings for Bazaar from the late 1950s and early ' 60s are currently on exhibit at the Hearst Tower .
Gazing upon the spreads featuring Warhol 's ink and flat - color paintings of shoes , hats , gloves and beauty products made me think about how magazines never use drawings of merchandise now .
I asked a creative director friend if he'd seen the exhibit , and whether he liked it .
He frowned slightly and looked bored .
“ It was ... cute . ”
I mentioned how it seemed sad that no magazine today would think of using drawings , no matter how charming , to accompany an article about things to buy and wear , and my friend 's eyes widened in horror at the mere thought of it .
“ Oh no !
We would never do that !
No one would believe it .
Not modern .
Photography is modern . ”
A colleague who had been following our conversation grinned and remarked , “ But photos are n't any more real than illustrations .
They 're so fake you might as well have drawn the picture , anyway . ”
Despite our willingness to completely trust an image once conjured as if by magic from light and chemistry , and now made up of pixels , pictures lie and they always have .
From double - exposed Victorian spirit images to modern digitally retouched files , photographs occupy a strange liminal space between truth and fiction .
Yet we want to believe them , even though we know better : nothing seems more authentic to us than a photograph .
In the professional realm of publications , art directors now tend to rely upon conceptual photo - illustrations that could just as easily have been drawn .
Instead of hiring an illustrator to depict the world as an apple with oceans nibbled out , leaving the continents rendered in the apple 's perfect red skin , they now hire a photo - illustrator , who hires a food stylist , whose assistant nibbles the apple , which is then photographed .
The idea could be delivered in either format .
Why do we prefer this photographically created visual metaphor over a drawn or painted one ?
Because it seems more real .
This is not an anti-Photoshop rant ; Photoshop is a fantastic software program I use every day , which can be put to work as creatively as anything else in a designer 's arsenal , to transform and build upon what was actually shot .
Prior to its existence , photographers relied on tools such as work prints , X - Acto knives , rubber cement and paint to alter their work , with a great deal more time and effort .
In the 1980s , Jean - Paul Goude made idealized images of Grace Jones assembled from cut-up and airbrushed prints , achieving gorgeous , physically impossible pictures that could not possibly exist in the real world .
The September 2009 issue of Bazaar featured Goude 's studio shots of Naomi Campbell digitally merged with images he shot in Africa .
The resulting photos show the supermodel plausibly wrestling with an alligator and keeping pace with a racing cheetah .
Even Richard Avedon 's work prints show obsessively detailed markup instructions for the retoucher .
Altering photos is not a new game , nor even particularly remarkable ; it dates back to the birth of the medium .
What 's troubling is that Photoshop can remove a photographer 's own vision from the final version of his or her images published in a magazine 's pages .
The photographer Hiro envisioned his models as forms and shapes in white space , planning and sketching out every detail for weeks before a shoot , making sure everything was perfect before he clicked the shutter .
Hiro 's particular surreal , vividly colored way of seeing and thinking infuses every shot with a personal distinctive stamp that is uniquely his and cannot be duplicated .
Far too often art directors do n't trust their photographers to create work that will suit the pages of the magazine and please its readers .
Many shoots are only vaguely thought out in advance , an expensive hodge - podge of props and backgrounds rented , models cast for half - baked scenarios thrown together and quickly snapped , “ saving time ” by shooting multiple set-ups and components with the intention of having it all somehow come together as a narrative , later , through the magic of Photoshop .
The artist 's vision has vanished from the equation .
Instead of carefully composing and framing the shots in - camera , the job falls to the designer , who must choose from a dizzying array of options to assemble composite photos , hardly representative of the photographer 's sensibility .
The images become just Tinkertoys , endlessly reconfigurable .
Which background ?
Do you like her in the red shirt or the blue dress ?
Oh , we hate the blue dress ?
[ Image > Adjustments > Hue ]
Look , now it 's a yellow dress .
Why do all 50 clocks in this photo about running late show the same time ?
Let 's Photoshop them with times 10 - minutes apart over a two - hour time span .
It would have been just as easy , and a lot less expensive , to think of that in advance and set the clocks accordingly in the studio .
Photoshop time ai n't cheap .
In an interview with the principals of design studio Hjarta Smarta , legendary magazine art director Ruth Ansel said , “ Photography is not a substitute for experience — any more than theater , opera or painting is — but a metaphor for all our experiences ... photographs reveal a truth that reaches far beyond appearances . ”
Lately , photographs reveal a truth based on appearance alone and not on experience — i.e. , something that happened in the real world — at all .
Among Warhol 's drawings exhorting a reader to “ Wear Bright Blue with Blue ! ” and “ Wear Brick Brown with Brown ! ” in the Hearst exhibit are paired with the artist 's car and Coca - Cola paintings of 1962 , his first forays into combining drawn lines with repeated silkscreened images .
The future can be seen moving away from the line and into the photographic representation : more real - seeming to us , even though we know photos tend to provide a fake version of the truth .

Poll : Half of ' Birthers ' Call it ' Suspicion ' ; A Third Approve of Obama Anyway Obama 's birthplace has been subject of controversy since election .
May 7 , 2010 -- Fourteen percent of Americans say without prompting that they think Barack Obama was born in another country , rising to one in five when those with no opinion are offered that as a possibility .
But for many it 's not a firm belief – and some appear not to hold it against him .
Among those inclined to think Obama was born abroad , half also say that 's their suspicion only , not a judgment based on solid evidence , the latest ABC News / Washington Post poll finds .
And perhaps surprisingly , about a third of so - called " birthers " nonetheless approve of Obama 's work in office and express a favorable opinion of him personally .
Click here for a PDF with charts and questionnaire .
Still it 's mostly Obama critics who suggest he was born abroad ; two - thirds of those who express that view also disapprove of his work in office and view him unfavorably overall .
That , along with other data , supports the notion that some of this view is an expression of antipathy toward Obama , rather than a firm belief he was born in another country .
Obama 's birthplace has been the subject of some controversy since the election campaign , given the Constitution 's requirement that the president be a " natural born citizen . "
The debate has persisted despite research by organizations such as Factcheck.org , which in November 2008 reproduced his birth announcement , published in the Honolulu Advertiser in 1961 , and said members of its staff had personally examined his birth certificate .
It declared : " The evidence is clear : Barack Obama was born in the U.S.A . "
The story returned to the news when the Hawaii legislature last week approved a bill authorizing the state Health Department to ignore repeated requests for information on Obama 's birth records .
The department 's director had testified it was taking time and resources to respond " to these often convoluted inquiries . "
The bill 's on the governor 's desk .
THE QUESTION – This ABC / Post poll posed the question neutrally ; first : " On another subject , where was Barack Obama born , as far as you know ? "
Sixty - eight percent said the United States ( or a location within the country ) , 14 percent said another country and 19 percent had no opinion .
Those with no opinion were asked , " Is it your best guess that Obama was born in the United States , or in another country ? "
( The order of those phrases was rotated ) .
That produced an additional 6 percent of Americans taking the " other country " option , for a total of 20 percent .
The number saying he was born in the United States rose to 77 percent , with the remaining 3 percent still expressing no opinion .
The other - country group includes 9 percent of Americans who said , in a follow - up question , that they think there 's " been solid evidence " Obama was born in another country .
The rest , 10 percent , called it their " suspicion only . "
( This could reflect a phenomenon in which some people may answer polling questions with something other than literal intent – rather , to express broader support for , or opposition to , an individual , group or policy . )
In addition to Obama disapprovers , people who are more apt than others to say Obama was born in another country include conservatives , Republicans , supporters of the Tea Party political movement ( 31 percent in each group ) , evangelical white Protestants ( 33 percent ) , and supporters of John McCain in 2008 ( 30 percent ) – all groups broadly critical of Obama .
There 's also an educational element , with people who have n't gone beyond high school nearly twice as apt as those with postgraduate degrees to suggest Obama was born abroad .
At the same time , 15 percent of Democrats say they think Obama was born elsewhere , as do 12 percent of liberals .
And among people who say this , 31 percent approve of his job performance regardless , with an additional 3 percent expressing no opinion of his work in office .
Similarly , among people who think Obama is foreign - born , 34 percent also express a favorable opinion of him overall ; 64 percent , unfavorable .

A group of Argentinian hackers have managed to gain access to The Pirate Bay 's admin panel through a security breach .
Via the backend of The Pirate Bay website they were able to delete torrents and expose users '
IP - addresses , emails and MD5 - hashed passwords .
The Pirate Bay is currently working on a fix while the site is offline .
In the past TorrentFreak has covered several weaknesses in websites belonging to anti-piracy websites such as the RIAA .
However , a recent posting by the Argentinian hacker Ch Russó shows that The Pirate Bay is not invulnerable to such exploits either .
Russó , who claims to be researcher born in Buenos Aires , has published a video that shows how he got into the Pirate Bay admin panel .
Here , the hacker could manage all torrents in the site ’s database with full admin access .
In addition , Russó shows that he had access to sensitive user information such as IP - addresses and emails .
TorrentFreak has contacted a Pirate Bay insider who informed us that that several people are currently looking into the issue while the site is offline for upgrades .
The downtime is not related to the hack , but it will be used to solve the vulnerabilities .
“ We decided to rewrite all database - handling anyway , since it was 6 years old , ” we were told .
According to our source at The Pirate Bay , who did n’t want to give out too many details at the moment , the hackers were only able to execute the SQL injections after they gained access to the admin panel .
Russó claims that he has no bad intentions and that he merely wants to inform the public that their information is not as secure as they like it to be .
A humble goal , wrongly executed .
In the process he exposes several email addresses and other privacy sensitive information that is clearly visible in the video .
Although the information obtained by Russó might be worth a few bucks to some interested anti-piracy outfits , he has no plans to sell any of the information to any third parties .
“ Probably these groups would be very interested in this information , but we are not [ trying ] to sell it , ” Russó told KrebsOnSecurity .
“ Instead we wanted to tell people that their information may not be so well protected . ”
The Pirate Bay folks on the other hand are confident that the problem will be fixed during the current downtime period .
They further assured us that it was impossible for the hackers to find out the true passwords of the site ’s users .
Update : The Pirate Bay is back …

As Mr. Whelan said , “ We all know how problematic e-mails can be . ”
If there is a fight brewing over Ms. Kagan at all , it seems to be over the records .
Mr. Sessions has been pressing hard for them , and warned in the interview that Republicans might use the filibuster to block Ms. Kagan ’s confirmation if all the documents are not released in enough time for senators to review them before the start of the hearings , now scheduled to begin June 28 .

Hearings on her nomination are to begin this month .

“ We would not like to filibuster , ” he said , “ but I would say a failure to produce documents and actions in that vein could lead to more tension than some people might expect . ”
Senator Patrick J. Leahy , the Vermont Democrat and Judiciary chairman , said Republicans were trying to use a double standard .
“ We ’re going to have far more documents than we had for Roberts and Alito , and a lot sooner , ” he said in a telephone interview from his home in Vermont , referring to the two justices nominated by former President George W. Bush , John G. Roberts Jr. and Samuel A. Alito Jr .
Conservatives and liberals alike are eager for the documents ; both sides would like to gin up a little bit of controversy , if only to energize their bases in this midterm election year .
Nan Aron , president of the Alliance for Justice , a liberal advocacy group , said the records had the potential to transform Ms. Kagan “ from a candidate who ’s a blank slate to one with a very complex , intricate portrait . ”
In the weeks since her nomination , Ms. Kagan has been making the usual courtesy calls to senators .
So far , she has visited more than 50 of them , a parade of mostly ho - hum sessions that Dahlia Lithwick , who writes about legal issues for the online magazine Slate , has aptly dubbed “ the Elena Kagan Bore ’ Em to Death Tour . ”
So far , only one Republican , Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma , has said outright that he will not vote for her .
Others , including Mr. Sessions , say they have serious questions about Ms. Kagan , citing her lack of experience  she has never been a judge  and her decision to briefly bar military recruiters from facilities at Harvard Law School while she was dean .
Yet the complaints seem to have gained little traction .
Michael Perelman is puzzled by the administration 's attempt to blame environmentalists for the failure of climate change legislation :
Politico reports that the Obama folk blame the Greens for the failure of its energy bill because it was THEIR responsibility to lobby ...
So , here is the story : misinformed Greens voted for Obama for change , but the change was that it was the responsibility of the Greens to create the change .
Of course , the White House needs a strong grassroots movement to fight powerful interests , but it also has the responsibility to lead that movement rather than make deals with those whom the grass roots people oppose .
...
Here 's the part of the story linked above the raised Michael 's ire :
... The blame game has already begun .
One exasperated administration official on Thursday lambasted the environmentalists – led by the Environmental Defense Fund – for failing to effectively lobby GOP senators .
“ They did n’t deliver a single Republican , ” the official told Politico .
“ They spent like $ 100 million and they were n’t able to get a single Republican convert on the bill . ”
But many say it was Obama who did n’t do enough to make the climate bill a big enough priority , allowing other monster big - ticket items like the economic stimulus , health care and Wall Street reform to suck up all the oxygen and leaving environmentalists grasping for straws too late in the game – well past the expiration date for other big accomplishments during the 111th Congress .
“ The absence of direct , intense presidential leadership doomed this process , ” said Eric Pooley ...
Going back to Day One , Obama never turned his campaign proposals into formal legislative text , leaving lawmakers to shoulder the load .
And when Obama spoke publicly about the issue , it was only with a vague call for “ comprehensive energy and climate ” measures that did little to help win votes .
...
The leadership from the administration on climate change has been about as effective as its leadership on additional stimulus and job creation .
At least they are n't blaming the unemployed for their failure to lobby effectively for a jobs bill .
It 's not possible to give the administration a passing grade for effort in either case , let alone for results .
In fairness , this is one official speaking , I do n't think the administration more generally is pushing the line that the failure of climate change legislation is due to lack of effective lobbying by environmental groups .
I suppose it can be argued that these groups could n't even move the administration to effective action , but I doubt that 's an argument the administration will want to make .
In any case , it has more to do with the administration 's misguided notion that bipartisan , centrist victories will be anything more than Pyrrhic – if they can get them at all – than it does with lack of attempts from the left to get the administration to pursue these objectives .

Steve Paikin will never be mistaken for some sort of radical .
The host of TVO 's current - affairs program , The Agenda , has a reputation as a fair - minded interviewer .
With this in mind , I will reproduce some of his tweets today ( June 26 ) from the G20 protests in Toronto :
" i saw police brutality tonight .
it was unnecessary .
they asked me to leave the site or they would arrest me .
i told them i was dong [ sic ] my job . "
" they repeated they would arrest me if i did n't leave .
as i was escorted away from the demonstration , i saw two officers hold a journalist . "
" the journalist identified himself as working for ' the guardian . ' he talked too much and pissed the police off .
two officers held him .... "
" a third punched him in the stomach .
totally unnecessary .
the man collapsed .
then the third officer drove his elbow into the man 's back . "
" no cameras recorded the assault .
and it was an assault . "
" the officer who escorted me away from the demo said , ' yeah , that should n't have happened . ' he is correct .
there was no cause for it . "
" i can appreciate that the police were on edge today , after seeing four or five of their cruisers burned .
but why such overreaction tonight ? "
" the demonstration on the esplanade was peaceful .
it was like an old sit in .
no one was aggressive .
and yet riot squad officers moved in . "
" police on one side screamed at the crowd to leave one way .
then police on the other side said leave the other way .
there was no way out . "
" so the police just started arresting people .
i stress , this was a peaceful , middle class , diverse crowd . no anarchists "
" literally more than 100 officers with guns pointing at the crowd .
rubber bullets and smoke bombs ready to be fired .
rubber bullets fired "
" i was ' escorted ' away by police so could n't see how many arrested , but it must have been dozens . "
" we must make a distinction between the ' thugs ' who broke store windows and torched cop cars and the very reasonable citizens who ... "
" ... just wanted to remind the authorities that the freedom to speak and assemble should n't disappear because world leaders come to town . "
" i have lived in toronto for 32 years .
have never seen a day like this .
shame on the vandals . "
" and shame on those that ordered peaceful protesters attacked and arrested .
that is not consistent with democracy in toronto , G20 or no G20 "
" 2 . Who specifically gave the order to clear the street ? was that decision made on site or by a higher authority ? "
" Does the tor police svc have any evidence of dangerous acts from those demonstrators that forced them to act that way , at that time ? "
" if any journos are talking to the police chief on sunday , those would be questions i'd like answered .
ok , that 's it .
signing off tonight . "
Circumcised women experience sexual arousal and orgasm as frequently as uncircumcised women , according to a study in Nigeria .
The researchers also found no difference in the frequency of intercourse or age of first sexual experience between the two groups of women .
These findings remove key arguments used to defend the practice , they say .
Friday Okonofua and colleagues at the Women ’s Health and Action Research Centre in Benin City studied 1836 women , 45 per cent of whom had been circumcised .
During the operation , all or part of the clitoris and the labia are removed .
Proponents of female circumcision claim it makes virginity at marriage and marital fidelity more likely .
Opponents condemn it as dangerous and painful .

The women filled in questionnaires , asking about their sexual history .
The results show “ female genital cutting cannot be justified by arguments that suggest it reduces sexual activity in women , ” write the team in BJOG : An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology .
Two million women
Circumcision is common in Kenya , Ethiopia , Somalia , Nigeria and Sudan .
It is often performed using crude , non-sterilised instruments .
Okonofua ’s team also found that the circumcised women were more likely to have lower abdominal pain , genital ulcers and urinary tract infections .
An estimated two million women and girls undergo genital mutilation every year .
But in some regions , it is the women themselves who must be persuaded the practice is undesirable , say local health workers .
Circumcision brings women respect from other members of the community , points out Sudanese women ’s health rights campaigner Nahid Toubia .

Porcupine Tree
Dream logic
by Anil Prasad
If listeners are n’t careful , the latest Porcupine Tree album might blow their speakers or earbuds apart seconds after hitting the play button .
The British prog-rock outfit ’s tenth studio release The Incident kicks off with a window - rattling , repeating power chord designed to focus its audience on the album ’s epic conceptual themes .
The disc explores human tragedies that are often trivialized by being reduced to the word “ incident ” by the media .
The album ’s dark subject matter involves delving into a terrible traffic accident and its aftermath ; religious cult activity ; and the impacts and emotions that occur when bodies are found at random by strangers .
It ’s not all doom and gloom though .
The album also looks at positive personal incidents from the life of frontman , guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Steven Wilson , including his first love , a lost friendship , and the day he chose to throw caution to the wind and become a full - time musician .
The album paints its sonic pictures with varied brushstrokes .
Together , Wilson , keyboardist Richard Barbieri , bassist Colin Edwin , and drummer Gavin Harrison , combine their genre ’s proclivity for extended , mercurial passages and intricate interplay , with metal , pop , electronica , and folk influences .
The album covers a variety of moods from dark and thunderous to dreamy and delicate .
It ’s an appealingly eclectic approach , and one that ’s captured the attention of an exponentially - growing fan base .
In fact , word - of - mouth recommendations and grassroots marketing efforts propelled The Incident to a simultaneous debut in the Top 20 in both America and Britain .
The band also just released Anesthetize , a live DVD capturing its 2008 Fear of a Blank Planet tour .
In addition , a download - only live recording from the same tour titled Atlanta is now available , with the band ’s proceeds going to the Mick Karn Appeal , supporting the ex-Japan bassist ’s battle against cancer .
Outside of Porcupine Tree , No-Man , Wilson 's atmospheric pop duo with singer - songwriter Tim Bowness , recently put out Mixtaped , a performance and documentary DVD .
Another documentary DVD titled Insurgentes , based on Wilson 's 2009 debut solo album of the same name , is due out in the fall .
His ambient , drone - based work under the Bass Communion moniker also continues , with its latest live recording Chiaroscuro .
And The Complete I.E.M. , a box set of the entire output of Incredible Expanding Mindfuck , Wilson ’s Krautrock - influenced experimental project , was just released .
Wilson has also remixed the majority of the King Crimson back catalog in surround sound , which is being reissued throughout 2010 and 2011 .
Wilson explored many facets of his diverse output in this wide - ranging conversation with Innerviews .
The Incident features a very provocative , in - your - face opening sequence .
What made that appealing to you ?
There ’s a tradition with Porcupine Tree in which we start albums with a little sound effect or texture that eases you into the musical journey .
This time , I thought “ Would n’t it be great to start with a real statement of intent ? ”
The American composer John Adams is a big influence on me .
He has a piece titled “ Harmonielehre ” that starts with the whole orchestra playing these big grand power chords stabbing away .
It ’s an almost primitive approach , reducing music down to one big note .
I thought “ If we ’re going to write a big , album - length piece of music , let ’s not start with any pretentious ambient stuff .
Let ’s go for the big note too . ”
So , I sat down and came up with this power chord that appears in three groups of three .
It sounded good and the rest of the album grew from there .
That represented a key difference in the creative process compared to previous Porcupine Tree albums .
With this one , each piece I wrote naturally led to each subsequent piece .
So , everything grew out of that opening salvo .
The order you hear the album in is literally the order it was written in .
With the other albums , I wrote a bunch of parts and found the best way to structure and sequence them .
The plot and character development , structure , and story evolution of The Incident meant I had to write in a linear way .
It was like writing a movie script .
I do n’t necessarily mean lyrically .
Lyrically , this album is much less conceptual than Fear of a Blank Planet .
It has a much looser concept .
But musically , it ’s all about the structure , the story and how it unfolds , and the way the characters come in and out of it .
By characters , I mean the different musical themes and chord sequences that reoccur , and how the rhythmic opening to “ Occam ’s Razor ” appears again later .
That ’s a lot like character or plot development .
So , I think the script analogy works really well .
I love cinema as much as I love music .
I often think very much in terms of cinema when it comes to music .
Did you map out any of the elements before starting to write ?
Not consciously .
When I start writing , I ’m always thinking “ I do n’t know where the story is going to go . ”
I know some writers map out the whole plot , but it ’s not my approach .
For this album , I wrote chapter one , which suggested chapter two , which suggested chapter three .
It ’s a very intuitive process and it ’s something I could never have done before now .
It took a lot of experience and learning from my mistakes to accomplish it .
The Incident is n’t he first time I ’ve tried to do this .
I tried to do it as far back as The Sky Moves Sideways .
The original idea for that album was that it was going to be a one - track record .
I got really bogged down in the idea and it did n’t work .
It felt too ponderous and long .
I ended up scrapping the ideas and wrote some short pieces instead .
That ’s how the album evolved into what it became .
The Incident is the latest in a long line of attempts to write a long - form musical novel , having focused on short stories before .
For whatever reason , perhaps because of experience , it seemed to work this time .
I love big , epic , ambitious novels and movies , especially those that do n’t necessarily move in a logical way using a typical Hollywood approach .
I prefer the European approach , which is often quite fragmented and surreal , which enables things to evolve in a unique way .
It ’s almost like dream logic in that you do n’t necessarily arrive at the end you intended .
Instead , you arrive somewhere you had no idea you would end up .
It ’s amazing to witness The Incident attain serious chart positions and sales , given the fan base remains so organic .
Totally .
It ’s still all word - of - mouth .
What a great position to be in .
It ’s fantastic .
It ’s funny , the more willfully uncommercial we are , the more successful we are .
Fear of a Blank Planet was our previously most successful record and The Incident has sold more copies than that .
So , the more pretentious and ambitious we are , the more people that like Porcupine Tree .
Perhaps it ’s a sign of the times .
Maybe download culture has driven people back to looking for something more substantial — something that can justify them buying a physical product .
In the past , we ’ve tried to be a little more what the record company wanted .
We would give the record company a couple of singles .
With Fear of a Blank Planet , we said “ Fuck it .
We ca n’t write this stuff .
We ’re not good at it . ”
There are a few songs in the back catalog that are quite good pop songs , but I recognize that ’s not what we do best .
We do the long - form things the best .
The Incident is a continuation of the Fear of a Blank Planet philosophy and we ’re doing better than ever .
You ’re uncomfortable with your emerging guitar hero status .
Why ?
I feel like a fake because I ’m not a great guitarist .
I know I have a sound that ’s my own , but it comes from my overall vision for how I want to make records and my production approach .
I recognize and accept that I have a style too , and I think it partly comes from my limitations .
I ’m just not interested in playing fast or being an Olympic guitarist .
That does n’t appeal to me .
I ’d rather hear someone play one note with feeling that can break my heart , than 50 notes that mean nothing .
I ’ve never been interested in being a great technician , which is just as well .
I do n’t have the discipline or inclination to do that .
How do your limitations on the instrument influence your creative process ?
I write in a very intuitive , idiot savant kind of way .
Once I ’ve put the music together , I have to present it to the band at some point .
For instance , Richard Barbieri might say to me “ What ’s the chord ? ” I ’ll say “ I do n’t know , but this is how I do it ” and play it for him .
He ’ll say “ That ’s a B flat diminished ninth , ” and I ’ll respond “ Whatever . ” [ laughs ]
When I write , I ’m literally looking for sounds that feel good .
I do n’t have any academic background to know what a B flat diminished ninth is .
I think this holds true for most of the important musicians I really love too .
I do n’t think Bob Dylan knew a lot of the time what chord he was playing .
In contrast , all of the kids that go to the Berklee School of Music usually graduate and tend to start making jazz - fusion music that no - one listens to except other music students .
I believe you can sometimes know too much about what you do , and the truth is , I ’ve never read guitar magazines or fetishized the tools I use to make music .
Elaborate on that for me .
I do n’t approach the guitar the way a typical guitarist or musical purist would .
I ’ve always approached it as part of the texture of the songs .
So , I use a lot of amp simulation software in my work .
When I tell this to some other guitar players , they ’re horrified .
It ’s a common thing to do , but most real guitarists still feel you should put a guitar through a real amp and mic it up .
And those who use amp simulation are often trying to emulate classic amp tones .
This has led to a lot less distinctive musicians .
It ’s so easy to copy the tones of other musicians .
In the '70s , there was no such thing as a $ 250 box with presets that let you sound like Jeff Beck or Eric Clapton .
What I do is use amp simulations in a purely creative way , and that ’s why a lot of people think some guitar sounds on the record are keyboard sounds and vice - versa .
Tell me about your amp simulation software setup .
I take my guitar , plug it directly into an Apogee Trak 2 Mic Preamp and A - D Converter and go straight into an input bus , and from there into a Logic front - end , running the Pro Tools engine underneath it .
Then I put it through a Line 6 Amp Farm , and then into a chain of ridiculous plug-ins that I experiment with until I get sounds and textures I love .
I use a lot of plug-ins that are n’t meant for guitar at all .
I use a suite of plug-ins called D - Fi for Pro Tools .
They ’re designed to fuck up songs .
I particularly like the ring modulator plug - in .
It ’s very low - fi and allows you to reduce the bit rate and sample rate of a sound until it begins to break up .
You could never get such digitally distorted sounds out of a real amp .
I also love the Line 6 EchoFarm which lets me add wobble and dropouts to the sound .
In addition , I use the Focusrite d2/d3 multi-band EQ and compressor / limiter plug - in bundle .
I use a lot of extreme d2 - based EQ in my stuff .
I also love a lot of low - fi stuff .
I like to even add vinyl crackle and old , primitive analog sounds into my work .
There ’s a track called “ The Yellow Windows of the Evening Train ” that does n’t have any guitar on it .
But all of the sounds on it are processed to sound old .
That usually means taking a load of bottom end and top end out .
The reason people say vinyl sounds warmer is because CDs reproduce the top end so much better and more clearly .
So , the old kind of sound was much more warm and middle -y .
One of the great ironies of the way I make albums is that I record completely digitally , yet people say my records sound like vintage ‘ 70s records .
The reason is that I take a lot of that top end out to make the music sound more golden nostalgic and old .
The same goes for guitar tones too .
I like them to sound old .
And the only way I know how to do that , ironically , is through digital recording technology .
On the current Porcupine Tree tour , you mainly rely on Paul Reed Smith Custom 22 guitars .
What makes them ideal for you ?
They feel great and look great .
They are also incredibly versatile and can cover a lot of bases that more classic guitars can’t .
When you listen to Porcupine Tree music , you ’ll hear a very wide sonic spectrum , from extreme metal lines to tones that include the ambient , blues , jazz and acoustic worlds .
When we recorded The Incident , I used Les Pauls , Stratocasters and Telecasters , and the Custom 22 allows me to replicate their sounds within a single instrument .
You also used a custom Paul Reed Smith baritone guitar on the new album .
Describe it for me .
Winn Krozack , the Director of Artist Relations at Paul Reed Smith , offered to make me a guitar .
I said “ One thing I ’ve always wanted is a baritone because there ’s a Swedish band called Meshuggah , and I love how they play their guitars tuned way down , with the top strings taped up . ”
It ’s a beautiful instrument with a faded blue mateo top and a satin nitro finish , 27 - inch scale , 22 frets , and a tremolo bridge .
I also asked them to do something unusual and put a piezo pickup on it as well , so I can combine the glitchy sound of the strings with the Paul Reed Smith Mark Tremonti treble pick - up that ’s on it .
You can hear the combination on a track on The Incident called “ Your Unpleasant Family ” that has a very jangly , open guitar chord sound , but it ’s played on the baritone , so it ’s much lower than a typical guitar register .
In general , this particular guitar informs a lot of the heavier stuff on the album .
Typically , you use standard tuning , with the exception of dropping your bottom string to D or C .
Why is that your preference ?
It came from me listening to metal music .
A lot of those guys go down low .
Porcupine
Tree does n’t play metal music , but I like some of these tones .
However , I do n’t like a lot of heavy records , in general .
I find it quite difficult to listen to them for more than 10 minutes .
Texturally , they get very same -y .
It ’s as if someone is screaming in your face for 60 minutes .
[ laughs ]
You become kind of immune to it after a few minutes .
With Porcupine Tree , when we do use heavy sections , it ’s the context that makes them have a significant impact .
For instance , “ Circle of Manias ” is a very heavy piece , with the baritone guitar tuned way down .
It comes immediately after an acoustic ballad .
I think that sense of relief and dynamics emerged for me from loving the sound of extreme metal records , but not loving the records themselves that much .
The AlumiSonic Ultra 1100 guitar is another core instrument in your arsenal .
What do you like about it ?
It looks fantastic because it ’s entirely made of metal , and it sings in a way no other guitar I ’ve ever had does .
The sustain is really impressive too .
It generates beautiful , sympathetic feedback between the amp and guitar that I ’ve never experienced before .
Because it ’s made of metal , it has more reflective surfaces , so the harmonics reflect more freely and musically .
Describe the other elements of your signal path .
I do n’t use a lot , typically .
In concert , 60 to 70 percent of the time , it ’s just my guitar going through my Bad Cat BC - 50 amp head into a matching Bad Cat 4x12 cabinet , maybe with some delay and reverb .
I have a TC Electronic G - System effects processor that ’s easy to use , but in terms of actual sounds , they ’re the same as you get out of any typical guitar box .
I ’m also using the Option 5 Destination Rotation Single Vibe pedal , Boss FV - 500L Stereo Volume pedal , Soundblox Multiwave Guitar Distortion pedal , Boss SD - 2 Dual Overdrive pedal , and a Jim Dunlop Cry Baby Wah pedal .
The new album has some intriguing and entertaining guitar solos .
What can you tell me about your soloing philosophy ?
It ’s based on the Robert Fripp approach — play the notes with conviction , but do n’t think too hard about what you ’re playing .
Also , play as few notes as possible with as much emotion as possible .
I ca n’t play any other way .
[ laughs ]
I ca n’t play fast .
Gavin Harrison found a clip on YouTube of a guy who can play “ Flight of the Bumblebee ” on guitar at 320 BPM .
He must have spent months and months learning how to do it .
Why ?
Unfortunately , a lot of kids are enthralled by the athletic element , resulting in a lot of so - called shredders out there .
It ’s like if we conducted this whole conversation with me speaking at an incredibly fast rate constantly , without putting any expression or feeling into my voice .
You would learn nothing about me .
It ’s the way I express the words and the feeling I put into them that tells you something about who I am .
I understand you were unhappy being forced to learn guitar as a child .
Give me a snapshot of that period and how your enthusiasm for the instrument reemerged .
It ’s quite simple .
My enthusiasm reemerged when I fell in love with music .
Before that , I was n’t interested in music .
I was interested in soccer .
My parents tried to send me to piano and guitar lessons at age seven , when I was more interested in being a soccer player .
By age 10 , I discovered pop and rock music and fell in love .
I did n’t fall in love with the idea of being a musician and touring , or becoming a star .
I fell in love with one thing , and one thing only , which is the idea of making records .
My goal was to hold something I made in my hands , which in the late ‘ 70s and early ‘ 80s meant vinyl .
It ’s that straightforward .
From then on , I did whatever I needed to achieve that .
I retrieved this guitar that had been abandoned a couple of years earlier in my parents ' attic .
It was from Woolworth ’s and it cost 25 quid , which was a lot of money in those days living in Hemel Hempstead , a city north of London where I still reside .
I tuned all the strings on the guitar so it made a nice sound and I started to learn how to play guitar .
I also started writing my own songs from day one .
To this day , I can not play anyone else ’s music .
For instance , if you asked me to play “ Stairway to Heaven ” on guitar , I would have no idea .
Your Cover Version series of releases provide evidence to the contrary .
[ laughs ]
Okay , yes , I can learn those things when I need to , but I do n’t learn things just for the sake of doing so .
If you say to a lot of guitar players “ Play me the first lick of Black Sabbath ’s ‘ Snowblind ’ or Fleetwood Mac ’s ‘ Landslide , ’ ” they can do it .
It ’s almost part of their vocabulary to know these things .
But I do n’t know anyone else ’s music at all except mine beyond the cover versions I ’ve recorded .
Your general musical influences are very well known , but I ’ve never heard you talk about your key guitar influences before .
Fripp is my number one influence , no question .
The others are mainly the major prog-rock guitarists , including Alex Lifeson and David Gilmour .
I ’ve been working a lot with Fripp recently , remixing the King Crimson back catalog .
When I was very young and first heard those King Crimson records , I would think “ That ’s just wrong .
You ’re playing the guitar wrong , mate ! ”
But the more you start to listen to Fripp ’s playing , the more you appreciate his choices of notes .
Fripp is a very unique man and his guitar playing reflects that .
He does n’t pick notes in any sort of logical way , but he plays them with conviction .
He blew my mind open when I heard his solos on King Crimson ’s “ A Sailor ’s Tail ” and Brian Eno ’s “ Baby ’s on Fire . ”
Just extraordinary stuff .
I ’ll never be able to play like that because you have to have the mind of Fripp to do that , but there is certainly an influence from him in terms of choosing unique notes and making them sound beautiful .
Are you quoting from King Crimson ’s “ Red ” on “ Occam ’s Razor ? ”
Probably . [ laughs ]
I ’m sure I am .
It ’s in my DNA .
It does n’t matter if it ’s conscious or unconscious .
I ca n’t get away from it and I do n’t want to get away from it .
What was it like for you to work on the King Crimson surround remixes ?
It was an amazing experience .
It ’s funny , because one of the things someone asked me when I said I was going to work on the King Crimson catalog was “ Are n’t you worried it ’s going to destroy your love of this music ? ”
That ’s because there ’s a sense of if you know too much about the way things were put together , it can rob you of some of the mystery and enigma .
I would say the opposite situation occurred .
I now have even more respect and appreciation for the work , and particularly for Robert .
There are some extraordinary ideas going on in those records .
Being able to go inside them and decode how they were put together was fantastic .
Truthfully , I still do n’t understand how Robert put everything together .
He was no help in explaining things to me .
[ laughs ]
He ’s not about to help you understand how the music was created .
In a way , and I mean this positively , he probably does n’t know himself .
What artistic license did Fripp provide you during the remixing process ?
What would happen is I would get the tapes , transfer them , and create the mix .
Then Robert would come along and we ’d listen to my mix .
He ’d make suggestions and changes .
He made some changes I would never have been brave enough to make because I was trying to be faithful to the original .
But Robert would say “ Oh no , I never liked that .
Let ’s get rid of that . ” [ laughs ]
It ’s stuff that people are intimately familiar with .
They ’ll probably be horrified by some of the changes , but the thing is , it was Robert ’s decision .
He always said to me “ You have the fan ’s perspective .
If you think it ’s the wrong thing to do , I will bow to you . ”
But sometimes he ’d make a suggestion and I ’d say “ Yeah , I actually kind of agree with that .
Even though I ’m intimately familiar with the original , I can understand why you want to do it . ”
We made a big edit to the improv section of “ Moonchild ” from In The Court of the Crimson King , which I always felt went on too long .
Most people do .
Robert said “ Let ’s cut it . ” I said “ Are you sure ?
People have been listening to this record for 40 years . ”
And Robert said “ Yeah , fuck it .
Let ’s cut it . ” [ laughs ]
So , “ Moonchild ” is three minutes shorter on the master .
But you get the full - length version as a bonus track .
Ultimately , I was trying to be very faithful to the original albums , because I ’m intimately familiar with them and love them .
I think a lot of people will understand why Robert has done what he ’s done .
The only things I would agree with him on are when there was a sound reason to make a change .
For instance , he took out some synth overdubs that Pete Sinfield had made to Lizard .
What you have to understand is when you ’re in a band , there are a lot of politics and compromises going on .
Now , 40 years later , he does n’t have to bow down to them .
He does n’t have to keep people happy .
So now , he ’s like “ I never liked that .
We only did that because Pete wanted to do some synth stuff . ”
So , he took stuff out and I totally agreed .
Bass Communion remains an important part of your solo output .
Describe the vision that informs your output under that name .
The approach I ’ve adopted with Bass Communion is that every record uses a different musical force .
So , Ghosts on Magnetic Tape is mainly piano and old 78 RPM records .
Pacific Codex was based purely on gongs and metal sculptures .
And Molotov and Haze , the last studio release , was an album based entirely on guitar .
And for the next album , I ’m sure I ’ll use a completely different force as well .
The idea is to use different ingredients each time and figure out how to Bass Communion - ize them .
I think the problem with a lot of drone artists is that the records sound kind of the same after awhile .
With Bass Communion , every record is kind of different .
Everything has been through the Bass Communion process , but the source material in each case is unique .
What can you tell me about how you used and processed guitar for Molotov and Haze , and the live album Chiaroscuro ?
It ’s all laptop and guitar .
[ laughs ]
The laptop is running Logic , running a lot of plug-ins .
Basically , what I do is string about 15 plug-ins on a channel strip , set up basic settings on them , and dial them in and out .
I ’m also using a Line 6 DL4 Stompbox Delay Modeler to create loops .
So , I ’m feeding in notes from the guitars into the Line 6 , which creates the loops , and that feeds into Logic .
I ’m really just playing very subtly with the mutating textures of the guitar loops .
The plug-ins are native to Logic .
They ’re the ones that come with it for free .
Some of my favorites include “ Spectral Gates ” which is like a noise gate , but it only affects certain parts of the frequency spectrum .
I use it a lot .
There ’s also a whole range of very bizarre distortion plug-ins that affect the harmonics of sound in very eccentric , unique ways .
Describe your attraction to the universe of drone - based music .
I find it very interesting because it ’s very hard to convince many music lovers that drone music is music at all .
Most Porcupine
Tree fans would probably have a hard time accepting Bass Communion as music .
The problem is , if you take away rhythm and harmony from music , most people will not recognize the existence of music at all .
I think that holds true for the West , but not necessarily for many Eastern cultures in which drone - based music is a part of everyday life .
That ’s exactly true .
For me , drone music goes to the very root of what we are .
The album I fell in love with as a kid was Tangerine Dream ’s Zeit .
I consider it the original ambient record .
It changes the way you think about the space you ’re in when you listen to it .
A way of explaining to people what drone music is , is saying it ’s like filling a room with incense or perfume .
But let ’s get away from the drone thing for a minute and talk about it as purely textural music .
Anyone that ’s been to a movie theater and seen a horror movie or thriller has probably responded to sound as pure texture in an emotional way .
In a horror movie like The Shining , you ’ll find drone music that ’s scary as fuck .
However , if you play that music in a standalone context and say “ This is music ” you ’ll find that people say “ That ’s not music .
That ’s just sound . ”
But if you had an emotional reaction to it in a movie , why ca n’t you have an emotional response when it ’s reduced to pure textures ?
It ’s just a question I ask .
It sounds very pompous , but I ’m saying it anyway .
I want to educate people to listen to music in a slightly different way or perspective .
I was initially into later Tangerine Dream and then I heard their Zeit album .
The first time I heard it , I said “ This is n’t music .
This is just people mucking about . ”
The more I listened to it , the more I began to decode what was so special about it .
Now , if you ask me what my favorite album of all time is , very often I ’ll say Zeit .
The record never loses its appeal for me .
It ’s the greatest ambient record ever made .
It has a complete sense of otherness that I cannot explain .
It ’s a bit like Fripp ’s guitar playing .
It keeps its enigma .
Since I got into Zeit , that kind of pure textural music has been my music of choice to listen to for pleasure .
I do n’t find it obtrusive or bland .
It ’s neither one nor the other .
It has an incredibly emotional effect on me , but I ’m always able to do other things while it ’s happening around me .
That ’s where this analogy with incense and perfume really comes through .
Speaking of film , what ’s going on with your Deadwing script ?
We keep showing it to anyone that will read it , but it ’s very hard to get someone to give you a million dollars to make a movie , particularly one that ’s very uncommercial and written by people who have never written a script before .
That ’s why I took the pragmatic step of making a film about the making of my first solo record Insurgentes .
Lasse Holle came out with me and we made this surreal road movie that ’s much more than a documentary .
It has a lot weird , surreal , fucked - up stuff in it .
In addition to stuff about the album , it deals with my thoughts about download culture .
You ’ll see me destroying 10 iPods in 10 different ways .
It has Trevor Horn talking about the same subject .
There ’s also a social commentary aspect about what it ’s like to be a musician in the current era .
We ’re very happy with it and I ’ve got my fingers crossed that it will get some attention .
It ’s a beautiful piece of filmmaking .
In the back of my mind , I hope that if it can get some kind of profile , it will give us more of a chance for Deadwing .
So , my aspirations for the film world are not over yet .
Give me a snapshot of the coming months for you .
After this period of wall - to - wall Porcupine Tree touring , I ’m going to start working on my second solo album .
I was very pleased with the first one .
It was well received , which was gratifying , because it was quite different .
It had aspects of my other projects , but fused together in a way I had never pursued before .
It combined some of the Bass Communion aesthetics of noise and texture with songwriting , using an orchestra in an atonal , wall - of - sound way , and integrating my love of shoe gazing music for the first time as well .
No disrespect to Richard Barbieri intended , but it was interesting to be in a position in which I did n’t have to rely on a keyboard player .
So , I used the guitar in a more textural way .
Now , I 'm looking forward to the next step .
I have no idea how the album will sound .
I ’m going to take what I did on Insurgentes and go further into more twisted and experimental areas , but still have it all based on what are effectively songs and vocal pieces .
I ’m just going to go to my studio and start experimenting , which is how the first album happened .
It ’s quite liberating not to have to consider what other musicians are thinking about .
When I write for Porcupine Tree , I ’m aware that I ’m writing for three other musicians and I ’m cognizant of what they do and do not like and what they will and will not respond to in a positive way .
So , while that limitation is essential and important for a band that has a style and direction , at the same time , I ’m happy not to have that limitation with my solo material .
So , if I want to fuse a beautiful orchestral passage with a complete wall of noise within a pop song with trip - hop elements , all in the space of eight minutes , I can .
And that ’s what I did with Insurgentes .
So that will be my next major writing and production project .
The Beatles , Bob Dylan , the Rolling Stones and more missed Woodstock — and not for very good reasons .
This is a good “ hindsight is 20/20 ” list — but since hindsight IS 20 / 20 , here you go .
Woodstock was certainly a monumental moment in music and cultural history — but clearly did n’t include all of the biggest bands of the era .
I started researching why different bands were n’t included on the bill and found that a lot of them had excuses that are laughable .
In retrospect .
At the time , all they thought they were missing was a low - paying random music festival in the middle of the rain .
1 | Bob Dylan – fear of a gathering storm of hippies
There are two theories on why Dylan turned down Woodstock .
One is that his daughter got sick .
I ’m not buying it .
I like the other theory — he lived near Woodstock … saw hippies slowly gathering … channeled his inner Cartman … and realized instead of playing at the concert , his best bet would be to get the hell out of town for the weekend and away from all the hippies .
Sick daughter be damned .
2 | Jethro Tull – fear of naked ladies
Seriously .
In an interview with SongFacts.com , Ian Anderson explained why he and the other Jethro Tull guys did n’t want to play .
I asked our manager , Terry Ellis , “ Well , who else is going to be there ? ”
And he listed a large number of groups who were reputedly going to play , and that it was going to be a hippie festival , and I said , “ Will there be lots of naked ladies ?
And will there be taking drugs and drinking lots of beer , and fooling around in the mud ? ”
Because rain was forecast .
And he said , “ Oh , yeah . ”
So I said , “ Right .
I do n’t want to go . ”
Because I do n’t like hippies , and I ’m usually rather put off by naked ladies unless the time is right .
Wow .
If I ’m starting a band , I do NOT want a fear of naked ladies to be a quality possessed by my lead singer - slash - flautist .
3 | Led Zeppelin – concert in New Jersey instead
Zeppelin had their own tour going that summer , where they were headlining .
So when they got the word that they could come play at Woodstock with a bunch of other bands , they passed it up — because why just be one of 30 + bands in a concert when you could headline your own show in Asbury Park , New Jersey ?
4 | Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention – too much mud
Zappa turned down the gig last minute because he heard rain was coming and did n’t want to play around all that mud .
( Bad for the festival , good for one of his future children who no doubt would ’ve gotten a name like Runny Soil Zappa or Muddlicious Orthopedic June Caralarm Zappa . )
5 | Joni Mitchell – did n’t want to miss the Dick Cavett Show the following Tuesday
On August 19th , 1969 , two days after Woodstock officially ended and one day after it actually ended , Dick Cavett featured Jefferson Airplane , Joni Mitchell , and Crosby and Stills ( sans Nash ) on his ABC prime time show .
Two of those three acts played at Woodstock .
Joni Mitchell did not because , in a case of homeschooling - level over - caution , her manager made her skip her Woodstock gig so she would n’t miss her scheduled appearance on Dick Cavett .
Mitchell was so upset that she ended up writing the song Woodstock — not from first - hand experience , but from what Graham Nash ( sans Crosby and Stills ) told her about the festival .
So basically , that song is like the A Million Little Pieces of Woodstock lore .
6 | I -ron Butterfly – demanded helicopters for transportation
As much as the crowd would ’ve enjoyed making out to I - ron Butterfly ’s hymns , they never got a chance .
The Butterfly bunch could n’t get their equipment up to Woodstock because of the traffic .
So they made a deal to use The Who ’s equipment , and helicopter themselves in .
The Woodstock organizers did n’t want to pay for helicopters for them … after all , if I - ron Butterfly gets helicopters then everyone ’s gonna want them … plus , word is , they were a little uneasy about I - ron Butterfly ’s edgier music riling up the crowd .
( Perhaps they had flash forwards to Woodstock ’99 when Limp Bizkit ’s angry suburban rap - rock induced a bunch of angry suburban kids to riot and plunder .
No one has more justifiable angst than white suburban kids . )
So I - ron Butterfly just stood there at the NYC Port Authority waiting for a chopper that never arrived .
7 | The Doors – fear of getting shot by someone in the crowd
Apparently , by 1969 , Jim Morrison had such a raging case of agoraphobia that he refused to play outdoors because of a genuine belief that it would give snipers too good of a shot .
Really .
And , at that point , he still was n’t The Saint so he could n’t just roam around in disguise .
8 | The Beatles – Yoko was n’t invited too
One of the biggest questions in music history is “ Why were n’t the Beatles at Woodstock ? ”
It ’s up there with “ Who was so vain that they probably thought this song was about them ? ” , “ Did Rob Base just say he ‘ ca n’t stand sex ’ ? ” and “ Did New Kids On The Block really think people would n’t notice that Hangin ’ Tough and You Got It ( The Right Stuff ) are the same basic song ? ”
And there are three theories why the Beatles did n’t end up as a part of the festival …
(1) John could n’t get a visa to come to the U.S. because of his drug arrests .
( And Nixon did n’t like him . ) ( 2 ) Other than their B - Sharps - inspiring rooftop concert in January of 1969 , they had n’t played a show together since 1966 .
( 3 ) John agreed to play but only if Yoko ’s Plastic Ono Band also got an invite … and the Woodstock organizers said hell no .
I ’d say # 1 is the most boring theory , # 3 is the most entertaining theory … and # 2 is probably the most accurate theory .
9 | Rolling Stones – Mick Jagger was shooting a bad movie in Australia
In case you think that stars making the transition from music to bad acting only started with the advent of the Fast and the Furious franchise , let this be a history lesson .
Musicians have been making the ill - advised jump from the recording studio onto the movie set forever .
And most of them are way more Ja Rule than Mos Def .
While Woodstock was going on , Mick Jagger was in Australia , starring in a film about the life of an Australian - born folk hero named Ned Kelly .
He was one of those glorified outlaws who stood up to injustice from The Man , kind of like that Cuban guy from all the t- shirts .
Anyway , the movie ended up bombing , Mick was mediocre … and neither he nor the director even showed up to the premiere .
10 | Eric Clapton – in England with Steve Winwood working really hard on getting their new band off the ground
Woodstock caught Clapton at an awkward time .
The Yardbirds were long dead , Cream was recently dead , and Clapton decided to pour all of his effort into launching his new supergroup , Blind Faith .
So , rather than play Woodstock , Clapton and his Blind Faith bandmade Steve Winwood decided to have a retreat to really work on their music .
It did n’t work — Blind Faith would barely last another few months .
I will draw a parallel to this in a few years when LeBron James and Dwyane Wade skip the 2012 Olympics to practice working together over the summer when they realize their results produced by their superteam is less than the sum of its parts .
11 | Roy Rogers – accurately realized it was n’t really his scene
The organizers wanted him to come on at the end of the show and sing Happy Trails To You .
Which would ’ve been a worse ending than anacrhonistically having Journey play Do n’t Stop Believin ’ but cutting it off and abruptly going black .
Anyway , years later , Roy Rogers would say that ’s exactly why he turned down the gig .
Quote , “ I would ’ve been booed off the stage by all those goddamn hippies . ”

( Asking for a friend . )
A former transit police officer who fatally shot an unarmed man at an Oakland train station was convicted of involuntary manslaughter Thursday , capping a racially charged case that raised fears in the Bay Area of possible violence after the verdict .
Prosecutors accused the ex-officer of intentionally firing his handgun as he tried to handcuff Oscar J. Grant III on New Year ’s Day 2009 .
Johannes Mehserle , 28 , tearfully testified that the shooting was a tragic accident caused when he mistakenly grabbed his firearm instead of an electric Taser weapon during a struggle with Grant .
The shooting was captured on video by several witnesses .
Mehserle , who is white , fired a single round into the back of Grant , who was black and was lying face - down on the station platform .
Mehserle resigned a week after the shooting .
The killing provoked protests and violence in Oakland .
The case , which has drawn comparisons to the videotaped beating of Rodney G. King that ultimately triggered riots in Los Angeles in 1992 , was moved to Los Angeles for trial amid concern about the extensive media coverage of the slaying in the Bay Area .
Many civil rights activists considered the case a test of how the justice system treats police officers accused of abusing minorities .
The trial also captured the attention of law enforcement officers who feared that a guilty verdict could raise the stakes for cops who make mistakes .
The shooting occurred soon after police responded to reports of a fight on a train stopped at the Fruitvale Station .
Grant and four friends were detained by a different police officer who prosecutors said used excessive force against the men .
Mehserle arrived on the platform after the men had been detained .
Alameda County Deputy Dist .
Atty .
David R. Stein rejected the idea that the shooting was a mistake , telling jurors that Mehserle ’s holster was specially designed to prevent easy release of his firearm .
The prosecutor contrasted the light , bright yellow Taser gun with the heavier black Sig Sauer handgun that Mehserle fired .
“ He let his aggression dictate his conduct , ” Stein told jurors .
The prosecutor urged jurors to find Mehserle guilty of second - degree murder , pointing out that the officer never told his colleagues that night that the shooting was an accident .
Prosecutors in Los Angeles have not won a murder conviction in a police shooting case since 1983 .
Mehserle testified that he intended to use his Taser because he believed Grant , 22 , might be reaching for a gun in his pants pocket .
While the officer ’s firearm was on his right side , the Taser was in a holster on the left side of his belt but angled so that it could be pulled out with his right hand .
Two people , including a friend of Grant ’s , testified that they heard the officer say he intended to use his Taser shortly before the shooting .
In at least six other instances , officers have said they made the same mistake of firing a handgun when they intended to use a Taser .
Numerous witnesses said Mehserle looked shocked after the gunshot .
Defense attorney Michael L. Rains said video footage shows his client holding his head in his hands in despair .
“ He ’s sick to his stomach , ” Rains told jurors , “ because he has shot a man who did not deserve to be shot . ”

Didier Drogba has been tipped to make a speedy recovery after undergoing an operation on his fractured arm .
Ivory Coast striker expected to make speedy recovery
Thanks
Didier Drogba has been tipped to make a speedy recovery after undergoing an operation on his fractured arm , but his involvement at the World Cup still appears to be in the balance .
The Ivory Coast striker was forced out of his side 's warm - up game against Japan on Friday and it initially seemed that his World Cup dream was in tatters .
However , a spokesman later stated that Drogba had not been ruled out of the tournament ' at this stage ' and he has now gone under the knife .
The Ivory Coast Federation ( FIF ) is happy with how the surgery has gone and hopes he will regain fitness as quickly as possible .
" Following the fracture of the ulna which Didier Drogba suffered in the international friendly between Japan and the Ivory Coast , on June 4 in Sion , the national team captain was today , Saturday June 5 , admitted to the Lindenhof hospital in Berne , " read a statement on the FIF website .
" He was taken care of by Professors Ralph Hertel and Michel Gaillot , eminent specialists in their area .
" The surgical operation which was necessitated by his condition was performed with success .
" Professors Hertel and Gaillot , as well as the Elephants ' medical staff , are confident regarding the speedy recovery of the player .
" The FIF thank the sporting world and all those in the Ivory Coast , in Africa and throughout the world who have shown their support to Didier Drogba and the Ivory Coast . "
( CNN ) -- Warnings from the National Weather Service about excessive temperatures in the Northeast remain in place through Thursday , as temperatures approached or surpassed the 100 - degree mark for a second consecutive day Wednesday in many states .
An " excessive heat watch " will remain in effect through Thursday afternoon in parts of Delaware , Massachusetts , Pennsylvania and New Jersey .
The weather service says that temperatures maybe lower but the dew point temperatures will be higher .
That combination means heat indices will be close to 100 degrees again on Thursday .
A " heat advisory " remains in place for parts of Vermont as well .
Heat index values are expected to hover between 100 and 104 degrees Thursday , so the advisory will not be lifted until Thursday evening .
Meanwhile , the weather service projects that a " heat advisory " in place for the New York metro area will lifted by mid-day Thursday .
High temperatures are forecast to be about ten degrees cooler than they were Wednesday , as southeasterly winds come in off the Atlantic Ocean .
Show us ways that you are staying cool
Weather stations in Richmond , Virginia ; Raleigh , North Carolina ; and Mount Holly , New Jersey ; and at Philadelphia International Airport in Pennsylvania and Newark International Airport in New Jersey all registered triple - digit temperatures early Wednesday afternoon .
At Baltimore - Washington International Airport in Maryland , temperatures also hit 100 degrees Wednesday afternoon , 4 degrees shy of Tuesday 's high .
But CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said heightened humidity Wednesday made it feel similar to Tuesday -- and he warned that the hottest time of day lay ahead later in the afternoon .
Waterparks , pools and even fire hydrants became gathering places for people trying try to cool off as the record - breaking heat wave continued to roast much of the region .
Officials are advising people to stay indoors as the prolonged heat and humidity creates a " dangerous situation . "
The heat already has claimed at least two lives .
An elderly woman was found dead Monday night in a Philadelphia home without air conditioning , according to the city medical examiner 's office .
An adult was found dead inside a Baltimore home with a temperature higher than 90 degrees , the Maryland state health department said Wednesday .
Young , fit people have succumbed to the extreme temperatures , too .
Four midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis , Maryland , were being treated for signs of heat exhaustion Wednesday morning , according to academy spokeswoman Judy Campbell .
The extreme heat caused scattered power outages in some states .
There were customers without power in Connecticut , Massachusetts and New Jersey .
Con Edison says customers who lost power in the New York City area should have electricity restored by early Thursday morning .
Michael Clendenin of Con Edison told CNN's American Morning Wednesday that his company has been able to keep the power on for all but 6,000 or so of its 3.2 million customers in New York City .
" It is the kind of thing we expect in heat waves like this and we are working very hard to try to minimize the impact . "
Clendenin said .
He warned that the situation is far from over .
" So far , I would say we dodged major bullets .
I think there 's still a big shoot - out going on . "
Clendenin said .
Power is n't the only thing in sporadic supply in the heat - afflicted region .
According to the general manager of the White Oak Ice company in Bensalem , Pennsylvania , " The whole tri-state area is just about out of ice -- New Jersey , Philadelphia and Delaware .
Absolutely unbelievable .
It 's terrible up here .
We have n't experienced this in 12 years , 13 years , " said John Sylvester .
" All the big major companies are out of ice .
Guys are scrambling .
They 're calling for ice and it's coming from Wisconsin , Ohio , the Carolinas and they 're running out .
Demand is way higher than what everyone can produce and I do n't see any end in sight , " Sylvester added .
" Other ice companies are calling us begging for ice .
There 's only a certain amount of guys who manufacture and a company like ours , we 're keeping up with it but we 're coming to an end .
We 've used all our ice in storage .
We start storing in February or March .
We make a couple hundred tons a day . "
In New York , the city set up as many as 400 cooling stations in its five boroughs , according to the Office of Emergency Management .
Emergency Management Commissioner Joe Bruno urged people to use the center , and advised neighbors to check on neighbors to make sure they are well .
Some of those neighbors might not have air conditioning to begin with .
New Yorker Alfred Roblero not only lacks air conditioning in his apartment , he has to walk up six flights of stairs to get there .
" It 's terrible .
Most of the time my heart is like beating like ... like I need air because of the heat , " Roblero told CNN 's Jason Carroll .
" This is a significant health emergency as well as a heat emergency , " Bruno said .
New York City officials say the unauthorized opening of fire hydrants often spikes during heat waves .
Residents are being warned not to open hydrants without spray caps , because it's " illegal , wasteful and dangerous , " and could lead to fines and / or imprisonment .
The city says illegally - opened hydrants could impede firefighting , waste more than 1,000 gallons of water per minute and knock down children , causing injury -- but adults can get legally - approved spray caps from their local firehouse that will limit water flow to 20 - 25 gallons per minute when placed on a hydrant .
In Middletown , Connecticut , police issued summonses for second - degree reckless endangerment to two high school football coaches who held practice in the heat , leading one student to collapse .
The assistant football coaches at Middletown High School staged a " strength and conditioning session that consisted of weight training and running " from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday , the Middletown police said .
A student passed out during a phase of the running that involved " sprinting up a hill several times , " police said .
In Nashua , New Hampshire , Ben Dionne spent part of Tuesday outside cleaning out a pool .
He told CNN affiliate WMUR he was following experts ' advice to stay hydrated .
" It 's hot .
I 'm just trying to stay cool and get as much water as I can . "
In Philadelphia , a 92 - year - old woman was found dead in her home .
The woman , who was discovered by a neighbor , had opened a few windows but did not have air conditioning , said a medical examiner 's spokesman .
The National Weather Service is urging people to protect themselves .
" Be sure to check on your elderly relatives and neighbors .
Coaches , trainers , camp counselors should remain alert for signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke , " the weather service warned .
The heat can also adversely affect animals , and that 's having an impact on a popular New York City tourist attraction .
The city 's health department bans carriage operators from working their horses " whenever the air temperature is 90 degrees Fahrenheit or above , " said department spokeswoman Suzanne Craig .
She said anyone offering horse - drawn carriage rides at those dangerous temperatures is subject to fines from both the health department and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , or ASPCA .
ASPCA officers in Central Park told Craig that operators complied with the mandate Tuesday , sidelining their businesses in the heat , except for early in the morning and late at night when temperatures dipped below 90 degrees , she said .
Some people are fleeing the city for cooler places nearby .
Mountain Creek Waterpark in Vernon , New Jersey , is drawing a lot of New Yorkers , park spokeswoman Alice Heinrich said Wednesday .
" It has been one of those weeks where everyone gets the idea , they see a heat wave and do n't have pools , so they come out to the waterpark . "
Heinrich said the waterpark is reminding visitors via its loudspeakers to drink fluids -- and making it easier for them to do so .
Waterpark workers are going around handing out water to people waiting in long lines for rides , she said .

Last month I posted a recipe for peanut butter banana granola .
Here ’s a zippy ginger - molasses version for those of you who like a bit of spice in the morning .
[ social_buttons ]
6 cups of old - fashioned rolled oats ( not quick - cooking or instant )
1 cup of walnut halves and pieces
1 cup of slivered almonds
1 cup of shredded coconut
1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon
Dash of salt
1/2 cup of honey ( or maple syrup )
1/2 cup of molasses
2 - 3 tablespoons of fresh ginger juice or store - bought ginger juice ( such as Ginger People )
1/2 cup of chopped crystallized ginger
Heat the oven to 325 degrees .
In a large bowl , combine the oats , nuts , coconut , cinnamon , and salt .
Set aside .
Combine the honey , molasses , and ginger juice in a smaller bowl and blend well using a fork .
Add the honey mixture to the oat mixture and stir to combine , using a large spoon or your hands .
Spread the mixture evenly on a rimmed baking sheet .
Bake for 30 minutes , stirring every 10 minutes .
Remove the pan from the oven , stir the granola , and set on a rack to cool .
Add the crystallized ginger pieces .
Stir the granola once in a while it comes to room temperature .
Do n’t judge the taste of the granola while it ’s hot – the flavor develops as the granola cools ( it tastes best the next day ) .
Transfer to a sealed container and store in the refrigerator for up to one month .
Makes 8 - 9 cups .

On October 5 , 2006 , the BBC reported that the second most senior leader of terrorist organization Al - Qaeda , Abu Ayyab Al - Masri , was killed in a raid in Haditha , Iraq .
This event would have been a crowning achievement for global anti-terrorism efforts , except that Al - Masri was not in fact dead .
The international media and U.S. military forces were mistaken about Al - Masri ’s whereabouts in the raid .
Proving to be a slippery and elusive figure , Al - Masri was declared dead at least once more on May 6 , 2007 by The Economist , and then most recently in April 2010 by numerous reputable newspapers and websites .
This failure of major media sources and military intelligence points to humans ’ pervasive susceptibility to misbelief ; and in matters far more mundane than the death of a top terrorist official , misperceptions of the truth plague our daily lives .
False beliefs carry a bad reputation for bringing turmoil and misunderstanding .
No less an enlightened thinker than Thomas Jefferson noted , “ It is always better to have no ideas than false ones ; to believe nothing , than to believe what is wrong . ”
Mistaken beliefs can mean the difference between war and peace in the case of conflicts such as the Cuban Missile Crisis or the more recent pursuit of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
Even common , small mistaken beliefs come with severe consequences like misbeliefs about appointment times that result in missed flights , missed jobs , and missed opportunities .
More recently , however , in an issue of Behavioral and Brain Sciences , psychologist Ryan McKay and philosopher Daniel Dennett posed the question of whether it can ever be right to be wrong .
They argued that false beliefs can be good for you , in at least one particular way .
McKay and Dennett systematically assessed a variety of different types of false beliefs — from pathological delusions to biased approximations of facts — for evolutionary value .
Misbelieving that everyone is out to get you , for example , would not be adaptive for human survival because it impedes the ability to establish close relationships with others .
Misbelieving that simply wearing a copper amulet will cure an illness when medicine is readily available is similarly maladaptive to staying alive .
McKay and Dennett concluded that only one mistaken belief passes muster , something that they called “ positive illusions . ”
Positive illusions refer to unrealistically positive views of oneself , unrealistically positive optimism toward the future , and unrealistic views of personal control .
McKay and Dennett argue that positive illusions are adaptive because they not only enhance psychological well - being — who does n’t enjoy thinking of themselves as better than others — but because they enhance physical health as well .
A body of research spearheaded by psychologist Shelley Taylor and colleagues over the past 25 years consistently demonstrates a relationship between positive illusions and benefits to physical health including recovery from disease .
Taylor ’s work has shown that HIV - positive individuals with unrealistically positive views of their health outcomes survived longer and showed a slower illness course .
In a similar set of studies , Taylor conducted extensive interviews with breast cancer patients and showed that those who fared the best with the disease were those whose positive illusions allowed them to attain a sense of meaning , a sense of mastery , and a positive view of themselves .
Such findings are not to suggest that receiving a diagnosis for a fatal disease should immediately be cause for smiling and celebration .
Indeed , it can be tremendously difficult to find optimism in dire circumstances : Author Barbara Ehrenreich described frustration with receiving advice to consider her own breast cancer diagnosis as a “ gift ” rather than a problem , in her recent screed against positive thinking , Bright - Sided .
Nonetheless , a significant body of psychological research supports a relationship between positive thinking and positive health outcomes .
Positive illusions work their magic through a variety of psychological mechanisms , even directly influencing physiological and neuroendocrine response as well .
Taylor ’s work has shown that people who typically engage in unrealistic self - enhancement also showed lower cardiovascular responses to stress , more rapid cardiovascular recovery , and lower levels of cortisol , a hormone associated with increased stress .
Despite the robust nature of findings on the benefits of unrealistic optimism , not everyone agrees that positive illusions are all that positive , and some psychologists argue they do more harm than good .
Psychologist David Dunning , for one , wrote a response to McKay and Dennett ’s article , noting that people smoke cigarettes while mistakenly believing they can avoid serious disease , and are overly optimistic that they alone are capable of handling their high blood pressure despite doctor ’s orders toward a stricter diet .
Summarizing his argument , Dunning asked whether one would agree or disagree with the following statement : “ When flying , I prefer my pilot to have an overconfident view of his or her ability to handle rough weather . ”
Whereas some disagree with positive illusions ’ adaptive value , others suggest that positive illusions are not the only category of misbelief valuable for human functioning and survival .
In another response to McKay and Dennett , psychologists Josh Ackerman , Jenessa Shapiro , and Jon Maner note that negative beliefs ( unrealistically pessimistic beliefs about oneself , the future , or one ’s personal control ) might be just as important in the context of close relationships and intergroup interactions .
For example , in the context of relationships , there is a well - documented tendency for women to underestimate men ’s interest in romantic commitment , a belief that actually leads men to expend more effort in courtship , thereby stabilizing the relationship .
In response to these critiques , Dennett and McKay concede that there may be situational variation in whether particular false beliefs are adaptive or not .
What is undeniable is that misbelief , misunderstanding , and self - deception are unavoidable in daily life .
The growing body of research on this topic suggests that we can understand that our inaccuracies , misbeliefs and errors may be healthy in certain circumstances , and that is a belief — whether illusory or not — that should provide comfort .

Comedy is in my genes .
My dad used to say : " There 's nothing so terrible that can't be laughed at . "
And he would laugh at the most horrible things – including his own Alzheimer's .
He found Alzheimer 's hilarious .
I 'm not kidding you – I 've always thought his was an interesting philosophy .
Once he got sick , instead of calling it Alzheimer 's he would call it " Old - Timer 's disease " .
I would go : " Dad , you 're making a joke ? ! ' "
He 'd say : " What can you do ?
You can't bloody do anything about it . "
I can be described as many things but no description of me is complete without saying " Englishman " .
My parents were from Liverpool and emigrated to Canada before I was born .
We also have Scottish heritage .
My relatives were railway workers and miners .
So my mother 's total acceptance of the bounty that came to me is hilarious .
The first time I took her to the Emmys , she was greeting people as if she was Her Majesty the Queen : " Nice to meet you .
What do you do ? "
Dad adored laughs and appreciated the giggle in everything .
He was very funny and a massive inspiration .
My grandfather was the same .
Dad loved movies and I grew up with British comedy .
My ultimate favourite is Peter Sellers .
I loved the Ealing comedies , Monty Python , Alec Guinness .
It 's true that Englishness , comedy and otherwise , is a very big part of my life : and there 's nobody more English than an Englishman who no longer lives in England .
The Cockney rhyming slang in Austin Powers was inspired by my dad .
He picked it up in the army .
He 'd often come out with this stuff .
You 'd hear him talk about crossing the frog [ frog and toad , road ] , or going up the apples and pears [ stairs ] .
I felt ripped off when he got Alzheimer's .
Little by little , I was losing the one person I wanted to see what was happening to me .
My mum is a certified English eccentric .
She has just turned 84 , and she is absolutely unique .
She 'll say anything that 's on her mind .
She has theories about everything and does n't worry about being wrong .
Bunny [ mum ] gave me whimsy and unpredictability and chaos and the courage to go out on a limb , which is all part of my creative process .
When my unbelievable explosion of success happened , my mum sent me tube socks for Christmas .
I laughed for 25 minutes .
Tube socks !
She told me , " Well , I just figured that with all that 's going on , you might forget to buy them . "
My parents taught me to do whatever makes you happy – follow your bliss .
That 's why I do n't make a lot of movies .
I 'm very meat and potatoes when it comes to work , putting in eight hours each day .
I only do what I love .
I love making things .
I 've taken up oil painting .
Right now , I 'm kind of obsessed with Colonel Sanders , the Kentucky Fried Chicken founder , who I 've painted in about 15 settings .
There 's no chicken in the paintings .
I would love to be a father .
I think I 'd be good at it , but I like just being a person .
Do n't forget to take time to be a person and do the things that make you happy .
Do n't get so caught up in the career thing .
It 's never going to nourish you .
It 's not , in the end , what matters .
On my death bed I 'm not going to say , " God I wish I did more movies . "
I 'm perfectly happy I was present for the ones I did .

The best analogy to describe the global financial system may well be " skating on thin ice . "
Despite all the " fixes " and " reforms , " the ice continues thinning for a variety of reasons which are not fixable in the current State / Plutocracy - dominated Status Quo : massive overindebtedness , both public and private , and a declining ability to service that ever - rising debt .
Thus it is natural for many observers to see the current crisis - du - jour ( Gulf oil well blowout , China 's real estate bubble , sovereign debt / banking insolvency in Europe , etc. ) as the " straw that will break the camel 's back , " that is , the crisis which will trigger a phase transition or tipping point to the global collapse which is already inevitable : demographics , exponential debt and resource depletion all render the status quo Neoliberal Capitalist Globalized system unsustainable .
The concepts of phase transition and the related " stick - slip hypothesis " play key parts in the Survival + critique , as they describe the process of a system reaching a " critical point " : the sand pile suddenly cascades , tectonic plates shift , causing an earthquake , or the buying of bundled debt ( such as mortgage - backed securities ) suddenly drops to near - zero .
But other forces are constantly striving to maintain the Status Quo , and as such they resist the dynamics pressing the global financial system to the breaking point .
These are negative feedback loops , and the major Central States have deployed powerful monetary and political tools to stave off collapse .
Here is a diagram of a positive feedback loop in which recession reduces housing equity which then further reinforces recession , which further depresses housing , and so on :
This chart illustrates how capital declines feed additional declines :
At the critical point , the positive feedback overwhelms the negative feedback and a death spiral ensues .
This diagram charts how raising taxes in a contracting economy to feed public unions and other tax - dependent fiefdoms creates a " death spiral " which ends in the bankruptcy of local government .
But the last two years have shown how those with enormous stakes in maintaining the Status Quo have thrown all their resources into staving off or deflecting the crises .
The Full - Spectrum Defense of the Status Quo is generally a facsmile of reform , a facade of " change " heralded as the " fix " to all our most pressing problems , or merely propaganda , i.e. a travesty of a mockery of a sham .
Nonetheless , we would do well not to underestimate the tenaciousness and reserves of those benefiting from the Status Quo , or the depth of their commitment to doing whatever it takes to defend their perquisites and power .
But in addition to feedback loops , there are also long - wave cycles which have tended to play out over history .
Nothing is written in stone , of course , except the endless repetition of human folly , and thus those who dismiss all cycles as mesaningless do so at their peril .
This chart from Weblogs & New Media : Marketing in Crisis illustrates four primary cycles which are set to coincide in the 2010 - 2022 time frame :
1 . The 80 - year ( four - generation ) cycle of U.S. history - - a major transformative crisis occurs about every 80 years ( 1781 , 1861 , 1941 , 2021 ) , as described in The Fourth Turning .
2 . The Fisher wage stagnation / price inflation cycle documented by David Hackett Fischer in The Great Wave : Price Revolutions and the Rhythm of History ; ( no precise length , but wages have stagnated and prices have been rising since the early 1970s )
3 . The credit expansion / bubble - bust cycle ( i.e. the Kondratieff cycle )
4 . The depletion of oil and other non-renewable resources ( lithium , uranium , etc. ; see The Long Emergency : Surviving the End of Oil , Climate Change , and Other Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty - First Century and Financial Armageddon : Protecting Your Future from Four Impending Catastrophes )
As a lagniappe , there is fifth cycle possibility conjectured by Elliott Wave Theory , the Grand Supercycle ( not shown ) , the last of which led to the 1720 South Sea Bubble collapsing and a 50 - year long depression , and a sixth relating to warfare , as wars also tend to cycle , as shown in The Rhythm of War ( recommended ) .
As an example of how Status Quo resistance / feedback loops can lengthen the unsustainable longer than seems possible : many of us knew housing was in massive bubble as early as late 2003 , yet the bubble continued expanding for over 3 years , finally popping in early 2007 .
The insolvent black hole known as Fannie Mae continued sporting a share of price of $ 65 - $ 70 , even as its obvious value was near - zero .
( I know , because I lost a lot of money betting that the supposedly infallible " market " would eventually pole - axe the fraudulent Fannie 's share price .
The value of Fannie 's shares did n't fall until the entire house of cards was in full - blown collapse . )
Thus I fully expect the U.S. Central State to continue borrowing and squandering $ 1.5 trillion a year to maintain the Status Quo and the American Empire , with few if any visible consequences , as the Chinese Central State and other exporting nations will desperately continue propping up low interest rates to keep their mercantilist fantasies ( that the U.S. will continue to be the dumping ground for the world 's massive oversupply of exports ) alive for another year .
The Fed will persist in its manipulations and machinations to prop up the housing market and the stock market , as those facades are the critical elements in the propaganda campaign to convince the fast - crumbling middle - class that all is well and the Plutocracy is not only firmly in charge , but it 's doing a darned fine job of it .
But the heat of insolvency is not dissipating , as much as it is merely being cloaked ; the ice is thinning every day , and the global financial system is becoming more brittle , more fragile , more vulnerable , more unstable and less resilient .
Meanwhile , obfuscation , misdirection , and outright propaganda have been normalized as " news , " the illegitimate ( shadow banking , shadow National Security State , etc. ) have been legitimized and those who challenge the Status Quo or act as whistleblowers are quickly discredited or marginalized .
My best guess : the wheels wo n't really fall off the wobbly global cart until 2012 - 2013 , with the possibility that it all hangs together ( against ever - longer odds ) until 2014 .
After a near - collapse experience , things will seem to improve for a few years , setting up the real collapse in the 2020 - 2022 time frame .
Just a guess ... to be revised as events unfold .

Image caption Satvati shows the house where the killings took place
Umesh Kumar and his wife Satvati Devi were woken in the middle of the night by loud cries coming from the neighbouring house .
" She was crying loudly .
She was pleading , ' Kill me , but please do n't hurt him . '
She loved him and they wanted to get married , " Ms Devi tells me .
Two days after teenage lovers Asha and Yogesh were brutally killed , Swaroop Nagar colony on the north - western outskirts of the Indian capital , Delhi , is still trying to come to terms with the tragedy .
Asha 's family was opposed to a marriage because Yogesh belonged to a different , lower caste .
Police have described the murders as a case of " honour killing " .
They have arrested Asha 's father and uncle in connection with the deaths and are looking for others .
In this poor , semi-rural community , tiny homes sit cheek - by - jowl and paper - thin walls offer little sound - proofing .
' Tied up '
When the cries on Sunday night became unbearable , Mr Kumar tried to intervene .
" When I went in , Yogesh was tied up in ropes .
He had bruises all over him .
And they were beating Asha , " Umesh tells me .
" They " were Asha 's uncle Omprakash Saini , her father Suraj Saini , their wives and her cousin , he says .
Honour in our community and society is paramount to us Titoo Saini
" I tried to save the girl , but they pushed me around .
They broke my spectacles .
They told me not to interfere since it was an internal family matter . "
The Sainis also warned Mr Kumar against calling the police .
" I do n't have a phone , the pay phone booths are closed at night , and the other neighbours were too scared to get involved , " Mr Kumar says .
The cries finally stopped at 4 am .
Ms Devi was sitting outside her front door when the Sainis came out , locked the house and left .
" We were wondering what happened to Asha and Yogesh , " she says .
" There were no more sounds from inside . "
The bodies were brought out in the morning once the police arrived .
And details began to emerge of the torture and beatings to which the young couple were subjected .
No remorse
" Their mouths were stuffed with rags , there were signs of beating and small burns on legs suggesting that they were possibly electrocuted , " a senior police officer who was the first to reach the crime scene told the BBC .
Asha 's uncle and father were arrested but the two men have shown no remorse .
" I'm not sorry , " a defiant Omprakash Saini told reporters after his arrest .
" I would punish them again if given a chance . "
If they wanted to kill their daughter , that 's okay .
But they should n't have killed our boy Meera Devi
The killings have stunned Delhi .
Cases of " honour killings " are regularly reported from the neighbouring states of Punjab , Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh , but in the capital they are uncommon .
Assistant commissioner of police Pankaj Kumar Singh , who is posted at Swaroop Nagar , says that although the area is part of the capital , the mindset of its people is the same as in the villages .
" A majority of the people here are migrants from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states .
People here are deeply rooted in their traditional beliefs , " Mr Singh says .
" Caste considerations hold much sway . "
In traditional Indian societies , women are often regarded as family property .
Marriages are carefully arranged by parents and elders and relationships outside of caste are frowned upon .
But proximity to the city and access to education often bring in modern influences , sometimes creating a conflict between traditional beliefs and modern aspirations in the minds of the young .
And these sometimes have fatal consequences , as in the case of Asha and Yogesh .
Although her family is no better off than his , it is from a higher caste .
There are no statistics on the number of " honour killings " in India , but Mr Singh says for every case that gets recorded , several others go unreported .
In the Gokulpuri area of north - east Delhi where the lovers lived and met , I visited the homes of both Asha and Yogesh , five minutes apart .
A group of local women sit mourning outside Yogesh 's house .
His sister , Renu Jatav , weeps inconsolably .
' Justified '
" I had no idea this could happen , " she says .
" He was having dinner , it was 9.30 pm on Sunday when Asha 's mother came and called him .
Yogesh was a driver .
She said someone needed the car , and he went . "
" Four or five policemen came to our house the next morning .
They said Yogesh had died , " Renu 's husband Rakesh Kumar says .
Image caption Renu Jatav is inconsolable over the murders
" We want strict punishment for them .
We want the death penalty .
We want them hanged . "
The neighbours vouch for Yogesh 's character .
" He was a very good boy , " one of them , Meera Devi , says .
" We are very angry .
We want justice .
If they wanted to kill their daughter , that 's okay .
But they should n't have killed our boy . "
At Asha 's home , her relatives are equally angry .
Cousin Lokesh Kumar Saini says : " We had talked to Yogesh and his family in the past and told them to stay away .
We had also found a good match for Asha and she was engaged .
" What will any parent do if they see their daughter in a compromising position with a man ?
What would you do if you were in the same situation ? " he asks me angrily .
" That 's why my uncles killed them . "
Another of Asha 's uncles , Titoo Saini , is convinced " the killings were justified " .
" We did it for our honour .
Honour in our community and society is paramount to us , " he says .
I ask them what honour the family has now that they are accused of murdering their own daughter ?
" If she had run away with Yogesh , what honour would we have left then ? " he asks .
" Moreover , that would have set a bad precedent for the other children in the family .
They would have done the same .
Then it would have been a slow and painful death for us every living moment .
This is better , " he says .
" Asha played in my arms as a baby .
I carried her for her funeral .
Did that not make me unhappy ? "
But Titoo Saini is clear that marriage outside of caste is a bigger evil than murder .
" How can we marry outside the caste ?
This can not be tolerated .
Only an impotent man will accept this .
If I was in their place , I would have done the same , " he says .
After decades of careful refinement , precision training and deep aesthetic study – then canning all that nonsense – Sunday ’s World Cup was the scene for the unveiling of Dutch football ’s latest revolution , the new style of ‘ Total Bastard Football ’ .
The totaalbastaardvoetbal tactical theory relies on a perpetual and fluid interchange of positions , demanding that all outfield players , be they a tightly - permed midfielder or even a bald midfielder , are able to boot any team who dares to play football against them firmly into touch .
The system places great physical demands on players like Mark van Bommel and Nigel de Jong , as they must boot them up and down the entirety of the pitch , covering every blade of ( thankfully absorbent ) grass on the pitch .
Though presented here for the first time on Sunday , the style has its origins in 1970s lower - league Dutch football .
The chief architect was Dutch legend Johan Knuyff , the inventor of the famed ‘ Knuyff Turn ’ , which involved ‘ knuyffing ’ down anyone who turned you .
Though they may have lost the final 1 - 0 to Spain , the birth of Total Bastard Football has presented the Holland team with previously unimagined possibilities .
“ Before I was simply viewed as a biscuit - kneed aesthete ” , mused striker Robin van Persie , “ but now I ’m moving into acting , with auditions lined up for a series of interchangeable 80s high - school jock bullies .
Take a hike , dicksplash !
Actually , I used to know a Dick Splasch ” .
Asked for a comment on this new Dutch style , Johan Cruyff replied : “ Que ? “

Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer ( Notre Dame ) , Charitable Crowdfunding :
Charitable crowdfunding is a global and rapidly growing new method for raising money to benefit charities and individuals in need .
While mass fundraising has existed for more than a hundred years , crowdfunding is distinguishable from those earlier efforts because of its low cost , speed of implementation , and broad reach .
Reflecting these advantages , it now accounts annually for billions of dollars raised from tens of millions of donors through hundreds of Internet platforms such as Charidy , Facebook , GoFundMe , and GlobalGiving .
Although most charitable crowdfunding campaigns raise only modest amounts , every year several efforts attract tens of millions of dollars in donations .
However , charitable crowdfunding also has its downsides .
Donors may misunderstand how the beneficiaries will use the funds raised or a campaign that unexpectedly goes viral may overwhelm a small charity or greatly exceed an individual ’s needs .
There have also been instances of outright fraud , as well as concerns raised about money laundering and terrorist financing .
Existing laws relating to charitable solicitations and charities more generally have either uncertain or limited application to charitable crowdfunding .
Broader fraud and money laundering laws may apply to the worst abuses , but these usually criminal statutes are rarely invoked .
The challenge faced by government regulators is therefore whether and how to modify existing laws to address the downsides of this new activity without unduly inhibiting the generosity that charitable crowdfunding encourages .
This challenge is made more difficult by the lack of information regarding the positive effects as well as the downsides of crowdfunding .
Finally , existing scholarship relating to charitable crowdfunding focuses on either the motivations of donors or tax implications instead of addressing this regulatory problem , even as some governments are beginning to develop proposals to address this activity .
This Article fills this gap by reviewing the existing , incomplete information regarding charitable crowdfunding and theories for regulating in the face of uncertainty to develop recommendations for addressing this new and growing phenomenon .

Apple says a fault on its new iPhone 4 is causing it to incorrectly display the phone 's signal .
Users who gripped the phone - which went on sale on 24 June - on the lower left - hand side noticed the signal strength and reception fell away .
Apple says the problem relates to an error on how the signal bars are displayed , rather than the signal .
However , some industry experts say that there may be a deeper signal problem than a cosmetic design flaw .
Apple is promising a patch fix " within a few weeks " .
Users may also choose to get a full refund within 30 days of purchase , the firm has said .
In a statement , Apple said the iPhone 4 had been " the most successful product launch in Apple 's history " and that all phones gripped in " certain ways will reduce its reception by one or more bars " .
" We have discovered the cause of this dramatic drop in bars , and it is both simple and surprising , " the statement read .
Changing the display may make some people feel better , but it does n't really fix the problem Stuart Miles , Editor , Pocket - Lint
" Upon investigation , we were stunned to find that the formula we use to calculate how many bars of signal strength to display is totally wrong .
" Our formula , in many instances , mistakenly displays two more bars than it should for a given signal strength .
For example , we sometimes display four bars when we should be displaying as few as two bars .
" Users observing a drop of several bars when they grip their iPhone in a certain way are most likely in an area with very weak signal strength , but they do n't know it because we are erroneously displaying four or five bars .
" Their big drop in bars is because their high bars were never real in the first place . "
Another way
Apple said it was going to adopt AT&T 's formula for calculating how many bars to display for a given signal strength .
The theory now is that , once the patch update has been applied , iPhone 's bars will report signal strength " far more accurately " providing users a better indication of the reception in a given area .
But Stuart Miles , editor of technology site Pocket Lint , was sceptical .
Speaking to BBC News , Mr Miles said the news raised a few questions .
Image caption
The iPhone 4 integrates the antenna into the case
" Why , for the first time , has Apple released a bumper for their phone , and why does no one else have this problem , " he asked .
" HTC makes metal phones , but they seem to work just fine .
" Changing the display may make some people feel better , but it does n't really fix the problem , " he added .
Apple said the new software to fix this would be released in a few weeks , claiming that as the problem also existed in the original iPhone , it would also be available for the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 3G .
However , there have been few - if any - complaints about older iPhones losing signal strength when held in a certain way .
Apple 's previous advice for iPhone 4 owners to overcome the problem of the device losing signal was to not place your hand on the lower left corner .
Apple chief executive Steve Jobs said : " Just avoid holding it in that way . "
This latest approach is an unusual admission from the company , which has apologised for " any anxiety we may have caused " .
The iPhone 4 went on sale on in June , with hundreds of people queuing Apple 's flagship stores across the globe .
One of the more embarrassing foul - ups from a major technology company Rory Cellan - Jones , BBC Technology Correspondent Read more on dot .
Rory
Many new owners reported that signal strength dropped when the phone was held .
The casing of Apple 's latest phone is made of stainless steel , and also serves as its antenna .

Terry today denied reports of friction within the England camp following the poor performances that leaves them needing a win against Slovenia on Wednesday to guarantee progression to the last 16 .
The defender added that the inclusion of Joe Cole could be the catalyst England need to spark their World Cup campaign .
But the England squad is set for a clear - the - air meeting tonight , during which they will review the dire 0 - 0 draw with Algeria on Friday .
" We have a meeting tonight to watch the game and see where we went wrong .
As a group of players we owe it to the people back home , " said Terry .
The draw against Algeria followed the opening 1 - 1 result against USA to leave them with just two points and third place in Group C , sparking reports of a rift between the senior players and Capello .
" On behalf of the players there 's no unrest in the camp at all .
We 're obviously still disappointed from the game the other night , but we have to pick ourselves up and we have to win the game on Wednesday , " said Terry .
" We 're all behind the manager , we should n't be looking at excuses or criticising the manger .
All we can do as a group of players is stick behind him .
We 're here , we 're supporting and we are fully behind him .
We know we 've got his support as well and that 's the main thing .
" I 'm not going to sit here and question the manager .
All I can say is I 'm here on behalf of the team and players and we 're all fully behind the manager .
Since the manager has come in he's had his ways and his philosophies that he 's brought to the side .
" That 's worked in the campaign and nothing should change from that .
We 've got to stay unified and stay together and get the win . "
Asked if he believed Joe Cole could liven up team , Terry responded : " I think so , we 've seen that with Chelsea .
I personally think he and Wayne [ Rooney ] are the only two in the side who can really open up things and are key to breaking down defences .
If he 's called on , Joe will do a great job . "
Terry added that all the England players shared the frustration exhibited by Rooney , who drew criticism for his comments to a TV camera after the Algeria game , criticising England 's travelling supporters for booing .
" Like everyone [ Rooney ] was frustrated with the way we played .
Were still upbeat , we 've still got to go into the last game trying to top the group .
We 've got to go out there and think sod it , we 've got one game left and we owe it to our fans to play well .
" Once we 're out there it is up to us as a group of players to do what the manager wants us to .
I 'm sure for the game on Wednesday everyone will have that fire in their belly . "
Terry said there was no fear in the England camp but admitted that failure to reach the second round was " unacceptable " .
" But until that minute comes I 'm going to keep myself upbeat and keep the lads ' spirits up , " he said .
" I 've certainly not enjoyed [ the World Cup ] so far but we do need to start enjoying it .
Even in training the lads have been uptight .
But we need our big players to stand up .
" I'm asking the fans to get behind us again because we 've got the best fans in the world .
If we go out then they have every right to have a go at us but its not going to come to that . "
Terry was stripped of the England captaincy earlier before the World Cup by Capello following a scandal surrounding his private life but the defender said it had not altered his approach in the dressing room .
" Since I 've lost the armband nothing has changed for me , " he said .
" I was born to do stuff like that and I will continue to do that in the dressing room and on the training field .
No one will take that away from me . "
The Denver district attorney ’s office has filed criminal charges against an HIV - positive man accused of spitting on a probation worker who was putting on his ankle monitor .
William O’Kelly , 48 , was charged with attempted second - degree assault with a deadly weapon and harassment June 2 .
Prosecutors are reviewing the case to determine whether the charges as filed are appropriate , said Lynn Kimbrough , spokeswoman for the district attorney .
O’Kelly is due in court for a preliminary hearing June 24 .
The Colorado Independent first reported the case and indicated that O’Kelly intends to fight the charges .
According to the Independent , O’Kelly ’s partner witnessed the incident and claims it was the contract worker for the probation department who was the aggressor .

Professor Barry Scott and Dr Murray Cox
Breakthrough in plant - fungi relationship
Massey biologists have uncovered for the first time the complete set of gene messages that define the symbiotic interaction between a fungal endophyte and its grass host .
Institute of Molecular BioSciences head Professor Barry Scott conducted the research with Dr Carla Eaton and Dr Murray Cox .
It may have implications for future research into understanding plant disease and pasture growth .
They looked at perennial ryegrass , which has a fungus living inside it in a symbiotic relationship .
“ We focused on a particular gene in the fungus responsible for signal transduction , ” Professor Scott says .
“ We knocked out that gene and reintroduced the modified fungus into the plant , and the results were dramatic . ”
The plant 's whole development was altered .
“ It was seriously stunted , it did n’t grow very well .
At the base of the grass there is usually a band of red pigments , but they were gone , and the fungus just grew out of control ; the symbiosis had completely broken down , ” Professor Scott says .
To make sense of these developmental changes , the team utilised a relatively new process , known as high - throughput sequencing .
They were able to rapidly sequence the transcriptomes ( sets of gene molecules that can be influenced externally and reflect which genes are active at any given time ) of both the fungal endophyte and the grass host .
“ We sent ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) from plants containing the normal fungus and the modified fungus to a company called Cofactor Genomics in the United States , ” Professor Scott says .
“ They sent us back a vast amount of data ; around 40 million sequences per sample . ”
Being able to obtain that amount of data would have been impossible just a few years ago , Dr Cox says .
“ Five years ago a large dataset would have been a few thousand reads , and now we ’re dealing with millions of reads , that ’s how much it has changed , ” he says .
The result is a spreadsheet that lists all the plant and fungal genes that show a statistically significant change between grass infected with the modified and normal fungus .
This was matched against the genome sequence of the fungus to find which reads were fungal and which came from the grass .
Just over 1000 of the fungal genes had changed significantly .
Professor Scott says the resulting data represents the first complete transcriptome of a plant - fungal symbiosis .
“ We now have a key insight into what ’s important in terms of symbiosis , and how it can quickly turn into a pathogenic relationship if things are altered slightly .
It ’s a really fine balance ; if you change the relationship subtly it is enough to tip it over the edge .
The fungus becomes a pathogen ”
The research will be published in the August issue of the international journal Plant Physiology .

The cupcake is an art form we can all get behind .
It involves baking , an art form in itself , decorating , where the sky is the limit , and photography if the results are good .
The best part is that even if the decorating is n't the greatest , you get to eat them !
The decorations are excellent in these ten crazy cupcakes .
1. Spaghetti and Meatball Cupcakes
Lisa Smiley showcases many kinds of cupcakes on her site Smiley 's Sweets and Creations .
One that caught my eye was a cupcake with spaghetti and meatballs on top !
2. Knit Night Cupcakes
Lauren Ulm of Vegan Yum - Yum made these intricately knitted cupcakes for a Knit Night gathering that included a goodbye party for one member .
The knitting on top of these cupcakes is made of marzipan yarn .
They went over so well , the process of " knitting " them was featured on The Martha Stewart Show .
3. Sushi Cupcakes
Craftster member eggyolk put together Bento boxes of mini-cupcakes that look exactly like sushi .
The rice you see is actually white sprinkles .
Chopsticks and gummy fish added the finishing touch .
4. Murdered Cupcakes
Craftster member Lethargic made a special batch of cupcakes for a gathering to watch a season premiere of the TV show Dexter , which is about a serial killer .
They feature bloody wounds made by knives fashioned from white chocolate .
Inside the cupcakes : red velvet cake , of course !
5. Vegetables
Broccoli cupcakes ?
You heard right !
Karen Tack and Alan Richardson of Hello , Cupcake !
have produced a series of books on cupcakes .
They find there is nothing that does n't go on a cupcake , one way or another .
The book What 's New , Cupcake ?
will show you how to make Lo Mein Chinese cupcakes , which have broccoli on top .
Yes , but this is no ordinary broccoli .
Each floret is made from candy and sprinkles .
6. Robot Cupcakes
Hello Naomi makes individual cupcakes that are works of art , but are even more awesome in a set , like these robot cupcakes that can be mixed and matched to build cute robots .
She also has sets of Pac - Man , Super Mario , and Space Invaders cupcakes in her extensive repertoire .

TV host Konnie Huq and Screenwipe presenter Charlie Brooker are engaged to be married , her spokeswoman has confirmed .
No further details of their plans to marry have been revealed .
Former Blue Peter presenter Huq - the new host of The Xtra Factor - has been dating Brooker , 39 , for several months .
Huq , 34 , recently said in an interview that she was in a relationship with a TV screenwriter called Charlie and that " he is definitely a keeper " .
" Is he ' the one ? '
Yes , but then I say that about everyone I date .
Two weeks later , I 've changed my mind . "
The presenter added that her life was on hold while she was on Blue Peter and now she needed " to get a move on " .
Huq was a member of the long - running show 's presenting team from 1997 - 2008 and appeared on Brooker 's Screenwipe last year .
Brooker is best known on screen for his acerbic and satirical critiques of the the media .
He also wrote Dead Set , a zombie horror which takes place on the set of Big Brother , and is a columnist for The Guardian newspaper .

Four show Newswipe was nominated for best entertainment programme at the Bafta TV Awards at the weekend , but lost out to Britain 's Got Talent .
Derek Zona at the Copper & Blue wrote a important post about the serious issue of homophobia and anti-gay bigotry in hockey today .
It is an absolute must - read .
If you have n't read it , stop here , and go read it .
It is a powerful piece of writing , and it makes the strong case for the NHL and the NHLPA to take initiative in combating the bigotry of those who are n't heterosexuals .
Read the comments too , they go in depth of the complexities of the issue .
While reading it myself , one of the parts of the post really stuck out the most to me , and ultimately led me to write this post :
While it 's a good sign that people at all levels in the NHL have begun to speak out , this is n't limited to professional hockey .
The anti-gay culture is pervasive throughout all levels of hockey and it's not likely to change any time soon without a giant push in the right direction from the NHL .
There are still over 15,000 near - adults playing higher - level amateur hockey in North America .
Of those , some 3,500 are playing Major Junior or NCAA Hockey .
As sure as Brian Burke is that there are gay men in professional hockey , I 'm sure that there are many times that number in the amateur ranks .
Yet these kids are left on their own , far from home , far from any support system , invariably alone , a gay kid playing a sport in which gay men are reviled , living in fear of being discovered .
There is nowhere to go , no one to talk to , and nowhere to turn but inside themselves , and that loneliness and fear almost certainly impacts their on - ice performance and , to a greater extent , their careers .
With all due respect to Derek , I think the issue goes even far further than just players .
The culture not only dissuades gay players from coming out or even getting involved , but it would certainly affect those in other positions : management , trainers , coaches , and scouts among others .
And you can definitely believe it affects fans of the game at all levels .
I fully agree with his call for a top - down approach , imploring the NHL and the PA to both publicly and privately make an concerted effort to combat such bigotry .
I would like to argue that there also needs to be a bottom - up approach .
Basically , fighting this kind of hate needs to come from us , the fans , as much as it does have to come from the league , the union , and the teams .
And I believe the first step - perhaps the most important step - is something we can do by ourselves and right away .
Let me start off with an obvious statement :
No one is born a hockey fan , much less a player .
We 're all introduced to the sport in some way or form .
We learn about it from our families .
We see it on TV .
We read about it in the paper or online .
We hear about it on the radio .
A friend tells us about the sport .
We go to a game and see for ourselves .
And so forth .
By whatever means , we all have our own experiences that led to be hockey fans and to be fans of the New Jersey Devils .
Would we be fans of hockey , much less the Devils , if the atmosphere was not welcoming ?
That there was a sense of intolerance of who we are by other fans of the team / sport ?
For many , it 's certainly a deal - breaker .
Why should I spend any time , money , or other resources supporting a team or being part of a fanbase that seemingly does n't accept me for who I am ?
And while I can't speak for anyone , I certainly would n't be .
So let me ask some difficult questions .
Why would a gay person want to play the game if the banter in the locker room is disparaging of homosexuals , as if same - sex relations are a bad thing ?
How can anyone at any level of the game at any position on any team possibly think about coming out of the closet if being gay is the subject of derision and insult ?
Honestly , I do n't know .
Anyone who has put up with this has far more courage and tolerance of the intolerant than one can count .
What I do know is that it all contributes to an unwelcoming atmosphere .
Let me be cynical for a bit and talk about business in terms of how bad an unwelcoming atmosphere can be .
As fans , we claim to support the team .
Here , I think it 's fair to say that most of us support the New Jersey Devils .
Would anyone be a fan of the Devils if it was n't enjoyable to go watch a game ?
No .
It is in the team 's best interest to create as enjoyable of a time as possible for the people who go to games .
Yet , what does an unwelcoming atmosphere do for a minority of the people who go to games ?
It would certainly keep them from coming to games , and they 'll certainly tell other people to not go to games .
Given how many people know a friend , a co-worker , a roommate , a family member , or others who are gay , that 's potentially a lot of people being told about said unwelcome atmosphere .
That 's toxic in terms of public image and by virtue of people staying away from games , it can cut into revenue .
It 's no coincidence that the Devils ' pre-game announcements includes statements about how fans should see an usher if their " enjoyment of the game " is being compromised .
The Devils , like any other organization , want everyone to be welcomed .
The business is undercut when there is some kind of an unwelcoming attitude , perceived or otherwise , towards anyone .
Therefore , I do n't see how anyone can honestly claim to support the Devils or any other team and be a bigot and contribute to a phenomenon that very well may hurt the Devils or any other team financially .
That 's not support at all .
However , I 've heard the rationalizations from others about such sentiment and insults at games .
" It 's just juvenile . "
" The context is n't bigoted . "
" It 's just banter . "
" Who honestly cares , he / she is just a kid . "
" They are n't using the f - word ; do n't be so P.C. "
" It 's traditional to yell Flyers / Gomez Swallows . "
No matter what it is , it 's just an excuse that does nothing to address the problem , much less solve it .
One person may think it 's just immaturity to disparage an opposing player as gay , but the person next to him or in the row or section over may feel it's an unsaid message : " Do n't come here .
We do n't like your kind here . "
Even referring the player as effeminate ( e.g. Cindy Crosby - ring any bells , anyone ? ) or a metrosexual ( e.g. Sean Avery ) is n't the same thing as calling them gay - it 's just close enough for certain people to pick up on that subtlety .
I do n't doubt some if it based on ( a lot of ) immaturity , but it only furthers the unsaid message that it 's bad to be gay , and that hockey / the Devils / some other sport or team is n't for gays .
That 's unacceptable .
Can I claim to be so above all of this ?
Not really .
Do I take part in such juvenile - at - best , hateful - at - worst talk at games ?
No .
Of course not .
Such talk and feelings is wrong and unacceptable .
Do I always say anything about it when I hear it at games ?
Unfortunately , no .
I have had my own rationalizations from time to time at Devils games : " I do n't want to start any trouble . "
" He or she is n't going to listen to me anyway . "
" I did n't quite catch who said it . "
" It 's only some kid , he 'll grow out of it " " It 's been a long day , can't I just watch the game and ignore this garbage ? "
" I can't tell thousands of people to stop yelling ' Rangers Suck ' in Devils games against teams who are n't the Rangers ; much say anything about Flyers / Gomez swallows . "
As much as I do n't approve of it and as much as I write here about how odious it is , I can't say I 'm helping the situation by being silent .
Claiming that it 's just the crowd and I 'm not the crowd despite being among the crowd is nothing more than an excuse .
Therefore , here 's my simple proposal that any one of us can do at any part of the arena at any level : speak out .
If you hear someone at a game - at the Rock , at your local rink , in your locker room - say anything disparaging or insulting involving being gay , or how the player / team is gay , or similar talk - speak out to that someone .
Let me emphasize the speaking out to that someone part .
Here 's a suggested list of what to focus on if you 're not sure :
Tell them that it 's hateful .
Tell them that it 's wrong .
Tell them to leave that garbage at home .
Tell them that you 're offended .
Tell them that it offends others .
Tell them it paints a bad picture of the fanbase .
Tell them it makes them look incredibly stupid .
Tell them it hurts the team .
Tell them it hurts the sport .
Tell them it 's just inappropriate in public .
Tell them to grow up .
Tell them to please stop saying such things .
Tell them in the stands , on the concourse , outside the arena , Tell them one - on - one , perhaps during intermission or at some point and let them know privately .
Just tell them some how , some way , something about their ignorance .
Ultimately , simply speak out against the hate .
At a minimum , you can at least say you 've said your piece .
It may not be much , and it 's not guaranteed to stop anything .
However , the current method of sitting by and being silently disgusted is n't doing anything either .
Who knows , maybe the offender will actually listen , wisen up , and consider the man or woman nearby may be a fan or become a fan - and it 's OK if they are gay .
That 's the ideal and I 'm not so naive to believe that such a change will happen immediately ; it does n't mean an effort should n't be made .
But it can be the start of something .
Again , perhaps I 'm being too starry - eyed here , but people who play hockey tend to go to hockey games too .
If it is possible to firmly establish that homophobia and anti-gay bigotry is unacceptable in the stands , the people who are players or will become players could carry that attitude into the locker room and into the offices .
I know I 'm reaching here , but I do n't see how that 's impossible logic .
My main point is that changing the culture of the fans can help change the culture elsewhere .
I 'm not asking you to make a huge scene everytime you hear something .
I 'm not saying you need to lecture someone .
I 'm not asking you to act as a Thought Police ( though I would recommend sic'ing an usher / security on anyone who does n't stop yelling that garbage ) .
I 'm not asking for society to completely change or for mountains to move overnight .
What I 'm asking is simple : say something about someone 's bigotry to their face so they know that you , as a supporter and as a person , do not approve .
Something that can be said in as little as a sentence , not even a minute long .
That 's all .
Certainly seems simple to me .
As much as the NHL and the union and the teams may speak out against homophobia and reach out to various gay communities ( as they should ) per Dereks ' post , I do n't think they can't fully control what gets said in the stands .
That 's OK , because we do .
We are the fans who sit in those stands .
We buy the tickets , the food , the merchandise , and the privilege to watch our favorite team .
We create the atmosphere and we lead the best chants .
Quite frankly , the sport is n't what it is without us .
Therefore , we can and should use our voices to police ourselves as necessary .
We should stand with those who represent and support our team regardless of who they want to sleep with .
The crowd is us , and we should take responsibility in supporting the ideal that hockey is truly for everyone who is interested in the game on any level regardless of sexuality , race , creed , class , national origin , and other categorization .
In conjunction with league and team action , the effort in reaching that ideal would be that much stronger and make it much more possible .
It may not be much , I 'll at least make this simple effort and I hope that you will join me in it by speaking out against hate in hockey .
Thanks for reading .
Please let me know your thoughts on what else can be done by fans like myself at Devils games or any other games of other hockey teams at any level that can combat bigotry .
What do you think the Devils or any team should do ?
I put this under Devils Issues & Views , but it really affects anyone at the amateur , minor pro , high school , junior , college , and all other levels of the game .
All the same , please leave your thoughts in the comments .

Complex messiah
A convoluted theology has emerged in the wild woods of the comments section .
One writer greeted my return from vacation with an ironic taunt that suggested I thought he had nothing better to do than breathlessly await my return .
I do n't know , but that fact that he posted it the day I came back seemed to confirm that he DIDN 'T have anything better to do .
He also implied that I thought of myself as the messiah .
Now I do n't know where he would get an idea like that , other than my Facebook page where I have a photo of myself walking on water .
Then yesterday , a commenter said OBAMA was my messiah .
This was his considered response to my blog post that conservatives were out of ideas .
I guess this is what he considers an idea .
That and calling me Tommy ol ' boy three times .
Hard to argue with ideas like that .
I said all they have left is preposterosities like Sarah Palin .
The commenter went on to endorse her , pretty much confirming my whole post .
But I shall forgive them , for they know not what they do .

This is a guest post by John Fowles .
I was shocked today to read a description of the behavior of our fellow Latter - day Saints in Nevada who call themselves political conservatives or Republicans .
From what I gather , a Stake Presidency in Nevada invited Harry Reid to speak at a “ Why I Believe ” fireside ( Harry Reid has spoken at other such firesides in other stakes and at other functions ) .
Members of that stake were apparently outraged at the suggestion that a Mormon with a different political viewpoint than their own might bear testimony .
A member of the stake described what happened in her personal blog , The Backordered Life .
( note :
The link to the blog has been removed at the request of the blogs ’ author . )
Members of her stake apparently threatened to protest with signs and to heckle Harry Reid from the audience ( in a fireside about a person ’s testimony ! —
I would guess that these same people are the type who would strongly discourage clapping after a musical number at a fireside ) .
It seems that Senator Reid even received some threats of violence causing concern for his safety that ultimately got the fireside canceled .
Members of the stake allegedly sent emails to the Stake Presidency saying that Harry Reid was the most evil man on the planet and that the Stake Presidency must be evil too to have even considered letting him bear his testimony :
One man said , “ If I see Harry Reid in the temple , I ’m going to hit him . ”
Another told our stake president , “ Harry Reid is the most evil man on the earth , and you and your counselors are next . ” . . .
There were even people weighing in from out of state .
One woman called from St. George , Utah ; my husband took the call , and she gave him a message for our stake president : “ You ’re a wicked man for allowing this to happen . ”
( Imagine , apparently , as the blogger points out , some suburban Nevadans who oppose health care reform think that Harry Reid is more evil than President Ahmadinejad or Kim Jong - il , or human traffickers in Africa , Latin America or Asia selling young girls into sexual slavery , or owners of African or Indian gold mines forcing ten year olds to slave for crusts of bread , or street bosses in Asian cities crippling children to make them more effective armies of beggars , or militias in Africa hacking entire villages to pieces and making the children of those villages eat the flesh of their parents .
It makes reason stare and causes one to ask whether these Nevadan Latter - day Saints at issue are really so uninformed about the broader world and its real evils that they could actually think that advocating a certain health care policy in the United States is evil , as opposed to just misguided from a policy perspective . )
News of this should be extremely distressing to all Latter - day Saints .
This , and other antics that we are seeing more and more of from Latter - day Saints who call themselves conservatives or Republicans has the potential to be a public relations disaster and unwinds a lot of the careful , methodical work done by President Hinckley during his tenure to improve the image of Mormons from the damage done in the Civil Rights and ERA political fights .
As a Latter - day Saint looking at such horrible behavior and mean - spirited antics from afar , I can confirm that from my perspective this is damaging to the Church as a whole and opens us to unnecessary and harmful ridicule .
This also tarnishes the Church ’s long - standing commitment to political neutrality .
The membership of a stake in Nevada has shouted down a Latter - day Saint and prevented him from bearing his testimony of Jesus Christ and telling of the power of the Atonement in his life ( Reid was to bear his testimony and describe his conversion to the Gospel ) .
They have put a fellow Latter - day Saint in fear of his safety such that the fireside was cancelled and he was silenced .
This treatment appears to have been purely motivated by politics .
Mormons in Nevada who have allowed themselves to get so riled up by certain pundits and personalities have evidenced their character in how they have treated this fellow Latter - day Saint .
It was Harry Reid ’s political policies that made him unworthy to bear his testimony at a fireside in the eyes of these Latter - day Saints .
How dangerous that is for the body of the Church and for the welfare of Zion .
What is wrong with us as a people that this could be possible ?
How does Reid ’s involvement in drafting health care policy possibly make him “ evil ” ?
( Answer :
It does not and cannot reasonably be conceived to do so . )
Why ca n’t the Latter - day Saints doing this just view Reid as wrong from a policy perspective rather than claiming that his testimony is invalid or calling him evil ?
Do we have such little understanding of the world and the Gospel ?
My best sense from the scriptures is that God does not really care about the particulars of political policy in different governments , even on health care .
He has left it to us to set up governments and to use our best resources , reason and intellects in crafting policies that we deem beneficial for ourselves .
I would think that an honest reading of the scriptures teaches us that God is indeed interested in seeing us make efforts communally as a society to alleviate each other ’s suffering and to care for the poor and needy , etc .
Whether a society chooses to do this through a policy such as the current health care reform in the USA or through a single payer system like the NHS in the UK ( or nothing at all , although I think God would expect accountability on how we as a society had the means to help those suffering without adequate access to medical care and chose not to do so in that scenario ) is , I would think , entirely irrelevant to God .
Moral Agency as a doctrinal concept or principle is also completely irrelevant to this debate .
Nothing that a government does can take away someone ’s Moral Agency in the Gospel sense .
Liberty as referenced in the Book of Mormon is not at issue in any of these debates .
Nothing about King Noah has any applicability to health care policy in the USA in 2010 .
Latter - day Saints in the UK or Germany are not less morally free than Latter - day Saints in Nevada .
From the perspective of this Latter - day Saint living in the United Kingdom , Latter - day Saints in Western European democracies that have implemented socially beneficial systems of equitable health care access are in fact evidencing Christlike attributes by paying their dues into such health care systems ( and also of course reaping the benefits of those systems ) without raising an insurrection or shouting down their fellow saints for having alternative political viewpoints .
I would venture a guess that the same people in Nevada who have behaved in this manner toward Harry Reid would welcome a fireside in which Glenn Beck bore his testimony and related his conversion story .
This is despite Glenn Beck ’s very uncharitable and un-Christlike manner of presentation and content in his sensationalistic and ideological show .
I am very troubled by hearing of this development in Nevada .
As Latter - day Saints we need to value the discipline of demonstrating moderation in all things , including political viewpoints .
Each of us needs to play a role in toning this mess down , in helping Latter - day Saints who define themselves as political conservatives or Republicans to come to their senses and most of all , to chastize the Latter - day Saints involved in such an embarassing and despicable display against Senator Reid .
We each need to take a reality check on how we are contributing to building upthe Kingdom of God by allowing different viewpoints about something as petty as a particular political or policy debate to cause us to act in an unChristlike manner toward our fellow citizens or Latter - day Saints .
It is counterproductive to our covenants to build up Zion .
This is especially the case in our representative democracies — a political system that allows Zion to flourish in a context of pluralism , diversity , harmony and prosperity .
As members of such a polity , our actions should be guided by principles of civic republicanism in accepting the responsibilities of citizens , including by obeying the rule of law once enacted by the party winning an election , even if that is not the party a particular individual prefers .
Let us press forward as Latter - day Saints , not sullying ourselves with the political acrimony of the world around us .
Harry Reid is just as much a Latter - day Saint as Glenn Beck .
Each has a meaningful testimony of the Restored Gospel .
We can and should take strength in that fact and appreciate each of them for that testimony .
Sometimes , things just fall into place .
This training block went incredibly well despite a week - long vacation in California and a missed day in the first week .
It ’s important to roll with the punches and adapt your training to everything life throws at you .
I went to the Adidas Grand Prix track meet in New York on June 12th and saw some amazing performances .
Watching elites run incredible times is inspirational and will motivate you to get in better shape .
If you have the opportunity to go to a pro track meet , do n’t hesitate .
Do it .
It ’s also incredibly affordable – for a 4 hour event , my ticket was $ 20 .
That ’s about what you would pay for two movies .
I went to a wedding in San Jose on June 26th and then I traveled to San Francisco and Napa .
Of course , I was planning to run every day but I skipped my run the day after the wedding .
I ’m not about to make the same mistake twice !
I ’ve been going to a lot of weddings recently ; they take a lot out of you – the dress shoes , dancing , and booze ( I could be more responsible , but your friends only get married once ) .
After all , there ’s more to life than running ( gasp ! ) .
Here we go …
6.7 – 6.13 : 63 miles in 7 runs with a short 42 ′ bike ride .
This Saturday I went to the Adidas Grand Prix meet in New York .
My bus ride home the next day took over 8 hours and I was n’t able to run when I got back .
The overall volume is low because of that but that ’s ok – my other runs were high - quality .
The one workout I did consisted of a 22:49 tempo along 3 loops of a trail in Rock Creek Park .
I felt good , but not great .
6.14 – 6.20 : 74 miles in 8 runs with ~ 80 ′ slow bike ride .
Finally , consistency !
I did the same workout as last week in 22:25 – over 20 seconds faster .
The heat was bad for the workout , but somehow I ran well .
I love it when that happens .
6.21 – 6.27 : 71 miles in 7 runs .
I was in CA for half of the week and took a day off on Sunday , but I still got in my 2 hour long run .
I did a short workout of 2 x 5 min .
@ tempo pace on trails before leaving for vacation .
It was too hot to do a longer tempo .
6.28 – 7.4 : 73 miles in 8 runs .
Despite taking two easy days of 5 and 6 miles , I still got in the miles and increased my long run to 18 miles .
The long run went incredibly well and somehow I was running incredibly fast .
I ran on the track for a few miles during the run , splitting a 13:01 two - mile and a 6:37 mile for the 8th and 9th miles and the 15th mile .
I also did a short tempo workout , running 4x800 m @ threshold in 2:38 , 2:38 , 2:37 , 2:36 .
I ’ve never run a tempo workout at this pace before on the track so this is incredibly promising .
I once did workouts at 2:40 – 2:42 800 m pace in mid-2006 and this was before some big PR’s .
So I ’m excited .
I ’m running an 8 k road race on July 17th so I ’m excited to see what I can do .
My PR at this distance is 26:19 from 2005 from a cross-country course .
If the next two weeks go well , my goal is to break 26 minutes .
Lessons learned from this training block include :
Adaptability – there are other things in life that sometimes make running impossible .
Adapt , change up your plan , and live to run another day .
– there are other things in life that sometimes make running impossible .
Adapt , change up your plan , and live to run another day .
Do n’t underestimate heat .
If you ’re not ready to handle the heat , do n’t push it .
I cut a key workout because of the high heat here in Washington , DC because it ’s better than pushing your body to the limit .
If you ’re not ready to handle the heat , do n’t push it .
I cut a key workout because of the high heat here in Washington , DC because it ’s better than pushing your body to the limit .
Consistency is king .
Even though my overall volume is n’t spectacular for me , nor have I run any great workouts , I ’m still in great shape .
I credit my consistent weekly volume of 65 + miles .
I ’m looking forward to another few weeks of great , consistent training .
I plan on doing some faster workouts after the 8 k to prepare for a 10 mile race on August 14th .
I ’m just going to run the 8 k on the fitness I already have .
It ’s been too hard ( and hot ) for cycling in addition to what I ’m running .
I do n’t think I ’m ready for that yet .
How ’s your training going ?
Who ’s gearing up for a big race soon ?
Can I help ?
A former New York City police officer convicted of lying about a confrontation with a bicyclist in Times Square was given a conditional discharge on Wednesday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan .
The former officer , Patrick Pogan , had faced up to four years in prison , but will avoid any time behind bars .
He also will not be placed on probation .
In April , a jury found Mr. Pogan guilty of filing a criminal complaint that contained false statements concerning a 2008 collision with Christopher Long , who was participating in a Critical Mass bike ride .
Mr. Pogan ’s complaint alleged that Mr. Long knocked him to the ground by intentionally steering his bicycle into him .
But video footage of the episode , which was a viral presence on the Internet , showed that Mr. Pogan remained on his feet , while Mr. Long flew to the pavement .
Mr. Pogan was acquitted of falsifying the initial arrest report filed against Mr. Long .
The jury also acquitted Mr. Pogan of a less serious charge of assault .
Mr. Pogan , who was on the job for less than two weeks when the collision occurred , resigned from the police force .
Because he was convicted of a felony , he would not be allowed to attempt to rejoin the Police Department .
After the NHL lockout , the Ottawa Senators got pretty lucky : Against very long odds , the Sens moved up to ninth overall in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft , and were poised to make their highest overall pick since 2001 .
When they drafted Brian Lee , there was n't much known about him ; he was pretty big , and he was putting up big numbers in Minnesota high school hockey .
Given the Senators ' blue line at the time , which included Zdeno Chara , Wade Redden , Andrej Meszaros , Chris Phillips , Anton Volchenkov , and Brian Pothier , it looked like he was going to be given time to develop in the NCAA , and even the AHL , before being asked to step up to Ottawa 's squad .
And he was given a few years .
Two at the University of North Dakota , and he put up 53P ( 6G , 47A ) in 82GP and looked ready to take the next step -- which was Binghamton .
Lee had a few games in 2007 - 08 , but was n't expected to stick in the NHL , and did n't , although he put up good numbers in a shortened season with Bingo - - and actually looked like one of the Senators ' best defenders in their ugly first - round sweep at the hands of the Pittsburgh Penguins .
Higher expectations came in 2008 - 09 , and Lee played 53 games with Ottawa that season ( mostly in the second half ) , registering 13P in 53GP .
He was expected to get a real shot at full - time minutes this past season , but was outplayed by all of Erik Karlsson , Alex Picard , Chris Campoli , and Matt Carkner , and -- perhaps a victim of his two - way contract -- was demoted to the AHL again , taking a serious step back in his career .
It was hoped Lee would use the demotion as motivation and step into a leadership role with Binghamton , but instead he wallowed and put up his worst AHL season statistically ( on a per - game basis ) in 2009 - 10 .
Late in the season , though , Lee was given a two - year contract , and this time he would n't be a victim of a two - way clause :
It was an NHL - only deal .
It seems like we 've been waiting for an eternity to see Lee step up and stake his claim on the Senators ' NHL roster , but it 's worth noting that he 's still only 23 years old .
The journey has seemed longer because he 's been given short stints in the NHL , and those raised expectations for the following season .
It certainly has n't been a conventional path to the NHL ( high school , USHL , NCAA , AHL , NHL , AHL ... and so on ) , but with another shot at the NHL this season , everyone in Ottawa is wondering :
Is Brian Lee finally ready to take the next step ?
If he is , it wo n't be easy .
The Senators have four defenders on one - way deals aside from Lee ( Phillips , Matt Carkner , Filip Kuba , and Sergei Gonchar ) as well as Karlsson ( who , despite his two - way deal , is a sure thing ) , restricted free agent Chris Campoli , and highly - touted prospects Jared Cowen and Patrick Wiercioch waiting in the wings .
That makes at least five , and as many as eight , players higher than Lee on the depth chart .
So he 's going to have to have a hell of a training camp .
Which might be a problem .
If the past two seasons are an indication , Lee is a slow starter .
Part of the reason he started the past two years in the AHL were poor showings in training camp , only offset by solid play or holes in Ottawa 's lineup that opened up a spot for him in some NHL games .
I can't speak to his off - season workout routine , but Lee had better be spending a few hours in the gym everyday if he hopes to make the NHL roster -- and , beyond that , if he hopes to play anything other than benchwarmer ( or press - box seat warmer ) .
Lee 's best chance for making the Senators lies in his size .
At 6 ' 3 " and 206lbs , he 's a big kid .
He has n't regularly used his size in the NHL , but he has shown that he knows how to use it at times in both pro leagues he 's played in , and playing within a system like Cory Clouston 's might simplify the game for him and allow him to excel .
But there is a well - documented need on Ottawa 's blueline : shutdown defenders .
Darren wrote about it on Friday , but with the loss of Volchenkov and apparent loss of Andy Sutton , the Senators need big players who can play defence to balance the offensive play of Karlsson , Gonchar , and Kuba .
If Lee can incorporate some degree of physicality and defensive soundness into his fairly strong passing game , he could make himself a valuable , cap - friendly sixth defender -- with room to move up in the lineup due to injuries , trades , or poor play from other players .
The key to Lee might be the comfort level head coach Clouston has with his play .
They 'd spent a couple seasons together in the AHL , and although it did n't help Lee much last season , Clouston knows what he can do .
A comfort level and knowledge of Kommand Kloustonom ( that is , Cory Clouston 's highly regimented playing style ) helped Ryan Shannon , Matt Carkner , and Peter Regin become NHL players , so there 's reason to believe it could help Lee , as well .
In a shocking exclusive from Gawker , AT&T , and possibly Apple , have been party to a massive security lapse that rendered sensitive personal information about tens of thousands of iPad owners vulnerable .
According to the report , a hacking group called Goatse Security found the weakness and data mother - lode by running a script on the AT&T website itself .
The group has in the past found and made public security holes in both Safari and Firefox .
Dozens of famous people ’s information was open up for the taking until the hole was closed .
What information was out there , blowing in the wind ?
The individual user ’s personal email address , and their ID used to authenticate them on AT&T ’s network .
While Gawker does state that 114,000 user accounts were compromised , it could be that all accounts of iPad 3G owning people in the US were exposed .
Another egg on the face of the usually unflappable Apple .
First the iPhone - Gizmodo fiasco , then the collapse of WiFi at the WWDC , and now a gigantic flaw with AT&T that breaks the circle of trust between Apple ’s users and the corporation that usually treats them with care .
Not what we are accustomed to seeing from Cupertino .
Ryan
Tate sums it up succinctly :
At the very least , AT&T exposed a very large and valuable cache of email addresses , VIP and otherwise .
This is going to hurt the telecommunications company ’s already poor image with iPhone and iPad customers , and complicate its very profitable relationship with Apple .
Exacerbating the situation is that AT&T has not yet notified customers of the breach , judging from the subscribers we and the security group contacted , despite being itself notified at least two days ago .
It ’s unclear of AT&T has notified Apple of the breach .
In an oddly perverse way , this could work out for the best .
This might finally convince enough minds at Apple ( or perhaps only one mind needs convincing ) that to stick with AT&T exclusively is not a tenable plan for the future .
If indeed Apple was not aware of the flaw , then they can be indemnified of poor conduct .
If instead they did know , and did not share with the world , shame on them .
This is not the last you will hear of this story .
We will bring you updates as they come .

I ’m not sure if there 's a great demand for this , but for those hardcore geeks out there who want the best of both worlds , this iPhone - Android hack might just be what you ’re looking for .
David Wang ( aka planetbeing ) was able to port the Android OS over to the iPhone 3G , and the video below is proof of his accomplishment .
It ’s not yet perfected though .
Load time is ridiculously slow although SMS functionality , WiFi , and its web browser are all working as expected .
One major caveat , however , is the missing audio support which means you can make calls using Android , but you wo n’t be able to hear the person you ’re talking to and vice versa .
It can also run Android apps just as long as audio is n’t required .
Needless to say , this hack is still a work in progress , but nonetheless , it ’s hard to discount this milestone Mr. Wang has achieved in getting Android to work on the iPhone .
The binaries needed for anyone to perform this hack on their iPhone are also still being prepared , but if you want to read more on his Android - iPhone project , you can read his article at PC World or check out his blog here for more updates .

Barack Obama is under growing pressure to release a letter that reveals the US grudgingly supported freeing the Lockerbie bomber on compassionate grounds .
The letter was sent to Scottish ministers by a senior diplomat at the US embassy in London last August , eight days before Abdelbaset al - Megrahi was released from prison because he was dying from inoperable prostate cancer .
Obama 's administration has refused to allow publication of the letter , in which the US says allowing Megrahi to live at home in Scotland would be " far preferable " to sending him back to Libya under the prisoner transfer deal brokered by former prime minister Tony Blair in 2007 .
Although Megrahi was allowed to go home to die in Tripoli , Scottish officials believe this undermines Obama 's vigorous criticisms of the decision to free Megrahi earlier this month , when he said he was left " surprised , disappointed and angry " by the Libyan 's release .
David Cameron said he and Obama were in " violent agreement " that freeing Megrahi was a bad decision .
The American ambassador to the UK , Louis Susman , said the US was examining whether its correspondence on the issue could be released , but he refused to be drawn on the reported memo .
Senators in Washington are now pressing for the release of all correspondence between Obama 's administration and the Scottish government in their investigation into allegations that BP directly influenced the decision to release Megrahi to help its $ 800 m oil deal with Libya .
The allegations have been rejected by Alex Salmond , the first minister .
He has offered to send dozens of official documents on the Megrahi affair to the US Senate 's foreign relations committee after refusing to allow his justice minister , Kenny MacAskill , to appear at the committee 's hearing on Lockerbie this Thursday .
Salmond insists the documents , released last year , prove that MacAskill released Megrahi solely on compassionate grounds and had completely ruled out using the prisoner transfer agreement brokered by Blair .
But his aides have told the committee that Obama 's government refused to allow some material to be published – including the US embassy correspondence .
Meanwhile , William Hague , the foreign secretary , came to Salmond 's aid .
In a seven - page letter to the committee he confirmed that BP had heavily lobbied the UK government about the prisoner transfer agreement with Libya .
Hague said BP met the former Labour government five times in October and November 2007 over its concerns that disputes about the treaty might damage its oil exploration contracts with Libya .
But Hague said : " This was a perfectly normal and legitimate practice for a British company …
There is no evidence that corroborates in any way the allegation of BP 's involvement in the Scottish executive 's entirely separate decision to release him on compassionate grounds . "
The existence and content of the US embassy note was first disclosed by the Guardian last August , at the height of the controversy over Megrahi 's release , and its full text has now been leaked to the Sunday Times .
In it , the deputy head of the US embassy in London , Frank LeBaron , said the US believed Megrahi should remain in Greenock jail because of the seriousness of his conviction for killing 270 passengers and crew , and 11 Lockerbie townspeople , by bombing Pan Am flight 103 in 1988 .
But he added : " Nevertheless , if Scottish authorities [ conclude ] that Megrahi must be released from Scottish custody , the US position is that conditional release on compassionate grounds would be a far preferable alternative to prisoner transfer , which we strongly oppose . "
LeBaron said releasing Megrahi but making him live in Scotland " would mitigate a number of strong concerns we have expressed with regards to Megrahi 's release . "
Scottish officials took that to mean that the US had only " half - hearted " opposition to Megrahi 's release : the embassy comes under the direct control of the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , who became the most vigorous critic of Megrahi 's release
Allowing Megrahi to live outside prison in Scotland was one of the options considered by MacAskill .
Megrahi's wife and sons had a family home paid for by the Libyan government in the prosperous Glasgow suburb of Newton Mearns .
But that option was rejected after police advice that this would cause immense security and logistical problems , and cost £ 100,000 a week to protect him .
The house would need a 24 - hour armed guard , while Megrahi would need heavy security for his regular trips for medical treatment .
To Salmond and MacAskill 's embarrassment , Megrahi is still alive after being allowed home to Tripoli .
MacAskill had stated the Libyan had less than three months to live when he was released .
They now concede that his life has probably been prolonged from being at home with his family and receiving better medical care .

While most rated Republicans as better able to handle the biggest threats to the future of the USA , voters overwhelmingly favored Democrats to handle the top issues , according to surveys of voters as they left polling places .
USA TODAY / GALLUP POLL USA TODAY / GALLUP POLL THE RACE IS ON THE RACE IS ON Find the latest updates from the campaign trail with USA TODAY 's political coverage .
WASHINGTON  Americans are increasingly optimistic about the economy , but that brightening outlook has n't softened their outrage over the country 's direction and its political leadership , a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll finds .
Two - thirds of those surveyed this week describe themselves as " angry " about the way things are going in the USA , the highest percentage in the decade the question has been asked .
By nearly 2 - 1 , they would rather vote for a candidate who has never served in Congress over one with experience .
" We 're just going to have to clean house and get people in who really care about the country , " says Stephen Besz , 63 , of Hokendauqua , Penn. , who was among those called in the poll .
He worries about the future for his son , an electrical engineer who has been looking for a job for 18 months .
On Memorial Day weekend , incumbents in general and Democrats in particular face a hot summer .
The nation 's mood has n't eased even though attitudes on the economy have begun to turn around .
About half of Americans rated the economy as " poor " in April and May , not a glowing appraisal but the lowest percentage since the economic meltdown in September 2008 .
Half say it 's getting better , the highest level of optimism in six years .
" I would n't say bad , but you can't say good , " says John Harbachuck , 51 , of Millville , Mass .
" It 's reached a level point .
You hope it 's going up . "
Still , three of four remain dissatisfied with the nation 's course .
White House adviser David Axelrod says that 's not surprising .
" There 's been a lot of frustrations and grievance building up for years , " he says .
" For many Americans , it ( the recovery ) still has n't touched their lives . "
The findings are sobering for incumbents who hope an improving economy will ameliorate the throw - the - bums - out sentiment before November .
Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen , head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , says " confidence is picking up " among voters , but he acknowledges , " Democrats have an uphill battle . "
Texas Sen. John Cornyn , head of the GOP Senate campaign committee , says the party has " the wind at our back " and might regain control of Congress .
The poll finds a huge intensity gap between the parties : 50 % of Republicans are " extremely motivated " to vote this year ; 30 % of Democrats are .
" Normally I vote Democrat , but right now I 'm not real sure , " says Sherry Havard , 60 , of Newton , Texas .
" I just do n't like what they 're doing right now . "
Among registered voters , 42 % say their view of Obama is " very important " in their vote for Congress .
That 's likely to cut both ways :
The group includes 43 % of Democrats and 49 % of Republicans .

' Bout one month ago today , over on Sportatorium , Richie called it : Russ Martin would be taking over as morning - show host on KEGL - FM ( 97.1 ) some time this month .
J.D. Freeman , Clear Channel 's market manager , just made it official :
The one - time Observer cover boy begins July 12 at 6 a.m .
The full announcement follows .
I asked Freeman : Did Clear Channel buy out what Richie reported was his million - dollar CBS contract through April 2011 ?
He responded via e-mail : " Russ wanted to get back on the radio , and CBS released him from his agreement . "
Before you jump , this is what Martin has to say about his return to the station where he used to work , oh , ' bout a decade ago :
" After my almost 10 year leave from The Eagle , I 'm excited to be back home and give the listeners what they want ...... ME !
I 'm ready to ruffle a few feathers and have fun doing it .
My life in radio has been a big influence on me as a man , it has allowed me to explore my hobbies , cars ... Russ Martin Automotive ; music ..... The Russ Martin Show Band .
Radio has even given me a way to give back , The Russ Martin Show Listener Foundation ; we recently sent a check for $ 35,000 to the family of fallen Lancaster Police Officer Craig Shaw .
That makes it all worth while . "
Ah , who says terrestrial radio's dead ?
( Proper punctuation , on the other hand ...)
On the other side , comments from Chris Ryan , the station 's program director , and Freeman .
SHANGHAI  Although Apple is widely admired in China , most fans of its products here have been buying their iPhones , iPods and Mac computers from smugglers who operate through underground electronics markets .
The company , which has been slow to cultivate the Chinese market , has relatively few sales outlets in the country and only one Apple Store  a modest branch in Beijing .
But with Apple set to open a flagship showroom on Saturday in Shanghai  one of its largest stores in Asia  the company is making a new push to tap into the world ’s biggest mobile phone market and grab a bigger share of China ’s fast - growing consumer electronics business .
Success is far from guaranteed , because the company will be going up against big , entrenched competitors in both the personal computer and mobile phone markets .
And its newest , hottest products  the iPad and the iPhone 4  are not yet available in China , and the company has not announced when they will be .

A captain himself , Marvel , 43 , is now working 18 - hour days at his one - month - old company , PeaceKeeper Logistics , which he set up to win work from BP .
" When we realized the scope of the spill , it was the only thing to do , " he says .
" All I 'm handling is one little piece of the pie . "
It may be one little piece , but it 's an ever - growing pie .
The largest oil spill in U.S. history is also one of the most expensive cleanup projects ever -- which means that money is being made as well as lost .
BP ( BP ) has already spent more than $ 1 billion ; that 's a rate of $ 25 million a day .
If the process continues for the next six months , the total cost could be at least $ 7 billion , predicts Morgan Stanley analyst Theepan Jothilingam .
So who is poised to profit ?
Start with a $ 1.7 billion - in - sales company called Seacor Holdings ( CKH ) , based in Fort Lauderdale .
After the Exxon Valdez spill and the subsequent Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , government - mandated readiness plans made oil - spill response a lucrative business .
Seacor has seven subsidiaries active in the gulf ; its nonprofit rival , the Marine Spill Response Corp. -- funded by a group of Big Oil and shipping companies -- has 7,000 people at work .
Seacor 's helicopters ferry Coast Guard personnel over the marshes .
Its 200 - foot ships transport supplies .
At subsidiary O'Brien 's Response Management , consultants work with BP at command posts .
" It 's a 24 - hour coordination , " says Eric Fabrikant , 29 , Seacor 's vice president .
Seacor wo n't talk about the cleanup 's impact on profits , but Tim Parker , an energy analyst at T. Rowe Price , says it could be more than $ 10 million .
Nalco ( NLC ) , the Illinois - based water treatment firm , has sold more than $ 40 million of its oil dispersant Corexit .
Clean Harbors ( CLH ) , a Massachusetts disaster - response company , expects second - quarter sales to jump 15 % to 20 % , or up to $ 70 million .
Procter & Gamble ( PG , Fortune 500 ) shipped 7,000 bottles of Dawn dish soap to clean animals , then promoted its efforts nationally .
And on May 25 , the SEC halted trading in ACT Clean Technologies to investigate its statements about BP 's interest in its technology , which boosted the penny stock 2,000 % .
At a Venice , La. , marina , Lee McLean is a captain working with BP .
He 's earning double his usual day rate of $ 1,200 and grins when he says , " I want to know how long this faucet stays on . "
Looks like a very long time .

 GOOD NASTY FUN WITH GREAT ACTION SEQUENCES , ACTUAL PLOT TWISTS AND SMART , LIGHT - FINGERED CARTOON VIOLENCE .  BOXOFFICE.COM
From screenwriter Ryuhei Kitamura ( director of  The Midnight Meat Train and writer - director of  Versus ) and director Tak Sakaguchi ( the star of  Versus and fight choreographer for  Tokyo Gore Police  and  Vampire Girl Vs. Frankenstein Girl ) comes Samurai Zombie , a splatter - filled , genre blending , horror - comedy that delivers precisely what its title promises .
A vacationing familys drive through the tranquil woods surrounding Eight Spears Village takes an unfortunate turn when their car hits a gun-toting man standing in the middle of the road .
Suddenly , a young man and woman emerge from the woods and , after shooting the accident victim , proceed to car - jack the family taking them hostage in the process .
The situation immediately goes from bad to worse when the car suffers a blowout and dad is sent off in search of a spare tyre or an alternative means of transport while his wife and two kids remain in the hands to the two apparent psychopaths .
Unfortunately , any sign of deliverance for dad , his family or their captors is a long way off .
Before he can find help , a mysterious encounter with a rather large blade leaves the head of the family headless , precipitating a bloody rainfall and the resurrection of a long - dead samurai warrior with a mean streak and a score to settle .
Meanwhile , back at the car , a derelict old hag appears before the stranded group with a dire but frighteningly convincing warning :  You re all going to die ! 
Confirmation of this stark proclamation soon comes in the form of the undead warrior looking to add to his newly - begun collection of severed heads .
A highly recommended addition to the recent wave of Japanese extreme splatter movies , Samurai Zombie sees director Sakaguchi and writer Kitamura playing for laughs and shocks in equal measure with a joyously demented zombie flick that includes scenes of explosive geyser - spouting decapitations , hilariously graphic dismemberment , wince - inducing oral castration and the introduction of a pair of bumbling cops with an amusing case of serious gun envy .

There are two topics about which I am a crank .
The first , as you might have guessed , is alternative medicine .
The other is pharmaceutical reps .
Drug companies are somewhat schizophrenic .
They have amazing scientists who invent drugs that treat an astounding array of diseases .
Then , they take these drugs and turn them over to marketing , to be sold with all the enthusiasm and truthiness of a late night infomercial .
In the spirit of openness , I will say that I have not talked to a drug rep in 20 years .
As far as industry supported gifts and food , I have not taken a pen or eaten pizza from industry in almost 30 years , since I was a fourth year medical student .
I have accepted one gift over the years .
Years ago , when the Pfizer rep left , he sent me Fleets enema with a Unasyn sticker on it .
I still have it in my office , unused .
But you never know when it might come in handy .
Being an absolutist about industry gifts does have downsides .
It is distracting to sit in an auditorium filled with the smell of pizza and not eat any ; somehow the PB&J I bring with me does n’t smell as sweet .
Administration has received one letter complaining about me that was ostensibly from an employee , but curiously was printed from a windows folder that had the same name as the levofloxacin rep .
Just a coincidence , I am sure .
As an Infectious Diseases fellow I was the on call physician for the hospitals antibiotic stewardship program where expensive or problematic drugs had to be approved before they could be released from pharmacy .
It was curious how there would be spikes in approval requests , often for drugs that the surgical resident could n’t pronounce correctly .
Ain’t no drug called ciprofloxacillin , although there should be .
Investigation revealed that these spikes often occurred shortly after a service was treated to a good dinner by the drug rep .
Hmm .
Funny thing , that .
Probably just another coincidence .
I remember once as an intern late at night trying to decide what antibiotic to give a patient and I decided to prescribe what was embossed on my pen .
Turned out Bic was not on the formulary .
Over the years it has been rare to find a physician as extremist as I am .
It is curious , since the literature supports the concept that interaction with pharmaceutical reps is detrimental to patient care : docs who interact with reps are more likely to prescribe expensive and / or inappropriate drugs after being detailed .
When pointed out , every doctor tells me the same thing :
That may be true of others , but I am not swayed by information provided by drug reps .
It is the one area of science - based medicine to which most physicians are immune , and understandably so : who wants to jeopardize free pizza ?
Most of the literature on the topic is collected at nofreelunch.org , which appears to be under construction .
It all may be publication bias , but I know of no reference that demonstrates improved patient care as a result of physicians interacting with drug companies .
So imagine my surprise when someone came out in favor of physicians learning from drug companies .
Over at Slate.com is “ Appetite for Instruction .
Why Big Pharma should buy your doctor lunch sometimes , ” by Jessica Wapner .
It starts out sedately enough “ The war against industry - sponsored medical education is in full tilt . ”
War ?
It is an interesting choice of words .
I might have started by writing “ physicians are finally reclaiming their integrity after whoring for 50 years , ” but I have a dog in the fight .
But with the mounting concern about ties between doctors and the pharmaceutical industry , commercially supported medical education is being axed from hospitals and university medical centers around the country .
Not only is this change unfortunate for anyone with a doctor , but it also does n’t make any sense .
It does make sense if you bother to read the extensive literature .
The preponderance of data strongly suggests that medical practice and research is altered , and not for the better , by interaction with pharma .
She quotes only one reference in her article in support of drug company sponsored education .
There is no substitute for a small group of people listening to a doctor talk about how to treat a disease .
And there is no substitute for the commercial support required to run such programs .
In a recent study , academic researchers were paid a modest honorarium to travel around the country teaching more than 14,000 doctors about new treatment guidelines for high blood pressure .
Each researcher met with small groups of doctors to educate them about the latest advances .
In counties where the most sessions took place , adherence to the guidelines rose by more than 8 percent .
In counties with the fewest such sessions , adherence decreased by 2 percent .
The approach that the pharmaceutical industry has been taking for years is actually an effective way to educate doctors .
The “ recent study ” refers to “ Impact of the ALLHAT / JNC7 Dissemination Project on thiazide - type diuretic use . ”
I pulled the article , and it does not say what the author thinks it says .
What a surprise .
The academic researchers were educating physicians about generic medications , it was “ was supported by contract N01 - HC - 35130 from the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) , as well as an NHLBI mentoring award ( RSS , K24HL086703 ) , ” not pharmaceutical money , and if they were paid an honorarium it is not mentioned in the reference .
Academic detailing , or counter - detailing , is what is done to try and give evidenced based , minimally unbiased information about treatments in an attempt to give practitioners information free from pharmaceutical company spin and bias .
Academic detailing incorporates many of the approaches used in pharmaceutical marketing .
By using persuasive , individualized small group or one - on - one communication of key points , detailing can summarize findings , suggest concrete changes in practice patterns , and explore potential barriers to change .
In addition , by targeting specific physicians recognized as opinion leaders , resources can be concentrated on locally influential prescribers .
Several systematic reviews have examined the effectiveness of academic detailing in changing clinical practice and found this type of intervention to be effective .
The effectiveness of academic detailing is described as ranging from small to strong with results that are consistently favorable .
The effectiveness of academic detailing in affecting prescribing practices is particularly prominent .
In this situation , even small changes in prescribing may be important when the population affected is large or where large cost differences exist between alternative medications .
Academic detailing is the Spock without the goatee .
The effects of the intervention was modest :
The ALLHAT / JNC7 Dissemination Project was associated with a small effect on thiazide - type diuretic use consistent with its small dose and the potential of external factors to diminish its impact .
What external factors may have impacted the results ?
… There was substantial questioning of the ALLHAT findings by recognized hypertension authorities , as well as by the pharmaceutical industry , that likely reduced the potential impact of the results on clinical practice .
So the authors suggest that using inexpensive , effective generic drugs for hypertension are being undermined by drug companies .
The take home message is that academic detailing , using the methods of drug reps but not their funding , is an effective alternative to pharma - financed education .
It so irritates me when I read the original reference and discover it was almost completely misrepresented or misunderstood .
I suppose she will be writing for Medical Voices next .
When Consumer Reports discusses cars , it is education .
When Chrysler discusses cars , it ’s an advertisement , even if they are having Dale Earnhardt Jr. as the discussant .
She also says the lack of pharmaceutical - sponsored education has lead to an increase in the misuse of drugs .
No reference .
So I went looking .
Pubmed ?
Nothing .
Google ?
The only reference is her article .
Stephen Hanauer , one of the clinical investigators who developed Remicade and who has been paid to speak to doctors about it , explains that as Remicade teaching sessions have been nixed , misuse of the drug has risen and Hanauer thinks that the two phenomena are connected .
The basis of the increased misuse is the experience of Dr. Hanauer .
Well .
Good enough for me .
Lets get him back on the paid speaker trail , ASAP .
Patient care depends on it .
Even if the literature suggests that it is interaction with drug companies that more commonly leads to more medication mis-prescribing .
Who are you going to believe , the published literature or the anecdotes of Dr. Hanauer ?
He has been paid to speak .
I wonder how much , because the money can be substantial .
However , the largest median payments were for research ( $ 6593 ; range , $ 109 -$ 922,239 ) , speakers ( $ 1430 ; range , $ 118 - $ 154,188 ) , consulting ( $ 1000 ; range , $ 121 -$ 334,180 ) , and unspecified purposes ( $ 1000 ; range , $ 100 - $ 331,947 ) .
I have always thought as part of mentioning conflicts of interest at the start of a talk , speakers should be required to give a dollar amount of direct and indirect ( food , hotels , airfare etc ) payments they have received .
Does anyone think $ 154,188 is n’t going to buy something ?
I know if I were making that kind of cash as a speaker in this economy , I would want to keep the cash cow alive .
But I really should n’t suggest others are subject to base motivations for their actions — I sound too much like Mike Adams .
Of course , if the drug company does n’t provide food , no one will come to the talks .
But surely there must be other options .
Ca n’t doctors meet with the experts in the absence of fancy cheese ?
Not necessarily .
Teaching sessions often take place during the lunch hour .
As Hanauer , who practices at the University of Chicago School of Medicine , describes , the elimination of paid lunches sent hungry doctors to the cafeteria instead of the lecture hall .
“ But the lines were so long that they missed the conference , ” he says .
“ So attendance at our grand rounds conferences went to miniscule . ”
Now the doctor has a sandwich but is n’t up to date on how to treat a serious disease .
That may sound silly , but it ’s often the mundane reality .
“ There are sometimes times when residents have to choose between lunch and a conference , ” Richard Goldberg , an oncologist at the University of North Carolina , wrote in an e-mail .
I just had to laugh .
At my hospital system , administration takes education seriously and there is lunch provided at Grand Rounds .
We get a sandwich and a lecture .
University of Chicago is evidently not all that serious about the ‘ school ’ part of their title .
Or , I do n’t know , try planning ahead : it is Wednesday and we ’ve had Grand Rounds every Wednesday at noon for the last 100 years , maybe I will pack a sandwich .
Pu-lease .
If my doc does n’t have enough on the ball to plan for eating at conference , I do n’t want them prescribing my Remacaid .
Of course , I do n’t know how I manage to keep up in my field with no pharmaceutical support .
I ca n’t read journals , ca n’t use websites like Medscape ( I am a paid blogger for Medscape , so of course I suggest them ) , ca n’t go to conferences , ca n’t listen to podcasts , ca n’t attend meetings , ca n’t do the MKSAP .
There is such a wealth of educational opportunities in medicine to keep up you have to be either lazy or stupid not to find them .
It does takes discipline and time to keep up .
I spend a minimum of 24 hours a month on CME .
If you want job that requires no continuing medical education , perhaps you should be a naturopath or homeopath .
Part of being an MD is the endless education it takes to stay current .
The problem is that drugs have more and different uses than the FDA approved indications and the only way that information can be disseminated is pharma sponsored education .
Only way ?
Sure worked for Neurontin .
… ParkeDavis executive reportedly told Franklin , I want you out there every day selling Neurontin . . . .
We all know Neurontin ’s not growing for adjunctive therapy , besides that ’s not where the money is .
Pain management , now that ’s money .
Monotherapy [ for epilepsy ] , that ’s money .
. . .
We ca n’t wait for [ physicians ] to ask , we need [ to ] get out there and tell them up front .
Dinner programs , CME programs , consultantships all work great but do n’t forget the one - on - one .
That ’s where we need to be , holding their hand and whispering in their ear , Neurontin for pain , Neurontin for monotherapy , Neurontin for bipolar , Neurontin for everything .
I do n’t want to see a single patient coming off Neurontin before they ’ve been up to at least 4800 mg / day .
I do n’t want to hear that safety crap either , have you tried Neurontin , every one of you should take one just to see there is nothing , it ’s a great drug …
The Neurontin marketing plan consisted of both general strategies such as the promotion of Neurontin use among high - prescribing physicians and cultivation of thought leaders and tactical programs .
Local physicians were recruited , trained , and paid to serve as speakers in “ peer - to - peer selling ” programs , which the company saw as “ one of the most effective ways to communicate our message . ”
Academic leaders were solicited with educational grants , research grants , and speaking opportunities ; some received up to $ 158,250 over a 4 - year period .
Advisory boards and “ consultants ” were convened so that the firm could cultivate relationships with them and deliver “ a hard - hitting message about Neurontin .
Marketing “ tactics ” included education , publications , and research whose promotional intent was disguised , in addition to more transparent activities , such as advertising and sales visits .
“ Educational programs ” reflected the belief that “ medical education drives this market ! ”
Teleconferences involving practicing physicians were moderated by physicians who were paid as much as $ 176,100 over 4 years .
ParkeDavis formed speakers bureaus and sought “ strong Neurontin advocates and users to speak locally for Neurontin . ”
“ Unrestricted educational grants ” were made to for - profit medical - education companies that produced programs to discuss unapproved uses of Neurontin and to grant credit approved by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education .
Yep .
That ’s what I want for continuing medical information , programs that resulted in payments “ of more than $ 430 million to resolve criminal charges and civil liabilities . ”
Of course , industry has learned their lesson .
I can trust industry , and my patients life and health , with information about off - label indications provided by an industry that stands to profit from giving me the information .
“ There ’s an old saying in Tennessee — I know it ’s in Texas , probably in Tennessee — that says , fool me once , shame on , shame on you .
Fool me , you ca n’t get fooled again . ”
She concludes :
But the entanglement caused by for - profit drug development can’t be undone by eliminating the free lunch .
As one physician suggested , perhaps pharmaceutical companies should be required to pay for medical education .
After all , if companies are going to unleash new drugs into the world , should n’t they be responsible for teaching people how to use it ?
Ousting commercial support is creating a huge chasm in medical education , leaving doctors not only hungry but also starved for knowledge .
No , but it is a start .
Physicians can take responsibility for their own education .
And lunch is n’t free .
In the end , our patients pay for it .
The price of drugs , in part , takes into account the cost of advertisement .
Maybe you feel it is fine for the underinsured to pay $ 1500 out of pocket for a 10 - day course of linezolid , but I ca n’t justify my patients indirectly subsidizing my pizza and education .
While we are at it , let ’s have MacDonalds be responsible for teaching nutrition , Nintendo teach us about fitness , lobbyists determine congressional voting , tobacco companies provide research cancer and oil companies tell us the cause of global warming .
“ The only way that information can be disseminated is ‘ fill in the industry ’ sponsored education ” indeed .
Perhaps as professionals , doctors should be responsible for their own education , especially when the lives and health of their patients may depend on it .
The conclusion of the only other journal article referenced sums it up :
… attending sponsored CME events and accepting funding for travel or lodging for educational symposia were associated with increased prescription rates of the sponsor ’s medication .
Attending presentations given by pharmaceutical representative speakers was also associated with non rational prescribing .
That ’s the chasm being created by banning pharma - sponsored education : more rational prescribing , more physician integrity and patient trust , better education and information .
I can live with that , and so can my patients .

In Japan , where the ingredients , the colors , and even the temperature of a dish changes with the seasons , the hot sticky months of summer bring with them a whole host of seasonal dishes .
Chilled dishes replace steamy hotpots , and whether it ’s tofu , soup , or noodles , there ’s a good chance you ’ll find a cold preparation to help ease the oppressive heat .
What is Hiyashi Chuka ?
While ramen shops still sell their unctuous bowls of steaming noodles in summer , they nearly always have chilled ramen called Hiyashi Chūka Soba ( 冷やし中華そば ) on the menu during the summer months .
The name , which literally means “ chilled Chinese soba , ” can be a little confusing because we all associate “ soba ” with buckwheat noodles , but until fairly recently , ramen was referred to as chūka soba ( Chinese soba ) in Japan .
These days most people have shortened the name of this chilled ramen salad and refer to it as simply Hiyashi Chūka .
A bed of chilled noodles topped with a vibrant patchwork of color , Hiyashi Chūka is the kind of dish that gets your appetite going when all you can think about is jumping into an ice - cold pool .
The curly toothsome noodles are dressed with a nutty sesame sauce that ’s subtly creamy with a mild sweetness and acidity , which strikes a magical balance between rich and refreshing .
The best part is that it ’s easy to make , and involves only a few minutes of cooking time : good news if your kitchen is n’t air - conditioned .
What kind of noodles do you use for Hiyashi Chuka ?
Hiyashi Chūka by definition is made with ramen noodles , but in Japan , ramen noodles come in dozens of varieties .
I like using thin curly yellow noodles for this as they have a nice texture when chilled and the kinks in the noodles help them hold onto the toppings as you slurp the noodles .
If you ca n’t find fresh ramen noodles near you , you can also do this with other types of noodles such as udon , soba , or somen , but the name of the dish would become hiyashi udon , hiyashi soba , or hiyashi somen .
What are the toppings for Hiyashi Chuka ?
The toppings can be subdivided into three broad categories : proteins , vegetables , and garnishes .
There is a lot of room for improvisation here , and I encourage you to experiment with what ’s in season around you .
Protein –
The most common proteins are ham , egg , shredded chicken , and seafood such as shrimp or imitation crab , but the skies the limit here and I ’ve made Hiyashi Chuka with everything from leftover roast beef to fresh mozzarella .
There are also a bunch of plant - based vegan - friendly options such as edamame and tofu .
Vegetables – Summer vegetables that can be eaten raw such as cucumbers , lettuce , and tomatoes are the most common toppings for Hiyashi Chuka , but this is a very flexible area .
Corn , carrots , and even broccoli make for delicious toppings for this dish , and I ’d even venture to say the best vegetables are the ones you already have in the fridge .
Garnish –
Here ’s another area you where you can use your imagination .
The traditional garnishes are things like benishōga ( reg pickled ginger ) , sesame seeds , and kaiware sprouts , but you can have fun with different herbs such as shiso , basil , or even mint .
I also like to add some texture in the garnishes so that you can try things like crumbled rice crackers , potato chips , or even tobiko .
What is the sauce for Hiyashi Chuka ?
There are a lot of options here , and if you ’re in a rush , using a bottled dressing is perfectly acceptable .
That being said , in Japan , the dressings generally fall into two categories : vinegar - based and sesame - based .
The distinction is a bit confusing as they both include toasted sesame oil , but the former tends to be lighter while the latter is more creamy thanks to the addition of ground sesame seeds and sesame paste .
Soy Sauce Vinaigrette –
This style of dressing is light and tangy with a balancing sweetness and a hint of nutty sesame oil .
The ingredients are usually soy sauce , rice vinegar , sugar , white pepper and ginger .
Creamy Sesame –
This style of sauce starts with similar ingredients to the Soy Sauce Vinaigrette , but it also includes ground sesame seeds and nerigoma ( sesame paste ) .
The latter gives the sauce some body so that it ’s great for coating the noodles and toppings while adding a rich earthiness that ’s just irresistible .
It ’s worth noting that if you like spicy , you can add heat to either of these dressings by adding some rayu ( chili oil ) , or your favorite Asian chili sauce such as sriracha or doubanjiang .
What are some variations on Hiyashi Chuka ?
Although there is practically an infinite number of variations of this cold ramen salad , here are some fun ideas for a non-traditional Hiyashi Chuka :
Italian - style – Fresh mozzarella , tomatoes , and basil , dressed with a balsamic vinaigrette .
Vietnamese - style – char siu , pickled daikon , carrots , cilantro , and jalapeno , dressed with nước chấm .
Mexican - style – corn , taco meat , tomatoes , and guacamole , dressed with a cilantro lime dressing .
Cybercriminals have found a new way to profit in the wake of Facebook ’sÃ‚Â drive to lower the bar on privacy .
They ’ve begun spreading corrupted Facebook “ Like ” buttons .
The end game : turnÃ‚Â Facebook users intoÃ‚Â unwitting accomplices in a cutting - edge click fraud caper , Ã‚Â according to Panda Security .
See top story : Facebook continues drive to lower privacy
Facebook launched Like buttons in early 2009 .
The tiny thumbs - up icons appears alongside news stories , videos and other content on numerous popular websites , including Huffington Post , CNN , ESPN and Yelp .
If you click on such an icon and are one of Facebook ’s 500 millionÃ‚Â users , an identicalÃ‚Â thumbs - up icon will automatically embed on your profile page along with a link to the content .
This signals your friends that you think the content is worthwhile checking out .
Privacy advocates are critical of Like buttons because they happen to also enable Facebook to track people as they switch from one web site to the next , supplying information about online behavior that ’s salable to advertisers .
And now cyber scammers have figured out how to cause malicious Like buttons to turn up on Facebook users ’ profile pages .
They begin by manipulating a Facebook account for which they ’ve stolen the username and password , typically one that has a long list of friends .
The initial step : embed a Like button with an enticing link on the profile page of that account .
The link touts a hot topic — examples include news about the popular game Farmville or the hit movie Sex and the City 2 , says Panda Labs rearcher Sean - Paul Correll , who has intercepted and examined samples .
Clicking on the link takes you to a web page filled with online ads .
This confirms you ’ve got a problem , says Correll .
Unseen to you , a malicious program will embed a similarly - corrupted Like button on your Facebook profile page .
The scammers are using a technique called “ clickjacking ” to amass clicks and generateÃ‚Â payments from online advertisers .
Facebook spokesman Simon Axten says clickjacking stems from security weaknesses in web browsers and is not specific to Facebook .
“ We ca n’t technically prevent it completely , but we ’re always working to improve our systems , ” says Axten .
“ And we continue to build additional protections to mitigate its impact . ”
For the moment , the Facebook clickjacking attacks appear to be limited to defrauding online advertisers , says Correll .Ã‚Â
But he says there is little stopping clickjackersÃ‚Â from spreading Like buttons with links that trigger promos for worthless antivirus , known as scareware .
“ Currently these attacks are being used only to generate advertising revenue , ” he says .
“ It ’s likely they will be replaced by much more lucrative attacks in the near future , such as spreading scareware . ”
Facebook is “ involved in discussions with others in the industry on how to fix the underlying issue on the browser side , ” says Axten .
“ As always , weÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re advising people to use caution online and to not click on suspicious - looking links , even if theyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ve been sent or posted by friends . ”
Meanwhile , no one expects Facebook to pull back on features such as the Like button that drive toward CEO Mark Zuckerberg ’s goal to makeÃ‚Â the Web , as Zuckerberg puts it , Ã‚Â “ more social . ”
Facebook ’s Like button “ does support their business model , ” says Correll .
“ Facebook needs to figure out how to target online advertisements to specific groups of consumers .
But it definitely does lower privacy as well . ”
It appears lower privacy translates into greater opportunity for the bad guys .

About the color glove
The color glove is printed on a Lycra fabric and does not contain any obstructive sensors .
The pattern is designed to be distinctive and facilitate robust tracking .
However , the time has come for us to verify that what was predicted by the model in fact happens in the real world .
It might be interesting to understand if the conclusions drawn in the article were wrong or are at least somewhat close to reality .
At the end of February , The Oil Drum published an article I wrote called Efficiency and Resilience : After Jevons Paradox , the Piggy Principle .
Its content was a strictly theoretical discussion of energy efficiency and its impact on the consumption and resilience of societies .
This is a guest post by Marco Bertoli .
Mr. Bertoli has an economics degree from Bocconi University in Milano and a master 's degree in " social and economic disciplines " from the Milano Politechnical University .
Overview
Here is a brief summary of the basic thesis contained in the article , which we are going to double - check by using some data : according to the Consumer Choice Theory and the Piggy Principle – both concepts being considered as basics in any course of economics , but curiously passed by – it is not energy efficiency in consumer goods , but the price of energy and individual income that determine energy consumption per capita .
Efficiency , however , plays an important role in increasing the level of societies resilience .
Total energy consumption is the product of the consumption per capita and the number of consumers : we cannot help but consider the demographic variable when studying these phenomena – which is systematically ignored by official sources .
It can all be summarized in the following graph :
As a test , it is useful to examine the key variables for private mobility in the United States , for the period post World War II to date .
These key variables are gasoline consumption and prices , mileage , car efficiency , and income .
For these variables , it is possible to easily obtain long - time series of data from official sources that are suitable for the scope of this analysis .
The spread of these series also lets us observe the ‘ big picture ’ without drawing false conclusions due to the slenderness of the observed sample .
However , we should keep in mind that the example of private cars in the U.S. is only one of countless examples of energy consumption : we are not referring to universal laws applicable to every type of energy ( heating , electricity consumption of appliances , etc. ) , at differing times and locations .
On the contrary , if readers are aware of counter - examples , please post them .
Review of Test Data
So let 's go through data in detail .
When considering data regarding gasoline consumption per capita since the early 1930s ( Source : Federal High Way Administration FHWA , thanks to Metacaffeination ) and comparing them with historical series of average real hourly wages from 1947 ( Source : Bureau of Labor Statistics , BLS .
The series ID is CES0500000032 ) , we have the following result :
As you can see , the correlation is really impressive .
Leaving aside our astonishment after seeing so clearly that real wages – therefore the purchasing power of workers - have been stagnant for over 40 years , we should first clear up some doubts that may arise when looking at this correlation .
First , someone may ask what happened to the price of gasoline .
We should not forget that this is included in real wages , which correspond to the ratio between nominal earnings and the Consumer Prices Index .
In turn , the latter is a value proportional to the cost for the basket of consumer goods selected by the BLS .
And it is well known that gasoline and its price are included in this index and directly influence it .
A second question could be why there is such a strong relation with wages , whereas that disappears when considering the real gross national income per capita .
Gross National
Income per capita is closely related to GDP ; it is the sum of all gross incomes in an economy : wages , dividends , interest , rents and capital gains .
As we know , in a society where residence , work , shopping and meeting places are very far away from each other , where public transportation is weak and private mobility is based on the car paradigm , gasoline becomes a basic necessity .
As a basic necessity , gas is purchased each year by nearly every family , but for the overwhelming majority of them , the main source of income is wages , ( although for the richest the capital gains from investments is to be deducted ) .
Moreover , the percentage of income spent on the purchase of gasoline and other basic necessity decreases as per capita income increases -- in other words , the poor spend a greater proportion of their income on gasoline than the rich .
For the poorest groups of population , wages are also the main source of personal income , together with government transfers .
So , to simplify , when the purchasing power of wages varies , the change is largely directed to consumption of basic goods .
Similarly , the variability of dividends , rents , etc. can be thought of as determining the change in the consumption of ‘ luxury ’ goods .
A last criticism to be prevented is the use of ‘ gross ’ variables .
We should remember that consumption depends on personal income , which is equal to net income plus government transfers ( pensions , unemployment aids , tax reliefs , transfers to publicly owned enterprises providing services of first necessity like water , healthcare , etc. ) .
In the case of low incomes , and thus of low wages , transfers offset taxes with a redistribution effect .
Therefore , gross wages are a good approximation - underestimated - of personal incomes of both the workers and the poor .
So , in this context , which is the role of
As you can see in the chart as below , the average efficiency of cars in use in the U.S. was constant from the 1930s through the 1970s , rising rapidly till the 1990s ( Source : FHWA , thanks to Metacaffeination ) .
It is then clear the correlation with the oil shock and the regained abundance due to the resumption in Russian production in the 1990s .
And not incidentally , after the 2008 oil shock , the debate on engine efficiency was back in the news .
Now , if we approximate the individual utility with miles traveled per capita ( see chart below ) , it can be easily shown that , in this case , the Piggy Principle really prevents improvements in efficiency from reducing gasoline consumption per capita .
So , if we build a dispersion graph with miles traveled per capita ( on the y - axis ) and gasoline consumption per capita ( on the x - axis ) , we can get a good approximation of the first chart that correlates consumption per capita and Utility :
Analysis of Results
Going back to the figures , we can identify two different periods in which the variables behave in a uniform way .
First Period : Post - WWII to 1970 .
Skyrocketing real wages and unchanged efficiency .
During this period , the growth in miles per capita and in gasoline consumption is caused solely by the peak of purchasing power of wages .
Efficiency itself has no role in those years , remaining unchanged or even slightly decreasing .
Second Period : from 1970 to the 2000s .
Stagnant wages and quickly increasing efficiency .
In these years , wages remained flat for 40 years , causing gasoline consumption per capita to stop rising .
Efficiency improvements led to the growth of miles traveled per capita ( Utility ) that , in accordance with the Piggy Principle , consumers prefer to the reduction of fuel consumption for unchanged mileage .
We can add some controversy to this simple analysis .
These data show that for the majority of people , the steady - state economy is a 40 year - old reality .
In fact , as long as wages remained unchanged , utility improvements were reached only through efficiency improvements .
. .
I guess there is no need for me to go any further in producing here data on productivity ( real GDP / employee ) , which has always been closely tied to the growth of wages .
To conclude the analysis , let ’s move from the consumption per capita to total consumption , which is the key variable for both the oil peak and global warming :
As we see from the chart , for private cars , the total consumption of gasoline is growing .
If consumption per capita has remained constant since 1970 , this effect can only be due to the rise in the number of drivers .
Obviously this can be ascribed to demographic dynamics only .
Continuing with the controversy , how many times did you find the word ‘ demography ’ in the ‘ proposed policies ’ paragraphs of the IEA or EU reports ?
Finally , let ’s check if it is true that efficiency has an important role in the improvement of resilience of societies .
To do this , we should look for an indicator for the ‘ hit ’ striking societies with the rise of gasoline prices and check whether the effects are reduced by efficiency .
As we said earlier , wages – and therefore the majority of the population - are severely affected by the rise in the price of goods that are necessities .
In fact , in these cases , the rich may draw down savings or cut back on luxuries , but the poor have to cut down on other important goods and on gasoline itself .
That being said , the ratio between the nominal price of gasoline ( source : EIA ) and nominal gross hourly earnings ( Source : BLS , Historical B - 2 ) represents the time that has to be worked in order to buy a gallon of gasoline .
It can be considered to be a good representation of the ‘ hit ’ suffered by the society .
During the oil shocks of 1979 and 2008 , to buy a gallon of gasoline workers had to work for 11 minutes , about twice the time needed when gasoline was at its lowest price .
The social effects cannot be quantified unequivocally , but we cannot forget that in 2008 , unlike 1979 , there were no queues at gas stations and there was no rationing and so on .
Above all , this was largely due to the fact that , facing a peak in prices , drivers were able to cut the unnecessary consumption of gasoline ( for leisure trips , etc. ) , which would have never been reached with the 1979 engine efficiencies .
Compared with 1979 , in 2008 efficiencies increased by 33 % .
In conclusion , the theoretical idea has a good match with long - term statistics .
So , at least for this example , the poor practice of some economists - avoiding any comparison with real data and relying on abundant and evanescent speculation - was not followed .
And this poor practice is coming from a long - time , noble and glorious tradition – still in very good health , though – which was condemned by Sir William Petty for the very first time : it was in 1676 .
（ C）創通・サンライズ 記者会見はガンダム前で行われた
バンダイが静岡市で7月から一般公開する実物大「機動戦士ガンダム」の組み立て作業中の様子が6月2日、報道向けに公開された。まだ下半身のフレームと一部のパーツのみだったが、既に迫力は十分。今後、上半身と頭部を取り付け、右手には輝くビームサーベルも装備。静岡の大地に立つ日が近づいている。
高 さ18メートルの実物大ガンダムは昨年夏、東京・お台場で公開され、予想を大きく上回る約415万人を集めた。ガンダムが立つ新たな「大地」は、ガンプラの故郷・静岡市のJR東静岡駅前（同市葵区）の広場。同駅に停車する東海道線と、平行して走る東海道新幹線の車内からもガンダムを望めそうだ。天気によっては富士山もバックに入るよう、ガンダムの角度も計算したという。
一般公開の初日となる7月24日は、ガンプラ30歳の誕生日。静岡市が主催するイベント「模型の世界首都・静岡ホビーフェア」の目玉として登場し、来年1月10日まで5カ月半にわたって公開される予定だ。会場近くにはガンプラ工場「バンダイホビーセンター」もあり、ガンプラ30周年の節目をガンプラの故郷で祝う。
会場では、実物大ガンダムと同じ仕様でビームサーベルを持たせたプラモキット（HG）も販売する予定。期間中、約90万人以上の来場を見込んでいる。
輝くビームサーベ ル
なにやらセクシーさすら漂う立ち姿
しかしメカメカし い
静岡ガンダムはお台場ガンダムから進化し、右手にガンダム定番の武器・ビームサーベルを装備。夜間には実際に輝いてライトアップされる。制作を担当する乃村工藝社によると、サーベルのブレード部分はレーザーで発光させ、実際にビームが伸び縮みしているかのように演出するという。もちろん頭部の稼働ギミックなどはお台場ガンダムと同様だ。
どう見てもガンダム工場
また機体の各所に貼られたデカールも一新。一般公開と同時に発売する「REAL GRADEシリーズ」第1弾「RG 1/144 RX-78-2 ガンダム」に合わせているという。サーベルを握る右手も作り直した。
公開された2日時点では、コンクリートの壇上にガンダムの下半身を固定し、脚部のパーツを取り付けた状態で、完成度は60％程度という。ガンダムの頭部やビームサーベル、、サーベルを持たせるために作り直した右手などは東京にあり、今後現地に輸送。6月中にはガンダムが完成し、その後イベントの開幕に向けて周辺の整備などを進める。
Arabic newspaper Al - Quds al - Arabi reports that 12 American warships , among which one aircraft carrier , as well as one Israeli corvette , and possibly a submarine , have crossed the Suez Canal on their way to the Red Sea .
Concurrently , thousands of Egyptian soldiers were deployed along the canal to protect the ships .
The passage disrupted traffic into the manmade canal for the " longest time in years . "
The immediate destination of the fleet is unknown .
According to Global Security , two other carriers are already deployed in the region , with the CVN - 73 Washington in the western Pacific as of May 26 , and the CVN - 69 Eisenhower supporting operation Enduring Freedom as of May 22 .
It is unclear at first read what the third carrier group may be , but if this news , which was also confirmed by the Jerusalem Post and Haaretz , is correct , then the Debka report about a surge in aircraft activity in the Persian Gulf is well on its way to being confirmed .
There has been no update on the three Israeli nuclear - armed subs that are believed to be operating off the coast of Iran currently .
From the original article , translated by Google and Zero Hedge :
Shipping sources in the city of Suez on Friday have said that 12 U.S. warships , including a giant Israeli warship , have crossed the Suez Canal in the early hours of dawn on Friday , en route to the Red Sea coast , at the same time as the channel has seen large numbers of soldiers .
According to sources and eyewitnesses ' The Suez Canal traffic was disrupted for hours in the morning during the crossing of U.S. Navy , which includes a giant aircraft carrier , soldiers , ships and infantry , armor and ammunition , coming from the Mediterranean Sea on its way to the Red Sea ' .
The sources revealed that many merchant ships were disrupted outside the channel until the completion of the Navy passage , which observers said was one of the longest since several years .
The sources added that the movement of fishing boats in the Bitter Lakes and Lake Gator and navigation between the two shores of the Suez Canal over the Peace Bridge and ferries of individuals and vehicles may be stopped completely .
Egypt deployed thousands of soldiers on both sides of the Suez Canal for insurance ; witnesses said ' The Israeli warships were seen among the U.S. warships but official sources have not confirmed the information ' .
Maj . Gen. Amin Radi Secretary of the Committee on National Security in the People 's Assembly made an exclusive statement to to Al Quds Al Arabi , that the " decision to declare war on Iran is not easy , but Israel was known for her Beslvha and Arabdtha may provide to the war in order to maintain its leadership in the region as nuclear weapons are the only deterrent . "
Radhi said , ' should be the scourge of Israel tend to be left a free hand should be forced by the international community to disarm its nuclear weapons before calling for strike on Iran ' .
In a related development , the opposition warned from various that the Egyptian regime that allows a repeat of the historica mistake when opening the Suez Canal to cross the fleet - American attack on Iraq in this context , Abdullah said Alsnanwi editor of ' Arab Nazareth ' for ' Al Quds Al Arabi ' that ' the Egyptians will not stand idly by this time they see the system of government in a major scandal in coordination with Israel and America to open the Suez Canal to attack Iran and Islam . "
He expressed surprise at the crossing of a huge number of American battleships , along with an Israeli sub carrying nuclear warheads , and wondered , what is the secret channel those huge numbers of warships to the Gulf , and he believed the difficulty to enter the U.S. facing big problems in Afghanistan and Iraq to open a front with Iran .
For his part , the leader of the Brotherhood warned of the consequences of a strike on Iran , stressing that accept the Arab and Muslim world such a thing is unacceptable and should not be silent if the masses bowed to the will of the governments in Washington and Tel Aviv .
The international media has pointed to the direction of an Israeli nuclear submarine model ' Dolphin ' carry nuclear warheads and warships to the Gulf region in light of tensions with Iran .
With Iran warned Friday that any act against the interests of the Iranian people , legal and legitimate will result in legal response and appropriate action by Iran , said U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday that U.S. intelligence that indicates that it is likely to possess Tehran the ability to attack Europe ' tens or even hundreds of rockets ' taken into account in the Government 's decision to modify the Obama system for missile defenses .
The United States has cited the growing threat of Iranian missiles when it announced in September ( September ) last plans to integrate missile defenses at sea and ashore in the member states of NATO in Europe and around the States in what was dubbed ' adaptive phased approach ' .
Gates said in a hearing on Congress ' among the elements of information that contributed to the decision to approach the interim adjustment to recognize that if Iran actually launched a rocket attack on Europe would not be just a missile or two or a few .
He added , ' but is likely to be attacked with a barrage of missiles because of its potential to deal with tens or even hundreds of rockets ' .
We have submitted a query to Hillary Clinton for confirmation , in advance of her meeting with Israel defense minister Ehud Barak , who flew in to the US on Saturday for meetings with the former first lady , as well as Robert Gates and Chairman of the JCS Mike Mullen .
And yes , the Joint Chiefs of Staff do n't really get involved in high level " diplomacy " all that often .
Update : it appears the Aircraft Carrier crossing the Suez is almost certainly CVN - 75 Harry Truman , which until recently was in the Mediterranean according to Stratfor .
According to Wikipedia , " the super carrier can accommodate approximately 80 aircraft . "

The moment Jupiter is hit by mysterious new object AGAIN as Nasa reveals planet 's ' bruise ' was caused by rogue asteroid
An amateur astronomer has spotted an object crashing into the surface of Jupiter for the first time .
Anthony Wesley , an Australian computer programmer , spotted a bright flash and alerted professional and amateur sky - gazers to the unique collision .
' When I saw the flash , I could n't believe it , ' said Mr Wesley .
' The fireball lasted about two seconds and was very bright . '
And it comes just as Nasa announced that it had solved the mystery behind a strange ' bruise ' on Jupiter which had also been spotted by Mr Wesley .
Mr Wesley gained fame last year when he spotted the scar the size of the Pacific Ocean on Jupiter which is believed to have been caused by an asteroid smacking into the gas giant planet .
Scroll down to watch video of the historic collision
The bright flash of the asteroid crashing into the planet 's surface is clearly visible in the top left of the image taken by Anthony Wesley
The latest hit near the equator has not left any visible mark so far , but astronomers are on the lookout .
The absence of a detectable gash and the short impact time have led scientists to believe Jupiter was likely struck by a meteor .
' We 've never seen a meteor slam into Jupiter , ' said Glenn Orton of Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
The latest collision should give astronomers a better idea of the size of debris floating in the outer solar system .
The mystery object struck the planet on July 19 last year , leaving a dark scar the size of the Pacific Ocean .
Astronomers have used images from Nasa 's Hubble Space Telescope to compare the blemish on Jupiter with similar scar caused by a 1994 comet , and believe a 1,600 ft wide asteroid is responsible for the mark .
Mystery : Images from Nasa 's Hubble telescope show how the dark scar discovered in July last year faded over time
Bizarrely , the most recent collision occurred exactly 15 years after more than 20 pieces from the Comet P / Shoemaker - Levy 9 ( SL9 ) plunged into Jupiter 's atmosphere .
Nasa released its analysis of the Hubble images this week , and said the impact of the asteroid would have been similar to several thousand nuclear bombs .
Astronomers believe the culprit was an asteroid about 1,600 ft wide and that the ' bruise ' shows for the first time the immediate aftermath of an asteroid , rather than a comet striking another planet .
Mr Wesley was using a home - made telescope in the yard of his rural home in Murrumbateman , near Canberra , when he spotted the dark scar last year .
He said that he had discovered the scar in between running inside to watch the final rounds of the British Open golf on television .
' I could n’t believe it .
I thought " That was n’t there before " and then I realised Jupiter had actually been hit by something , ' he said at the time .
The 2009 strike was equal to a few thousand nuclear bombs exploding .
Heidi Hammel of the Space Science Institute in Boulder , Colorado , led a team that took pictures of the impact sites using the Hubble .
' This solitary event caught us by surprise , and we can only see the aftermath of the impact , but fortunately we do have the 1994 Hubble observations that captured the full range of impact phenomena , including the nature of the objects from pre-impact observations ' she said .
And she said the 2009 impact showed how important work was still being performed by amateur astronomers .
' This event beautifully illustrates how amateur and professional astronomers can work together , ' she said .
Nasa said the Jupiter bombardments revealed that the solar system was a ' rambunctious ' place .
The gap between the 1994 and 2009 was particularly a surprise as Jupiter impacts were only expected to occur every few hundred to few thousand years .

Everybody 's favorite fruit has a secret .
When you freeze it , and then stick it in a food processor , a banana will whip up into a texture not unlike soft - serve ice cream .
I just made up a version of this that added a little honey and peanut butter to the basic frozen banana cream .
Not everybody will dig this — my husband , for instance , was n't a fan — but I loved it .
Plus , it 's such a great summer solution for vegans .
( And for lazy ominvores who want a quick dessert with little work . )
My curiosity now :
Why frozen bananas turn out so creamy when you beat them senseless .
The Kitchn blog says it has to do with the very small amount of fat in the banana , and that makes sense .
But I have n't been able to find a source to verify it .
Chemistry people and food scientists , weigh in !
( CNN ) -- Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende resigned Wednesday as leader of the Christian Democratic Alliance after exit polls from the country 's national elections projected that his party would lose 20 of its 41 parliamentary seats .
Balkenende , who also gave up his seat in parliament , will remain in office as prime minister until a new coalition government is formed , said Xander van der Wulp , political editor for CNN affiliate NOS .
That process could take months because no clear winner was projected in Wednesday 's elections .
The exit polls showed the center - right Liberal Party and center - left Labor Party tying with 31 seats each , while the far - right , anti-Islam Freedom Party of controversial Dutch politician Geert Wilders more than doubled its seats , going from nine to 23 -- far ahead of analyst expectations .
With its strong showing at the polls , there was speculation that the Freedom Party could play a role in a forthcoming coalition government .
Opinion polls earlier had predicted the Liberal Party , led by Mark Rutte , would come out on top .
Rutte had promised to lower taxes and dramatically slash government spending to bring the country 's budget quickly back to surplus .
Former Amsterdam Mayor Job Cohen 's Labor Party was the other major contender in Wednesday 's election .
As mayor , Cohen built a strong reputation for easing community tensions by extending friendship and showing tolerance to the city 's Muslims .
It was Labor 's withdrawal from the coalition government earlier this year in a dispute over troops in Afghanistan that set the stage for the current elections .
The issue has barely surfaced in the campaign .
The Liberal Party 's Rutte has suggested he may be willing to form a coalition with Wilders ' Freedom Party , but the choice could be divisive .
Wilders has become internationally famous for his fight against the " Islamization " of the Netherlands .
" I believe we should have a stop of the mass immigration from Islamic countries , " he said in an interview , " not because the people are bad , but because they bring a culture that really is against everything in our own values . "
Wilders is currently facing trial on charges of inciting discrimination and hatred , charges related in part to his much - criticized film about Islam , " Fitna . "
The trial is expected to get under way later this year .
Wilders is also charged with offending a group of people , which relates to his comparison of Islam to Nazism .
The charges relate to comments Wilders made in a variety of media between 2006 and 2008 , including an October 2006 interview with the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant in which he said he wanted to stop the " tsunami of Islamization , " and another in September 2007 with Radio Netherlands in which he said the Quran should be banned .
" Fitna , " which Wilders released online in March 2008 to international outcry , is also part of the charges against him .
The film features disturbing images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from the Quran in order to paint Islam as a threat to Western society .
Wilders would face up to two years in prison and a fine of 19,000 euros ( about $ 23,000 ) for each charge if convicted .
CNN 's Phil Black contributed to this report .
Anti-whaling activist Peter Bethune has launched a tirade of criticism against the New Zealand government over its stance on whaling and its handling of his court case in Japan .
The 45 - year - old was deported from Japan last week after being given a suspended sentence for illegally boarding a Japanese whaling ship .
After four months in a prison in Japan and another month in detention on board a Japanese whaling security ship , Mr Bethune is now a free man .
While he is still at times emotional about his arrest , trial and time in jail , he could see a little of the funny side .
" I was treated like Hannibal Lecter .
They took me into the prison .
I had 12 guards escort me to my cell , " he said .
" Most inmates have a single guard or escort but I had 12 .
The only good thing that came out of that was I was perceived in prison as being the most evil and dangerous person by all of the other inmates who all saw this . "
But Mr Bethune also remains intensely serious about his cause .
" Since 1987 when the moratorium on commercial whaling came into effect , Japan 's so - called scientific research program has killed over 10,000 whales and generated over $ 1 billion in revenues .
To call this anything other than commercial whaling is farcical , " he said .
" They are speared through the back with an explosive harpoon .
They then spend the last 30 minutes of their lives thrashing in agony as they slowly but surely bleed to death .
" What upsets me the most about this however is where it happens .
It is in my backyard and it is in the backyard of all Aussies and Kiwis .
" That Japanese vessels sneak past us each summer to then slaughter whales in our whale sanctuary is deeply offensive . "
' Fat little lap dog '
He says the New Zealand government sided with the Japanese despite his boat the Ady Gil being sliced in half by the Japanese whaling security ship the Shonan Maru 2 .
Mr Bethune thanked Australia , saying the Australian Government - not his own - had shown leadership .
" The many people from all over the world who protested on my behalf , who supported me on Facebook and in forums and who raised the profile of whaling .
The Government of Australia who have announced they are finally taking action against Japan in the International Court of Justice , " he said .
" It is fantastic to finally see some politicians showing some backbone over this issue .
" I get the feeling these days that New Zealand has become like a fat little lap dog and any country like Japan that wants to walk over us , we are too afraid to do anything about it . "
But New Zealand prime minister John Key has labelled Mr Bethune as ungrateful , saying he has received plenty of help .
" I think he 's downright ungrateful .
In the end he's had a sentence which has allowed him to return to New Zealand , " he said .
Mr Key says he has always maintained that it would have been wrong for his government to get involved in Mr Bethune 's trial in Japan .
During his trial Mr Bethune was cut adrift by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society which he had been campaigning for .
He was banned on the grounds he had been carrying a weapon .
But Sea Shepherd 's Laurens De Groot , who was sitting next to him today , says it was all designed to influence the court to give him a more lenient sentence - and it worked .
" Now Peter is out of prison , we start the preparations for Operation No Compromise and again we 'll take our ships down to Antarctic and we will stop the Japanese illegal whaling , " Mr De Groot said .
" If there is a decision made that we needed to board another ship , then we probably will . "
Mr Bethune is now back in his Sea Shepherd - branded clothing and weighing up his future .
" Man , I have sacrificed a lot and if I will be back down in Antarctica this year , I do n't know but I firmly believe what Sea Shepherd stands for , " he said .
" I will always be opposed to Japanese whaling and the other campaigns they do , the Blue Fin Tuna , the shark finning , those things are dear to me as well .
" If I 'll be back in Antarctica this year , I do n't know .
I 've spent a long time away from my kids . "
The catch is Mr Bethune gave assurances during his trial that he would not disrupt the Japanese whaling fleet again .
Another day , another $ 15 gold takedown in a manner of seconds .
Liquidations or LBMA intervention , nobody cares anymore .
Presumably the agenda of the day is to make investors believe that all is well in Europe , and that among all the upcoming stress test results announcements , the " fact " that a single bank will not be in need of rescuing will be palatable .
Of course , this is laughable , and as we discussed yesterday , the bloodbath that will be the Spanish cajas is only starting to be appreciated .
But in the meantime , the old - school short covering inspired rally is on full blast .
Today downticks are forbidden as China is now perfectly ok .
Cause Australia said so .
In the meantime , please ignore the short bald guys behind the scenes buying up insolvent government bonds and further diluting the pieces of paper in your wallet .
The Oakland City Council voted Thursday to lay off 80 of the Police Department 's 776 officers as it slashed at a $ 30.5 million budget deficit .
The decision could be rescinded if the police union agrees to pension concessions .
Council members would like the officers to contribute 9 percent of their salaries toward their CalPERS pension , the same as every other city union worker .
Union leaders and city officials are set to negotiate Sunday and Monday , a move some interpreted as a sign the union was willing to change its position .
" I 'm confident that we can have an agreement by July 15 , " said Councilwoman Jean Quan , who voted for the measure , which passed 5 - 3 .
" No one cancels their weekend unless they plan to negotiate . "
Sgt. Dom Arotzarena , the union president , would only say , " It 's not over yet . "
The union was under relentless attack all night from council members and a wide range of speakers , who called it a matter of fairness that the police union be treated like the other city unions .
" Police unions needs cuts too ! " said a sign held by Lydia Kosmos , 20 , a lifelong Oakland resident who works at the Montclair Recreation Center .
" Quite frankly , our pension program that allows any employee to retire at $ 100,000 a year at age 50 is unsustainable , " Quan said .
But police union officials see it differently .
They see a city that squandered money in good times and now is coming to employees to make up the difference .
Firefighters pay into their pensions , but they were given a salary increase to make up the difference , Arotzarena said .
If police do not agree to the pension request , the council 's layoff plan Thursday is a gamble .
It assumes that voters will pass a ballot measure in November that will suspend for three years a mandate that the Police Department have 739 officers .
Without that suspension , the city will lose $ 20 million a year in police funding from a parcel tax that voters approved in 2004 .
If the measure passes , an additional 27 officers would have to be laid off Jan .
1 .
The council is also considering a parcel tax that would cost each single - family home about $ 360 and bring in about $ 50 million .
If the parcel tax and the minimum staffing measures both fail , the city would be forced to lay off 202 officers by Jan .
1 .
Oakland has been reconciling itself to the worst economy in 70 years .
Like other cities around the state , Oakland 's property , sales and property transfer tax revenues have dried up during the Great Recession .
The city 's $ 407 million budget represents a revenue decline of $ 69 million in just five years .
At the same time , the city has been treating police and fire budgets as all but sacrosanct .
As other city departments have been steadily whittled back , Oakland 's budget has been increasingly dominated by public safety expenses .
In 2005 - 06 , police and fire accounted for 61 percent of the budget , according to City Administrator Dan Lindheim .
For 2010 - 11 , they will account for 75 percent .
Debt payments account for another 11 percent of the budget , and voter - mandated spending for children 's programs and libraries ties up 6 percent .
That leaves just $ 25 million in discretionary spending - or $ 5.5 million less than the deficit that needs to be eliminated .
" There 's just very little left to cut , " Lindheim said .
Firefighters have a no - layoff clause in their contract , so council members and Mayor Ron Dellums have said they have no choice but to lay off police .
However , they also have promised to hold off for at least five months - until ballot measures to boost police funding can be brought before voters - if officers agree to concessions on their pensions .
The Oakland Police Officers Association is seeking at least a two - year guarantee of no layoffs in return for pension concessions , something the council has been unwilling to do because future years have greater deficits .
" We have to look at the next five years and put this city in a position where we start correcting this incredible structural deficit , " said Councilman Ignacio De La Fuente , a longtime labor leader .
Following up on last week 's post , Tax Court Rejects Billionaire Anschutz 's Use of Variable Prepaid Forward Contracts to Avoid $ 144 m Capital Gain : Forbes , IRS Demands $ 45 Million From Billionaire McCombs , by Janet Novack :
The IRS is demanding $ 45 million in back 2002 and 2003 taxes from San Antonio billionaire Billy Joe “ Red ” McCombs for his use of a tax strategy similar to one a judge disallowed last week for billionaire Philip Anschutz .
[ Anschutz Co. v. Commissioner , 135 T.C. No. 5 ( July 22 , 2010 ) . ]
In a previously unreported lawsuit filed in May in U.S. Tax Court , the 82 - year - old McCombs is contesting the IRS ' assertion that he should have reported $ 213.4 million in long - term capital gains in 2002 from the sale of 11.3 million shares of Clear Channel Communications Inc. -- the company he cofounded in 1972 .
He 's also disputing an additional $ 3.3 million in 2003 capital gains in connection with the same purported sale .
In all , the IRS asserts , McCombs had $ 245 million in taxable income for 2002 and 2003 , rather than the $ 18 million he reported and owed $ 53 million in income tax , not the $ 8 million he paid .
The case involves a complicated strategy , which was widely peddled by Wall Street as a way for rich folks like Anschutz and McCombs to raise cash from highly appreciated stock positions , while deferring capital gains tax .
“ It 's like a who 's who of business that entered into these things , '' observed Robert Willens , an independent tax analyst in New York who was a managing director in the equity research department at Lehman Brothers for 20 years .
The Anschutz U.S. Tax Court decision was the first on the strategy , and the Anschutz Co. has already said it will “ vigorously appeal ” the adverse ruling .
Screenwriter David Steinberg was invited last fall by a producer to pitch his idea for a rewrite of a “ high - concept comedy ” about an adult slacker for a major studio .
Steinberg figured he had a good shot at the assignment with credits like “ American Pie 2 " under his belt , even though he heard there were many other writers competing for the opening .
After an initial meeting , the producer asked him to prepare a more detailed proposal , known as a “ beat sheet , ” outlining each scene and character .
Steinberg reworked four drafts of his pitch and met with other producers , each one offering a different take while praising him for a “ great job . ”
Normally , jumping through all those hoops signaled he had the job in the bag .
Not this time .
Steinberg was vacationing with his family in Aruba over the winter holiday when his agent e-mailed him that the studio picked another writer .
Advertisement
“ I was devastated , ” said Steinberg , a lawyer before turning to screenwriting .
“ If I was going to break into the business now , I do n’t know if I could do it because there are so few opportunities to sell a script or get an assignment . ”
Such is the dreary lot now facing many of Hollywood ’s screenwriters , who emerged from a bruising strike two years ago only to be hit by the recession that forced a sharp retrenchment in filmmaking at the studios .
This week the Writers Guild of America , West reported that while earnings for screenwriters have bounced back to pre-strike levels , there is a lot less work going around : employment has fallen 11 % in the last three years , with 226 fewer screenwriters working in 2009 than 2006 , the year before the 100 - day walkout and the lowest level in at least six years .
Indeed , the recession has given the movie studios a reason — or an excuse , depending on the perspective — to adjust in their favor how they employ screenwriters .

When screenwriters do get a shot at work , they are increasingly subject to “ sweepstakes pitching , ” in which as many as a dozen are pitted against one another , with producers picking the one they like best .
Or writers are often paid only for the first draft of the script in “ one - step deals , ” and no longer offered a fee for subsequent drafts , as in the past .
Writers also are expected to produce elaborate outlines of the script before they are hired for the project , losing valuable time if they are not selected .
The practices have raised the ire of the Writers Guild of America , West .
The union ’s president , John Wells , and other guild members recently met with studio executives at the Beverly Hills Hotel to air their concerns about practices they view as exploitative and harmful to the creative process .
“ What some members are telling us is , ‘ I ’m being asked to write a film before I ’ve been hired to write a film , ’ ” said David Young , executive director of the Writers Guild of America , West .
“ It ’s not just bad for writers , it ’s bad for the entire industry . ”

Studio executives who attended the meeting , including Tom Rothman , co-chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment ; Warner Bros .
President Alan Horn ; and Donna Langley , co-chair of Universal Pictures , all declined to comment .
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers , which bargains contracts on behalf of the studios , also would not comment .
Two people who attended the meeting , but who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential , said studio executives vowed to reexamine the practices but at the same time emphasized the right to protect their financial interest .
After the meeting , Warner Bros. moved to phase out one - step deals while also insisting that writers meet deadlines for work .
Of course , writers are n’t the only ones in Hollywood to be squeezed .
Confronted with a sharp decline in DVD sales , studios have been clamping down on the fees paid to top stars and filmmakers , who are being asked to defer their share of profits in movies until studios have recouped their production and distribution costs .
Advertisement
To cut expenses further , studios have slashed spending on development — the industry ’s equivalent of R&D — while scaling back the number of movies they release each year : the guild bestowed writers ’ credits on 237 films last year , down from 299 in 2008 .
With the closing of several independent distribution labels , studios have been purchasing fewer scripts in favor or adaptations of comic books , graphic novels , remakes and TV shows .
All of which has meant fewer jobs for rank - and - file writers , especially those who are trying to sell original scripts .
“ Except for current A - list writers , the picture is as bleak as I ’ve ever seen it , ” said former Writers Guild President Dan Petrie Jr .
Advertisement
Writers think the crimp in what the studios are willing to pay puts a cramp on creativity since it does n’t encourage risk - taking .
“ When a writer is working on a one - step deal , he ’s going to be risk - averse because if he takes a flier on a wildly creative or inventive way of telling the story , he might wind up getting fired , ” said Billy Ray , writer of the thrillers “ Flightplan ” and “ Color of Night , ” whose last four projects have all been one - step deals .
“ He wo n’t have another draft or two to make it work , so he ’s going to write it down the middle . ”
That ’s because , as agents who represent screenwriters note , a script often does n’t come together until after multiple rewrites .
“ In my opinion , it ’s shortsighted , ” said Nicole Clemens , head of the motion picture literary department for International Creative Management .
“ In terms of the development process , what ’s unfortunate about the one - step deal is that the movie is often ‘ found ’ in the second or third draft . ”

Which means that if writers do n’t succeed with the first draft , they wo n’t get the chance to try , try again .

Welcome to apipkg !
With apipkg you can control the exported namespace of a Python package and greatly reduce the number of imports for your users .
It is a small pure Python module that works on CPython 2.7 and 3.4+ , Jython and PyPy .
It cooperates well with Python ’s help ( ) system , custom importers ( PEP302 ) and common command - line completion tools .
Usage is very simple : you can require ‘ apipkg ’ as a dependency or you can copy paste the ~200 lines of code into your project .
Tutorial example
Here is a simple mypkg package that specifies one namespace and exports two objects imported from different modules : # mypkg/__init__.py import apipkg apipkg.initpkg( __name__ , { ' path ' : { ' Class1 ' : " _mypkg.somemodule:Class1 " , ' clsattr ' : " _mypkg.othermodule:Class2.attr " , } } The package is initialized with a dictionary as namespace .
You need to create a _mypkg package with a somemodule.py and othermodule .py containing the respective classes .
The _mypkg is not special - it ’s a completely regular Python package .
Namespace dictionaries contain name : value mappings where the value may be another namespace dictionary or a string specifying an import location .
On accessing an namespace attribute an import will be performed : >>> import mypkg >>> mypkg.path < ApiModule ' mypkg.path '> >>> mypkg.path.Class1 # ' _mypkg.somemodule ' gets imported now < class _mypkg.somemodule.Class1 at 0xb7d428fc > >>> mypkg.path.clsattr # ' _mypkg.othermodule ' gets imported now 4 # the value of _mypkg.othermodule.Class2.attr
The mypkg . path namespace and its two entries are loaded when they are accessed .
This means : lazy loading - only what is actually needed is ever loaded
only the root “ mypkg ” ever needs to be imported to get access to the complete functionality
the underlying modules are also accessible , for example : from mypkg.sub import Class1
Including apipkg in your package
If you do n’t want to add an apipkg dependency to your package you can copy the apipkg .
py file somewhere to your own package , for example _mypkg / apipkg.py in the above example .
You then import the initpkg function from that new place and are good to go .

There 's some seriously good brewing going on in the Midwest , though those of us stranded on the East Coast rarely get to taste it .
Perhaps that 's a good thing , though :
By focusing their efforts on producing small quantities of beer for local distribution , Midwest breweries are able to concentrate on quality and flavor .
This week , we gathered a sample of IPAs from the Midwest to review , and a few of them are definitely top tier .
Many of these beers tend to be creamier and mellower than California or Pacific Northwest IPAs , without quite the resinous pop that 's more common out west .
It 's a great style unto itself :
The best of these beers are drinkable and balanced , rich and silky .
They 'll be friendly to food and they wo n't demolish your palate the way extremely hoppy brews will .
( Be warned : there are still a handful of wildly hoppy beers in this roundup . )
What follows is a taste of some of the great IPAs of the Midwest .
But we 've only just begun exploring Midwestern beer .
So tell us , locals : what are your favorite Midwestern brews ?
Serious Beer Ratings *****
Mindblowing ; a new favorite ****
Awesome , stock up on this *** Around average for the style **
There are probably better options *
No , thanks , I 'll have water .

Magnificent Michigan IPA
Bell 's Two Hearted Ale Kalamazoo , Michigan 7 % ABV
This beer smells like honey and orange , butterscotch and apricot .
It has an amazingly smooth mouthfeel and no harshness ( though it retains a good dry earthy bitterness ) .
This beautifully balanced beer is accessible , drinkable , with notes of orange marmalade and mulling spices , cream soda , brown butter , toffee , and orange pekoe tea .
Every beer lover should try this stellar example at some point .
****1/2
Short 's Huma Lupa Licious Bellaire , Michigan 6.7 % ABV
This may be the most aggressively resiny of the Midwest beers we tried ; with woodsy grassy notes and a highly herbal scent ( mostly that herb ) .
This beer is focused and piney with a squeeze of lemon juice , oily grapefruit peel , and a rich , almost buttery finish .
Full - bodied caramelly malt supports the very big , complex hop flavor .
If only these guys distributed outside Michigan ...
****1/2
Founder 's Centennial IPA Grand Rapids , Michigan 7.2 % ABV
It 's hard to decide whether we prefer this one or the Two - Hearted ; with beer this good , it 's just a matter of personal taste .
This beer is a bit more caramel - flavored than the Bell's , but a little less creamy , with a nose of oily hops and broiled grapefruit .
Sweet orange and pine flavors are balanced with malty richness ; we'd be happy to drink this anytime .
****1/2
Double Trouble
Three Floyds Dreadnaught Munster , Indiana 9.5 % ABV
Full bodied without being too sweet , this Imperial IPA has a serious serving of hops .
We tasted marmalade and pine resin , a bright bitterness that actually stands up against the high alcohol .
Awesome — and we sat on our bottle longer than we should have .
Get a fresh one and open it right away !
****1/2
Bell 's Hopslam Kalamazoo , Michigan 10 % ABV
When fresh , this double IPA has a delicious aroma of candied orange peel and juniper — and you do n't need to stick your nose in the glass to smell it .
( Older bottles have mellowed into honeyed maltiness ; not bad , but we recommend catching a fresh one as soon as it's released or seeking it out on tap . )
This beer has marmalade notes and a hint of watermelon Jolly Ranchers ; it 's seriously tasty , but also seriously alcoholic .
****1/4
Hoppin ' Frog Mean Manalishi Akron , Ohio 8.2 % ABV
This beer is highly drinkable for the ABV , with plentiful carbonation and refreshing bitterness .
It has friendly apricot and pomelo notes , a hint of cantaloupe with a squeeze of lemon .
After the pops of flavor are done , you 're left with an herbal finish .
We enjoyed this -- it 's not the most complex double IPA we 've had , but it 's fun and even approachable for the style .
****
Surly Abrasive Minneapolis , Minnesota 9.7 % ABV
This beer is n't abrasive at all — it 's named after the factory that once stood at the brewery 's site .
It 's a sweet and rich double IPA with a buttery finish , sticky / resiny hops , honeyed grapefruit , and a hint of maple syrup .
Some of our tasters found it more interesting than Surly 's intense single IPA .
****
Schlafly American IPA St. Louis , Missouri 8 % ABV
This is technically categorized as an American IPA , not a double , but it 's just too strong for us to compare to a single IPA .
We 've heard this beer is awesome on tap , with hoppy brightness rising above the toffeed sweetness that you get in the bottle .
The scent is rich grapefruit , but we found this beer mostly thick and boozy , with notes of cantaloupe , banana , pine , and sugar .
This is not a beer for the meek ; we felt the alcohol was a bit over the top .
***1/4
Schlafly Export IPA St. Louis , Missouri 8 % ABV
Another boozy offering from Schlafly , categorized as an English IPA ( but for us , more like a double ) .
This beer is also quite sweet , but with a burst of bitter hopping over the papaya and orange - Starburst notes .
It 's earthier than the American IPA , but we wished they would dry it out a little bit more .
***
More Solid Midwest Sips
Surly Furious Minneapolis , Minnesota 6.5 % ABV
This one has a blast of floral hoppiness and fruit on the nose .
It 's seriously bitter and piney , with tons of caramel malt and dried - papaya - spear sweetness to balance .
This ones for hopheads only ; others may be overwhelmed .
****
Goose Island IPA Chicago , Illinois 5.9 % ABV
This drinkable IPA smells like caramel and butterscotch .
The flavor is rich and creamy , almost understated for an IPA , with delicate earthy hops and a dry bitterness on the finish .
We were reminded of lemon - poppyseed cake and clementines , sage and spicy clove .
Once again , a tasty , food - friendly beer from the folks at Goose Island .
****
Two Brother 's Resistance Warrenville , Illinois 6.9 % ABV
This is not your standard IPA — it 's aged in oak barrels and tastes more like a hoppy farmhouse ale .
It 's balanced and food friendly , extremely dry after a fruity - sweet opening taste .
We noticed bitter orange peel , lavender , and lemon .
***3/4
Hoppin ' Frog Hoppin ' to Heaven IPA Akron , Ohio 6.8 % ABV
This approachable , drinkable IPA has primarily apricot and peach flavors , with a hint of cream soda and enough bitterness to balance .
The finish is clean on this food - friendly beer .
***3/4
Ale Asylum Bedlam !
Madison , Wisconsin
What happens when you brew with Belgian yeast and Citra Hops ?
Rich tropical - fruit aromas ( with a hint of spicy cinnamon scent ) and vibrant flavors .
It 's fruity ( like a peach crossed with a pineapple ) without being overly sweet , tarted up a bit by the hops .
Beer nerds may find it fascinating , though some of our tasters believed it was n't quite coherent .
***3/4
Lakefront IPA Milwaukee , Wisconsin 6.9 % ABV
This beer is nothing like the creamy IPAs we often find in the Midwest — there 's an eyepopping amount of hopping , and it'll make you pucker Atomic Warhead - style .
We tasted tongue - coating lemon , thyme , eucalyptus , and grapefruit from Cascade and Chinook hops .
Prepare your palate — while it's not super complex and it could use a little fuller body to balance the hoppiness , this beer will take you for quite a ride .
***3/4
Michigan Brewing Company High Seas IPA Webberville , Micigan , 7.2 % ABV
This bright and flavorful IPA has a good orange - peel scent and some slightly - astringent bitterness on the finish .
Grapefruit pith flavor is n't for everyone , though we enjoyed this .
***1/2
Tallgrass IPA Manhattan , Kansas 6.3 % ABV Caramels and orange hard candy dominate the scent of this beer , which has a nice rich body and graham - crackery malt .
This drinkable beer has a delicate bitterness and orangey hops .
Fans of copper ales will love this one , though it might leave hardcore hopheads wanting more .
***1/2
Copper Canyon Devil's Peak IPA Southfield , Michigan 6.8 % ABV
This beer has a big aroma of orange candy and pine , and the taste follows through with very fruity and sweet grapefruit notes up front , and thyme on the finish .
We tasted brown sugar and meyer lemon , candied grapefruit , with good crisp bitterness ( which it needs ) on the finish .
Tasty stuff , though not quite as focused as the best in the category .
***1/2
Boulevard Single - Wide IPA Kansas City , Missouri 5.7 % ABV
This crisp and tart IPA has floral notes and a hint of apricot and lemon .
It 's on the bitter side , grassy and refreshing , if not life changing .
The finish reminded us of black tea .
***1/2
Not Really Our Thing
Great Lakes Commodore Perry Cleveland , Ohio 7.5 % ABV Remember Tang ?
This beer smells a bit like that .
It 's fruity - tasting but with a sharply bitter earthy / herbal finish and hints of prune and brown sugar .
This spicy beer includes traditional English Fuggle hops .
We felt that the alcohol in this beer was n't quite integrated .
***1/4
Summit India Pale Ale St. Paul , Minnesota 6.4 % ABV
A reddish pour with apricot and sour cherry notes , this beer is malty with earthy hop notes and a dry finish .
The toasted grain flavor is balanced with minty hops in this fine but not exceptional Minnesota brew .
***
Arbor Brewing Sacred Cow IPA
Ann Arbor , Michigan , 6 % ABV
This earthy IPA has toasted bread flavors and a hint of Grand Marnier — some tasters found it slightly funky and discombobulated , though others liked the spicy herbal notes .
***

Dutch MP Geert Wilders speaks during a news conference in central London March 5 , 2010 .
The Dutch MP was in London to show an anti-Islam film , local media reported .
REUTERS / Suzanne Plunkett
( Reuters ) - The Freedom Party ( PVV ) of anti-immigrant leader Geert Wilders moved three seats ahead of its rivals in a new Dutch election poll on Sunday , as support for the Christian Democrats ( CDA ) of Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende continued to slip .
The Maurice de Hond poll put the PVV on 27 seats in the June 9 national elections , while the CDA and the Labour Party ( PvdA ) were both on 24 seats .
The poll also showed that none of the three most likely coalitions would be able to form a majority government without reaching across lines to a fourth or fifth party .
In local council polls on March 3 , Wilders made substantial gains , positioning him to do well in the national election .
Balkenende ’s Christian Democrats were seen as the biggest loser in the council voting .
There has been heavy speculation since then in the Dutch press that the party might change course and name Transport Minister Camiel Eurlings to lead it into the election .
The current government collapsed February 20 after Labour pulled out of the CDA - led coalition in a dispute over the Dutch mission in Afghanistan .
The Celtics have agreed to terms with veteran center Jermaine O’Neal , using their full mid-level exception on the six - time All - Star who played the past 1 1/2 seasons with the Miami Heat , according to a team source .
O’Neal earned more than $ 23 million last season but was willing to take the $ 5.7 million MLE for a chance to win a title .
And it ’s good news for Celtics fans hoping their team can compete with the Miami Heat if they manage to sign LeBron James .
O’Neal struggled mightily in the playoff series against the Celtics last April , going 9 for 44 from the field and averaging 4.2 points , but when he is playing well , O’Neal remains a solid perimeter player and rebounder .

He will eventually blend time with Kendrick Perkins , who will be out until February with a torn right ACL .
You see the evidence every day .
If it ’s not one thing , it ’s another , and I ’m fed up .
I pay my tax dollars to fuel a bloated beast of incompetence , and its name is Government .
Gosh darn it , the government can’t do anything right .
Except for the Internet .
I concede that the government may have had something to do with the development of the Web .
But that was the Department of Defense !
And the DOD is the cool part of the government ( inasmuch as any of it is cool , which none of it is ) .
I ’ve gotta admit that my GPS is nice , too , and I guess the government may have sort of set that up .
I love my GPS , because asking for directions makes me feel as ignorant and useless as the government .
But look at the BP oil spill .
That ’s classic big - government meddling right there .
Oil companies just want to do the right thing and spend lots of money on redundant safety equipment and extensive backup systems , because those are things that investors really care about .
And for a long time , the Minerals Management Service kept its nose out of the business , except when it came time for cocaine parties and sex with oil company people .
Now look what ’s happened .
In the current power - hungry government regulatory environment , BP was probably so busy conforming to nitpicking rules – you ca n’t put a rig on Myrtle Beach ; hey , watch out for that bald eagle nest – that it had no extra resources to plan for worst - case scenarios .
Last year , the company made only $ 14 billion , and functional blowout preventers are n’t cheap .
Now everyone wants to blame BP , just because it drilled the well and has a history of safety violations and has a CEO who said he wants his life back .
I say that when Interior Secretary Ken Salazar points a finger at an oily pelican , three fingers point back to a feckless bureaucracy .
Evidence of government worthlessness and corruption abounds .
Meanwhile , private industry is consistently a model of progress , innovation , and ethics in synch with the good of society .
To name just one example , consider the National Football League – profitable , wholesome entertainment .
Imagine if the government were involved with even a single football team .
A government - affiliated enterprise would n’t look like the University of Alabama team that beat the University of Texas for the 2010 BCS championship , that ’s for sure .
If you need further evidence of the uselessness of the government , take a look at the Big Dig .
I mean , how delayed and over budget was that boondoggle ?
If only a few competent private companies had been involved – perhaps established firms like Bechtel and Parsons Brinckerhoff – then we would n’t have had leaks and collapsing ceiling panels .
But you know the government .
Just rife with incompetence .
Private companies and publicly held corporations are the engines of progress , and government exists only to undermine the innate spirit of innovation with stifling taxes and regulations .
Competition , unfettered by government , naturally results in the best outcomes .
Well , except for maybe Tyco , WorldCom , Enron , Bernie Madoff , Lehman Brothers , Global Crossing , AIG , Bear Stearns , Arthur Andersen , and one or two others .
But do you think the government could have come up with important products you use every day , like the credit default swap and synthetic collateralized debt obligations ?
No way .
All the government does is take your money and blow it on frivolous projects like schools and roads and fire departments and health care for the elderly and saving the financial system .
That last one really burns my britches .
Here we have a perfectly fine system that takes care of itself , only melting down about once every eight years , and the government barges in .
It ’s so socialist .
Private companies know best , so if they think it ’s good to lose trillions and go out of business , then I ’m sure that was just part of their long - term plan .
But , of course , the government interfered , and now it wants to impose new rules that will stunt innovation .
Think the Founding Fathers would have wanted transparency in derivatives trading ?
I bet Lenin would have loved to establish a consumer protection agency .
I thought Scott Brown was OK until he showed his true colors as the kind of power - crazed politician who is occasionally in favor of the government doing things .
I ’m not joking when I say I would n’t trust the bumbling , idiotic government to water my plants .
But come to think of it , there is one thing that maybe it could handle : pulling someone over on suspicion of being an illegal immigrant .
Yeah , it would definitely be really good at that .

We ’re met by the lovely Chris Jones , who has the unenviable task of nerd - herding over the course of the shoot .
To the bemusement of passers - by , this gaggle of geeks marches into our very own TARDIS , a white trailer whose insides resemble an American diner , only without a jukebox .
Or any food .
There ’s a television , though , and we sit chatting as someone from wardrobe comes to assess our nerd credentials .
I watch , nervously , as some of my cohorts are handed extra-nerdy shirts and cardigans to wear .
With my checked shirt , striped tie and thick glasses , could I be about to get sent home for looking too cool ?
1400 .
No .
In fact , the wardrobe lady compliments me on how nerdy I ’m looking and waves me through .
I ’m told there ’s a danger I might strobe , though , and spend the next quarter of an hour envisaging myself as a superhero , a bit like Dazzler from the X - Men ( but with larger breasts ) .
1430 .
A group of glamorous female extras from an outside agency comes to join us in the trailer .
I ’m later told that they were dressed rather provocatively , but I ’m too busy looking around at the bevy of bespectacled nerdy beauties to notice .
I may not have the social skills to actually go up and talk to any of them , but I can sure as hell stare .
So that ’s exactly what I do .
1500 .
The call comes through from the not - so - evil overlords on set : bring on the extras !
We ’re shepherded out of the warmth of the TARDIS and into the bitter cold of a disused multi-storey car park .
It ’s a glamorous life , working in television .
I wonder , as we ’re separated into several small groups and positioned between metal fences , if perhaps we have been gathered for a darker purpose – I suspect the sitcom gods would look quite favourably upon a sacrifice of 30 or so nerds in exchange for another successful series …
1515 .
It seems their plan is more fiendish than I had imagined , as it ’s revealed that our first task … is to run .
There are some things in life that I just do n’t do , and running ’s one of them ( Counting past 23 is another , which makes birthdays difficult ) .
I consider storming out , but at that moment we are greeted by comedy legend Graham Linehan , writer / director on The IT Crowd and one of the brains behind shows such as Big Train , Black Books , and Father Ted .
He thanks us for coming along and explains a little about the scene , and as his Irish tones wash over us my reservations melt away .
I do n’t do running , but I ’ll make an exception for Graham Linehan .
Plus , I realise , if I do everything exactly to the letter then he ’s sure to promote me to a regular on the show , right ?
Senators will hear testimony from Army officials next week in the ongoing controversy over the troubling mismanagement allegations at Arlington National Cemetery .
The Senate Homeland Security Subcommittee on Contract Oversight will address the findings of a months - long Army investigation that revealed a “ dysfunctional ” management system , flawed recordkeeping and more than 200 mismarked graves at the military burial site .
ADVERTISEMENT
Edward Harrington , Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army ( Procurement ) ; Claudia Tornblom , Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army ( Management and Budget ) ; and Kathryn Condon , Executive Director of the Army National Cemeteries Program are among those expected to testify .
Also requested at the hearing are John C. Metzler Jr. , former superintendent at Arlington National Cemetery , and Thurman Higginbotham , the former deputy superintendent .
Metzler and Higginbotham were both implicated of wrongdoing in the Army ’s report , but because both men recently announced their retirements it is unclear whether they will be compelled to testify .
Metzler was reprimanded following the report ’s release , while Higginbotham was put on administrative leave pending a disciplinary review , which is ongoing .
The subcommittee wants Higginbotham to testify about his role overseeing contracts , in particular the technology contracts to digitize the cemetery ’s burial records .
Investigators said mistakes related to these contracts contributed to the improperly marked graves at the cemetery .
In a letter to Higginbotham requesting his appearance at the hearing , subcommittee Chairwoman ( D - Mo. ) said Higginbotham should be prepared to discuss the report ’s findings that he “ repeatedly authorized payment to contractors for IT contracts despite ‘ grossly inadequate contractor progress to justify these expenditures . ’
” McCaskill spokeswoman Maria Speiser said Higginbotham had not yet indicated how he would respond to the subcommittee ’s request .
The report ’s release in June prompted severe public outcry , extensive media coverage and the immediate scheduling of congressional hearings to address the issue .
Members of the House Armed Service Committee openly expressed their outrage at a hearing earlier this month to address the report ’s findings .
“ I ’m just downright angry , ” Rep. Ike Skelton ( D - Mo. ) , the committee chairman , said in his opening remarks .
Rep. Buck McKeon ( R - Calif .
) , ranking member on the committee , called the report ’s findings “ profoundly shocking and heartbreaking .
” In spite of the initial outcry over the Arlington report , sources indicate that lawmakers are in no rush to take legislative action .
Instead , members of Congress seem to have adopted a “ wait and see ” approach to allow the Army to confront the problems on its own .
“ At this point , legislative action would be premature , ” Skelton spokeswoman Jennifer Kohl said .
She said the committee continued to exercise “ full oversight ” of the Army ’s efforts to correct the problems identified in the report , but would not hesitate to conduct further hearings if needed .
“ This is an ongoing effort that will continue for a number of years , ” Kohl said .
Brian Lawrence , a spokesman for Rep. Steve Buyer ( R - Ind. ) , ranking member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee , said that while lawmakers have met with Army officials to discuss the situation at Arlington , these discussions are still in the preliminary stages .
“ I do n’t want to say it ’s out of the spotlight , ” Lawrence said .
“ We ’re waiting to see if legislation is necessary .
” He said given the relatively full legislative agenda facing Congress , members are unlikely to address the Arlington situation before the August recess .
“ I do n’t see that happening , ” Lawrence said .
“ We ’re still in the assessment period right now .
” Speiser said the Senate subcommittee would wait until after Thursday ’s hearing before deciding how best to proceed .
“ We ’re hopeful that the hearing will shed new light on how these contracting problems occurred and what factors led to the situation and then we will go from there , ” Speiser said .
Though legislation to address the problems at Arlington is unlikely to materialize any time soon , some lawmakers have been working on the sidelines to address what is widely considered to be the cemetery ’s most pressing issue shortfall — its woefully outdated record system .
Sen . ( D - Va. ) posted a YouTube video on his website last month following a briefing with Army officials .
He said it was “ appalling ” that while the Army has spent $ 5.5 million since 2003 on a number of separate contracts to update and digitize Arlington ’s gravesite records , cemetery officials are still relying on “ hand - written 3x5 index cards .
”
“ That means we are one fire , flood or coffee - spill away from damaging or losing these irreplaceable records , ” Warner said .
Warner said he has been working with members of the Northern Virginia Technology Council to provide a “ short - term patch , ” free of charge , that could immediately improve the cemetery ’s record system while a more permanent solution is negotiated .
He said the issue of Arlington ’s recordkeeping should be addressed as soon as possible , even as Congress determines whether further corrective action is needed .
Buyer has also been pushing Arlington to adopt a new electronic database .
“ Our concern is whether the IT system has the backbone to support what it needs , ” Buyer ’s spokesman said .
Warner said a reliable record system was a necessary first step to restoring Arlington to its “ hallowed ground status for all Americans . ”
The days are passing really fast , and I know that when we realize , it will be December , and Tron will be moments away from its release .
That said , I guess it 's time for us to warm up for that , because I just know that this movie will be fantastic .
First a set of billboards , then a set of promo images ...
I find these really amazing .
The design line they chose is just breathtaking .
But I wonder how do you like it .
What are your expectations for this film ?

Prince Charles ' backed homeopathy in secret talks with ministers '
Prince Charles is said to be in support of using homeopathy on the NHS
Prince Charles last night stood accused of secretly lobbying ministers in support of using discredited homeopathic medicines on the NHS .
The Department of Health has admitted for the first time that homeopathy has been discussed at private meetings between ministers and the prince , a strong supporter of alternative therapies .
The NHS spends millions of pounds each year on the complementary medicine -- at a time when it is restricting proven lifesaving drugs for those with cancer .
Last year Prince Charles was accused of meddling in Government policy after it emerged he had written to eight Whitehall departments in three years .
Now an MP has accused him of overstepping his constitutional role by having ' secret ' meetings with ministers on what is a deeply political issue .
It comes as the Commons science and technology committee is today expected to call on the NHS to stop funding homeopathic medicines because of a lack of evidence that they are effective .
Experts say there is no way known to science that the medicines - which claim to treat and prevent disease by using greatly diluted forms of herbs and minerals - could possibly work beyond being a placebo .
But a letter posted on the House of Commons website indicates the Prince of Wales is still exerting influence on the issue .
Health minister Mike O'Brien wrote to the committee , saying homeopathy was likely to have been discussed at the prince 's meetings - the most recent of which was with Health Secretary Andy Burnham on October 29 .
He wrote : ' These are private meetings , have no fixed agenda and cover a wide range of topics of interest to both parties , which may sometimes include homeopathy . '
Dr Evan Harris , a LibDem member of the committee , said the letter would have ruled out homeopathy if it had not been discussed , as it was in response to a question from the committee about the Royal Family 's influence on the subject .
He added : ' It is bad enough that the heir to the throne ( who can not be criticised or even mentioned in Parliament by the rules of the House ) should seek to influence policy , but it is made worse by the fact that he does so secretly , that he has access to the Health Secretary that any health professional - with a lifetime 's expertise to offer - could never have , and that he does so on matters of political controversy currently before the House . '
A Clarence House spokesman said the prince 's meetings with ministers were ' perfectly normal in his role as heir to the throne ' .
She said he used the last meeting to ' raise issues of concern to him ' - but would not say what was discussed .
DUBAI ( Reuters ) - Al Qaeda has threatened to kidnap Saudi princes and ministers in order to secure the release of a female al Qaeda operative arrested by Saudi forces , al Arabiya television said on Thursday .
In an audiotape played on al Arabiya , an al Qaeda regional commander threatened “ major operations ” against the kingdom following the arrest of Haylah al - Qassir .
Qassir was believed to be responsible for recruiting women to the global militant group as well as handling money issues , the Arab satellite television channel said .
“ Al Qaeda is organizing cells to kidnap ... princes , ministers and officials including military commanders , ” Saeed al - Shehri said in the audiotape .
Reuters could not verify the accuracy of the recording .
The regional Yemen - based arm of the group , known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) , jumped to the forefront of Western and Saudi security concerns after it claimed responsibility for a failed December attempt to bomb a U.S. - bound passenger plane .
In April , the group tried to assassinate the British ambassador to Yemen when a suicide bomber threw himself into the path of his convoy in the capital , Sanaa .
Only the suicide bomber died , but the bold hit signaled that a recent crackdown by the Yemeni government on the global militant group has done little to curb its ambitions to carry out attacks in the region and beyond .
Last August , a 23 - year - old AQAP suicide bomber posing as a repentant militant , tried to kill Prince Mohammed bin Nayef who heads Saudi Arabia ’s anti-terrorism campaign .
Yemen , struggling to curb a northern Shi’ite insurgency and a southern separatist movement , has faced international pressure to quell domestic conflicts in order to focus on fighting a resurgent al Qaeda in the impoverished country .
Qassir , called “ the lady of al Qaeda , ” is the widow of an al Qaeda operative killed six years ago , al Arabiya said .
Brammo just moved directly into superbike territory with the Brammo Empulse electric motorcycle .
Featuring a top speed of 100 + mph ( 160 + kmph ) and a range of between 60 , 80 and 100 miles the Empulse has a starting price of just under $ 10,000 USD , after tax rebates this price tag will come down as low as $ 7,000 in some US states .
That ’s a very , very good deal for a bike like this .
The Empulse is due in early 2011 and is going to be serious competition for the range of electric motorcycles offered by Zero , although Zero is n’t offering a street racer style bike at the moment they may very well have something in the pipeline after having won the TTXGP Infineon race this year .
Putting down 55 HP and 59 ft - lbs of torque through the rear wheel the Empulse should have comparable performance to a 650 cc sportbike and with all the torque available through the entire rev band it ’s acceleration off the line should be enough to trounce most sports cars .
It will take between 6 and 8 hours to recharge from the power socket in your garage or 2 hours if you have access to a high voltage power source .
I have n't bought a video camera in a very long time .
The main reason for this is that I believe that every camera on the market is either too expensive or has too many drawbacks .
However , two weeks ago I bought a Canon 550d which is the first camera that meets my price - perfomance requirements .
I was close to buying a Canon 7D a few months ago but decided not to .
The camera 's shortcomings ( line - skipping sensor , h.264 codec ) did n't justify the price to me .
Shortly after I decided not to get the 7D , Canon announced the 550d ( known as the Rebel T2i in the US ) which made me incredibly glad I did n't make that purchase .
The video functionality on the 550d is virtually identical to that of the 7D .
The only notable differences are the lack of 1/3rd stop ISO settings , white balance fine - tuning in Kelvin , and HD external video output while recoding .
The other differences between the cameras are purely build quality and photo shooting speed -- neither which I care about too much .
The other big difference : the 550d costs half as much as the 7D .
I have n't had the chance to use the camera on any legitimate projects yet , however I have made some very unscientific tests :
Download High - Bitrate 1080 p h.264( 307MB )
The main purpose of these tests was to investigate overall image quality and to see how the camera looked with varying depth of field .
The lighting is clearly not constant at all ( I had no real cinema lights handy in my apartment at 1 am ) , but Spock 's face should be consistently exposed throughout .
All of the tests were shot using a Canon 50 mm f1.8 , some of the other random footage was shot using a Manual Nikon 24 mm f2 or the Canon 17 - 55 f2.8 IS .
I recorded at 1080 p 25 .
I think the camera performs quite well .
The noise ( even at ISO 1600 ) .
though noticeable , is n't really distracting .
One problem I noticed and was expecting is in the last test clip where I rack focus .
There is some shimmery aliasing on the card in the background .
This must be an artifact of the line - skipping sensor .
Any questions ?
First off , my apologies for the late posting in the SysAdmin series ( or very early since tomorrow is Thursday ) .
I had to deal with a double HDD failure on my home PC this weekend which ate up 14 + waking hours between Saturday night and all day Sunday , which would have been my prime writing time .
Then the third HDD in that system crashed Monday evening , egad , what are the odds .
I digress …
I 've been looking for an easy way recently to manage configuration files for remote servers without having to deal with subversion , and even looked at some sort of file sync with Evernote / Dropbox via Android using an FTP client , but neither Evernote or Dropbox give you easy access to files on your SD storage when you download files .
Evernote will let you navigate to notes you create on your Android device , but the folders to get to that note do n’t have intuitive names .
Again , I digress , and will cover Evernote and Dropbox from a sysadmin point of view another time .
I decided instead to look at tools that could let me carry some config files on my Android device and sync them to remote servers , but that still raises the question of versioning .
Since no capable tool was found , and since I tend to take my Android device along with me everywhere I go anyway , I wanted to explore a few different options .
So today , instead of one extensive thorough review of a single app as I 've done in previous articles , I decided that this article would instead be a quick recap of 3 different FTP clients for Android , and then give my recommendations in the conclusion .
Note – I ’ve added descriptive alternate text to all images , so feel free to hover your mouse over them to see additional comments .
In no particular order : DroidFtp , AndFTP , and FSync .

I wonder what would happen if I whine that his FAQ site is offline ?
It 's also non-reassuring when the developer name , FAQ site , and dev Email address are all different .
The Good , The Bad , and The Ugly
My first complaint about the software is the opening screen where you enter session data for a server connection ( image 1 ) .
Tapping on a text field places the cursor at the beginning of the strings which are already present .
Its annoying to have to tap a second time to get to the end of the string , then backspace through the existing test data just to enter real data .
I do , however , like that you can connect to a system without having to save the connection setup .
And , overall , the simplicity of the app is somewhat endearing .
This is not a jack - of - all - trades kind of app , it has one focus and sticks to it .
Nice !
Configuration settings are slim , only giving you an option to choose where on your SD card you ’d like to set as your default download path , and to enable system logging .
Once connected ( image 5 and 6 ) , you ’ll see your files on the remote system .
Forewarning , you may want to run this in landscape mode if you have long filenames , as this app will attempt to wrap filenames which looks pretty bad .
Under the “ what was he thinking ” category , pressing the Back button on your device will navigate you up the file system , not take you back to the previous page ( home screen in this case ) .
The only easy way to exit the app is to disconnect form any session which will return you to the home screen , and the Back button from there will return you to Android .
While you are connected , the submenu is where you can to to upload a file , but the interface on the files is a simple scrolling dialog where tapping on a folder will enter that folder but hitting the Back button will return you to the file listing screen , and not navigate back through other folders on the SD storage .
Once you find your file , uploading is quick and easy , simply select the Upload File option from the submenu while you ’re connected , and browse to your file ( image 8 ) .
Be careful though , as the Back button does not operate as you ’d expect it to .
Android Development 101 teaches aspiring developers to maintain a sense of consistency , and follow common UI principles .
This developer must have missed that class .
I 'd rate this app at 4 stars .
The interface is n't as nice as others I 've seen , and limiting uploads to a single file at a time is a bit of a nuisance , especially since you have to navigate from the root of your SD card to find each file .
However , the simplicity of the application is really nice , and it ’s a relatively small app to download .
And Ftp

Neat features : FTP / FTPS / SFTP , manages several connection configurations , provides download / upload resume , provides Intents for other applications to link to AndFtp for connectivity ( * )
* in programmer lingo , an Intent in Android development is like providing an API to other applications on your device , similar to how Decaf can link to ConnectBot as covered in a previous SysAdmin Series article .
The Good , The Bad and The Ugly
The interface is well thought out but not necessarily intuitive for first - time users .
Even as a seasoned software developer myself and a hard - core Android user , I found myself scratching my head a few times .
Despite an eventually - successful login , I could n't simply flag files on the SD card and upload them to my home folder , I was forced to select a folder first ( image 15 ) .
I tried to create one using the interface and got an error that a new folder could n't be created .
I logged in a second time and created a new folder just fine and uploaded my files into that folder ( image 16 and 17 ) .
Hitting the back button to try to navigate around worked as expected , but hitting it too many times will return you to the home screen where you 'll see that you 've been disconnected .
Unlike our favorite SSH client ( ConnectBot ) , you cannot maintain several connections at the same time .
It would be nice if returning to the home screen did n’t disconnect you , but instead altered itself to detect that you are still connected and give you options to resume your session or disconnect .
I give high marks for the layout of the app , and allowing a decent amount of customization and lots of supplemental commands .
A place to manually enter FTP commands might be handy for hardcore FTP users .
I ’m not sure why , but I could n’t connect as my ‘ testuser ’ account on my FTP server , and had to log in with a regular user instead .
The others apps evaluated in this article connected as ‘ testuser ’ just fine .
I personally rate this app 4 stars ; if it was a little more intuitive and less buggy ( could n’t log in as a user named ‘ testuser ’ , bug in creating new folders , unable to upload into home folder ) I would consider a 5 - star rating .
Fsync

App web site : http://www.unisaran.com/fsync.html
Support Email : [ email protected ]
FTP / FTPS , Sync Widget , ZIP , drag and drop interface
The Good , The Bad and The Ugly
From the get - go , we can see that the UI designers at Fsync are doing their jobs , and doing them very well .
It 's always nice to see a fresh looking interface .
The fact that you can customize the color scheme is a neat option as well though just exploring into that submenu changed my default color scheme from blue to green without me touching anything .
Another bonus is that setting up a network connection gives you a button to Save , and a button to Test ( images 10 and 11 ) -- clicking
Test will save the settings if its successful , a really great feature .
The idea of gestures in the app is nice , but I found no practical use for them .
I tapped on the server connection to connect to my FTP server ( image 12 ) and nothing happened .
A long - tap on the entry crashed the app ( image 13 ) .
Upon restarting , and going to the submenu , selecting Network , and long - tapping on the connection , I was given options to connect , edit the settings or delete the connection .
Also , upon restarting the app , it seems my default color scheme changed from blue to green .
I was unable to find clear instructions on how to upload or download a file , and found this almost frustrating enough to not include Fsync as an option in this article .
However , I eventually figured out that long - tapping on a file on the Network view gave me an option to copy the file , which copied it to a " server clipboard " .
However , once I navigate to SD storage , there 's no intuitive ' paste ' command .
I eventually found that if I long - tap on a folder , I can choose the Paste command to start the download to SD .
I imagine the instructions are similar to go in reverse .
At the risk of saying that the app has a security hole , when logging in as an unprivileged user , I was surprised to see myself logged into the root folder of my FTP server , and not my home directory .
I do n’t recall seeing a setting for this in the configuration screens .
The app has an option for viewing background jobs , as if there 's a means to queue up several files and just send them in the background , however I was n't getting tired of trying to find the options and gave up looking .
While this is one of the nicer interfaces in the bunch , I can still only rate this app with 4 stars .
It 's still a little buggy , and it 's not very intuitive .
I 'd suggest the app developer write a tutorial or add some comprehensive help screens for users to get some assistance within the app .
Conclusions
DroidFtp , AndFtp and Fsync are all free apps in the Android Market , and compete with other apps out there as well as other paid apps .
It was disappointing to see that developers do n’t give us any sort of “ command line ” access to the FTP prompt for advanced work , or even giving us the full range of FTP commands such as remotely renaming files .
If these were the only three FTP clients in the Android Market , I would personally use And Ftp .
Some thought has obviously gone into the application to make it comparatively easy to use in a side - by - side comparison of DroidFtp and Fsync .
On looks alone , my choice would be Fsync , but the application just is n’t intuitive enough .
DroidFtp has some nice features going for it , and I love that it ’s a do - one - thing - and - do - it - well kind of app , but recent comments are all bashing on the app and makes me wonder if the developer has moved on to other apps .
Do you have a favorite FTP client for Android ?

This Is What Happens When You Try To Take Off A Wrestler ’s Mask

I ’m no expert about Mexican lucha libre wrestling , but I do know this – you should never ever try to take a lucha libre wrestler ’s mask off his head .
Apparently nobody told this fan that rule , because he tried to remove a guy ’s mask and took quite a shot to the head as a result .

A few months ago , I wrote about creating a simple MP3 Player using wxPython ’s MediaCtrl widget .
Since then , a fellow released the MplayerCtrl , a wxPython widget that wraps mplayer , a popular cross- platform media player .
I actually ended up switching my MP3 Player ’s backend to use this new control , but that ’s a story for another post .
This article will just focus on creating a really simple Media Player that you can play movies with .
And you can do it all with Python !

Now , to create an instance of the MplayerCtrl , we need to call mpc.MplayerCtrl(self.panel , - 1 , mplayer ) and pass in the path to the mplayer .
To keep track of how much of the movie has played , we create a wx .
Slider .
We also use a slider for the volume control .
We use some of wx ’s generic button widgets to give us some easy - to - use bitmap buttons .
Finally , we create a timer that we ’ll use to update the playback slider ’s position .
To load a movie and start it playing , we create a menu item .
The build_btn , build_controls , and create_menu are helper methods that build our GUI .
You can figure those out for yourself .
We ’ll just look at a few of the mplayer - related methods .
In on_add_file , we open a FileDialog and let the user find a movie file on their PC .
Once they ’ve picked one out , we hack the path to the file slightly to make it more palatable to mplayer by replacing backslashes with forward slashes .
Then we call our MPlayerCtrl ’s LoadFile method to load the movie into mplayer and get it started .
We also start our timer and update the playback slider .
You can Pause or Stop the playback with the two buttons that call the appropriate methods .
The MplayerCtrl also exposes lots of other methods that we can use to get the length of the movie , get the bitrate , the codec , and more .
Check out the documentation to see what all you can accomplish .
Wrapping Up
As you can see , creating a simple media player in Python is really easy .
Getting the MplayerCtrl to play something takes about 5 minutes .
Adding the sliders and functions add 30 - 45 minutes ( depending on your skillz ) .
Feel free to add enhancements , like a playlist , a way to speed up or slow down the playback or get the frame to resize the movie so its aspect ratio is constant .
Note that sometimes mplayer does n’t want to kill the movie when you close the frame .
This is a bug which the author of the control is trying to figure out .
Anyway , have fun watching movies with Python !
Note : This code was tested with MplayerCtrl 0.1.2 and 0.2.4 , wxPython 2.8.10.1 , Python 2.5/2.6 on Windows XP and Windows 7 .
I used the mplayer rtm -svn -31170 version in my testing as well .

Google has finally pushed Android 2.2 Froyo to its otherwise abandoned Nexus One handset .
The update should either already be living on your phone , or be arriving over the air any time now .
One of the problems with Android is the scattering of different versions running on various devices .
Unlike Apple 's iOS machines , all of which have their upgrade cycle controlled by Apple itself , Android updates are in the hands of individual manufacturers or telcos who would rather you bought a new phone and signed a new contract to get the latest OS .
And while you 'd probably be foolish to buy a Nexus One now that you can have the Droid or any number of better phones , Googlephone owners who have n't already hacked their Nexuses can look forward to some goodies .
Best of these is probably the MiFi - like hotspot ability , which lets you share your cellular data connection over Wi-Fi .
Even if you do n't care about that , you 'll see a general speeding up of the whole OS , and the premature draining of your battery should you manage to get the browser 's Flash support to work .

Taxi - sharing ’s a nice idea but a ) it takes a village to make it truly cheap and b ) the city - run version has n’t made it across the bridge quite yet .
So , where to look next ?
The App Store ( obvs ) , for one of the latest necessary additions to your very existence .
This one ?
Weeels is the name , and livery cabs the game .
Weeels : “ Social Transit ” is a brand new free app for sharing livery cabs in NYC .
Livery cabs are privately - owned , fully - licensed cabs that exist in all corners of the city ( Weeels is partnering with Brooklyn ’s Eastern Car Service ) .
The app works like this :
You enter a destination into your phone , Weeels searches for another user traveling a similar route and it hooks the two of you up to share the ride .
If no one ’s going your way , you can still take the cab solo or cancel the trip altogether .
Like other ride - sharing services , it ’s a community , so you get to see your potential sharer ’s profile and you both have to approve the trip .
Here ’s the FAQ page for all the details on how things work ( safeguards , availability , etc ) .
Weeels has pre-negotiated rates with their providers , so fares are guaranteed to be consistent for a given route .
Here ’s our survey of what your BK cab ride should cost , without the share .
The app ’s geared toward areas where yellow cabs are lacking — mainly Brooklyn and lower Manhattan — but service is guaranteed anywhere in Brooklyn , Manhattan and Queens .
Staten island and The Bronx are iffy , the site says , and anywhere outside the city ‘s a no - no ( except for Newark Airport ) .
For now , Weeels is available only for Apple products , but its creators are working on versions for other mobile devices .
And they say a version for yellow cabs also is on the way .
We ’ll let you know about that one .

It is always a tendency in MRM forums to post stories about the horrendous amount of sexual discrimination in the legal system , both for women and against men .
I made a pledge to myself that I was not going to fill headlines with this stuff because , one , it ’s redundant - anyone who does n’t know the men get the hammer and women get the kit glove in criminal courts is living under a rock .
And two , it would be doubly redundant here .
In the right column I have created a “ Men in the News , ” section with links to relevant stories that fall into this category .
But Aset Magomadova is a different story .
In a stunning decision by the Court of Queens Bench Justice Sal LoVecchio , of Calgary , Alberta , murdering mom Magomadova was let off with probation after strangling the life out of her 14 year old daughter with one of her scarves .
That , in and of itself , is neither surprising or uncommon .
In our women - do n ’t - do - bad - things - unless - someone - makes - them world , women have grown accustomed to taking a walk while bodies are lowered into the ground .
We have become a culture , when it comes to women , that can find an excuse for the inexcusable quicker than you can drown five children in a bathtub in Houston and say Post Partum Depression .
The kicker to this one was delivered , as it often is , by the press that covered the story .
PostMedia News reporter Daryl Slade , reported in a Calgary Herald story posted at Canada.com that Magomadova was sentenced to three years probation with the condition that she take grief , depression and anger management counseling .
Translation :
Get through the grief of murdering your daughter and then learn how to manage your anger well enough not to kill some other child .
Secondary Translation :
We know what you did , but we are letting you off anyway .
Tertiary Translation :
If you kill anyone else , we will extend your probation .
Justice LoVecchio would disagree .
“ At first blush ( a suspended sentence ) may seem like a get - out - of - jail - free card .
It is not , ” he said .
Uh , yes it is , Sal , and even an incompetent political whore like you knows it .
Between the lines in the case - actually not between the lines unless you want them to be - are facts that defy the notorious lack of reason and sexual bigotry presiding at the western bench .
The knife that the accused alleged her daughter attacked her with did not have the daughters fingerprints on it .
That was apparently part of why the judge stuck down the woman ’s claim of self defense .
Also , the medical examiner in the case testified that it would have taken approximately two and a half minutes to cause death by strangulation in this manner .
Two and a half minutes .
How long is two and a half minutes when you have a scarf twisted around the neck of your child ?
Anger management ?
I ’ll damned well bet .
Now , it was noted in the case and the news story that the daughter , Aminat Magomadova , had a history of violence , including an assault of her teacher at school .
Any bets on where she learned that ?
This is just one more shameful case in which a woman snuffed the life out of another human being and it was reduced to a counseling matter by the legal system .
In a strange twist for sexual parity , it apparently did n’t matter that the victim was female , or a child .
Female killers have equal opportunity when it comes to their victims .
You ’ve come a long way , baby .
Yes , indeed .
David Axene was flat on his back in a hospital bed with a swollen left leg .
His kidneys had shut down .
His blood pressure had plunged .
Doctors pumped him with potent antibiotics to stave off a deadly infection .
Yet there he was sifting through spreadsheets on his laptop , cradling his cellphone to his ear , waving off doctors to finish another conference call .
California ’s top insurance watchdogs had hired Axene to scour Anthem Blue Cross ’ files for any flaw in the voluminous paperwork that accompanied its rate hikes of up to 39 % .
Anthem ’s plan to impose higher premiums March 1 had outraged consumers and politicians alike .
President Obama seized on the furor , criticizing Anthem ’s increases on national television as he tried to revive fading support for his healthcare overhaul .
California regulators were bound by law to accept the rates as long as Anthem could show that it used at least 70 cents of every dollar in premiums to pay medical claims .
In the past , Anthem ’s requests had sailed through with barely a peep from officials .
Not this time .
The outcry was too great to ignore .
That ’s where Axene came in .
The state looked to him for an impartial judgment .
The stakes had never been higher for the 60 - year - old actuary : Finding an error in Anthem ’s 70 - page rate proposal and reams of supporting documents would dent the image of California ’s largest for - profit insurer and possibly save consumers tens of millions of dollars .
He knew his work had to be flawless .
“ I was n’t going to let this illness stop me , ” he said .
*******
The son of an evangelical pastor , Axene grew up in Canada and Washington state , schooled from a young age on the importance of faith , love and hard work .
Blessed with a gift for numbers , he dreamed of becoming an aeronautical engineer .
But in the early 1970s , jobs were scarce in Seattle for college graduates with degrees in physics and applied mathematics .
At 21 , Axene found himself pumping gas .
Then a friend told him that Travelers Insurance Co. was hiring .
He applied for a sales position and bombed the interview , recalling the recruiter ’s stinging words : “ Axene , you could n’t sell your way out of a wet paper bag . ”
But the recruiter asked whether Axene had ever thought of becoming a health actuary — a mathematician who calculates insurance rates by evaluating life expectancies , medical histories and other risk factors .
Axene had never heard the term , but the interview launched him into a career with some of the nation ’s most influential accounting and actuarial firms , including Ernst & Young , where he supervised 45 actuaries and enjoyed a corner office with a sweeping view of San Diego Bay .
Ernst &
Young downsized seven years ago , leaving Axene , then 53 , out of work .
He decided to start his own business in his Temecula home and later moved to the nearby rural enclave of Winchester , where housing developments and horse ranches stretch over sun-dappled hills .
There , a small office behind his master bedroom serves as the corporate headquarters of Axene Health Partners .
He shares the bare - bones space — dubbed “ the Outhouse ” — with Tiffany , his office manager and daughter - in - law , and his son Josh , an actuary , while six other employees work from their homes in California and Oregon .
Axene likes it that way , surrounded by family in a tranquil place where he can wear shorts and deck shoes to work .
“ It ’s no luxury office , ” he said as his wife , Dawn , dropped by to offer a glass of iced tea .
******
Axene Health Partners is off the beaten path , but it was well known to senior managers from the California Department of Insurance as a top - flight actuarial firm with a reputation for deft work .
So when they wanted someone to double - check Anthem ’s numbers in mid-February , they called Axene , who personally took on the project and enlisted three of his staffers , including Josh .
Axene and his actuaries set about reviewing Anthem ’s proposal and more than 1,000 pages of internal documents and Excel spreadsheets filled with columns of numbers and formulas and equations — a mind - numbing mound of data that produced a stack of paper 18 inches high .
“ This was a brain stretcher , ” he said .
“ It may be the most intense project we ’ve ever worked on . ”
Axene relied not only on his math skills but also on a higher power :
He prayed for insight and wisdom each morning before launching into another round of numbers sleuthing , often drawing inspiration from a worn Bible he keeps in his office .
“ I ’m one of those crazy people who believes that God listens to our prayers , ” he said .
A month into the investigation , Axene came down with what he thought was the flu .
Tests turned up a blood infection that could have proved fatal .
He landed in a Wildomar emergency room and was soon undergoing surgery to drain the infection from his left knee .
He was weak and could n’t lift himself out of bed .
But he refused to back off from the Anthem investigation , logging 66 hours of work in the hospital the week after his surgery .
With an intravenous line in one hand and a cellphone in the other , he continued to sort through Anthem spreadsheets on his laptop that was propped on a portable table over his bed .
“ I was getting e-mails from him at 3 or 4 in the morning , ” said Josh , 29 .
Axene returned home two weeks after surgery , in late March , confined to a hospital bed that had been moved into his family room , just off the kitchen .
His Anthem team , including actuaries John Fritz and David Bohmfalk , gathered there to pore over charts and tables displayed on a big - screen television on the wall over the fireplace .
The four men spent 250 hours digging but found little out of order .
As they went deeper , however , they found a discrepancy .
The insurer had projected a 19 % increase in the cost of healthcare .
Studying Anthem ’s own data , Axene and his actuaries determined that costs would rise just 13 % .
They were puzzled by the difference .
“ When you ’re a numbers guy and things do n’t appear to be consistent , it annoys you , ” Axene said .
Axene ’s squad suspected that Anthem had miscalculated some of the inflationary factors that drive up rates , such as the age of policyholders .
Bohmfalk was assigned to look closer and spotted the first of several mistakes :
Anthem had double - counted the effect of aging .
“ It was sort of like finding the Holy Grail , ” Axene recalled .
“ It … opened up a big can of worms . ”
The actuaries determined that Anthem could reduce its average rate hike to 15 % from 25 % by correcting the error and a handful of other mistakes .
At the urging of regulators , Axene and his team reported their findings to Anthem and its corporate parent , Indianapolis - based WellPoint Inc .
The news stunned the companies .
“ We were genuinely surprised , ” WellPoint spokeswoman Kristin Binns said .
“ We immediately realized the mistake .
We understood how visible these rate increases were . ”
On the same day in late April that state regulators released Axene ’s findings , WellPoint canceled the 39 % rate hike .
It was a sobering moment for the economic titan , with 42,000 employees and $ 65 billion in annual revenue .
And it transformed
Axene into something of an accounting wizard — so impressive that even Anthem wanted to hire him .
“ We found a big one , ” Axene said of his firm ’s Anthem coup .
“ It is extremely satisfying . ”
By this time , Obama had signed the healthcare overhaul bill into law .
Democrats and Republicans alike singled out WellPoint ’s rate increases — repeatedly citing the 39 % figure — as a turning point in the contentious debate .
Anthem submitted new rates to the state last month , seeking an average increase of 14 % and a maximum of 20 % — about half what it had originally sought .
The tumult over its premiums has been good for Axene ’s business .
California Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner hired him to review the rate filings of Blue Shield of California and Aetna Inc. , which pulled back its plan last month after two separate reviews — its own and Axene ’s — found math errors .
Aetna has resubmitted new rates , and Axene is once again examining the files .
He ’s just been asked to conduct yet another review , this one of a Health Net Inc. filing .
Even as he plods through all that work , new clients are calling and resumes are piling up .
Axene is thinking of expanding his operation .
“ He slew the giant , ” said Anthony Wright , executive director of Health Access California , a consumer group in Sacramento .
“ It was David versus Goliath , except David was armed with a calculator rather than a slingshot . ”

WASILLA , Alaska —
Stepping quickly toward his big black Dodge Ram truck , Todd Palin offered a few highlights of the weekend ahead .
His youngest daughter , Piper , had a dance rehearsal .
His oldest son , Track , would be helping out on the sprawling new addition to the family property on Lucile Lake .
The toddlers , his son Trig and his grandson Tripp , would keep everyone on their feet .
And his wife would be home for the weekend .
“ Everybody , ” said Mr. Palin , smiling , the late Alaska light washing over him .
“ All together . ”
Sarah Palin ’s big new life is remarkable for its smallness .
She is as remote as she is overexposed .
Even as she travels the country stirring up Tea Party apostles , poking at opponents and building a robust bank account through speaking fees , book royalties and television contracts , she comes home to one of the more unlikely launching pads in politics — and she apparently will not be pulling up stakes anytime soon .
“ Where else would we go ? ” Mr. Palin said .
“ Alaska is our home . ”
Things have changed , of course .
Ms. Palin is often away , sometimes joined by her husband and some combination of their five children .
Her father , Chuck Heath , who lives in town , said in a recent interview that he had not seen her in a month .
While people say that Piper might turn up at Wasilla Bible Church with a cousin and that her parents attend community basketball games , sightings are far less frequent than they were when Ms. Palin was governor and friends from high school bumped into her at the Wal - Mart Supercenter .
Here ’s a comic that ’s not about how awful it is to be alive .
But it does have hypermammaried girls – so it ’s not totally out of character .

The sign was erected in the town of Mason City , Iowa , last week and has angered locals
A billboard advert in the US state of Iowa that linked President Obama to Adolf Hitler and Vladimir Lenin was removed on Wednesday morning .
The sign , which was funded by a group of local Tea Party activists , has been replaced with a community service announcement .
Text on the sign had read : " Radical leaders prey on the fearful & naive . "
The billboard had angered many in the local community , including other Tea Party activists .
A representative of the Iowa group called the billboard 's owner and requested the sign be removed on Tuesday evening .
A national Tea Party representative had called the controversial poster a waste of money , time and resources .
" It 's not going to help our cause .
It 's going to make people think that the Tea Party is full of a bunch of right - wing fringe people , and that 's not true , " Shelby Blakely , of the national Tea Party Patriots group , told the Associated Press agency .
" When you compare Obama to Hitler , that to me does a disservice to the Jews who both survived and died in the Holocaust and to the Germans who lived under Nazi regime rule , " Mr Blakely said .
A spokesperson for the 200 - person group that organised the billboard said it was intended to critique socialism , but admits that their message was overshadowed by the fascist images .
Tea Party condemned
On Tuesday , America 's largest civil rights group passed a resolution condemning the Tea Party for tolerating racism and bigotry .
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) has not released the language of the motion , but a spokesperson has said that it calls on Tea Party members to " repudiate the racist element and activities within the Tea Party " .
" We do n't have a problem with the Tea Party 's existence .
We have an issue with their acceptance and welcoming of white supremacists into their organisations , " said Ben Jealous , NAACP President .
Sarah Palin has responded to the resolution on her Facebook page .
" The charge that Tea Party Americans judge people by the colour of their skin is false , appalling , and is a regressive and diversionary tactic to change the subject at hand , " Mrs Palin wrote .
Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , Iran ’s president from 1989 - 97 , was at the top of the Iranian political establishment for three decades , his uncanny ability to manipulate politics to his own advantage undiminished .
But over the past year , as Iran went through its most serious political crisis since the 1979 revolution , his empire has declined , and now his enemies have been emboldened to strike a fatal political blow .
Rafsanjani has signalled his willingness to step aside from politics , thus avoiding public dismissal ; the language has been carefully worded to minimise his loss of face .
Rafsanjani ’s downfall was his inability to avoid a confrontation with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and supporters , after his disputed victory in last year ’s presidential election .
The purge of Rafsanjani has less to do with a clash of personalities and factional interests ; it signals a major re-alignment in Iranian politics , in which the role of factions is much diminished and the power of the state ascendant .
Rafsanjani has been among the most influential forces in Iranian politics , devoting his life to the revolution .
Before the expulsion of the shah in 1979 , he was a committed disciple of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and took extraordinary steps towards the fall of the monarchy .
He even participated in political violence , notably the assassination of the former prime minister , Hassan Ali Mansour , in 1965 .
After the revolution Rafsanjani was catapulted to the commanding heights of the Iranian government , serving as the speaker of the Majlis or National Assembly throughout the 1980s .
This gave him a vantage point to survey the complex political faultlines of post - revolutionary Iran , with its many shifting factions .
Besides his Machiavellian instincts , Rafsanjani ’s extraordinary political success came from his understanding of the Islamic Republic ’s lively political scene and his ability to intervene successfully in major political disputes .
By placing himself in the middle of warring political factions he was able to play mediator , taking the heat out of disputes – all the while strengthening his own position and that of his family .
The biggest dispute in the 1980s centred on a left - leaning government led by the then prime minister Mir Hossein Mousavi ( a leftwing nationalist ) and its rightwing detractors .
These were conservatives allied to the Bazaar , and more ideological conservatives belonging to such associations as the Hezbe Moetalefeyeh Eslami ( Islamic Coalition Party ) which , contrary to its name , was a loose political grouping that brought together some of the most influential , shadowy political players and kingmakers in the Islamic Republic .
A divided regime
As a stubbornly independent politician , Mousavi was also in a political fight with Seyed Ali Khamenei , Iran ’s president in the 1980s .
Although this dispute is now seen in the wider context of the left - right dichotomy , it was a personal dispute over constitutional powers ; both tried to invest more authority in the institutions which they represented .
This dispute was finally resolved in July 1989 , when an amendment to the constitution abolished the post of prime minister .
By acting as a peacemaker , Rafsanjani was able to emerge as the second most powerful man in the country , all the while appearing ever faithful to Ayatollah Khomeini .
But Rafsanjani ’s success was not limited to politics , for by the late 1980s critics and neutral observers alike agreed that the wily cleric had abused his position and privilege to amass a huge family fortune .
While the figures may have been exaggerated , Rafsanjani ’s extensive business empire before the revolution ( he dealt in pistachios and property ) gave credence to the accusations .
After Khomeini ’s death in June 1989 , Rafsanjani was elected president .
Meanwhile , Khamenei had been elected as the new Supreme Leader , the highest office in the land ( 1 ) .
This new arrangement has influenced all the major political developments that have taken place in Iran ever since .
The two men had much in common ; their political and ideological relationship stretched back to the early 1950s .
They were the most committed and competent disciples of Ayatollah Khomeini , so it made perfect sense that they were at the pinnacle of the post - revolutionary system .
But they were increasingly divided by political and ideological outlook , and by different leadership styles .
While Rafsanjani was happy to ride the tiger of clerical supremacy , he was careful to reach out to all the key constituents of society ; he appeared to hold the middle ground in politics , yet he was content to see the battles between left and right worsen .
Khamenei appealed to the grassroots of the revolution , embodying the hezbollahi spirit of the regime .
Khamenei to the fore
It was this difference in leadership styles that defined the dialectic of power in the Islamic Republic until the mid-1990s .
Even though Khamenei – in his capacity as the Supreme Leader – was the more powerful , he and his supporters appeared to be in opposition to a dominant Rafsanjani .
This perception of dominance – reinforced by greater cultural liberalisation following the austerity and piety of the 1980s – was resented and challenged by veterans of the 1980s Iran - Iraq war and by newly demobilised units of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps ( IRGC ) and its paramilitary wing , the Basij , most of whom gravitated towards Khamenei .
They looked like an opposition under pressure , but Khamenei and his inner circle were consolidating power behind the scenes , through the IRGC and other grassroots revolutionary institutions .
This covert political battle was suffused with personal symbolism , with Khamenei representing the ideology of the regime while Rafsanjani represented expediency .
All the while the bond between them was judged to be of unique importance to the future direction – indeed the survival – of the revolution .
Though sidelined from the 1990s on , Rafsanjani continued in a major role in politics , as a grandee of the establishment .
In hindsight , his fall began when he lost in the second round of the June 2005 presidential election to Ahmadinejad , a new force in Iranian politics .
The rise of Ahmadinejad represents the triumph of ideology over expediency .
But at a deeper level it signifies the collapse of factional politics – the way politics were managed for 30 years – and the formalisation of rifts within the revolutionary establishment .
Major political personalities – such as former prime minister Mousavi , ex-president Mohammad Khatami and ex-speaker of parliament Mehdi Karrubi – are new leaders of the opposition .
With the acute phase of the post-election crisis effectively over , Iranian politics is now moving towards more institutionalisation and the eventual formation of disciplined political parties .
This may seem fanciful considering the political repression .
But the maturation of the divisions long latent in the revolutionary body politic – and the aspirations of Iran ’s politically aware young – point to this trend .
The end of factional politics signals the end of Hashemi Rafsanjani , who accumulated political capital from unregulated rifts and disputes .
As the Iranian revolution moves toward its fifth decade , there seems to be no more room for the man who excelled in the art of being everything to everyone .
The next time you feel angry at a friend who has let you down , or grateful toward one whose generosity has surprised you , consider this : you may really be bargaining for better treatment from that person in the future .
According to a controversial new theory , our emotions have evolved as tools to manipulate others into cooperating with us .
Until now , most psychologists have viewed anger as a way to signal your displeasure when another person does you harm .
Similarly , gratitude has been seen as a signal of pleasure when someone does you a favour .
In both cases , emotions are seen as short - term reactions to an immediate benefit or cost .
But it ’s more cunning than that , says John Tooby , an evolutionary psychologist at the University of California , Santa Barbara .
Anger , he says , has as much to do with cooperation as with conflict , and emotions are used to coerce others into cooperating in the long term .
Tooby and his colleagues think that our anger or gratitude reflect our judgement of how much the other person is sacrificing enough for us – and whether they will continue to do so in future .
Advertisement
For instance , you might feel angry towards a friend who broke a dinner date to watch a TV programme , but not at one who did so to take his child to the hospital .
Tooby points out that the harm to you is the same in each case , but the first friend ’s behaviour indicates his low regard for your interests – triggering anger – while the second friend ’s does not .
Motivation matters
As another example , an unpublished study by Tooby ’s colleague Julian Lim found that 296 student volunteers were more willing to cooperate with an unseen partner when that partner had forgone a profit to give them money .
This gratitude was absent when the partner gave them the same amount of money not as a favour but to avoid paying a penalty , Lim reported last month at a meeting of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society in Eugene , Oregon .
All this suggests that anger and gratitude – and perhaps other emotions , too – may be tools for turning up a partner ’s mental cooperation control dial , says Tooby ’s colleague Aaron Sell .
You get angry not when someone hurts you , but when their actions betray a setting of their cooperation dial that is lower than you expect , and your anger is both a threat to turn down your own dial and an inducement to them to turn theirs up .
You show gratitude not when someone benefits you , but when their dial is set higher than you expect , and this signals that you plan to turn yours up in response .
Their hypothesis is not yet fleshed out , and the team still has to show that these emotional reactions really do tune the partner ’s cooperation control dial as they predict – but they say they have experiments in the pipeline which do just that .
Strength and beauty
Preliminary evidence is consistent with the idea , however .
Psychological tests of 281 university students revealed that those with a stronger sense of entitlement tended to be more anger - prone , as one would predict if they expected others to set their cooperation dials higher .
Stronger men and more attractive women were quicker to anger , too , Sell reported last year ( Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , DOI : 10.1073/pnas.0904312106 ) .
Although stronger men would n’t necessarily have any reason to expect better treatment in modern society , in the past they would have been desirable mates – as attractive women may still be – and so may have a stronger sense of entitlement .
And a wealth of evidence – some of it presented at last month ’s meeting , and some still unpublished – suggests that the cooperation control dial , or “ welfare trade - off ratio ” , is a real part of our mental make - up , says Tooby .
Others in the field remain unpersuaded .
“ Whether [ anger ] constitutes some form of negotiation is a just - so story , ” says Michael Lewis , a developmental psychologist at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick , New Jersey .
“ They certainly do n’t have any strong evidence to support that claim . ”
And beware of experiments using university students , warns Joe Henrich , an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver , Canada .
Tests have shown that North American university students are some of the least typical people on the planet , psychologically speaking : “ If you ’re going to build a theory of human nature , university students might be the worst population to use , ” he says .

ZHUKOVSKY , RUSSIA - Some military equipment rises to the level of celebrity — and in Russia , tanks immediately spring to mind .
At a military exposition held over the weekend at Zhukovsky , a town just outside of Moscow , some lesser - known vehicles from the current Russian arsenal were on display .
These trucks , missile launchers , communications systems and engineering vehicles are the real backbone of any modern land force .
Land battles are a priority here , thanks to Russia 's impossibly long land borders .
The country now upgrades Soviet designs and sells vehicles internationally for both financial and geopolitical gain .
While the electronics and sensors are often a little outdated , it 's easy to admire the brute strength and rugged design of Russian military vehicles .
Here are some of our favorites from the Engineering Technologies Forum in Zhukovsky , about 25 miles outside of Moscow .
1 ) IMR - 3M Obstacle - Clearing Vehicle
A vehicle built for heavy engineering in tough environments , it 's hard not to respect this road - clearing ( or - creating ) monster .
The two - man crew inside the vehicle can breach tree entanglements , blaze an 8 - mile trail in an hour and lift 2 tons with a telescoping arm that extends 10 yards .
It 's also prepared to survive a fight , with thick armor , masking smoke and a machine - gun turret .
Best of all , it 's mounted on the chassis of a T - 90 main battle tank .
It can also survive blasts from explosives — the plow can clear pressure and magnetic - fuse mines — making the vehicle an all - purpose brute .
2 ) 9A52 - 4 Multiple Launch Rocket System
One hero of Russian history is the Katyusha , a wheeled vehicle from World War II that rained rockets on German troops and tanks .
This modern version , a very lightweight rocket launcher mounted on a truck chassis , has a simple design but packs a wallop — the crew inside the cab fires 300 - mm rockets with warheads that include incendiary , fuel - air explosive , cluster munitions or antitank mines .
The one on display here features six reusable launch tubes , which can be reloaded by a separate vehicle , using a crane , within 8 minutes .
While the four - axle truck it 's mounted on is not ideal off - road driving , these systems are masters of the shoot - and - scoot ; by the time counterbattery fires rain down , they have driven away .
This air - transportable version of the popular Smerch rocket system was introduced in 2007 but still awaits an international customer .
( The previous , heavier versions are used by India , Algeria , Kuwait and others . )
3 ) Kasta 2E Radar
The Kasta is a great all - purpose radar system that can be used to track helicopters , cruise missiles and airplanes .
Set this up for remote operation , and you 've got a movable defense screen for virtually anything in the air or an air - traffic - control radar that can operate in any weather for up to 20 days .
The radar here can cover about 90 miles , depending on the height of the antenna it is mounted on , and can be set up for action in 20 minutes .
The Kasta is said to be resistant to enemy jamming .
A newer version of this radar is a popular item on the international market and guards Iranian nuclear sites .
The diesel engine fires up with a whine , and the old - school mechanical radar dishes spin , unlike newer electronic radar arrays .
4 ) 1V13 Artillery Fire Command Vehicle
Even the most modern artillery shell or missile is useless without knowing where targets are located .
This scrappy recon vehicle is made to operate , day or night , in the most miserable conditions possible to provide guidance to indirect fire coming from large and small formations , from the platoon to the battalion level .
The 1V13s are studded with radios , laser rangefinders , navigation equipment and an aiming circle that provides the angle needed to correctly place a round .
Once in position , the crew of six can set up to direct volleys of heavy fire within 15 minutes .
The low profile and telescoping antenna are meant to protect the crew members as they sneak into position .
The guys inside these things need to be close to the enemy to do their jobs — that takes bravery and good hardware , especially since they are favored targets of the enemies .
Like almost all Russian military equipment , the vehicle was designed during the Soviet era and has been sold internationally and sporadically upgraded .
5 ) 9A39 Launch / Reload Vehicle for the BUK M1 - 2
The BUK M1 - 2 Self - Propelled Launch System ( called the SA - 11 Gadfly by NATO ) is tailor - made to spot and destroy aircraft and inbound cruise missiles .
In this photo is an oft - forgotten part of the medium - range system — the reloader .
The crane , bent in the front , hoists missiles onto nearby Gadflys .
The system can't see for itself — it relies on other nearby vehicles carrying radar for targeting — but it can shoot and reload on its own .
The missiles are radar guided and can reach Mach 3 .
These vehicles are sold all over the world , including in Pakistan , Egypt , North Korea , Syria , China and ( arriving soon ) Venezuela .
6 ) MIK-MKS Mobile Communications System
It takes a half - hour for the 100 - foot mast of this vehicle to reach its full height .
But once it does , the MIK - MKS provides wireless broadband access for 200 users using the four antennas atop the mast .
Micran , the company that makes the system in the Siberian city of Tomsk , can tailor it for a variety of other communications uses , but the main purpose of the system is for a single vehicle to connect a slew of dispersed units .
It 's designed to be hardened against jamming interference from enemies and rough conditions of Mother Nature , especially high winds .
7 ) Pneumatic Dummies
Okay , these are n't vehicles , but they 've fooled us before .
These cheap decoys made by Rusbal , a balloon manufacturer near Moscow , are intended to fool satellites and aircraft by adopting the shape , color , thermal signature ( by using heaters ) and radar returns of things that would make a juicy target for an airstrike .
At the arms show , the company chose to inflate an S - 300 antiaircraft missile launcher , the system that Iran is so eager to set up to thwart an Israeli attack on its nuclear facilities , if Russia will ever deliver them .
Imagine they do so , with a crate of decoys thrown in .
The company catalog includes aircraft , vehicles , hangars , radar arrays and forward operating bases .
American military intelligence has been fooled by decoys before — notably by the Serbs , who protected their air force by setting up a fleet of faux targets .
Nothing means tactical deception like launching a $ 600,000 cruise missile against a cheap balloon .

( Natural News ) The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation continues to throw its support behind risky genetically modified ( GM ) seeds as a means for feeding hungry Africans , ignoring safer and more reliable technologies that already exist .
Not long after publicly blaming GM critics for prolonging hunger in Africa , Gates announced that his foundation is partnering with DuPont subsidiary Pioneer Hi-Bred to develop higher yield GM strains of corn .
Two years ago , the Gates Foundation also partnered with Monsanto to develop drought - tolerant GM corn .
The companies claim that these GM seeds will be delivered to small farmers free of charge .
Yet Monsanto says its drought - tolerant corn will not be ready until 2012 , at which point it will be introduced into the commercial market .
It will not be made available to poor African farmers until 2016 .
Pioneer is using conventional ( non - GM ) breeding techniques to produce higher yielding corn by 2014 .
There is no projected date for when a GM version of this new strain will be developed .
" It 's hard not to think that Monsanto , Dupont and their ilk are turning into the Bernie Madoff of agriculture , " writes " Grist " blogger Tom Laskawy .
" Convince gullible foundations along with the federal government to send billions in research dollars their way based on a promise of magically awesome results .
Sometime down the road , of course .
" As Laskawy notes , the Nigeria National Variety Release Committee has already developed -- without the use of biotechnology -- various new corn strains that are resistant to drought , pests , disease , and poor soil fertility .
These conventionally bred seeds do not pose any of the well - documented risks of GM crops , such as toxic health and environmental effects ; the production of " super- weeds " and contamination of organic crops through cross-pollination ; increased pesticide use ; or encouraging monocultures and a loss of seed diversity .
"
If only Bill Gates , not to mention USDA Chief Tom Vilsack or Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , would spend some of their money getting those Nigerian seeds into farmers ' hands today , " Laskawy writes .
" Instead , they 'd prefer to funnel billions of dollars to biotech giants because , well , 2016 is n't really so long to wait .

Zip to Niagara and GO Biking !
Metrolinx is n’t household brand - name ( yet ! ) , much less one that ’s synonymous with casual weekend getaways and bicycle touring excursions .
However , through it ’s operational GO Transit division , which is indeed very well known to all Commuters here in Southern Ontario , Metrolinx has provided the GO trains with a big push to surpass their trusted role as the mover of work - a- day Ontarians , and break away from the commuting pack into a much more leisurely and adventurous class of rail travel .
The best part of this service expansion is that it wo n’t just enthuse Sightseers , but it ’s also purposely geared towards the pleasure of Cyclists as well , with the provision of specially equipped trains to carry bikes down to expansive scenery that surrounds Niagara Falls !
After last Summers successful inauguration of ZIP train service into the Niagara Region , GO Transit hopes to augment last years total of over 50,000 weekend passengers by adding an additional trip on Friday evenings to facilitate longer weekend getaways both to The Falls , as well as offering a quick weekend train trip in the opposite direction back into Toronto from the Peninsula .
From May 21 to September 26 passengers can not only avoid all traffic , and effortlessly get to the magnificent sights , routes , and attractions of the area in about 2 hours , but new for this season , they can also take their bikes along to tour The Falls and Vineyards of this famous wine - growing area as well at no extra charge !
As such , you might be very surprised by the easy options that this service opens up to even the most average Cycling enthusiast …
The train station is about a 10 minute ride up to the Falls , and also offers quick access to the scenic route back down the Niagara River to the many Theater attractions offered at Niagara - on - the - Lake .
What ’s more anybody who ’s ever wanted to ride their bike into the States can now do this with nothing more than their passport and some spending loot , and the clothes on their back …
At the very least .
GO to GoTransit.com / Zip for fares & schedules
These “ Zip Away ” trains to to Niagara Falls , can all carry 4 bikes per car , and on Saturdays , Sundays and Holidays they ’ll also be specially equipped with 2 designated bike coaches per train that can carry up to 18 bikes each !
So there ’s no shortage of options to carry bicycles down to the Falls as part of your regular GO Train fare , and buses are also equipped with racks during the off - season .
While we wait to see what types of special cross-promotional offers that we can expect to take advantage of this year , you might also want to consider some of the other very ambitious plans and projects that Metrolinx is working on to better integrate Mass Transit into the daily lives of all travelers in Southern Ontario …

My op - ed in this week 's Hill Times ( HT version ( sub req ) , homepage version ) notes that with reports that a new copyright bill could be introduced this week , thousands of Canadians have been expressing concern with the government 's plans , as there are mounting fears that the results from last summer 's copyright consultation may be shelved in favour of a repeat of the much - criticized Bill C - 61 .
The foundational principle behind C - 61 was the primacy of digital locks .
When a digital lock ( often referred to as digital rights management or technological protection measure ) is used – to control copying , access or stifle competition – the lock supersedes virtually all other rights .
The fight over the issue has pitted the tech - savvy Industry Minister Tony Clement , who has reportedly argued for a flexible implementation , against Canadian Heritage Minister James Moore , who has adopted what many view as an out - of - touch approach that would bring back the digital lock provisions virtually unchanged .
Moore has declined to comment on his position , but his approach raises some difficult questions :
1. Moore has been an outspoken critic of the extension of the private copying levy to iPods , deriding it as the iTax .
He is content to leave the levy on blank CDs in place , yet the forthcoming bill is likely to block personal copying of consumer purchased CDs that contain copy - controls onto blank CDs .
Why does Moore believe it is acceptable for Canadians to pay twice – once for the CD and a second time for the levy on a blank CD – and still face the prospect of violating the law ?
2. Thousands of Canadians buy DVDs from outside the country as they seek content not typically available at home .
Yet DVDs purchased in Europe , Asia , or South America do not work on Canadian DVD players .
The forthcoming bill is likely to block attempts to circumvent the region coding on DVDs and thereby stop Canadians from legally viewing DVDs they have purchased .
Is this consistent with Moore 's pro-consumer position in other areas ?
3 . Documentary film makers and visual artists often use small clips from DVDs in their art .
The use of those works without permission is currently permitted through the criticism and review sections of the fair dealing provision in the Copyright Act .
The forthcoming bill is likely to block unlocking a DVD to use such clips , however , since the presence of a digital lock will trump fair dealing .
In fact , even the much - discussed potential introduction of new artists ' exceptions for parody and satire would be limited by locks .
What is Moore 's plan to allow Canadian creators to complete their art ?
4 . The Canadian media regularly rely on the news reporting section of the fair dealing provision to use portions of audio or video without permission .
The forthcoming bill is likely to render such activities violations of the law anytime a digital lock guards the audio or video .
Does Moore believe this strikes a fair balance between copyright and freedom of the press ?
5 . With the emergence of the Amazon Kindle and Apple iPad , Canadian teachers and students are facing increasing pressure to switch to electronic books .
E - books offer great potential , but also frequently come with restrictive digital locks that have been used to remotely delete content from users ' devices in their own homes .
Given the importance of the research and private study sections in the fair dealing provision , is Moore satisfied with an approach that would hamper the use of those sections for a critical part of the education process ?
6 . The new copyright bill is likely to reintroduce new exceptions that legalize recording television shows ( time shifting ) or moving purchased content from one format to another ( format shifting ) .
While consumers will undoubtedly welcome these long overdue reforms , they will likely be contingent on the absence of any digital locks .
Does Moore fear the new rights will be regularly blocked by anti-copying technologies ?
7 . Is Moore aware that the solution to all of these concerns is a single provision that would allow Canada to implement the World Intellectual Property Organization 's Internet treaties , provide legal protection for digital locks , and preserve the copyright balance by simply confirming that circumvention of a digital lock is not prohibited when undertaken for lawful purposes ?
Four Liberal Democrat
MPs have expressed their unease about the budget by demanding a vote tomorrow night on a proposal for the Treasury to investigate the impact of the VAT increase on poor families .
They have tabled an amendment to the budget resolutions saying that the Treasury should carry out an assessment of the impact of the new 20 % VAT rate " on business , charities and households across the income and age groups " and that the findings should be reported to parliament .
The amendment is not likely to be put to the vote .
But that fact that it is on the order paper shows some Lib Dem MPs are not convinced by the claims that have been made about the budget being progressive .
Andrew George , the St Ives MP who tabled the amendment , said that he hoped that Danny Alexander , the chief secretary to the Treasury , would agree to commission a report on the impact of the budget .
Government sources have indicated that this is unlikely , but the Lib Dem backbenchers will get another chance to raise the issue when MPs debate the finance bill later in this session of parliament .
The budget is seen as the first test of the strength of the coalition between the Lib Dems and the Tories and ministers were alarmed last week when Simon Hughes , the deputy leader of the Lib Dems , suggested that the Lib Dems would amend the finance bill to make it fairer .
He subsequently retracted his comment .
But Bob Russell , the Lib Dem MP for Colchester and one of the four MPs who has signed the George amendment , yesterday refused to rule out voting against the government on this issue .
" I 'm not ruling anything in or anything out , " said Russell , who has been the Lib Dem MP most critical of the budget .
" The only thing that I 'm ruling in is a desire to eliminate child poverty in the UK . "
George Osborne , the chancellor , insisted last week that his budget was progressive , and that the rich would pay more proportionally .
But the Institute for Fiscal Studies and others have said that , when you take out the impact of measures already proposed by Labour and when you include the impact of public spending cuts , the poor will be hit the most .
Today two opinion polls – YouGov for the Sunday Times and ICM for the Sunday Telegraph – put the Lib Dems on just 16 % , compared to the 23 % they got at the general election .
Their support seems to have gone down since the budget , suggesting that coalition 's decision to raise VAT may have damaged the party that campaigned aggressively against a VAT increase at the election .
BBC News has learnt that the Government has spent tens of thousands of pounds developing iPhone applications .
A Freedom of Information ( FOI ) request revealed that development costs ranged from £ 10,000 - £ 40,000 .
These included a travel advice app from the Foreign Office and a jobseekers ' tool .
But the Home Office declined the FOI request for information on its iPhone apps , saying security concerns " prevent us from supplying information " .
The information comes just a few weeks after the government announced it was to conduct a review of all 820 of its websites .
A report by the Central Office of Information has revealed that the government spent £ 94 m on website development and running costs and £ 32 m on web staff in 2009 - 2010 .
The most expensive application was a proposed Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency ( DVLA ) app that provides " a masterclass for changing your wheel " .
Documents seen by the BBC reveal that the DVLA Motoring Masterclass app would cost £ 40,000 and would also work out fuel mileage , act as a hazard light and track RAC patrols .
A spokesman for the DVLA told BBC News :
" We want to make it as easy as possible for motorists to renew their car tax , tell us about a change of address or update their driving licence , meaning they stay safe and legal to drive .
Gov iPhone apps and costs NHS Drinks Tracker £ 10,000
NHS Quit Smoking £ 10,000
Jobcentre Plus £ 32,775
DVLA Masterclass £ 40,000
" This would also bring benefits for DVLA , for example by reducing the number of reminders that need to be sent out .
" We considered how an application could help with this but no final decisions have been taken and the app , for now , is still in development , " he added .
It is not known how much of the total £ 40,000 budget has been spent or how far the app is from completion .
At present , the spokesman said , further development is " on hold " .
Underemployed
By the end of May there were over 53,000 downloads of the Jobcentre Plus app , although critics have asked why someone who can afford both an iPhone and the expensive running costs would need a Jobcentre Plus app .
There are also reports that it will not work with Apple 's new iOS4 , which Mark Wallace , campaign director for the Tax Payers '
Alliance , found a little ironic .
Is this really a great use of scarce government cash ?
Rory Cellan- Jones , Technology Correspondent Read Rory Cellan - Jones 's blog
" It seems many Government bodies have given in to the temptation to spend money on fashionable gimmicks at a time when they are meant to be cutting back on self - indulgent wastes of money " , he told BBC News .
" It is ridiculous not only that they are commissioning these apps but that some of them are supposedly secret on grounds of national security .
" Someone who is faced with losing their home because of high tax bills , or whose life is being ruined by crime is n't going to get any reassurance from knowing there 's an app for that , " he added
However , a number of government departments said they had no plans to develop iPhone applications , including the Department for Culture .
Media and Sport , HM Treasury , Northern Ireland Office , Scotland Office , Government Equalities Office , Ministry of Justice , the Cabinet Office and the Department for International Development .
A statement by the Cabinet Office to BBC News said : " The government recently announced a freeze on all marketing and advertising spend for this year and this includes iPhone applications .
" Future spend on iPhone development will be subject to strict controls : only essential activity , approved by the Efficiency and Reform Group , which is chaired by the Minister for the Cabinet Office and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury , will be allowed " .
Nicholas Kristof is in Palestine , though like all mass media journalists he calls it " the West Bank . "
He has just discovered that many Palestinians are resisting the Israeli occupation nonviolently , though scholars of nonviolence started writing about the Palestinian resistance over 20 years ago .
So Kristof is " waiting for Gandhi , " as the title of his latest New York Times column puts it , or at least a " Palestinian version of Martin Luther King Jr . "
Perhaps I should not be so cynical .
Kristof has gained fame as a crusader for human rights , especially women 's rights .
Now he 's taking a real risk by advocating for Palestinian rights and praising Palestinian resistance .
Any hint of Israeli wrong - doing has undone many U.S. liberals in the past .
And Kristof is giving more than a hint .
His previous column detailed Israeli settler violence against Palestinians and clearly sympathized with their plight .
He praised the work of Rabbis for Human Rights as " courageous and effective voices on behalf of oppressed Palestinians . "
Kristof himself deserves praise for placing the Palestinians alongside all the other victims of oppression he has written about so eloquently .
He 's moving the mass media one more tiny step toward more honest and balanced reporting on the Israel / Palestine conflict .
But if a writer is not careful , every step forward can also be a step backward .
By calling for a Palestinian Gandhi , Kristof clearly suggests that Palestinian resistance so far has fallen short of his high moral standards .
He complains that " many Palestinians define ‘ nonviolence ' to include stone - throwing , " so even when they claim to eschew violence their protests " are n't truly nonviolent . "
That reinforces a self - serving stereotype we 've been hearing from supporters of Israeli policy for decades :
We Jews want peace , they say .
We 've even got an organized peace movement .
But there 's no Palestinian equivalent .
It seems like those Palestinians are all a bunch hot - heads , implacably bent on violence .
How can we make peace with them ?
That kind of stereotyping spurs even more extreme views that are all too familiar :
There 's " no partner for peace " on the Palestinian side .
" Those people " are so steeped in violence , there 's no reasoning with them .
They only understand one thing : force .
And at their worst they ask :
What else can you expect from Muslims ?
I 'm sure Nick Kristof did n't mean to promote that kind of simplistic anti-Palestinian prejudice .
He sees good guys and bad guys on both sides .
But when you are a top columnist for the nation 's top newspaper , you are supposed to be smart enough to understand the implications of your words , to know what people can ( and some inevitably will ) read between the lines .
I do n't know Kristof , so I can't say why he might have fallen into this trap .
But I know the U.S. mass media coverage of the issue pretty well .
Even when they begin to break out of their reflexive " pro-Israel " shell , mass media journalists are still plagued by lines of thinking that are so old , so deeply ingrained , that they go unnoticed .
" Ain't it a shame those Palestinians are so violent .
If only they 'd turn to more peaceful ways , all would be well , " is perhaps the oldest and deepest of those lines .
So it 's not surprising that , even when a prominent columnist appeals for sympathy for the victims of oppression , he ends up indirectly but all too obviously blaming the victims .
Palestinians might well ask , " Who the hell is Nicholas Kristof to tell us how to resist the occupation anyway ? "
That 's a good question .
What can he really know about their situation after being with them for a day or two ?
Critics of American journalism have long noted the declining quality of our news from other countries .
The main culprit , many say , is the ignorance of journalists who show up in a place for a few days or even a few weeks and write for the folks back home as if they were experts .
At a deeper level , there 's the ever - present tendency among the stenographers of imperial power to assume that they 've got the right to preach truth to " the natives " and tell them how to live their lives .
Even if Kristof had been living in Palestine for years , though , the question would still remain :
Does he , or any non-Palestinian , have the right to tell an oppressed people how to resist their oppression ?
Maybe they do , if they 've joined the resistance and taken all the risks involved for a long enough time to earn that right .
But neither Kristof nor most any of the other non-Palestinians who call for a Palestinian Gandhi fit that description .
I 've been teaching and writing about , and advocating nonviolence for a long time .
From the beginning , I felt in my gut that I do n't have the right to tell oppressed people to keep their resistance nonviolent , since I have n't shared in their suffering .
Eventually , I found in Gandhi's own writings a powerful theoretical argument to explain my gut feeling .
It starts with the heart of Gandhi 's teachings .
He would have rejected the premise of Kristof 's column : that nonviolence is a smarter tactic for the Palestinians , the best way to get what they want .
For Gandhi , nonviolence was never a tactic or a way to win anything .
It was a way -- the only way , he insisted -- to act out moral truth in daily life .
The core principle of Gandhian nonviolence is to do the right thing in every situation , regardless how painful or even lethal the consequences .
In other words , nonviolence is not about figuring out how to make the other side -- even when they are brutal oppressors -- change their ways .
It 's not about making others change their ways at all .
Gandhi said that such efforts are senseless , because we cannot control the choices of others .
All we can control is our own choices , trying to make sure that they are as morally correct as possible .
So telling other people what to do , how to live their lives , or even how to resist oppression simply does n't fit Gandhi 's vision of nonviolence .
It 's only about changing our own ways .
But when Gandhi spoke about controlling our own choices , he included in " our " not just himself as an individual but his people .
That 's why , in the vast corpus of Gandhi 's writings , you 'll sometimes find indictments of British colonialism and insistence that the British must leave India -- in effect , telling the other side what to do -- but far more often you 'll find indictments of Gandhi's own Indian people and insistence that they ( Gandhi said " we " ) stop cooperating with oppression .
If you 're looking for another Gandhi , then , look for someone who addresses his own people 's policy choices rather than telling others about what they 're doing wrong and how to fix it .
Kristof made a nod in that direction when he repeated the words of Palestinian nonviolence advocates like Moustafa Barghouthi , Ayad Morrar , and Iltezam Morrar .
He could have found plenty of others .
They 've got the right to call for a Palestinian Gandhi , since they are talking to their own people .
The only thing Nick Kristof has the right to do -- and the obligation , Gandhi would have added -- is to address his own American people about the choices that Americans are making .
If any Americans are publicly waiting for the next Gandhi to appear , they should be waiting and hoping for him or her not in Palestine or any foreign country , but right here in the U.S. of A .
Kristof , given his immense readership and influence , has a special responsibility .
Rather than flying half - way around the world for a few days and lamenting his failure to find another Gandhi , he could be doing what Gandhi did : writing about America 's failure to stand on the side of justice , which is the only way to stand on the side of peace .
As Gershon Baskin , Israel 's leading expert on conflict resolution , recently wrote , the U.S. must play a central role if Israel and Palestine are to forge a just peace settlement .
The two parties mistrust each other so deeply that they need a truly even - handed third party to bring them together and guarantee adherence to a peace agreement .
Though the Obama administration has moved a bit closer than its predecessors to an even - handed approach , it is still far from the genuine neutrality that the Palestinians must see if they are to come to any negotiating table .
Foolish steps like bolstering Israel 's nuclear arsenal are bound to move Israel and Palestine away from the peace that both sides need so badly .
For the sake of that peace , it 's we Americans , not the Palestinians , who need to take up the torch of nonviolence .
Until we do , it seems hypocritical to be blaming Palestinians for failing to live up to Gandhian standards .
But that does not mean we should sit around " waiting for Gandhi . "
The Mahatma surely would have scolded Nick Kristof and all of us who waiting for some extraordinary charismatic leader to rescue us from our wars and injustice .
It 's easier to wait for someone else to do the job than to heed the charge Gandhi famously left us :
Be the change you want to see in the world .
We Americans have already had our Gandhi .
And while we elevated him to the status of a heroic King , most of us conveniently forgot the most difficult parts of his message , his call to recognize our own nation as the greatest purveyor of violence in the world and to practice nonviolence no matter what the consequences .
Now , instead of waiting for another miraculously gifted leader , we should each be speaking out and acting up , doing whatever little bit we can .
We may not see the greatness of a Gandhi or King again for a very long time .
But that 's no reason to give up the quest for nonviolent resolution of our problems .
It 's all the more reason for each of us to take responsibility for ourselves and our own people , to stop telling others what they should do and start , right now , changing what we do .
Meanwhile , when oppressed , militarily occupied people resist , let 's recognize that it 's not our place to tell them what means they should or should not use -- and certainly not when our own nation is contributing so much to their oppression .

Decorate Responsibly ® .
The Latin phrase “ graviora delicta ” translates into English as “ exceptionally serious crimes . ”
On Thursday , July 15 , the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , the Vatican council that Pope Benedict XVI headed while he was still Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , issued Modifications Made In The Normae De Gravioribus Delictis .
I have been trying , without much success , to wrap my brain around it .
The main emphasis of the document is the revision of Church procedure and policy on the treatment of pedophile priests , an issue that just will not go away or show signs of improving .
The statute of limitations has been doubled , to 20 years from 10 .
Also , the priest can be defrocked without a Church trial .
On the other hand , the document does not mandate the criminal prosecution of pedophiles or the punishment of bishops who cover up the crimes .
The document added pedophilia ( or , in the words of the Church , “ the delict against the sixth commandment of the Decalogue committed by a cleric with a minor below the age of eighteen years ” ( the Catholic version of the Sixth Commandment is , “ You shall not commit adultery ” ) , in 2001 , to other serious crimes , such as apostasy , heresy , and profaning the Eucharist .
Oh , and ordaining women .
That ’s where I ’m having some difficulty with the brain - yoga .
I ’ve got a couple of possible explanations , and lots of questions , none of which are comforting or particularly satisfying .
The Rev. Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman , emphasized the changes to the pedophilia policies , the “ long journey ” of reform , and the need to respect “ the civil laws of their respective countries ” ( including countries such as India , where a priest accused of abusing young girls in the US fled home to and took a job in a local parish ) .
Fr. John Zuhlsdorf , in a Washington Post blog , “ The logic of Vatican ’s linking sex abuse , women ’s ordination , ” explains that “ no one in the Vatican is saying that the attempted ordination of women does the same kind of damage as the horrific harm sexual abuse inflicts on a minor or a person who is vulnerable . ”
Instead , he explains , the document is about clarifying church court authority and procedure .
Some of Fr. Zulsdorf ’s readers believe that ordaining women is worse that pedophilia .
True , Article 5 does state , “ The more grave delict of the attempted sacred ordination of a woman is also reserved to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith . . . . ”
But it goes on to say , “ both the one who attempts to confer sacred ordination on a woman , and she who attempts to receive sacred ordination . ”
Not much about tribunals or courts there .
Now , here ’s where I ’m having more difficulty again : “ If the one attempting to confer sacred ordination , or the woman who attempts to receive sacred ordination , is a member of the Christian faithful subject to the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches .
. . , he or she is to be punished by major excommunication reserved to the Apostolic See . ”
It begs the question – are women who are not subject to the Congregation condemned by this statement ?
Is the implication that ANY woman , ordained in any faith , has committed an “ exceptionally serious crime ? ” I do n’t know and I have not seen this addressed , yet .
Certainly women like the three female Catholic priests in St. Louis are covered by the edict .
But what about others ?
What about Kathleen , Tamara , Patty , and Sharon , all female clergy that I have known .
In no way do I feel that these women are anything but inspired and answering the call they heard in their lives .
Assuming that the answer is yes and that the inclusion of women ’s ordination is deliberate ( I doubt that it was by accident ) :
1 ) The statement is a message to Catholics , sisters , and clergy that there are dire consequences coming for being involved with actual ordinations or groups like FutureChurch or The Women ’s Ordination Conference .
It may especially be a warning to US nuns who are already under investigation .
2 ) It may be a message to members of the laity who are influenced by statements from the Vatican that , yes , indeed , ordaining women is equivalent to pedophilia .
This may carry special weight in countries where church authority figures still carry a lot of weight and women are still in more subservient positions .
3 ) It may be a message to more liberal US Catholics : “ Watch what you ask for !
Ordaining women is just as bad as what you believe it will solve : pedophilia . ”
Maybe we ’re all reading too much into it .
Maybe it is just a work in progress and we ’ll have to wait and see what the result of the reforms is .
I do n’t know – but it ’s unsettling .
Twins that prove a baby can survive at 23 weeks
Together they weighed about the same as a bag of sugar and could fit snugly into each of their father 's palms .
Amelia Hope Burden and her brother Arthur are the youngest premature twins to survive in the UK .
One was even born before the 24 - week legal limit for abortion .
Even small equipment dwarfs Arthur as mother Amanda Staplehurst and father Lee Burdon look on , while , below , tiny fighter Amelia Hope is pictured three days after she was born , weighing a mere 1lb 2oz
Amelia
Hope came into the world ten days before her brother , when their mother was 23 weeks and two days pregnant .
The twins are being hailed as medical marvels , and their birth is expected to bolster the campaign to lower the abortion limit to 20 weeks .
Doctors are under no legal obligation to try to save a baby born younger than 24 weeks , unless they believe it is in the child 's best interest .
And thankfully that was the case when mother Amanda Staplehurst gave birth at the end of last month .
The investment banker , 30 , went to hospital with stomach pain and was amazed to be told she was in labour .
Amelia
Hope showed no signs of life when she was born , but doctors managed to revive her .
' Doctors said she had just a 10 per cent chance of survival .
And we never thought she 'd pull through , ' said Miss Staplehurst .
Twins :
Their proud parents hope that soon Amelia Hope and Arthur will be put together in the same incubator
' Then , having delivered Amelia Hope , it was totally bizarre that for ten days I remained pregnant with Arthur .
The doctors have told us they 've never come across a case like it . '
Amelia
Hope weighed just 1lb 2 oz while her brother , Arthur , was 1lb 4oz when he arrived at just over 24 weeks in July .
Describing the moment she realised she was in labour , Miss Staplehurst said : ' I went to my local hospital as a precaution as I had cramping pains but as it was so early in my pregnancy I just thought I had a stomach bug .
' However , doctors said I was in full labour .
There was nothing anyone could do to stop it and two hours later I delivered Amelia Hope .
' Seeing Amelia Hope whisked away by medical staff was incredibly traumatic .
After all , she was born before the abortion limit and appeared to be dead .
But thank goodness , despite this , doctors decided to revive her . '
Amanda at the Queen Alexandra Hospital while she was still carrying Arthur , but had given birth to Amelia Hope , who is in the incubator
Miss Staplehurst , from Bournemouth and her fiancé Lee Burden , 35 , a social worker , were transferred to a specialist unit in Portsmouth .
Arthur , who was breech , was born by caesarean section and the twins are now being cared for in side - by - side incubators .
Miss Staplehurst said : ' Amelia Hope was so small , even Lee 's hand looked big next to her .
Poll Should the abortion limit be lowered to 20 weeks ?
Yes No Should the abortion limit be lowered to 20 weeks ?
Yes 8865 votes
No 3402 votes
Now share your opinion
She could literally fit comfortably into the palm of his hand when she was born .
But in just a fortnight she has already put weight on .
' The pair of them seem to stretch together .
Nurses have said hopefully in the next couple of weeks they can share an incubator for a few hours a day .
That way they can cuddle up to one another as they did in the womb . '
Premature babies are more likely to be stillborn , and one in three born before 33 weeks suffers from a disability such as blindness and deafness or develops learning difficulties .
The previous UK record for surviving premature twins was 24 weeks while the world 's most premature baby was born at less than 22 weeks .

Uh Oh :
I think that the Supreme Court has really made their decision on this , they found that we have a First Amendment right across the board that was violated by the McCain - Feingold Act .
And that ’s what they threw out , was those violations .
The McCain - Feingold
Act is still in place .
The DISCLOSE Act is still in place .
It ’s just that certain provisions within that they found to be definitely violating the First Amendment .
If we did n’t have the DISCLOSE
Act there would be a lot of different things that people would n’t be able to find out .

' I'll Burn the Goddamn House Down , But Blow Me First ' : Mel Gibson Gets Creative in His Latest Rant

Kagan 's story was this : Harvard always allowed students and military recruiters " full access " to each other .
The law school had followed the university 's anti-discrimination policy by channeling military recruiters through the law schools ' veterans groups rather than the normal Career Services Office .
The Law School believed they were complying with the Solomon Amendment , but when the Department of Defense disagreed , the military was placed back under Career Services .
When the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ( centered in Philadelphia ) struck down the Solomon Amendment , Harvard returned to its previous , veterans - group - recruiting - only policy .
During that year , the number of students joining the military went up , not down .
When the DoD protested again , she and Summers together agreed to put the military back under Career Services .
Further , Kagan testified , " I respect and indeed I revere the military .
My father was a veteran .
One of the great privileges of my time at the law school was working with the wonderful students we had who were going to go into the military .
. . . "
Sessions , a former federal prosecutor , did a full Hamilton Burger , cutting off Kagan 's answers , his voice raised : " That 's not the question . "
Admonished by Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , he persisted until his time was up -- then tried to press on afterwards .
In a hall press conference during recess , he hinted that Kagan was a liar : " When my examination ended , I felt less confident than before , " he said .
" I feel that she was not rigorously accurate . "
Sessions 's was the only sustained attack so far .
It seems likely to become the far - right radio attack on Kagan .
It will energize some part of the Republican base .
By the time Kagan has finished her explanation and produced her supporting witnesses , however , it 's unlikely to fly with anyone who watched the hearings .
When I say that Kagan is good on television , I am not speaking reductively .
Her performance so far has not been a triumph of a glib talking head .
Her testimony has combined confidence , intelligence , poise , and superb preparation , and certainly given TV viewers a reason to think her qualified for the court .
I would be stunned if her public support did not spike after today 's hearing .
Senators might do well to use caution in taking her on .
She has been ready for them .
Kyl , for example , tried to grill her about a memo she wrote to Justice Marshall during her clerkship .
" For once , " she wrote , " the ( Solicitor General 's ) office is on the side of the angels . "
Surely that showed an anti-government bias ?
Was Reagan solicitor general , Charles Fried , in office at the time ?
Kagan asked .
Yes , Kyl said .
She looked over her shoulder .
There was Fried himself , like Marshall McLuhan in Woody Allen 's Annie Hall , sitting in the guest section to support her nomination .
" Sorry , Charles , " she said .
Hearings are slated to run through Friday , but funeral services for Sen. Robert Byrd are set for Friday afternoon .
They might provide senators a chance to declare victory and withdraw .
On the first day of the hearings , Hatch told Kagan , " Something tells me this is likely to be your last confirmation hearing . "
If I were a senator , I 'd vote for her confirmation to make sure I never had to share the small screen with Elena Kagan again .

#
# In the game there are a total of 54 cards of five types :
#
# 14 cards with three bananas on them
# 14 cards with two bananas on them
# 14 cards with one banana on them
# 6 cards with a swamp on them
# 6 cards with a banana skin
#
# The cards are placed face down on the table .
At each turn the
# player can take as many cards as they wish .
If they turn over a
# swamp or banana skin card they must stop ; otherwise they stop when
# they choose .
#
# The total number of bananas is added up ( call it X ) .
If the banana
# skin card was turned over then the player moves BACK X spaces , if
# not the player moves FORWARD X spaces .
#
# Players have perfect knowledge of the state of the cards as they are
# placed face up once drawn .
Once all six banana skin cards have be
# drawn the cards are all placed face down on the table again .
# The simulation runs through all the possible card positions and
# plays a large number of random draws for each possible number of
# cards a player might draw .
It then keeps track of the score for a

#
# Card counting scenarios :
#
# Number of skins : the player only keeps track of the number of banana
# skins that are on the table .

# Number banana cards : the player calculates the number of banana

And also , if you are player and have exceeded the expected score with fewer than the recommended cards you 'll know it 's best to stop .
The children 's game One Banana , Two Banana is a high stakes game of probability theory in action .
Or something like that .
Actually , it 's a fun game where you have to take probability into account when deciding what to do .
Conceptually , the game is simple .
There are 54 cards of five types .
Three of the card types have bananas on them ( one , two or three bananas ) , one card type has a banana skin on it and one card type has a swamp on it .
All the cards are placed face down on the table and shuffled about .
Each player takes turns at turning over as many cards as they want .
The total distance they move on the board ( winning is a simple first past the post system ) is the sum of the number of bananas on the banana cards .
But if they pick a banana skin card then they stop picking cards and must reverse direction by the sum of the number of bananas on the banana cards .
The swamp card simply stops a turn without a penalty .
There are six banana skin cards to start with and as they are removed from the pack they are placed on a special card for all to see .
At every stage everyone knows the number of banana skin cards remaining .
Thus you can adjust your strategy based on the number of banana skins that have caused others to go back .
So I wrote a little program that simulates One Banana , Two Banana games ( or at least board positions ) and see what the expected score is depending on the number of cards that the player chooses to pick .
I assume a very simple strategy of deciding up front how many cards to pick .
A more complexity strategy would be to look at the score as the player turns over cards and decide when to quit .
First , here 's the code :
And here 's a chart showing the average score from the Monte Carlo simulation for each of the six possible numbers of banana skins on the board .
The X axis shows the number of cards picked ( or desired to be picked ) , and the Y axis the average score .
If you look just at the maximum scores for each of the banana skin counts , then a simple pattern emerges .
So , just memorize that pattern and you 'll be a better player .
I 've removed that sentence because it is not correct .
That 's a different strategy based on stopping based on the cards you have already turned over ; that deserves a separate analysis to find the best strategy .
Watch out Vegas , here I come .
I pledge allegiance to the fear
of the United States of Amerika ,
and to the Republicrats who control
our lives , one global super - state ,
with paranoia and loathing for all
They say the world is a dangerous place and Americans have much to fear .
Your life is in constant danger from mysterious outside forces as well as your fellow citizens .
They may look like you , but according to some pundits , they want to destroy the nation , take away your rights , and corrupt your soul .
They might be psycho meth freaks who want to kill you for a few pennies or they may be satanic murderers who will kill you just for kicks .
Americans are not safe anywhere at any time , according to some talking heads .
Forget about leaving the country .
The cruise ships are staffed by thugs from the Russian mafia that will get you drunk and throw you overboard .
Do n't even think about flying - the other passengers are terrorists armed with box cutters and shoe bombs .
Even if you could safely get to another country , sexual predators will slip you drugs and kill you - after having their way with you .
If the sex pirates do n't get you , terrorists will kidnap you .
After torturing you , they will cut off your head .
The safest place is in your own home , assuming you have covered all windows with plastic sheets and duct tape .
This is the only way you can survive the constant threat of biological or chemical weapons .
You should also have rubber gloves to handle mail contaminated with anthrax spores .
Of course , simple plastic sheeting will not protect you in the event the mad dictator of a failed state passes off nuclear weapons to terrorists .
You will probably die when terrorists nuke cities all over America after smuggling 13 suitcase nukes in from across the Mexican border .
Terrorists are most likely smuggling in dirty bombs everyday and are just waiting for Osama to activate their secret jihad cells using a secret hand signal that will be broadcast on CNN .
In the event you must leave your home , be sure to wear a kevlar vest and a helmet .
Crazed addicts stoned on gateway drugs may try to shoot you and steal your cash in order to buy drugs that are stronger than the ones they are currently taking .
The helmet will also protect you from bird droppings that carry the deadly bird flu as well as head injuries due to baseball bat wielding hate criminals or auto accidents .
For more protection against anthrax , bird flu , SARS , and poisoned gases , you may wish to invest in a good gas mask .
Republicans or Democrats have much to fear - primarily each other .
Democrats fear that a government controlled by Republicans will result in the genocide of minorities , the starvation of the poor and elderly , millions of deaths from pollution , and summer temperatures of 150 degrees .
Republicans fear that a government run by Democrats will result in daily terrorist attacks , the elimination of the middle class , the banning of Christianity , and the murder of millions of babies .
Republicans and Democrats fear each other so much that both groups believe the only way they can be safe is if their group has total control over the government .
These groups embrace the concept that if they can win an election with 50.1 % of the vote , it entitles them to control the lives of the other 49.9 % of those who bothered to vote along with everyone who chose not to vote .
Americans have always loved horror movies - so much that they have transformed American life into what resembles a horror movie .
And what a drama it is - mad scientists , torturers , murderers , secret societies , hideous crimes , supernatural conspiracies , mysterious diseases , and various demons , monsters , and killers .
Constant fear and suspense .
The horror movies made in Hollywood are pale in comparison to the horror reality show produced in Washington by the all - powerful Imperial Government .
The carefully orchestrated drama directed by the government includes not only regular fear alerts and warnings of doom and dread , but the insidious power to destroy lives .
Unlike the horror movies made in Hollywood , the fear and loathing produced in Washington is real .
People are maimed , killed , jailed , tortured , bankrupted , and driven mad .
Cabalistic groups operate in secrecy to manipulate the minds of Americans .
Evil swindlers use deception and chicanery to rob Americans of their money .
Merchants of death bamboozle the public into wars designed to fill their coffers with treasure .
Megalomaniacs use stealth and cunning to satisfy their lust for power .
Monster movies from Hollywood may result in a few nightmares for those easily frightened , but they usually end after about two hours .
The reality show of fear made in Washington never ends and the nightmares and trepidation are relentless .
The scariest thing about this drama is that so many people embrace it .
When a horror movie is too dark , it is easy to walk out of the cinema or cut off the television .
It is not so easy to escape from the madness of the government 's perpetual horror show .

Tom Blanton runs the website Project For A New American Revolution .
In November , voters will decide a variety of issues - from allowing renaming the state 's No. 2 office to prohibiting affirmative - action programs .
As of Thursday 's filing deadline , nine measures qualified for the Nov. 2 general - election ballot .
But only one initiative - an effort to legalize medical marijuana - qualified for through a citizen petition .
The other eight measures were referred to the ballot by the Legislature .
Organizers and observers attribute the low number of citizen - driven initiatives to the lagging economy , which they say made it difficult for groups to hire companies to gather signatures and get the word out about their petitions .
" Most of the groups that would be doing initiatives have to be more selective in a tight economy , " said Sandy Bahr , a lobbyist with the Sierra Club .
" It takes a lot of money .
You have to really run two campaigns , one campaign to get it on the ballot and then you have to campaign to win . "
She said some groups that would traditionally run campaigns , such as the National Rifle Association , had the legislature refer measures to the voters instead or bypass the public altogether when possible , removing the costly petition - gathering phase .
Shawn Dow , who organized an unsuccessful initiative effort to ban photo - enforcement devices , said his group fell short because they could n't pay signature gatherers .
" It 's impossible for an all - volunteer organization to get something on the ballot , " he said .
For this election , initiatives needed to submit 153,365 signatures to qualify .
Past elections have seen much higher numbers citizen initiatives .
In 2006 , Arizona was the busiest state in the country with 19 measures , including 10 initiatives .
In 2008 , there were 10 ballot measures and nine voter initiatives .
Political observers said the nine ballot measures , while an interesting and diverse group , are not the type of propositions to generate large campaigns and will likely be overshadowed by statewide races .
" These are not big business issues , " said Gibson McKay , a lobbyist and political consultant who has worked with several ballot proposition campaigns .
" When you have the liquor interest , or gaming initiatives , those will turn people out to the polls because people are paying millions and millions of dollars to make sure of that . "
Three prominent signature drives - to repeal the state 's controversial new immigration law , to restructure the property tax system and to eliminate photo - enforcement traffic devices - failed to collect enough signatures .
One measure placed by the state Legislature , which would have guaranteed a secret ballot in state - run and union elections , was taken off the ballot Wednesday .
Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Robert Oberbillig ruled that the measure violated a constitutional provision that requires parts of an initiative to be substantively related .
Lawyers in support of the proposition said they would appeal the judge 's ruling to the Arizona Supreme Court , which could decide before the election whether or not to keep the measure on the ballot .
Medical marijuana
Proposition 203 , driven by the Arizona Medical Marijuana Policy Project , proposes to allow patients with a debilitating medical condition such as cancer , HIV or multiple sclerosis to purchase , possess and use 2.5 ounces of marijuana every two weeks with a doctor 's recommendation .
Non-profit dispensaries regulated by the state would grow and sell the drug to approved patients .
It still would be illegal to use marijuana in a public place or drive under the influence of marijuana , but the initiative would forbid employers from firing qualified medical - marijuana users who test positive for the drug unless they can prove patients used or were impaired while at work .
Thirteen states allow the possession of small amounts of marijuana for medical purposes , although only California has established a widespread network of dispensaries to distribute it .
Health care
Proposition 106 would amend the state Constitution to prohibit any law that requires a person , employer or health - care provider to participate in a health - care system .
The Legislature put the measure on the ballot after a similar initiative pushed by Arizonans for Health Care Freedom failed by a narrow margin in 2008 .
While the measure is not a reaction to the health - care law passed by the U.S. Congress in March that mandates that each individual have health insurance , it would almost directly contradict it .
Proponents of the measure say it will likely lead to lawsuits with the federal government if passed .
In the backlash against Congress ' health - care bill , numerous states adopted statutory versions of the proposition or put amendments on their November ballots .
Preferential treatment
State lawmakers put Proposition 107 , which would amend the Arizona Constitution to prohibit affirmative action programs , on the ballot after a similar initiative was disqualified from the 2008 ballot for not garnering enough signatures .
If passed , the law would prevent preferential treatment on the basis of race , sex , color , ethnicity or national origin in public employment , public education and public contracting .
In 2008 , the American Civil Liberties Union and the student government at the University of Arizona opposed the measure .
Similar measures approved by voters in California , Michigan and Washington have spurred numerous lawsuits .
Hunting and fishing
Proposition 109 would amend the state Constitution to give Arizona citizens a right to lawfully hunt , fish and harvest wildlife , give the Legislature the exclusive authority to enact laws to regulate these activities and forbid any law from unreasonably restricting these activities .
It also states that lawful public hunting and fishing would be the preferred means of managing and controlling wildlife .
The National Rifle Association supports the measure , and environmental groups such as the Sierra Club oppose it .
Stephanie Nichols - Young with the Animal Defense League of Arizona said the measure would restrict voters from putting conservation and preservation initiatives on future ballots .
Ten other states include hunting and fishing rights in their state constitutions .
Lieutenant governor
Proposition 111 would rename the position of secretary of state to become the lieutenant governor beginning with the November 2014 general election .
The lieutenant governor would assume the same duties and responsibilities as the secretary of state , including overseeing elections and being second in line for the Governor 's Office .
Candidates for governor and lieutenant governor would run in separate primaries but join together on a unified ticket for the general election .
The proposition makes no mention of what to do if a gubernatorial candidate runs as an independent .
Initiatives
Proposition 112 would change the deadlines for the voter - initiative process from four months before an election to six months before an election .
The start date to begin gathering signatures would n't change .
Growing Smarter
Lawmakers looking for more money for the state budget placed Proposition 301 on the ballot to get permission to take $ 123 million from a land - conservation fund and use it for general purposes .
The money comes from the Growing Smarter initiative , which voters approved in 1998 .
Since it was created by voters to buy land for conservation , their approval is needed to redirect the money to other purposes .
First Things First
Proposition 302 is another budget - balancing measure referred to the ballot by lawmakers anxious to find more money for the state budget .
It proposes to take the $ 345 million balance in the First Things First account , which pays for early childhood health and education programs , and send it to the general fund to be used for health and human services for children .
It also would direct the revenue from the 80 - cent - a - pack tobacco tax that funds First Things First and send it to the general fund for those same purposes .
The tax raises $ 60 million to $ 80 million a year .
Currently , the money is controlled by a citizen board ; voter OK of Prop. 302 would give lawmakers that control .
Arizona voters created First Things First in 2006 , making it a voter - protected initiative .
Therefore , voter OK is needed to dismantle it .
State Trust land
Proposition 110 would allow state - land officials to sell or lease state trust land , or place restrictions on the use of state trust lands if the goal is to protect military installations , ranges , airspace or other military - related uses .
These sales / leases would be allowed to happen without public notice or auction .
It also would allow state officials to exchange trust land for other public lands if the exchange would protect military installations from encroaching development or better manage and protect trust lands .
Failed initiatives
Representatives from the three campaigns that failed to qualify for the ballot said they would try again for to get their measures on the next general election .
Arizona Citizens Against Photo Radar , which fell about 34,000 short of qualifying their initiative , said they had begun pulling petition sheets to put similar initiatives on municipal ballots for November 's election .
An effort to repeal Arizona 's new immigration law and place a three - year moratorium on all immigration legislation fell about 50,000 signatures short of the 153,365 required .
Four referendums targeting Senate Bill 1070 or House Bill 2162 , which makes changes to the Senate bill , have until July 28 to gather enough signatures .

BBC News , Magdeburg , Germany
The next time you venture out for lunch in Magdeburg , check what kind of loose change you have in your wallet .
The local banknotes are issued at a rate of 1:1 to the euro
Like any other city in Germany , the normal currency here is the euro .
But bizarrely , they also have another currency in circulation : the Urstromtaler .
Before you doubt its existence , it is not " Monopoly " money - it is very real .
At a jewellery shop in the city centre , Gerfried Kliems explained how people use the regional currency .
" It 's quite simple , " he said .
" The money you spend stays in the region .
When I accept Urstromtaler in my shop , I then have to see how I can spend the local banknotes .
You get to know everyone who 's participating in this project , and at the end of the day , you have a good feeling about life . "
More than 200 businesses are using the regional currency , including shops , bakeries , florists , restaurants .
There is even a cinema which accepts Urstromtaler .
' Local boost '
Frank Jansky , a lawyer , launched the regional currency in Magdeburg .
" We are fostering links with businesses in the whole region and through the contacts that we develop , we are supporting the domestic German market , " he said .
Disillusionment with the euro is widespread in Germany
At the Urstromtaler " central bank " in Magdeburg , which is no larger than a small office , the banknotes are issued at a rate of 1:1 against the euro .
The banknotes have a time limit and lose value after a certain date , so people are encouraged to spend their money quickly .
Campaigners argue that the currency can help boost the local economy .
The unemployment rate in Magdeburg is about 20 % , and like other areas in the former communist east , many young people have left to look for work elsewhere .
Dilapidated , run - down houses and old factories still dot the landscape , even though billions of euros ' worth of subsidies have poured into the east since the fall of communism .
" Everyone who uses the regional currency develops a social network .
People get to know each other , " said Joerg Dahlke .
" It 's also good for the environment , as you are not buying goods from big supermarket chains who import their goods .
Instead you are buying products from regional producers , " he said .
The Bundesbank is keeping an eye on what we are doing - regional currencies are still in a legal grey area
Frank Jansky
It is easy to dismiss the regional currency as a gimmick , but supporters take it very seriously .
" We are disillusioned with the euro , as it does n't bring many benefits to the local community , " said Joerg Dahlke .
" But at the same time , we do n't want to get rid of the euro completely .
" Our regional currency runs in parallel to the euro .
Of course , we still need the euro for big purchases , " he explained .
Residents can choose to pay one - third of their purchase in the local currency , and the rest in euros , or sometimes they can pay for their purchase entirely in Urstromtaler .
The phenomenon is not limited to the state of Saxony - Anhalt .
' Social money '
Regional currencies have sprung up all over Germany .
According to Professor Gerhard Roesl , author of a report commissioned by the Bundesbank , there are at least 16 regional currencies in Germany .
" The regional currencies are not really a threat to the Bundesbank , although technically they are illegal and could pose a problem .
The Bundesbank tolerates the local currencies , which are regarded as a kind of ' social money ' , " said Mr Roesl .
Frank Jansky and representatives of other regional currency projects are lobbying the federal government to introduce a change in the law .
" The Bundesbank is keeping an eye on what we are doing .
Regional currencies are still in a legal grey area .
But there are other comparable financial schemes , like ' miles and more ' , which also pose a challenge to the status quo , " said Mr Jansky .
" We are supporting our regional economy and culture , which will benefit future generations . "
And in case anyone thinks it 's an old - fashioned system , they have now launched an online banking system for the regional currency in Magdeburg .
Last summer , Writers Digest Press published And Here ’s the Kicker a book of interviews I conducted with twenty - one humor writers , including Buck Henry , Bob Odenkirk , Dick Cavett , Harold Ramis , David Sedaris , and Marshall Brickman .
Although he ’s not a writer , I interviewed Ben Glenn II , a TV historian and expert in the history of canned laughter for the book .
As I was talking to all of these people whose work produces laughter , it seemed appropriate to include at least one expert in producing fake laughter .
How did canned laughter come about ?
The concept actually goes back at least five hundred years .
History tells us that there were audience “ plants ” in the crowds at Shakespearean performances in the 16th century .
They spurred on audience reactions , including laughter and cheering — as well as jeers .
How about more recently ?
Canned laughter was used to a certain degree in radio , but its first TV appearance was in 1950 , on a rather obscure NBC situation comedy , The Hank McCune Show .
Remarkably , there are a couple of clips from the show on YouTube .
Shortly after the show ’s debut , there was an article in Variety noting that the show ’s canned laughter was a new innovation , and that its potential for providing a wide - range of reactions was great .
Of course , that eventually came true .
How odd did the laugh track sound to those early TV audiences ?
I can only imagine that it seemed odd to viewers , but using a laugh track held many advantages for television producers .
The most important was that it made it possible to film exteriors and on location .
It gave producers freedom .
For example , scenes from Leave It to Beaver were shot outdoors on RKO ’s — and later Universal ’s — back lot .
With the laugh track , a studio audience was no longer absolutely necessary .
Who invented the canned - laughter machine ?
Actually , its official name is the Laff Box , and it was invented by a man named Charles Rolland Douglass .
He served in World War II , and when he returned to civilian life , he worked as a broadcast engineer at CBS .
Douglass was responsible for everything from recording sound levels during production to adjusting them in post - production .
Shows often needed sound correction before broadcast .
Sometimes a joke did n’t get a big enough laugh , or , in the case of a famous I Love Lucy episode , the laugh was too long and had to be cut down .
This particular episode was broadcast in March 1957 , and it was called “ Lucy Does the Tango . ”
The laugh , in response to Lucy dancing the tango with raw eggs stuffed into her shirt , lasted about sixty - five seconds .
There were other reasons , too :
For example , I once attended a taping of Alice in the seventies , and the actors kept blowing their lines .
Of course , by the third or fourth take , the joke was no longer funny .
A Douglass laugh was inserted into the final broadcast version to compensate .
How did Douglass originally invent the prototype for the Laff Box ?
According to his wife Dorothy , Douglass would bring home tapes of television shows and then pore over them for hours and hours in his living room , finding and isolating the precise audience reactions he wanted .
He spliced together tapes into spools — essentially tape loops .
There was a keyboard for this machine , and each key was connected to a separate tape loop .
At the bottom was a pedal that would either increase the volume or fade it out .
So , really , it was like playing a musical instrument .
And Charles Douglass was a virtuoso at the keyboard .
Where did the laughs on the Laff Box originate ?
Reportedly , the earliest reactions came from a Marcel Marceau performance in Los Angeles in 1955 or 1956 , during his world premiere North American tour .
This would make sense , because Marceau was , of course , a mime , and therefore , the only sound in the theater was the audience ’s reaction .
Other reactions are widely thought to have come from The Red Skelton Show , especially the show ’s mime sketches .
I can state this with relative certainty , as it has been reported repeatedly by various sound engineers who worked closely with Douglass .
It ’s interesting to note that the Skelton show aired on CBS , where Douglass worked .
So , in theory , he would have had access to those tapes .
But , in the end , it ’s also important to note that we may never know his exact sources .
As far as my research shows , there were never any interviews with Douglass or with anyone who worked at his company , Northridge Electronics .
The secrecy surrounding his work is Hollywood legend .
Only a very few people witnessed him using his machine , and it was always kept padlocked when not in use .
Part of this secrecy was to protect his invention , to be sure .
But part of it , too , was that , for some , inserting a laugh track may have been the same as admitting that a show was n’t funny — or not “ funny enough . ”
There was a real stigma surrounding the use of the laugh track , which continues to this day .
Have you ever seen a Charles Douglass Laff Box ?
I have seen photographs of it , but very few people , including myself , have ever seen this machine firsthand .
I ’ve spent a lot of time talking to some of the original “ laugh - track men ” who worked with Douglass during his heyday .
What they have to say is fascinating .
What ’s even more interesting is that they continue Douglass ’s tradition of secrecy by speaking only off the record , and with the condition that I not reveal their names .
It ’s still a secret , even fifty years later .
That ’s astonishing — you can even find C.I.A. and F.B.I. agents who are willing to talk once they retire .
I know , but this is a very small industry .
It ’s a brotherhood — very insular .
When they spoke with me , they described Douglass ’s method , which is quite fascinating .
Producers would call Douglass into the studio to “ laugh ” a show .
Douglass would show up with his Laff Box , which he carted around on a dolly that he invented .
When he was finished , he ’d pack up his machine , load it on his dolly , and drive off to the next job .
What made Douglass so good , exactly ?
Is there an art to canned laughter ?
Oh , absolutely .
First , Douglass knew his material inside out .
He knew his library extremely well , which makes sense , because he had , of course , compiled it himself .
He had dozens of reactions , and he knew where to find each one .
In addition , he sped - up the reactions just a bit to heighten the effect .
Douglass ’s work was crisp and clean .
It was a real craft .
And the range of reactions that he was able to find was incredible .
Some of the big belly laughs are great .
You just do n’t hear laughs like that anymore .
I also love the “ shock ” and “ surprise ” reactions , such as when a big audience says , in unison , “ Whoa ! ”
Those were used frequently on The Munsters when something extra-outrageous happened .
Douglass not only had a terrific “ ear , ” he also had a terrific memory .
Over the years he would not just add new tracks , but he would revive old ones that had been retired and then retire the newer tracks .
For example , tracks heard in sitcoms of the early 1960s resurface years later in the late 1970s .
The ABC series Delta House , which was a spin - off of the movie Animal House , is a perfect example .
However , by this time , Douglass was using his most extreme reactions almost exclusively , and the result was pretty awful .
To my ear , it rings of desperation .
I ’m not a fan of canned laughter per se , but some 1960s sitcoms were so poorly written that I can’t help but think that canned laughter only improved them .
No question !
In my view , the laugh track only adds to the fun of these shows , whether they are well written or not .
I mean , Mister Ed , which I think is quite well written , would be so much less fun to watch if it had no laugh track .
As far as shows with weak scripts — take The Flying Nun , for example — the laugh track saved that show .
Do the laughs today differ from the ones in the past ?
They most certainly do .
Today ’s sitcoms are based mostly on witty repartee and no longer rely on outlandish situations or sight gags , such as you would see in an episode of Mister Ed or The Munsters or Bewitched — and today ’s muted laughs reflect that .
Generally , laughs are now much less aggressive and more subdued ; you no longer hear unbridled belly laughs or guffaws .
It ’s “ intelligent ” laughter — more genteel , more sophisticated .
But definitely not as much fun .
There was an optimism and carefree quality in those old laugh tracks .
Today , the reactions are largely “ droll . ”
In what sense ?
In the past , if the audience was really having a good time , it shone through .
Audience members seemed less self - conscious and they felt free to laugh as loudly as they wanted .
Maybe that ’s a reflection of contemporary culture .
In the fifties , the laughs were generally buoyant and uproarious , although somewhat generic , because Douglass had n’t yet refined his structured laugh technique .
In the sixties , however , you could hear more individual responses — chortles , cackles from both men and women .
The reactions were much more orderly and organized .
I can actually tell you the exact year that a show was produced , just by listening to its laugh track .
Have you ever detected an actual , authentic laugh on a live - action sitcom ?
Yes , just once .
There is one episode of All in the Family in which a reaction is real .
The next TV season I heard it on a canned - laughter series , and I thought , Hey !
That ’s the same laugh I heard on All in the Family !
But that ’s been the only time — so far .
I ’m always listening .
Who ’s in charge of the canned laughter on sitcoms today ?
As far as we know , Northridge Electronics still produces the majority of canned laughter on television , and Robert Douglass carries on the family tradition by remaining as tight - lipped as his father .
But the business is no longer a monopoly .
There are many postproduction houses doing this work .
The Laff Box has been replaced by the laptop , and I ’m told there are multiple sets of laugh tracks that contain laughs specific to certain countries and cultural groups .
Whatever the case , the technique is certainly a lot more sophisticated than in Charles Douglass ’s day — which , to my mind , is not always a great thing .
Nothing will replace those classic , vintage tracks , and I wish they ’d bring them back .
Thank you .
My pleasure .

Think you know the saga of the deleted scenes from Monty Python ’s LIFE OF BRIAN ?
Not if you trust Wikipedia .
The 1979 comedy did n’t just take the mickey out of Jesus and the feuding Palestinian Liberation fronts , it poked fun at Zionists , as goose - stepping racists led by Eric Idle ’s OTTO the NAZIRENE determined to promote Jewish racial purity , carve a Lebensraum from the “ traditional Jewish areas of Samaria , ” displace the Samaritans into internment camps , and plan an Anschluss of Jordan to “ create a great Jewish state that will last a thousand years . ”
My , my , my .
But the defamed parties had the last laugh .
They acquired the studio with the rights to the film , obliterated the offending celluloid , reedited the video release , and have rewritten cinematic history .
Maybe you do n’t care what Israel has been doing to the Palestinians .
Did you know someone is messing with the oeuvre of Monty Python ?
We had the comedy sketches memorized in college .
Who could have imagined the originals would be vulnerable to tampering ?
I ’m not sure this is an overreaction .
Monty Python is not Shakespeare , what is ?
But it ’s not Nicholas Sparks either .
For a populist phenom I say Python rivals Swift .
This is book burning , is what it is — a sinister effacing of creative work .
In a recent British poll , Life of Brian was in contention for England ’s greatest film comedy .
But for your consideration , instead of a director ’s cut , we ’ve got a censor ’s cut .
Here ’s the lowdown in brief : three integral scenes of the theatrical release were removed from the video version .
The third scene was recut to make up for the absence of the first two .
And a key character was stricken from the credits .
When Criterion later released a collector ’s edition , the missing sequences were included in the extras as “ deleted scenes . ”
But these scenes were represented by mangled outtakes of the originals , from which key lines remain excised .
Then an official narrative was fabricated to recount how the sequences had been removed from the original version to improve the flow , the crude outtakes testifying to why they did n’t make the cut .
But that ’s all bullocks –and the niggling weak spot to this digital book burning is , ironically enough , that BOOKS were published in 1979 to accompany the film ’s release : a mass - market paperback of the screenplay , and an oversized Monty Python Scrapbook .
The rewrite runs afoul too of anyone who remembers seeing the film in its first release .
Not My Tribe has suffered its own internal dissension over comparing Israel to the Nazis .
Apparently it ’s SO not done , not even Monty Python can get away with it .
You may have revisited the video many times , now the DVD , maybe you read about the scandals about the film ’s release , maybe you memorized some of the Biggus Dickus dialog ; are you curious that you missed the bits about Samaria , Jordan and purified Jewish blood ?
When the Catholic church objects to a movie , it declares a boycott .
Zionists take a more effective strategy .
When pulling funding from the project does n’t work , they buy the rights and delete the scenes .
You ’d think a film as celebrated as Life of Brian would be inviolate to culture vandals .
And so far the desecration has escaped the legions of Monty Python fans .
Wikipedia recounts how Otto ’s scenes were deleted from the film , and thankfully resurfaced to be included as outtakes on the 2007 Criterion edition .
But the account is untrue .
From restored out - takes we might surmise that Jewish objection were limited to the Star of David embellished as a swastika , but from the un-restored material it seems that the modern censors objected to Zionists depicted as determined to carve their own Lebensraum in Samariaby by means of Anschluss and concentration camps , for the sake of a third Jewish reich .
And what have we now happening in the Occupied Territories which Israeli settlers insist on calling their Sumaria and Judea of biblical history , and what of the open air internment of the Palestinians in Gaza .
Oh My Goodness .
The Criterion edition of Monty Python ’s Life of Brian has some famously restored scenes , alleged to have been cut from the original version .
They ’re available again , and you can see them on Youtube .
But it ’s Poppycock .
The scenes in question were actually removed from the video release , and “ lost ” by the studio which took over handmade films .
The deleted scenes were actually out - takes of the originals .
Fortunately , the screenplay published to accompany the 1979 release has the original lines , which vary quite curiously from what ’s being peddled as the restored original .
Yes , the deleted scenes have deleted scenes .
If you saw the 1979 film in the theater , you might remember Otto , the Hitleresque Zionist with the curiously non-German accent .
Here is the original script made from the final take .
The out - take restored as “ deleted scenes ” stray considerably from these lines .
The lines in bold have simply been simply clipped .
BRIAN slips out through the back door and descends some steps into MANDY ’S garden where he sits , head in hands .
Suddenly a voice assails him .
OTTO : Hail , Leader !
BRIAN : What ?
OTTO : Oh , I– I ’m so sorry .
Have you seen the new Leader ?
BRIAN : The what ?
OTTO : The new Leader .
Where is the new leader ?
I wish to hail him .
Hail , Leader .
See. BRIAN : Oh .
Who are you ?
OTTO : My name .
Is. Otto .
BRIAN : Oh . OTTO : Yes .
Otto .
It ’s time , you know .
. .
BRIAN : What ?
OTTO : . . .
Time that we Jews racially purified ourselves .
BRIAN : Oh .
OTTO : He ’s right you know .
The new leader .
We need more living room .
We must move into the traditionally Jewish areas of Samaria .
BRIAN : What about the Samaritans ?
OTTO : Well , we can put them in little camps .
And after Samaria we must move into Jordan and create a great Jewish state that will last a thousand years .
BRIAN : Yes , I ’m not sure , but I . . .
OTTO : Oh , I grow so impatient , you know .
To see the Leader that has been promised our people for centuries .
The Leader who will save Israel by ridding it of the scum of non-Jewish people , making it pure , no foreigners , no gypsies , no riff - raff .
BRIAN : Shh !
Otto !
OTTO : What ?
The Leader ?
Hail Leader !
BRIAN : No , no .
It ’s dangerous .
OTTO : Oh , danger :
There ’s no danger .
( flicks his fingers ) Men !
A phalanx of armed , rather sinister , men appear from the shadows and fall in .
OTTO : Impressive , eh? BRIAN : Yes .
OTTO : Yes , we are a thoroughly trained suicide squad .
BRIAN : Ah -hah .
OTTO : Oh yes , we can commit suicide within twenty seconds .
BRIAN : Twenty seconds ?
OTTO : You do n’t believe me ?
BRIAN : Well . . . Yes . . .
OTTO : I think you question me .
BRIAN : No. No. OTTO : I can see you do not believe me .
BRIAN : No , no .
I do .
OTTO : Enough .
I prove it to you .
Squad .
SQUAD : Hail Leader .
OTTO : Co-mmit Suicide .
They all pull out their swords with military precision and plunge them into themselves in time , falling in a big heap on the ground .
Dead .
OTTO : ( with pride ) See. BRIAN : Yes .
OTTO : I think now you believe me .
Yes ?
BRIAN : Yes .
OTTO : I think now I prove it to you , huh ?
BRIAN : Yes , you certainly did .
OTTO : All dead .
BRIAN : Yes .
OTTO : Not one living .
BRIAN : No . OTTO : You see , they are all of them quite dead .
See I kick this one .
He ’s dead .
And this one ’s dead , I tread on his head .
And he ’s dead .
And he ’s dead .
All good Jewish boys , no foreigners .
But they died a hero ’s death and their names will live forever .
Helmut . . .
Johnny . . . the little guy . . . er . . . the other fat one . . . their names will be remembered . . . eventually . . . forever .
So now I go .
Hail Leader .
BRIAN : Wait Otto .
You ca n’t just leave them all here .
OTTO : Why not –they ’re all dead .
One oh the ‘ corpses ’ farts .
There is a giggle .
OTTO : Wait a minute .
There is somebody here who is not dead .
There ’s somebody here who is only pretending to be dead .
Stand up , you .
One of the bodies stands up sheepishly .
As he does so , he stands on someone else who quite clearly says ‘ Ow . ’
OTTO : Who said ‘ ow ’ ?
You ’re not dead either .
Neither are you .
Stand up , stand up , all of you .
Oh , my heck , is there not even one dead ?!
They have all stood up averting their eyes in shame .
HELMUT : No , sir .
Not one .
ADOLF : We thought it was a practice , sir .
OTTO : Oh my cock !
Tomorrow , as a punishment , you will all eat–pork sausages !
There is a horrified muttering at this suggestion .
OTTO turns sharply to BRIAN .
OTTO : OK .
Tell the Leader that we are ready to die for him the moment he gives the sign .
BRIAN : What sign ?
OTTO : The sign that is the sign , that shall be the sign .
Men , forward !
OTTO ’S MEN march away singing their exciting song .
OTTO ’S MEN ’S SONG :
There ’s a man we call our Leader .
He ’s fine and strong and brave ,
And we ’ll follow him unquestioning
Towards an early grave .
He-e gives us hope of sacrifice
And a chance to die in vain ,
And if we ’re one of the lucky ones ,
We ’ll live to die again .
BRIAN : Silly bugger .
A second scene involves Otto and his Nazirenes receiving the sign , as the crucifixion party departs the city gates .
JUDITH now is running through the crowded streets .
She reaches some steps and climbs up onto a roof .
Quickly , she opens a basket and releases a flock of pigeons .
A very STRANGE MAN is lying on a lonely hilltop .
Suddenly he rouses himself , sits up and peers into the distance towards Jerusalem .
A flock of pigeons flies up against the sun .
Seeing this , the STRANGE MAN rouses himself and does an extremely odd but elaborate dance .
Further away , on an even lonelier hilltop , a pile of straw moves to reveal that it is in fact a MAN dressed in straw .
He watches the STRANGE MAN ’S dance closely .
STRAW LOOK - OUT : It is the sign !
Instantly OTTO appears , with all his men .
OTTO : The sign that is the sign ?
LOOK - OUT : Yes !
OTTO : Men !
Our time has come !
Our leader calls !
Men forward !
The MEN march into the wall and each other .
OTTO : Oh my cock .
Of course the omission of Otto ’s gang created a problem for the film ’s final scene , where his men repeat their self - sacrifice beneath the crosses .
Here was the original sequence :
Suddenly PARVUS looks up .
He has heard something .
OTTO and his MEN appear over the skyline .
BRIAN : Otto !
( a new flicker of hope in his eyes ) OTTO : Men , charge !
They charge .
The ROMANS , seeing this formidable army bearing down on them , finger their swords rather nervously and then break and run away back towards the city gate .
BRIAN ’S face lights up with renewed hope as he sees OTTO ’S army advancing at the double .
The army arrives under the cross , swords held aloft .
The ROMANS have all run away .
OTTO : ( to Brian ) Leader !
We salute you .
Men !
Die for your cause !
With immaculate precision they all run themselves through , including OTTO .
OTTO : You see .
Every man a hero .
They died for their country .
BRIAN : You silly sods .
For the re-edited video and subsequent DVD versions , audio voice - overs were added to explain Otto ’s final charge .
None of this was in the original .
– [ A group of faux oriental - looking warriors come over a hill , led by their leader , King Otto .
Care to venture a guess as to who they are ?
Yes , it ’s … ]
WORKER
The Judean People ’s Front !

Some of Michelangelo's best known works may bear hidden messages suggesting that the human brain is among God 's greatest creations , scientists say .
The great Italian Renaissance artist dissected cadavers to familiarize himself with the human body , so he could better paint it .
And , according to a new analysis , he included a representation of the brainstem in his representation of God on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel , which he painted from 1508 to 1512 .
Neurosurgeons Dr. Rafael Tamargo and Ian Suk of Johns Hopkins University looked closely at Michelangelo 's painting " Separation of Light From Darkness , " which depicts the beginning of the universe .
They found that the neck of God in this painting appears to contain the human brainstem .
" He recognized that the brain was an important structure , and I think he included it in the creation of the universe because he recognized that this is one of the most magnificent things that God had created , " Tamargo said .
The brainstem is the most primitive part of the brain , through which all signals traveling to and from the brain must pass , Tamargo said .
In the image above , on the left , you can see a comparison between the neck of God in the painting and a real brain stem .
On the right , notice the different angles of light on the figure , which was uncommon for Michelangelo .
It was not uncommon in the Renaissance for artists to do dissections for the purpose of creating more accurate works , he said .
Leonardo da Vinci , 23 years older than Michelangelo , documented his brain dissections and did experiments on the brainstem .
The neck of the figure of God in Michelangelo 's painting , zoomed in above in image G , is abnormal anatomically .
This is curious because the artist 's other works show a fine understanding of what the neck looks like , as shown in images A - D above ( E is by Leonardo , F is by Raphael ) .
This suggests that Michelangelo was n't " just having a bad day , " Tamargo said .
Tamargo and colleagues are not the first to propose that Michelangelo hid brain anatomy in his paintings .
An article in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1990 by Dr. Frank Lynn Meshberger suggested that the Renaissance master 's " Creation of Adam , " another fresco from the Sistine Chapel , depicts the human brain .
Michelangelo probably did n't know the functions of the various components of the brain , but he understood it was an important structure , Tamargo said .
" Separation of Light From Darkness , " located above the altar of the Sistine Chapel , is too high for people of Michelangelo 's time to have been able to see details such as the brainstem , and telescopes did not yet exist .
But the artist probably knew that someday , someone would notice , Tamargo said .
" I think he put a message there for the future , to let people know that he knew anatomy , and probably to enhance the meaning of that fresco , " Tamargo said .

Four West Australian police officers are being investigated over allegations they misused Tasers on colleagues during an apparent initiation ritual .
Internal Affairs launched an investigation two weeks ago into claims officers within a particular team at Rockingham Police Station , south of Perth , were misusing Tasers on some of their uniformed colleagues .

2.3.4.8 Starting MySQL as a Windows Service
On Windows , the recommended way to run MySQL is to install it as a Windows service , so that MySQL starts and stops automatically when Windows starts and stops .
A MySQL server installed as a service can also be controlled from the command line using NET commands , or with the graphical Services utility .
Generally , to install MySQL as a Windows service you should be logged in using an account that has administrator rights .
The Services utility ( the Windows Service Control Manager ) can be found in the Windows Control Panel .
To avoid conflicts , it is advisable to close the Services utility while performing server installation or removal operations from the command line .
Installing the service
Before installing MySQL as a Windows service , you should first stop the current server if it is running by using the following command :
C:\> " C: \Program Files\MySQL\MySQL
Server 8.0\bin\mysqladmin " -u root shutdown
Note
If the MySQL root user account has a password , you need to invoke mysqladmin with the -p option and supply the password when prompted .
This command invokes the MySQL administrative utility mysqladmin to connect to the server and tell it to shut down .
The command connects as the MySQL root user , which is the default administrative account in the MySQL grant system .
Note Users in the MySQL grant system are wholly independent from any operating system users under Windows .
Install the server as a service using this command :
C:\> " C: \Program Files\MySQL\MySQL
Server 8.0\bin\mysqld " -- install
The service - installation command does not start the server .
Instructions for that are given later in this section .
To make it easier to invoke MySQL programs , you can add the path name of the MySQL bin directory to your Windows system PATH environment variable :
On the Windows desktop , right - click the My Computer icon , and select Properties .
Next select the Advanced tab from the System Properties menu that appears , and click the Environment Variables button .
Under System Variables , select Path , and then click the Edit button .
The Edit System Variable dialogue should appear .
Place your cursor at the end of the text appearing in the space marked Variable Value .
( Use the End key to ensure that your cursor is positioned at the very end of the text in this space . )
Then enter the complete path name of your MySQL bin directory ( for example , C : \Program Files\MySQL\MySQL
Server 8.0 \bin ) , and there should be a semicolon separating this path from any values present in this field .
Dismiss this dialogue , and each dialogue in turn , by clicking OK until all of the dialogues that were opened have been dismissed .
You should now be able to invoke any MySQL executable program by typing its name at the DOS prompt from any directory on the system , without having to supply the path .
This includes the servers , the mysql client , and all MySQL command - line utilities such as mysqladmin and mysqldump .
You should not add the MySQL bin directory to your Windows PATH if you are running multiple MySQL servers on the same machine .
Warning
You must exercise great care when editing your system PATH by hand ; accidental deletion or modification of any portion of the existing PATH value can leave you with a malfunctioning or even unusable system .
The following additional arguments can be used when installing the service :
You can specify a service name immediately following the - - install option .
The default service name is MySQL .
If a service name is given , it can be followed by a single option .
By convention , this should be -- defaults - file= file_name to specify the name of an option file from which the server should read options when it starts .
The use of a single option other than -- defaults - file is possible but discouraged .
-- defaults - file is more flexible because it enables you to specify multiple startup options for the server by placing them in the named option file .
You can also specify a - - local - service option following the service name .
This causes the server to run using the LocalService Windows account that has limited system privileges .
If both -- defaults - file and -- local - service are given following the service name , they can be in any order .
For a MySQL server that is installed as a Windows service , the following rules determine the service name and option files that the server uses :
If the service - installation command specifies no service name or the default service name ( MySQL ) following the -- install option , the server uses the service name of MySQL and reads options from the [ mysqld ] group in the standard option files .
If the service - installation command specifies a service name other than MySQL following the -- install option , the server uses that service name .
It reads options from the [ mysqld ] group and the group that has the same name as the service in the standard option files .
This enables you to use the [ mysqld ] group for options that should be used by all MySQL services , and an option group with the service name for use by the server installed with that service name .
If the service - installation command specifies a -- defaults - file option after the service name , the server reads options the same way as described in the previous item , except that it reads options only from the named file and ignores the standard option files .
As a more complex example , consider the following command :
C:\> " C: \Program Files\MySQL\MySQL
Server 8.0\bin\mysqld " -- install MySQL --defaults-file=C:\my-opts.cnf
Here , the default service name ( MySQL ) is given after the -- install option .
If no -- defaults - file option had been given , this command would have the effect of causing the server to read the [ mysqld ] group from the standard option files .
However , because the -- defaults - file option is present , the server reads options from the [ mysqld ] option group , and only from the named file .
Note On Windows , if the server is started with the -- defaults - file and -- install options , -- install must be first .
Otherwise , mysqld.exe will attempt to start the MySQL server .
You can also specify options as Start parameters in the Windows Services utility before you start the MySQL service .
Finally , before trying to start the MySQL service , make sure the user variables % TEMP % and %TMP % ( and also %TMPDIR % , if it has ever been set ) for the operating system user who is to run the service are pointing to a folder to which the user has write access .
The default user for running the MySQL service is LocalSystem , and the default value for its %TEMP % and %TMP % is C : \Windows \Temp , a directory LocalSystem has write access to by default .
However , if there are any changes to that default setup ( for example , changes to the user who runs the service or to the mentioned user variables , or the - - tmpdir option has been used to put the temporary directory somewhere else ) , the MySQL service might fail to run because write access to the temporary directory has not been granted to the proper user .
Starting the service
After a MySQL server instance has been installed as a service , Windows starts the service automatically whenever Windows starts .
The service also can be started immediately from the Services utility , or by using an sc start mysqld_service_name or NET START mysqld_service_name command .
SC and NET commands are not case - sensitive .
When run as a service , mysqld has no access to a console window , so no messages can be seen there .
If mysqld does not start , check the error log to see whether the server wrote any messages there to indicate the cause of the problem .
The error log is located in the MySQL data directory ( for example , C : \Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\data ) .
It is the file with a suffix of .err .
When a MySQL server has been installed as a service , and the service is running , Windows stops the service automatically when Windows shuts down .
The server also can be stopped manually using the Services utility , the sc stop mysqld_service_name command , the NET START mysqld_service_name command , or the mysqladmin shutdown command .
You also have the choice of installing the server as a manual service if you do not wish for the service to be started automatically during the boot process .
To do this , use the -- install - manual option rather than the -- install option :
C:\> " C: \Program Files\MySQL\MySQL
Server 8.0\bin\mysqld " -- install- manual
Removing the service
To remove a server that is installed as a service , first stop it if it is running by executing SC STOP mysqld_service_name or NET STOP mysqld_service_name .
Then use SC DELETE mysqld_service_name to remove it :
C:\> SC DELETE mysql
Alternatively , use the mysqld -- remove option to remove the service .
C:\> " C: \Program Files\MySQL\MySQL
Server 8.0\bin\mysqld " -- remove
If mysqld is not running as a service , you can start it from the command line .
For instructions , see Section 2.3.4.6 , “ Starting MySQL from the Windows Command Line ” .
If you encounter difficulties during installation , see Section 2.3.5 , “ Troubleshooting a Microsoft Windows MySQL Server Installation ” .
For more information about stopping or removing a Windows service , see Section 5.8.2.2 , “ Starting Multiple MySQL Instances as Windows Services ” .
Iphone 3D engine experience
Pumped up by the tremendous success of Fluid ( 4,000,000 + downloads ) and Fluid 2 ( 50,000 + downloads ) , I started two month ago to write a real game for iPhone :
Here is a modest report of my experience in the process .
This entry focus mostly on the renderer , I 'm planning on writing more about the toolchain and the visibility surface determination system later .
Screenshots
A few videos
The following videos show characters from Doom3 that I used to test the engine , the HellKnight is 2200 poly , the rest of the room visible is 1000 .
The materials all feature a diffuse map , a normal map and a specular map ( up to 512x512 ) .
The shadow is generated via a shadowmap ( because render to depth texture is not supported on iPhone ( GL_OES_depth_texture Edit 2011 : As of iOS 4.1 , GL_OES_depth_texture IS supported ) , depth value are packed in a R8G8B8A8 color texture twice the size of the screen ) .

Choices
My early choices were :
It 's going to be a 3D shmup because it 's the type of games I enjoy the most .
Nowaday they are not so trendy but I really appreciated the instant fun and beauty in them .
They are also relatively simple to program .
Ikaruga is the quality ( at least graphic ) I am aiming at .
Run on ANY iphone / iTouch from early 2G to 3GS .
Frame /s never goes below 30 .
One unique collection of asset for every devices , the same model is used across all plateforms .
On high end iDevice , support shadows , bumpMapping and specular mapping .
Material centric , allowing high end device to use PNG , others PVRT .
Ability to " scale " automatically depending on the plateform detected .
Only one codebase ( fat binary used for Cortex A8 Neon SIMD / 3GS optimizations ) .
Written in pure C .
I decided to go with C because :
I like to be close to the metal and it's very valuable when you program on a mobile plateform .
On a very limited environment , the least the language " take care for me " , the happier I am .
I enjoy this language very much and it's paramount for an indy project to jump on anything that will helps you to remain motivated .
It 's easier ( at least for me ) to write portable code and I wanted to be able to run the engine on Windows in order to allow artist using Vista or XP to join the project anyway ( and it does run on XP now ) .
C is beautiful
Writing an engine in C is slow mainly for two reasons :
You lose access to plenty of goodies such as < string > , < vector > or < map > .
You lose operator overloading which is handy when you work on vectors
Inheritance is not too much of a big deal but not have polymorphism makes things ugly .
To elaborate on the polymorphism aspect :
It was really annoying when trying to think of an elegant way to have two renderers :
One for the fixed pipepline used on 2G/3G and iTouch , the other for the programmable pipepline on 3GS .
An interface or an abstract class would have been perfect but it was not an option .
I ended up reusing a pattern that I found while reading the Quake 2 source code :
An object containing function pointers , initialized at runtime .
typedef struc renderer_t { uchar type ; void ( * Set3D ) ( void ) ; void ( * StartRendition ) ( void ) ; void ( * StopRendition ) ( void ) ; void ( * SetTexture ) ( unsigned int ) ; void ( * RenderEntities ) ( void ) ; void ( * UpLoadTextureToGpu ) ( texture_t * texture ) ; void ( * Set2D ) ( void ) ; //... } renderer_t // renderer_fixed.h void initFixedRenderer( renderer_t* renderer ) ; // renderer_progr.h void initProgrRenderer ( renderer_t* renderer ) ;
The " implementation " of every function is hidden in the .c of each renderer , initFixedRenderer and initProgrRenderer only expose the function address via the pointer .
In the end I think it 's pretty neat and besides this I think C is a really good choice to write your engine on iPhone / iTouch , I recommend it .
Degrading ....
Learning 3D on an NVidia 8600 GT and then moving to a PowerVR SGX / MBX made me feel like a spoiled brat .
It hit me reality hard with the first version of the fixed pipeline running at 7 fps for 4000 polygons displayed .
My first reaction was of course to blame it on the hardware , wondering how John Carmack could have compared the power of an iPhone to a Dreamcast .
I demoed it to my French exiled bro Vinc and even his legendary positive attitute had no come back to such a failure .
So I read a lot , studied , tried , trashed and I made my way into iPhone and powerVR philosophy :
It turns out you can do A LOT with this hardware but you have to take into account some of it's limitations :
My first mistake was to forget about bandwidth consumption .
Modern GPU have dedicated VRAM with double digits Gb/s output .
The iPhone is far from this and the first thing to do is to tune down the size ( and quality ) of what you send to the GPU :
Texture compression is a big win as a 32 bits per texel RGBA textures is a pig with no real reason to exist when working with a small display .
OpenGS ES 1.1 and 2.0 do not require the GPU to support any texture compression but the good guys at Imagination Technologies provided support for PVRTC which bring down consumption to as low at 2 bits per pixel with alpha support !
Vertex metadatas can be slimmed down as well :
A " regular " vertex is :
Vertex Elementary unit : position 3 floats normal 3 floats tangent 3 floats textureCoo 2 floats
------------------- 44 bytes
By packing the components in " shorts " instead of " floats " via normalization , you end up having :
Vertex Elementary unit : position 3 floats normal 3 shorts tangent 3 shorts textureCoo 2 shorts
------------------- 28 bytes
It 's almost like we " compress " the data on the CPU , send it to the GPU where they are " decompressed " .
Abusing normalization divide bandwidth consumption by almost 50 % and help to slightly improve performances .
Compiler tuning is also important .
Xcode is setup by default to generate ARM binaries using the Thumb instruction set , which is 16 bits instead of 32 bits .
This reduce the size of the binary and the cost for Apple but it 's bad for 3D as Thumb instruction have to be translated to 32 bits .
Uncheck this option for an instant gain of performances .
Framebuffer refresh can also be improved a lot with 3.1 firmware .
This is an issue I mentionned in my article about Wolfenstein for iPhone : NSTimer is an abomination and I was trilled to find we can now use CADisplayLink to perform vsync and get adaptative framerate ( although I 'm experimenting some nasty touchesMoved on non 2G v3. X devices , if you have any info about this , email me ! ) .
Reduze Framebuffer colorspace is an other way to improve performances by reducing the amount of written data .
Move from 24 bits color space to 16 bits provides some good improvements .
CAEAGLLayer * eaglLayer = ( CAEAGLLayer *) self.layer ; eaglLayer.opaque = YES ; eaglLayer.drawableProperties = [ NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys : [ NSNumber numberWithBool : YES ] , kEAGLDrawablePropertyRetainedBacking , //FTW //kEAGLColorFormatRGBA8 , kEAGLColorFormatRGB565 , kEAGLDrawablePropertyColorFormat , nil ] ;
Stating the obvious here , but reduce texture & blending mode switches are very important ( Forget about good perf if you do more than 60 textures changes ) .
The material approach of the engine can very handy in this regard .
Reduce blending of your polygons is PARAMOUNT : PowerVR performs TBDR ( tile - based deferred rendering ) which mean that one pixel is rendered only once via hidden surface removal , blending is defeating the purpose .
My take is that a blended polygon is rendere regardless of the culling outcome and it destroys perfs .
And last but not least , optimize the vertice indices so GPU fetches will hit the cache as much as possible .
OpenGL ES 2.0 = One GPU +
One giant notepad .
One other difficulty working with mobile shaders was to discover that OpenGL ES 2.0 is NOT a superset of openGL ES 1.1 .
This can sound like a minor issue but what it means is that the drivers stop providing you with a bunch of things such as GL_PROJECTION matrix , GL_MODEL_VIEW matrix , GL_TEXTURE matrix and so on .
You also lose every verterxArray functions : glNormalPointer , glTexCoordPointer , glVertexPointer .
In the shader , contraty to OpenGL 2.0 again nothing is provided ( no gl_ModelViewMatrix , no gl_NormalMatrix , no ftransform and no gl_LightSource either .
Anything you want to have in the shader must be passed from the CPU via an uniform , a variable or an attribute ( vertex position , normal and textCoo INCLUDED !! ) .
In a nutshell : 2.0 does NOTHING for you , and when I say nothing I mean nada , zip , rien , queues d'ales mon gros .
This was annoying at first because instead of improving the quality of the rendition right when you jump on 2.0 , you actually take a few steps back .
This disapointment was fast replaced by the satisfaction to have total access to the GPU .
This unlock the ability to perform all bumpMapping illumination in model space instead of the traditional eye space ( slightly faster ) .
The other thing was the satisfaction to have programmed something totally empty when it was provided .
This is super nerdy but there is nothing like feeling that you really " get " the hardware .
I 've also tried to experiment with an UberShader design : Besides the shadowmap generator there is only one shader in the engine , effects ( shadow , spec mapping , bumpmapping ) are activated via openGL pre-processing during compile time :
// snipet of the fragment shader #ifdef BUMP_MAPPING bump = texture2D ( s_bumpMap , v_texcoord ) .rgb * 2.0 - 1.0 ; lamberFactor = max ( 0.0 , dot( lightVec , bump ) ) ; specularFactor = max ( 0.0 , pow ( dot ( halfVec , bump ) , materialShininess ) ) ; #else lamberFactor = max ( 0.0 , dot( lightVec , v_normal ) ) ; specularFactor = max ( 0.0 , pow ( dot ( halfVec, v_normal ) , materialShininess ) ) ; #endif #ifdef SPEC_MAPPING vec3 matTextColor = texture2D(s_specularMap , v_texcoord ) .rgb ; #else vec3 matTextColor = matColorSpecular ; #endif
Depending on the materials properties used in a scene , the shader is re-compiled at runtime and then cached .
This approach allow to reduce branching operation in the shader .
I was very pleased with the result , if I stay below 10 / 15 shader switches per frame there is no significant performance drop .
Try , Trash , Repeat ....
The most frustrating part is to reach a point where components and the overall design start to feel " not right " .
It generally happen after a serie of " patchwork " when you get to implement things you had n't anticipated from the beginning .
It 's generally a good time to " start over " , keeping your math and loader library ( so you actually do n't redo the boring parts ) .
That may sound like a massive overshot but I found it quite efficient .
Within two months I had to trash numerous components , pretty much everything was written two sometimes three times .
This is of course not realizable if you work in a team or with a lot of legacy but starting from scratch was a luxury I was glad to afford myself .
3GS Neon and SIMD
Trying to push the 3GS Cortex - A8 to the maximum with SIMD instruction provided no gain .
The CPU does perform vectorial operations but not enough to show improvements while using SIMD .
I found the ability to generate a fat binary arm v6 / armv7 via Xcode 's ( Optimized armv6 arm v7 ) option quite neat : Just wrap the maths functions with #ifdef __ARM_NEON__ and you will have no overhead at runtime .
Thanks to Justin Sauders for sharing his NEON / ARM / SIMD library .
The shadow problem
Edit 2011 : As of iOS 4.1 , GL_OES_depth_texture IS supported , you can render directly to a depth buffer .
I love shadows effects , I think the realism and ambiance you get totally justify the cycles and bandwidth cost .
It does n't come for free in openGL and it 's quite ugly to do with the fixed pipeline but I was trilled to have it working on mobile shaders .
Unfortunatly as of today , iPhones do n't support GL_OES_depth_texture , which mean you cannot render directly to the a depth texture .
The workaround is to pack a 32 floating point value into 4x4 bytes color ( RGBA ) texture :
// This is the shadowmap generator shader const vec4 packFactors = vec4 ( 256.0 * 256.0 * 256.0,256.0 * 256.0,256.0,1.0 ) ; const vec4 bitMask = vec4 ( 0.0,1.0/256.0,1.0/256.0,1.0/256.0 ) ; void main ( void ) { float normalized Distance = position .z / position.w ; normalizedDistance = ( normalizedDistance + 1.0 ) / 2.0 ; vec4 packedValue = vec4 ( fract ( packFactors * normalizedDistance ) ) ; packedValue -= packedValue.xxyz * bitMask ; gl_FragColor = packedValue ; }
This method to pack float in bytes is pretty clever ( not mine ) because it accounts for the internal accuracy of any GPU ( via the substraction line ) and hence can be used on any kind of GPU ( PowerVR , ATI , NVidia ) .
Gratz to however came up with this .
And now what ?
A few technical things ( see what can be done to improve the shadows with Variance &| Percentage Closer filtering ) and improve the fixed pipeline with DOT3 bumpMapping or shadow but mainly :
Tools
To write a good engine is a first step to implement something of quality but if artists cannot easily input their creation it 's like you have done nothing .
Doom3 is a good example of a fantastic piece of technology that was impaired during licensing by the need for text files and commandline utility ( besides the difficuly to render outdoor environments ) .
Tools are not necessarily rocket science but they take a lot of time because they need to have a good friendy GUI .
I am going to keep working my ass off because shipping a game has been a dream for a long time now .
Hopefully a talented and motivated artist will cross the road with this piece of code .
I hope I will finish it .
@
The recent Emerging Languages Camp at OSCON ( Coverage of Day 1 and Day 2 ) , featured a long list of talks about new languages at various stages of development , from experiments that were only a few weeks old , more mature languages like Google Go or Newspeak , and veritable oldtimers like D .
JRuby 's Charles Nutter presented the language Mirah , which will appeal to everyone who likes Ruby syntax .
InfoQ caught up with Charles Nutter to see what differentiates Mirah from plain old JRuby and other JVM based languages .
InfoQ : So Mirah , formerly known as Duby , who is it for ?
At present , it seems the best way to describe Mirah is as " a nicer way to write Java . "
So I 'd say the primary target right now is Java developers that want a replacement for javac with a nicer syntax and a few additional features .
InfoQ : Is Mirah a language that every programmer can / should switch to or is it aimed at certain areas ?
Related Sponsored Content Demystifying Microservices for Jakarta EE & Java EE Developers
The goal is create a language that can do everything Java can do , a few things that Ruby can do , and still be as lightweight as possible ( i.e. no runtime library requirements ) .
So anywhere you 'd use Java , you should be able to use Mirah .
It turns out that the Java libraries and most of the Java type system are n't really that cumbersome if you put a little sugar around them .
For me , the best sugar available comes from Ruby syntax and some of Ruby 's " apparent " language features .
We start with Ruby as the syntax and Java or JVM bytecode as the result , and we 'll see how far we can go with that .
InfoQ : How do I use Mirah and Mirah code ?
Is there a compiler or an interpreter ?
Mirah is a statically - typed , compiled language , but it runs well as a script too .
You write what mostly looks like " Ruby with a few type annotations " , and then either use the " mirah " command to run it as a script or the " mirahc " command to compile it to JVM bytecode or Java source .
Both commands also have a " - e " flag for doing quick command - line scripts .
InfoQ :
Once the code 's compiled to JVM bytecodes , how much of a runtime is there to lug around ?
No language feature ( other than support for dynamic invocation ) imposes any library dependencies on you other than the classes you directly reference yourself .
It 's a primary design goal of the language to avoid , for as long as possible , any language - specific runtime .
We may not be able to do that indefinitely , but it 's a good thing to aim for .
All the other JVM languages immediately require you to ship their runtime once you 've written a single line of code .
With Mirah you take source in and get executable code out , and that 's what you ship .
No nonsense .
InfoQ : Do the Mirah binaries lend themselves to being translated to Dex code for Android ?
Certainly !
The Android SDK takes in any JVM bytecode and converts it to Dalvik bytecode , so you can either compile Mirah to JVM bytecode or compile it to Java source and use javac to compile that .
Once you 've compiled Mirah code , it 's basically indistinguishable ( to JVMs and JVM - related tools ) from what javac produces .
InfoQ : Could Mirah become something like Squeak 's Slang for JRuby ?
Ie . a restricted subset of a dynamic language that 's easier to compile to fast code ?
That 's one of the original justifications for making Mirah , and it may happen at some point .
Having JRuby extensions ( or JRuby itself ) written in Mirah could make it more approachable to developers for whom Java syntax is undesirable .
At the moment , however , we 're just focusing on stabilizing Mirah itself and building out missing features .
InfoQ : Is Mirah written in Mirah ( or will that happen at some point ) ?
There are small parts of Mirah written in Mirah now , like the tooling for the Ant task .
We 'd like to move toward being self - hosted , but it 's not currently a primary goal .
Mirah 's codebase is currently almost all written in Ruby , which turns out to be a really nice language ( and runtime ) for building a compiler .
Self - hosting might gain us bragging rights , but unless there 's a compelling improvement over having the toolchain in Ruby it probably wo n't happen soon .
Of course if JRuby were rewritten in Mirah , then we'd be self - hosting in a way ... Mirah would bootstrap JRuby which would bootstrap Mirah .
InfoQ : What 's the delta between Mirah and Ruby , what was added / removed from Ruby to make Mirah from a language / grammar point of view ?
At first we just focused on getting the basic structure of files to compile : classes , methods , instance variables , literals , imports .
As we 've gone forward , we 've added Java - specific features like interfaces and Ruby - specific features like internal iteration ( compiled like Java 5's " for " loops ) and closures ( compiled like Java 's anonymous inner classes . )
We 'll continue to add features from both languages and probably start borrowing some others like implicit conversions ( from Scala ) or explicitly immutable classes ( from Clojure or Seph ) .
It will be interesting to see how much we can do with just a compiler and no runtime library .
InfoQ :
There was some work on other Mirah ( Duby ) backends , eg for .NET .
Yes , Jimmy [ Schementi ] did a prototype of a Duby backend that could output C# source .
I believe it worked well enough to do simple flow control , basic math , and basic literals .
I 'd love to see that work start again .
InfoQ : Are there other backends ?
( Native or LLVM ; Rubinius ) ?
I experimented with a C backend , but the nature of Ruby syntax means the target backend should probably be object - oriented , garbage collected , and structurally similar to Ruby or Java .
A
Go backend might work , for example , or an ooc backend .
Mirah could also target dynamic language runtimes like Ruby itself , ultimately bringing static type - safety at compile time to those backends .
I have not considered what that might look like in practice or whether the dynamic nature of those systems ( e.g. runtime mutable types ) would defeat attempts to build a static language atop them .
InfoQ : How is Mirah tied to the JVM - or if it is n't : how do you keep it independent of the JVM ?
What types , for instance , do developers use ?
Eg. there is ' fixnum ' as type annotation - how 's that defined ?
The type names used are largely defined by the inference and code - generation phases , and can map to whatever is appropriate for the target backend .
In early Mirah code , " fixnum " was used simply as an alias for " int " or " long " .
These days , Mirah code targeting the JVM generally just uses " int " or " long " as the types directly , and all other types are just JVM primitives ( " float " , " double " , etc ) , regular JDK classes , or third - party libraries .
It 's not expected that you 'd take a Mirah program unmodified and run it on a different backend ; that 's not a goal of the language .
But if you know Mirah for one backend , you will have an easier time writing it on another backend , since the apparent features of the language are still the same .
InfoQ :
What 's the community , who are your collaborators ?
Right now most of the compiler work is being done by Ryan Brown from Google , and I 've been contributing when I can .
We have a few other folks submitting patches and adding features , but it 's a fairly young project today .
InfoQ :
Are there any projects , articles , etc by collaborators that you 'd like to point out ?
Phil Hagelberg has a " playground for Android development " called Garrett : http://github.com/technomancy/Garrett
Another contributor who goes by " consiliens " has been working on patching Mirah to support generating GWT applications .
This one is particularly interesting since GWT only processes Java * source * , so there 's basically no way to build GWT applications with most other JVM languages .
John Woodell , also from Google , has been putting together the basics of a web framework called Dubious : http://github.com/mirah/dubious.
He 's taking a similar design approach to Mirah , starting with the structure of a " Rails - like " application and filling in just the blanks necessary to make that compile as Mirah code .
Dubious is an example of building a language around your application or around a library , rather than forcing your application or library to conform to the language .
An easily - understandable compiler and a flexible syntax make that possible in Mirah .
InfoQ : What do numbers look like in Mirah ?
Is there a numerical tower , are there fixed size values that can overflow , is there boxing etc ?
When targeting the JVM , the numerical tower is just that of the JVM .
You have primitive numeric types and their boxed equivalents , and overflow behaves just like when writing Java .
InfoQ : Would JVM support for tagged numbers / immediate types help ?
It would help us in the same way that it would help Java , in that boxed numbers would cost considerably less to construct and use .
Outside that , there 's no pressing need for tagged numbers , since Mirah supports Java 's primitive types as well .
InfoQ : What are the metaprogramming features ?
Metaprogramming comes primarily in the form of compile - time macros , which are how many of Mirah 's apparent features are implemented .
Closures , for example , are translated by the compiler into their equivalent anonymous inner class form .
Iteration over a java.util .
Collection type is translated into external iteration using java.util .
Iterator .
By writing the compiler in Ruby , it becomes very easy to create macros that perform these translations , allowing you to design the language to suit your need .
I would also like to add two key features to make Mirah feel a bit more like Ruby : open classes , which would be compiled like extension methods on C# ; and implicit type conversions , which would behave much like they do in Scala .
These two simple features can give a statically - typed language a much more dynamic feel , and both can be supported without shipping a runtime library .
The source code for Mirah is available at GitHub .
A lot of people have been asking me about my fitness philosophy to help get a leaner , healthier body .
So I created a video to answer that question .
I also wanted to create some context for all the exercise and nutrition videos that I will be adding in the future .
If you blend these 3 elements I discuss into your life , I really do believe you can reach your potential !
The one thing I would like to add to this video is that being lean is really a lifestyle .
Not every lean person has the same exact lifestyle , but the vast majority of people who are lean in my opinion infuse these 3 elements into their lives .
I hope you enjoyed this video and I encourage you to share it with friends !
Also , am I missing anything ?
What would you add ?

“ You Got Bailed Out We Got Sold Out ” –Thousands Protest on Wall Street
Thousands of people turned out for a protest on Wall Street Thursday to denounce the taxpayer - funded bailout and the role of large financial firms in the nation ’s economic crisis .
A coalition of union and community groups organized the march as the Senate opened debate on a measure to overhaul financial regulation .

via “ You Got Bailed Out We Got Sold Out ” – Thousands Protest on Wall Street
A couple of days ago , I was a special guest host at a press screening of the new Batman direct to DVD movie “ Under the Red Hood ” .
I did n’t actually work on this movie , but I ’ve done enough other things with the Batman animated franchise to allow me to perform a little song , a little dance , a little seltzer down my pants , for the press , and to play cheerleader for this film .
I also had to watch it a couple of times as part of the gig .
Well , I ’d be playing cheerleader for this film whether they asked me or not .
It ’s easily the best DC animated film since Return of the Joker , and in my top ten super - hero films of any kind .
It ’s smart , beautifully directed by Brandon Vietti , with a quick pace and great emotional heart .
The action sequences are exciting , while at the same time , clear ( I wish you could say the same for most big budget blockbusters ) .
There ’s no fat in the plot , it ’s all tasty , tasty meat in every scene .
There ’s solid voice talent in the new cast , including John ( Bender ) DiMaggio as Joker , Jensen ( Supernatural ) Ackles as Red Hood , Neil Patrick Harris ( Dr. Horrible ) as Nightwing , Bruce ( Chris Pike of Star Trek ) Greenwood as Batman , and Bruce Timm ( WTF ? ) as the Riddler !
Wade Williams ( from Prison Break ) steals every scene he ’s in , as the Black Mask .
So does NPH as Nightwing .
This Batman fan was in hog heaven .
Go HERE if you want to see the trailer online .
A couple of caveats :
If you ’re familiar with the Batman comics written by Judd Winnick ( specifically his 2005 Red Hood stories ) then you ’ll know most of the twists and turns of the story , as the script ( by Winnick himself ) is faithful as hell to his original material ( with bits and pieces from his new Red Hood series , and Starlin ’s “ Death in the Family ” thrown into the mix ) .
But rather than feeling like a re-hash of familiar events , the script deftly streamlines many year ’s worth of continuity , and packs it all into a neat little 80 minute thriller that ’s a far more natural fit for the story .
Caveat Number
Two :
Do n’t put the kiddies in front of the TV with this one .
In tone it ’s far closer to the Chris Nolan Batman films than previous DC Direct titles .
The opening scene features a crowbar , some bones and some blood , and although it ’s an animated sequence , it ’s tough to watch .
This stuff is n’t added gratuitously ( the first scene is integral to the plot ) , I ’m just warning that animated do n’t mean ALL AGES .
Now , where can I get a PROPER copy of the DVD ( instead of my press screener ) ?
Apparently , it ’s got DVD extras like crazy !
A bunch of BATMAN ADVENTURES episodes , tons of “ making of ” features , and an all new Jonah Hex animated adventure .
I WANT MY PROPER COPY !
I WANT MY PROPER COPY !
Ty the Guy OUT !
PS : I complained about the whole RED HOOD comic book storyline in an earlier post .
Go here to read it .
Clearly the movie makes it all better .
ANOTHER PS : Apparently , I was n’t the only one at the screening who liked the film :
Here ’s some positive reviews from nerdgirlpinups , and here ’s another at thisweekingeek.net , both seemed to enjoy this DVD and were nice enough to liberally quote me and my leaping enthusiasm .
Plus , I got to be BRIEFLY interviewed by one of the Naked News ladies , who also seemed to love the film .
Fortunately for all concerned , I retained my pants .
To share post :
The sculptor who created ' The Angel of the North ' has unveiled his first project in Scotland - a group of life - sized figures standing in or near the Waters of Leith in Edinburgh .
Anthony Gormley spoke to the BBC's Lorna Gordon about his " naked rusty men in a ditch " .
THE advertising watchdog receives many complaints from the public .
Some are justified , some are questionable .
Some are a bit ridiculous .
Telstra has been forced to defend the treatment of a pet cat in a video filmed more than 20 years ago that it featured in one of its TV ads .
The company decided to include the popular " Keyboard Cat " video clip in one of its ads for the T - Hub phone earlier this year .
The YouTube video , which has been viewed more than 8 million times , shows Fatso the cat appearing to play a simple melody on a keyboard .
But while he might delight bloggers , Fatso has rubbed at least one TV viewer the wrong way .
After seeing Telstra 's ad , one animal lover made an official complaint to the Advertising Standards Bureau ( ASB ) alleging that it was cruel .
" The cat is clearly being forced to play this piano does not appear to be comfortable and quite frankly I think it 's cruel to depict a living animal being treated like a puppet , " said the complainant .
Telstra disputed the allegation , saying Fatso appeared to be " at ease " and " laid back " .
The company added : " It is very difficult to make a cat do anything it does not like without an obvious struggle . "
The bureau dismissed the complaint , saying in a case report that it " considered that most members of the community would consider the depiction of the cat playing the piano as humorous " .
ASB boss Fiona Jolly told news.com .au the complaint had been the only one received about the Telstra ad .
" Australia ’s self - regulation system allows for the diversity of cultures , beliefs and lifestyles of the Australian community , " she said .
" With such a diverse community , we expect to get wide ranging views expressed in the complaints we receive . "
Telstra said it had no comment beyond those published in the case report .
Keyboard Cat is the basis of an internet joke that sees Fatso " play off " people in other YouTube videos who have done something embarrassing .
The clip was originally filmed in 1984 by Fatso's owner Charlie Schmidt , who manipulated the cat 's legs to make it appear he was playing the keyboard .
It was then uploaded to YouTube in 2007 , where it became popular .
Fatso reportedly passed away in 2000 .
Watch the Telstra ad below :
1495 : The Scottish government records it has commissioned Friar Jon Cor to make Scotch whisky – the first mention in print of an elixir which has since brought down many a government , made friends of enemies and enemies of friends , lubricated good , great and bad writing , and ... well , suffice it to say a touch would hit the spot right about now , as I stare into this blank page .
Exact references of this momentous occasion are somewhat thin , and the underlying peg for a tech news organization even thinner .
But I would say , with some authority , that Scotch and its many delightful cousins are , if not constant companions in this line of work , at least central to the media ecosystem of reward and motivation .
No respectable bar can exist without Scotch – as well as at least a couple of single malts to which ' twould be blasphemous to add so much as an ice cube .
That is so my friend , even though some 90 percent of the world 's Scotch is of the blended variety , and of that , predominantly examples that should be relegated to the rail .
But I digress .
Though , now that I think of it , perhaps a wee dram is in order .
To welcome the muse , as it were .
The usually verbose Wikipedia reveals almost nothing about this event , except to quote what was written on that day :
To Friar John Cor , by order of the King , to make aqua vitae VIII bolls of malt .
— Exchequer Rolls 1494 –95 , Vol x , p. 487 .
So many questions remain :
We do n’t know if the order was actually fulfilled ( eight bolls is enough for 1,500 bottles of whisky ) .
But not giving the king his due was not a good career ( or life ) move .
The King of Scots at the time was James IV , known in military history for his disastrous rout by the English at Flodden in 1513 .
But it has also been said of James : " [ A ] s his gallantries were numerous , he had many illegitimate children . "
So , to be sure , the man knew a thing or two about partying .
Nor do we know the kind of Scotch whisky Friar Cor whipped up , if even he did , or if it would have pleased our modern palates some 500 years later .
" Malt " is a clue – by today 's definitions it might have been a single or a blended malt , as opposed to grain , but was it distilled solely by our fair friar or a whole cadre of monks ?
And how much was kept in reserve ?
And exactly how did they build on the ancient traditions in this , the world 's first known scotch distillery , from the original Celtic alchemy of fermentation ?
Oh , the mysteries ...
And there 's that whole * aqua vitae * business – what of that ?
Yes , well .
Glad you asked .
Pour me ' nother , oh , two fingers , and I 'll enlighten you .
Right : " Whisky , " you see , is derived from the Gaelic " uisge beatha " or " usquebaugh , " which means " water ( aqua ) of life ( vitae ) . "
As I sip my single malt this fine eve , I must admit it does indeed feel essential to life – surely as necessary as water at any rate .
And as I approach ( approach , mind you , and surely have not crossed ) that tipping point of glee and indifference , I can understand how " usque " could easily be slurred into " whisky . "
But : Gaelic means Ireland you say ?
Well , therein lies a tale , too .
I would n't say no to a generous pour as I educate you ...
Yes , 'tis true all forms of Gaelic are rooted in Middle Irish , but the particular Gaelic relevant to this story is in fact from that branch of Celtic spoken in the Highlands of ... Scotland !
So ask me , dear friends , what might Scotch whisky be called in Britain ?
Here 's a hint :
It 's not bourbon .
There are in Scotland currently 42 distilleries – the only place they can be located and still produce a properly named " Scotch " distillation .
So , Jack Daniels is referred to as American whiskey , the way sparkling wine from California can't be called champagne .
Speaking of the Americas – were n't we ? – what nation is the greatest importer of Scotch ?
The United States , of course .
And business was never better than in 2009 , as we drowned our collective sorrows during the worldwide economic collapse .
OK , this is getting depressing , and it is such a lovely evening .
Though I really must be going .
Is that rain ?
Well , maybe a short one to wait it out .
I 'll be on my way for sure as soon as I get to the bottom of this Friar Cor business .
Souse : Varioush
Photos : 1 ) " I hope you 're not serious about those ice cubes . "

But the FCC wants to know , and is willing to put consumer privacy at risk to find out .
The FCC cares deeply about broadband .
We know that because it released a 360 - page report called The National Broadband Plan and set up a website called www.broadband.gov.
Also , the Commissioners nowadays pepper their speeches with references to the importance of broadband .
Harder to find is evidence of similar interest outside the Beltway .
Or even outside FCC headquarters .
When the FCC went looking , it found mostly apathy .
The FCC conducted a survey of broadband service .
Not of how many people receive broadband , or what speeds they get , these being issues the FCC has long tracked .
Rather , it looked into whether people know their broadband speeds .
In case the importance of this datum is not obvious ( it was n’t to us ) , FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski explains :
“ The more broadband subscribers know about what speeds they need and what speeds they get , the more they can make the market work and push faster speeds over broadband networks . ”
If the Chairman is right , the market is not working .
Eighty percent of U.S. broadband users do not know the speed of their Internet connection s .
We are shocked !
Well , not really , but we might be shocked if were not part of the ignorant 80 % .
With all the earnestness of a middle - school science fair project , the FCC breaks down these numbers by population groups .
The results are about what you would expect .
Most likely to know their broadband speeds are men , young people , whites , and people with higher incomes – the same groups , by and large , that show the most interest in technology generally .
( Note to emailers : yes , we know there are many exceptions . )
But there is also good news .
Even though many of us may not pay much attention to the details , we still know what we like .
Ninety - one percent of users report being satisfied with their broadband speeds ( whatever those are ) .
This is a startling statistic .
It is hard to imagine anything else that satisfies 91 % of Americans .
A person handing out free money on the street would not draw that high an approval rating .
The broadband industry must be doing something right .
The not - so - satisfied nine percent are not further identified , but we think we know who they are : namely , people with teenagers who incessantly download Facebook videos and watch TV over YouTube and Hulu .
These are people who need twenty minutes to open an ordinary email .
As to them , the FCC might as well give up .
Teenagers can consume bandwidth as fast as providers can install it .
The data show an interesting anomaly .
Seventy - one percent of respondents say they actually receive the speed their broadband provider promises , either “ always ” or “ most of the time ” .
Combine this with the reported fact of 80 % cluelessness as to speed .
The result ?
Fully half the broadband - using population have no idea what their speed is , yet are confident that it equals the advertised speed !
How can that be ?
Maybe Americans just have implicit trust that their phone and cable companies always deliver what they promise .
Or maybe , after long enough on the phone answering silly questions , people start giving the interviewer random answers out of sheer boredom .
At any rate , having found that unsuspected vein of ignorance , the FCC also has ideas to attack it .
For one thing , the FCC offers a website that blows back the curtains of darkness and reveals your own broadband speed .
Just browse to this FCC - provided link and click a few buttons .
When you do , the FCC will collect your address before it tests your speed .
The FCC “ may use this [ address ] data to analyze broadband availability on a geographic basis . ”
Not a systematic technique for gathering data , but harmless enough .
Harmless , that is , so long as the FCC does not use the information for anything else .
But when we click through to the fine print , we find eight different situations in which the FCC can disclose your address .
Read them here .
None requires a warrant , or even a subpoena .
This is just one of them :
“ Where there is an indication of a violation or potential violation of a statute , regulation , rule , or order . . . . ”
That alone covers a lot of ground .
Considering how hard it is to know exactly what on the Internet is legal , some people may not want the FCC to have their address on file along with their connection details .
More cautious broadband users can bypass the FCC address screen and go directly to the identical speed test sites by clicking here and here .
The Internet also offers many other free speed tests , including this one and this one .
( Commlawblog does not endorse any of these . )
Alternatively , instead of just telling the FCC your address , you can invite them over to your house to install a box that monitors and reports your Internet activity .
You think we ’re kidding , right ?
We ’re not .
The box – which the FCC refers to as the “ SamKnows Whitebox ” ( seriously , we could n’t make this stuff up ) – will report data on your web surfing , peer - to - peer video download , video streaming , file download and upload , online gaming , and VoIP .
The FCC emphasizes how secure the system is against outside hackers .
But frankly , it ’s not outside hackers that concern us most .
The FCC has not yet told us how it will use the collected information , or when it might disclose the details to law enforcement .
Presumably it will let us know before installation .
We suspect the more sophisticated users will keep the FCC at a safe distance .
In consequence , whatever data result from these boxes are not likely to be representative .
The FCC is also trying to figure out how to get comparable data from mobile broadband users .
Among its questions : “ Are there any legal , security , privacy or data sensitivity issues with collecting device level data ?
If so , how can these issues be addressed ? ”
The simple answer is apparent : do n’t collect any personal information on the person using the device .
When George Orwell published 1984 , the most intrusive technology he could think of was a two - way TV that monitored citizens ’ activities .
Orwell would have loved ( or hated ) the Internet .
Not that the FCC is in any danger of morphing into Big Brother .
But it should be possible for the government to promote broadband , and even monitor its deployment , without gathering data on individual users .
Or , if such data are essential to the FCC ’s mission , it could ask Congress to authorize an absolutely airtight , no-exceptions privacy protection .
The only alternative is to trust the Government ’s competence and discretion .
That has not always worked out so well in the past .

Do you ever wish you had a magic wand ?
In the development office of a small nonprofit , it sometimes seems magic is the only way you ’ll ever get everything done .
You know your success depends on building relationships and touching prospects multiple times in multiple ways –“ dripping ” on them until they are ready to give their first gift and then drawing them closer to the core of your work , inspiring to give more regularly .
It ’s pretty easy to understand the concept , but the work itself can be overwhelming , especially for just one person .
Unfortunately , I am not your fairy godmother , or even an “ As Seen on TV ” spokesperson so I can offer no magical means to turn strangers into donors .
Does that mean small nonprofits are out - of - luck ?
No. Relationship - building takes time ; but it is too important to cut corners during the process , much less skip it altogether .
Instead , you can implement a tool that helps you create a strong foundation upon which to build desirable relationships .
With some time and a little bit of money invested upfront , an e-mail auto - responder can help you reach more people every day .
What is an auto - responder ?
An auto - responder is a special type of automated e-mail tool designed to send prospective donors a series of messages over a period of several months .
Because the messages are written by you and targeted toward a very specific audience , they read like personal e-mail sent directly from you to a single recipient ; and because the messages are sent by an e-mail marketing service , you do n’t have to remember who is supposed to get which message when .
While there are some similarities between an auto - responder series and your electronic newsletter , there is one big difference : Instead of sending the same message to your whole list at the same time , the auto - responder delivers a sequence of messages to prospective donors over time .
Each person gets the first message immediately after she signs up and then gets the rest of the messages sequentially , usually one or two messages a week .
Not sure how that will help you reach more people ?
Here are two of the most effective ways to use auto - responders in the development office .
Orientation material
One way to keep new donors engaged is to make sure they know about the many inspiring things your organization does , how you do them , and what kind of support you need to continue to thrive .
Most of that information probably already exists on your website , in annual reports , in grant applications , and marketing materials ; but new donors usually do n’t take it upon themselves to find and digest all of that information on their own .
If , however , that same information is delivered to their inbox in bite - sized chunks in a way that rewards them for reading , the chance of your messages getting through is much higher .
With a new donor orientation series in place , contact through phone calls , e-mails , and donation requests will be received by engaged , informed donors who are accustomed to hearing from you on a regular basis .
E-classes
Orientation material is great for people , especially new donors , who have already decided that they believe in your organization and want to know more .
But what about people who are n’t quite ready to write a check ?
Offering an e-class via auto - responder is an efficient way to gently pull those people in , give them something of value , and , at the same time , help you earn the right to talk to them about how they can help your organization grow .
For a great example of how an e-class idea works , sign up for Sonia Simone ’s e-mail and content marketing class .
The course makes great use of the auto - responder concept , while the class itself gives great advice on how to make your own e-mail marketing too valuable to delete .
Sonia ’s work is specifically targeted at marketing for small businesses , but the concepts are 100 % applicable to nonprofit development work .
For a more nonprofit - specific idea of how a course like this works , check out my course on using volunteers to amplify your message .
A word of caution
The auto - responder is a great tool for building stronger relationships with supporters , but it ’s still just a tool .
Using an auto - responder series does n’t change the fact that people give to people , and that development is all about building relationships .
Just like putting a “ donate now ” button on your website wo n’t automatically lead to regular online giving , an auto - responder series wo n’t pull in prospects on its own .
It simply gives you the opportunity to deliver the core pieces of your organization ’s message in a consistent and efficient way , providing you with more time to focus on the relationship - building tasks only a person can do .
How do I get started ?
If you are already using an e-mail marketing service , you may be able to use the same service to deliver your auto - responder courses .
If not , setting up an account with a new company is simple and most offer discounted pricing for nonprofits .
You have several options .
iContact , Mail Chimp and Aweber all offer fully - featured autoresponders .
Each company ’s pricing structure is different , focusing on slightly different features ; therefore , it ’s worth exploring several before you decide which one to use .
Constant Contact also offers an autoresponder but it has limited features , so unless you are a die - hard fan , I suggest you try one of the other providers .
( Vertical Response does not offer the autoresponder feature at this time ) .

( CNN ) --
Lightning strikes apparently caused a major fire at a gasoline pipeline company 's " tank farm " in North Carolina early Sunday morning , fire officials said .
The blaze started at Colonial Pipeline Company in Greensboro after midnight , said David Douglas , an assistant fire chief in Greensboro .
A tank holding about 20,000 barrels of gasoline -- about half that tank 's capacity -- caught fire .
While some of the gasoline burned , some of it was safely transferred to another tank , according to Steve Baker , Colonial Pipeline 's director of communications .
Firefighters used foam to extinguish the flames on the tank , Baker said , adding that Greensboro firefighters kept water hoses trained on other tanks in the sprawling complex to keep them cool and prevent the fire from spreading .
The huge facility is near Piedmont Triad International Airport , and the massive blaze sent plumes of smoke throughout the area .
The blaze caused the temporary closure of a portion of Interstate 40 , the North Carolina Department of Transportation said .
There were no evacuations , Douglas said .
CNN 's Divina Mims contributed to this story .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People put forward a resolution yesterday formally accusing the Tea Party movement of racism .
That ’s ironic coming from an organization whose mission is to promote the fortunes of one particular racial group .
Post - racial America has yet to arrive for many black leaders .
President Obama has shown little interest in leading the national dialogue on race he once proposed , and civil rights groups are unwilling or unable to reach beyond their usual tired rhetoric .
Saying the Tea Party movement contains “ racist elements that are a threat to democracy ” is a shameful slap at the millions of Americans untainted by bigotry who oppose Mr. Obama ’s radical leftist policies regardless of his color .
The Rev. C.L. Bryant , a black Tea Party activist who used to be an NAACP chapter president in Texas , said charges of racism are lies intended to further a liberal political agenda .
ABC
News quoted him as saying the NAACP wants to “ create a climate where they can say that those on the right are in fact racist and those on the left are their saviors .
This is very much what the liberal agenda is about . ”
Blacks who show any signs of independent thinking do so at their peril .
In August , Kenneth Gladney , a black Tea Partier from Missouri , was severely beaten by two thugs from the Service Employees International Union .
The NAACP started a campaign to defend Mr. Gladney ’s assailants , saying the victim was an “ Uncle Tom ” who was “ not black enough ” to protect .
Last week , the Project 21 black leadership network asked Mr. Obama for the second time to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the Justice Department ’s failure to prosecute New Black Panther Party members for blatant , race - based voter intimidation in Philadelphia in 2008 .
Project 21 Chairman Mychal Massie wrote that “ the problem has festered to a point where perceptions of racial bias within your Justice Department cannot be ignored . ”
The perceptions were reinforced July 6 when former Justice Department official J. Christian Adams , who resigned to protest the handling of the case , testified to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights that Justice Department attorneys in the Civil Rights Division were instructed to ignore cases that involved black defendants and white victims .
Justice apparently is not colorblind .
Black Panther Minister King Samir Shabazz , otherwise known as Maurice Heath , was one of the people engaging in voter intimidation .
He also was featured in a January 2009 video proclaiming to a black audience , “ You want freedom ?
You ’re gonna have to kill some crackers !
You ’re gonna have to kill some of their babies ! ” Mr. Shabazz added , “ I hate white people - all of them !
Every last iota of a cracker , I hate ‘ em . ”
The Washington Times ’ Kerry Picket reported last summer on Jerry Jackson , another accused Black Panther and an elected member of Philadelphia ’s 14th Ward Democratic Party committee .
His interests , according to his MySpace page , are : “ BLACK POWER , BLACK LOVE , BLACK UNITY , BLACK MINDS , KILLIN CRAKKKAS . ”
These are the kind of violent black extremists that Attorney General Eric Holder ’s Justice Department is coddling .
No such comparable hateful language has come out of the Tea Party movement .
The NAACP ’s tired racial rhetoric is simply the product of a time long gone .
It has been almost half a century since the Civil Rights Act was passed .
The United States elected a black president .
American society has closed the racial divide .
However , those who benefit politically from keeping the racial wound fresh continue to wave the bloody shirt and smear those who disagree with their hard - left political agenda .
It will take more than a beer summit to heal the racial wounds these black leaders are inflicting on the country .

Standing in the Soul
Robert Hunter interview
INTRODUCTION
I spoke with Robert Hunter at " the Office , " the Grateful Dead 's Victorian headquarters in San Rafael , sitting under the six original charcoal sketches for the back cover of Workingman 's Dead .
It was Hunter 's lyrics on that album for " Uncle John 's Band , " " Easy Wind " and " Cumberland Blues " that first drew me to his work :
His narratives of miners and pioneers , gamblers and jackballers , were California to me before I ever saw California , an imagination of the American West that alloyed the live Dead 's jazz - inspired sea journeys with song traditions of ballads and blues .
If the Dead pried open doors to new musical domains with their " blues with progressions / modeled on the tesseract " ( as Hunter put it ) , it was Hunter who put people in them , in the characters of August West , Delia DeLyon , the Candyman , and the nameless sailor from Carlisle who braved a lion 's den to retrieve a fan tossed by his beloved .
Hunter mined a vein struck by Bob Dylan and Robbie Robertson of rock and roll as social history , and Hunter 's people are mortal , fallible , caught by the storyteller 's lamp just at the moment of decision .
His portrayals are redemptive , in the sense of Nelson Algren 's statement that one calling of the American writer is to " stand with the accused .
Hunter 's debut as a poet was the publication of his translation of Rilke 's Duino Elegies in 1987 .
Since then , he has published Night Cadre , a collection of poems distinguished by their self - effacing wit and fractal - faceted philosophical inquiry , and Idiot 's Delight , written for Raymond Foye 's Hanuman series , a beguiling meditation on appetite that reads like an improvised sutra .
Next year , Viking will release The Bride of Entropy , a series of three long poems including " An American Adventure , " a very funny metaphoric recollection of the Dead 's haphazard mission written from the deep inside , and the sharpest x-ray of the ambitions of Hunter 's generation that I 've read .
His collected lyrics is called Box of Rain .
Hunter has spent his adult life just out of view of the magnifying glass of fame .
He is forthcoming about what he feels comfortable talking about , and glides easily into warm husky baritone song .
The poet 's road of small - press submissions and readings is still new to him , as he explains here , and he has put himself out on that road with the enthusiasm of a beginner and the honed tools of a passionate and meticulous craftsman .
He is plainly honored to be giving readings in the company of those he admires .
In Box of Rain , Hunter recounts the best compliment he ever got for a lyric , from a miner who had worked the Cumberland lode .
Hearing " Cumberland Blues , " the old miner said , " I wonder what the guy who wrote this song would 've thought if he'd ever known something like the Grateful Dead was gonna do it ? "
SILBERMAN : You 've put yourself into the public view a lot more as a poet in the last few months than you have for years when you were more reclusive or more exclusively a performer of songs .
How does that feel ?
HUNTER : I 've been writing poetry more or less exclusively , with some breaks for lyrics , for about five years now .
I 'm just beginning to feel I 've got the knack .
I 've done a bunch of cautious readings over the last year or two , and flopped on some of them , and learned from them , and am starting to feel that I 'm getting a style of my own .
My first reading , the lines I would love to have said were not written on the paper .
So I 'd go back and write those lines , and I 'm beginning to understand how much poetry is a spoken art .
What goes on the paper ought to be able to come out of your mouth also , with ease and fluidity .
I 'm feeling comfortable with it now , so it 's time to let it rip .
SILBERMAN : What were the first books of poems you read , that started you out ?
HUNTER : About 25 years ago I was visiting a girlfriend in the City , and there was this little orange book in her bookcase that I pulled out .
It was On Out , by Lew Welch , and I thought , " How long has this been going on ? "
Before the Poetry Flash benefit the other night there was who I thought was a street performer out there , entertaining the crowd outside .
It was like hearing bits of old jokes , the lines were so familiar .
All of a sudden I realized , " My God , that 's Lew Welch ! "
It was Kush , doing Lew Welch .
I presume he was doing it as Lew Welch would , ' cause Kush would have the tapes , if there were any .
SILBERMAN : What was the quality of Lew Welch 's poems that spoke to you ?
HUNTER : There was a beautiful line in one of them , " Trails go nowhere , they end exactly / where you stop . "
There was a lot of wisdom in it , and an easiness , and a fluidity of language .
Very , very appealing .
I would say that was my beginning turn - on .
I was ready to get bonked over the head with something , and that book was there for it .
SILBERMAN : Were you living in the Haight at this point ?
HUNTER : South of Market , in some alley or other I forget the name of .
I lived over the corner of Fillmore and Fell , I lived over at 710 for a short space of time [ the Dead 's communal house at 710 Ashbury ] , and over in the Mission , and like that .
I was in and around the area without specifically landing in the Haight that much .
I 'd go over to visit the Dead at 710 .
SILBERMAN : Were you conscious of yourself as a poet at that point ?
HUNTER : No .
I 've only been conscious of myself as a poet for about the last 4 years .
I looked up to poets , I thought they were doing something that I could n't do .
There was an editor in England who was interested in having me write some poetry , so I wrote a book of poetry .
She presented it to the readers without telling them who wrote it , many of whom she said were fans of my lyric work .
They rejected it ; they said it was all " too stiff . "
And indeed it was .
I was living in England at the time , and I had some idea of poetry that harkened back about a century -- which a person will do with no training whatsoever .
SILBERMAN : There 's a certain level of self - conscious archaism in your lyrics , and in your translations .
It 's interesting to see how it works differently in songs and translations , and in open - form poetry .
It 's less present in your open - form poetry , like in Night Cadre and Idiot 's Delight .
HUNTER : That 's a process of slowly vacuuming that stuff out , by having other models .
One of the things that has cleaned my act up was falling in love with the Language poets .
SILBERMAN : How did that happen ?
HUNTER : It was as simple as buying Doug Messerli 's book , The Language Poets .
I opened it in the store and said , " Whoo !-- This is like the stuff I used to write 25 years ago at the depths of my madness . "
Then I got Ron Silliman 's book ,
In the American Tree , and read all the way through that .
This was speaking directly to me .
I got interested in the individual poets , and started building a collection , and then I invited Lyn Hejinian and Carla Harriman to read with me .
The freedom that Language poetry opened up helped to dust away the Victorian cobwebs from my own work .
SILBERMAN : One of the interesting tensions between your work and the work of the Language poets is that one of your particular gifts is in riffing off of rhythms of speech with extreme playfulness , so that in a lot of your lyric work , and also in Idiot 's Delight , you 're deconstructing vivid bits of spoken language by either slightly varying the rhythms , or making percussive jokes out of the rhythms , jamming with the inevitable quality of little jive phrases , like kids on a streetcorner " playing the dozens . "
One of the projects of the Language poets , it seems to me , is moving away from a speech - based poetics that American poetry has been concerned with since Williams , Pound , on through Olson 's projective verse , and Creeley , though Creeley starts to cut into different areas with the extreme acuity of his line breaks .
I 'm curious as how a speech - based lyric poet came up against this body of work that wants to get away from the limitations of speech - based poetics .
HUNTER : What 's that I Ching phrase , " persistence in galling limitation . "
Eventually it will all take you somewhere else .
It was probably translating Rilke that was the beginning of the breakthrough for me .
Rilke matched , very much , my idea of where I thought English poetry should be , which will show how far out of date I was .
It 's a very fine archaic - laden German that he writes , that harks way back in nineteenth century forms .
After doing the Rilke translation , living it , I was no longer totally satisfied with regular meter and rhyme .
It was time to look elsewhere .
I still love lyric writing , but I 'd say , more and more , that my first love is the language in its freer forms .
SILBERMAN : How different does it feel to you working with a regular rhyme scheme , and to sit down and write in an open form ?
HUNTER : For quite a while , I had to be doing one or the other .
If I had a bunch of lyrics that I had to write , I would not write poetry during that time .
I did n't believe that I could do the two things together , but now I 'm getting the Bride of Entropy book together , and there 's Grateful Dead stuff to be done , and I 've been writing lyrics for [ local band ]
Zero , and it's come to where I seem to be able to juggle with both hands , different objects .
I 'm not someone who outlines , and knows what he 's going to write to begin with .
Which is why I 'm also a rewriter .
I just start and what happens next , happens next .
It directs itself .
Then I start seeing the flow of it .
Like as not , if I 'm working on a song , the first verse will go away .
I get into it , then I throw off the top part and continue .
SILBERMAN : The song " Box of Rain " began as a rough vocal outline from Phil [ Dead bassist Lesh ] .
How does that process work ?
HUNTER : Scat singing : " Dum - dum dum , da - da - da - da , bump - dum - dum - dum - dum , dee - dee - dee . "
I 'm able to translate peoples ' scat .
I hear English in it , almost as though I write down what I hear underneath that .
I hear the intention .
It 's a talent like the Rubik 's Cube , or something like that , and it comes easily to me .
Which might be why I like Language poetry .
I can tell from the rhythms , or lack of rhythms , from the disjunctures and the end stoppages , what they 're avoiding saying -- the meaning that they would like to not be stating there , comes rushing through to me .
I understand dogs .
I can talk to babies .
A cat dictated " China Cat Sunflower " to me .
It was just sittin ' on my stomach , purring away , and sayin ' this stuff .
I just write it down ; I guess it 's plagiarism .
I 've credited the cat , right ?
[ laughing ]
Before I was writing songs , I was a stoned James Joyce head , Finnegan 's Wake head .
I can still recite the first page and last couple of pages of that thing .
There was something in the way those words socketed together , and the wonderful feel of reciting them , that very , very deeply influenced me .
SILBERMAN : Paul Simon says that when he sits down to write a song , he 'll often scat sing to himself over a melody , and keep running through that until syllables find their way into the scatting , and eventually words find their way into the syllables .
HUNTER : If I 'm under pressure , writing a song and the band wants something right away , I 'll write whatever nonsense scans .
Then once I 've got the scan , seeing where the rhymes and accents are going to fall , it 's a fairly simple matter to translate it into English .
And leave some of it untranslated , too .
It 's interesting that way .
SILBERMAN : A lot of the motifs you use in your poetry are , in a sense , not English .
There are so many names that you invent , that are pure syllabic music .
HUNTER : Like " Preserpie and Senti Yagoya " [ unpublished ] .
I like the poem and its character , so I decided to lengthen it .
Finally , the other day , after going through nine or ten drafts , quadrupling , quintupling it in length , there was only one thing that I had added that did it any service .
I had to go right back to square one .
It 's got a line in it --[ sings ] , " A thousand miles I came to hear a bear play violin .
The bear played violin , not well , but better than you expect from a bear . "
I 've got a lot of things tucked away .
I 've got my Faust tucked away , that I 've been working on for years and years .
Idiot 's Delight began in England , and it was all in Spenserian stanzas , which is a challenging way to work .
All I kept from that for the book was a little bit of the feel , and the title .
And the rest of it 's just tucked away .
I 'm very pleased with it , but it is idiocy .
Benign Spenserian idiocy .
SILBERMAN : I think there 's a casual ease to that book that serves the different voices that come to terms with one another in it .
It 's breezy without being insubstantial .
HUNTER : When Raymond Foye asked me to write something for Hanuman , I said " Why do n't you take my verse translations of the Sonnets to Orpheus ? , " and sent it off .
And Raymond said there 's no way that this could fit into the Hanuman format .
I said , " What if you were to turn it sideways , or print it across the page ? "
He asked his printer ; it could n't be done .
He said , " Maybe you could just write something for the format . "
I did plan in advance to have 11 sections of 11 verses of 11 lines , and then I just went for it .
That 's why , as it gets to the end , it says that I 'm gettin ' a little tired of this piece now , but it requires an exact verse count , so I start talkin ' about the home team and the weather .
I did n't put a lot of importance on it at the time .
And that 's often the best way to work .
SILBERMAN :
In that book it seems as if it 's the small - page format that is the structural container , whereas with your lyrics it would be the melody , or the scan .
HUNTER : The song , its place on the record . . .
SILBERMAN :
When you write lyrics , do you think of things like where the song will go on the record ?
HUNTER : Yes .
You want to vary the pace and the emotional feel .
You definitely want a kicker to make somebody want to turn the record over at the end of side A , and then a grand statement to end side 2 .
But that 's all changed with CD .
Now it 's one longer continuum .
I like it .
I always felt limited by that .
SILBERMAN : Can you give me an example of when thinking in that way might have influenced the scale of a song ?
HUNTER : I have this short little piece , " Lady Simplicity . "
I did n't have a song that seemed to properly kick in and get Rum Runners [ Hunter 's first solo album ] going .
So I wrote this little chorale piece to start it off , and then I did n't have a piece that I felt ended the record satisfactorily , so I did " Boys in the Barroom . "
These were written to begin and end an album , because the other pieces all wanted to be in the middle somewhere , hanging onto each other for dear life .
SILBERMAN : One of the things that is really singular in terms of how your work is heard is that your lyrics comprise a narrative that is assembled by Garcia , or by the band , in the course of a Dead show , as the band builds a " set . "
Do you notice that when you go to shows , how your lyrics are being ordered by the shape of a set ?
HUNTER : Well , I do n't tend to hear it that way .
Although certainly I have heard , on a specific night , when some event has happened that the gig might be said to relate to , that the songs will , just naturally , hit into a flow that 'll cause them to be commenting on the World Series , or whatever natural disaster has happened .
I do n't believe that 's a conscious thing , for the most part .
This band is known for dense subconsciousness .
A lot of it is the Muse .
I just started work on an essay last night , because I told Anne Waldman that I would go to Naropa , and I was informed that I had to give a 90 minute lecture .
And I went , " Me? Lecture ? " I 've got no retentive memory at all .
I do n't remember the names of poets .
I do n't remember anything but the feel of them .
So I 've decided to write a lecture called " Courting the Muse . "
That 's one thing I do know something about :
Here , kitty , kitty , kitty !
SILBERMAN : The Muse is often envisioned as female in lyric tradition , and you have delineated her garments more deliberately and elaborately than many poets .
There 's a very interesting female presence in your work .
Can you talk about that ?
HUNTER : I saw my muses once .
It was a very , very high time , many years back .
There were three golden presences in the room .
It was a visual .
I do n't say I was straight at the time , but I will say it had a lasting effect on me .
I have a feeling that there 's something that helps me , gives it to me , sometimes .
" Terrapin " starts out with a shameless invocation to the Muse .
I know Muse is unfashionable now , but I think if people knew what it was , they could n't throw it out .
It 's an informing joy in creation , in which one 's verbal flow spills over the page with a great deal of ease and pleasure .
That joy is there even in the communication of pain .
The trick is to seek this out first , before anything else .
William Burroughs has said something about , " A writer 's business is to make his mind absolutely blank . "
This is not literally so , but you could say something " comes into the ear , " and moves around the head , and you know you 're on .
When you 're on , you can do no wrong .
SILBERMAN : Kerouac said , " Do n't think of words when you stop , but to see picture better . "
Thus an image - centered process .
Do you feel more conscious of your writing being driven the language , or by a set of images , or feelings ?
What does your Muse feel like ?
HUNTER : The language is little tricks that I play with my input , and if it delights the Muse , you hear a little bell [ laughing ] .
Do n't take this literally , ' cause we are talking about what can't be talked about .
I 'd say a lot of my poetry is about that , even .
Milton found a very fine way to talk about it .
Wallace Stevens is just chock - full of Muse .
I feel that anything that does n't have this central , singular focus is an exercise , and you would n't select it for your selected works .
Which leads to the next question , why do poems that have been lifted from books and put into a selected works seem so orphaned ?
Have you ever noticed that ?
SILBERMAN : Yeah , I have noticed that .
HUNTER : After reading Ashbery 's selected works , I went and got all the individual books to read again .
Those poems just jump forward , and they 're full of juice .
Last night I read , as I often do , " Self Portrait in a Convex Mirror , " which I think is one of the finest poems in the language .
But I read it in the selected works -- this was up at the river , it was all I had up there -- and it 's not the same poem as it was in that little Penguin paperback .
SILBERMAN : What is it about Ashbery that speaks to you ?
HUNTER : There is an absolutely daunting intelligence there , and an impatience with anything as simple as straight communication .
If you want straight communication , read a newspaper .
I read Ashbery at a fast clip .
I do n't stop and wonder what he means about something .
I let it roll , and collect , and flow , and when I come to the end , you know , here 's the way the tomato hit the wall .
And then on to the next .
There are very few poets that I read slowly and with great care .
I like to charge through them and get the whole bite at once .
SILBERMAN : I wonder if poems in selected poems seem " orphaned " because they lack the whole terrain of thought and feeling that the chosen poems were the peaks of .
The poems , or songs for that matter , that the artist thinks are only half - realized and slightly embarrassing , often have more of the artist 's struggle in them , than the completely realized works , dictated totally by the Other .
You can taste the human struggle more in half - realized works .
HUNTER : There 's a vulnerability to 'em .
There 's no vulnerability to " Self Portrait in a Convex Mirror . "
But you take some of Ashbery 's attempts to rhyme -- when Ashbery stoops to rhyme , he 's just another cheesy lyricist .
I think of lyric ability as a gift , you 're born with it .
I do n't like to see a great poet stoop to rhyme , for some idea of being more accessible .
James Merrill can go ahead and rhyme ; I 've just finished reading his wonderful " The Changing Light at Sandover . "
I 'm absolutely in awe of it .
SILBERMAN : Merrill 's another poet who 's come up with an elaborate -- I do n't want to say " explanation " -- of the Muse .
HUNTER : Indeed he has .
I think that 's why I feel very sympatico with him .
He 's like an elder in the field I 've chosen for myself .
It takes a good deal of reading before you suddenly engage Ashbery 's surfaces enough that , all of a sudden , you see what 's there .
It 's like putting your head down into a pond with the right kind of goggles on so you can see the stones on the bottom .
The unaccustomed surface .
SILBERMAN : Likewise , the syllabic textures of your own lyrics are often so wrought that the lyrics do n't just go down , you have to chew them .
Which might contribute to all the infamous mishearings of your lyrics you mention in your preface to Box of Rain .
HUNTER : That was the turn - on of Finnegan 's Wake : Words as sounds , and significance as an integral but almost secondary part .
If it does n't sound right , let 's find another way to say it , or something else to say .
I try to have a message , folks -- sometimes , anyway .
Where does a great line come from ?
It just comes .
Maybe you do n't have to look at it in terms of cause and effect .
SILBERMAN : In the postscript to " Entropy , " it seems like you 're , in a very deliberate way , attempting to strip , or dissect , the process of consciousness and memory itself , to reach into what Buddhists call " mind - only " : contentless consciousness .
HUNTER : But you notice , at the end of it , that it 's all rejected in my final statement .
I 'm building this crystalline structure up to walk away from it .
I felt that I had examined a certain phenomenological aspect of consciousness about as thoroughly as I felt capable .
I 've since moved on to my next approach , which is breath groups , rhythmic repetitions , what I call " mouth music . "
It 's just a slightly different tuning of the mental apparatus to favor the breath , and to favor spontaneity .
The " Bride of Entropy " stuff is anything but spontaneous .
That 's worked - over stuff -- starting with " An American Adventure , " right on through to the end , one long experiment .
Now I 'm done with that .
What I 'll be working on now is more heavily rhythmated -- I do n't want to say " rhythmic , " because I 'm not talking about regular rhythm .
I 'm talking about rhythms that are right from my heart , speech , and state of mind ; rhythms that roll , and socket into each other , and explode in places .
SILBERMAN : I like " American Adventure " for , among other reasons , the fact that you generate a set of very funny metaphors for dealing with the Sixties that get to something that hardly anyone 's been able to talk about .
America has been so haunted by that time , even unto now .
I 've lived in the Haight for 12 years , and I 'm very aware that my neighborhood , the blocks that I walk every day , are still living in the shadow of that " beckoning beam " you talk about in " American Adventure . "
You were right at the center of what that was about , or as close to the center as any human being could be , in terms of the particular people you knew , who you were working with .
Yet you have always been somewhat of an outsider .
You 've chosen to be an outsider , at the center of things .
HUNTER : That poem began as the Grateful Dead was going to release a set of CD's of everything that they 'd done .
Some new stuff , and vault tapes , plus all the old records , in a 3 CD set , which is something that did n't happen in the end .
I was asked if I would write liner notes for each of the three sections .
I just hit the page , and wrote in a really free manner , and I liked very much what I had come up with .
Then when the CD set did n't go , a year or two later I took out the things that were album - specific and kept the sociological stuff -- the adventure .
It 's recognizably the band I 'm talking about , being interchangeable for our generation .
I was telling myself something there , about how if it's not all said in a breath , it might as well not be said at all .
I tend to have a long breath - line , because I was trained in the trumpet and the Highland bagpipes .
It 's time to be true to what I feel is a strong positive thing about my own ability to speak as I 'm inspired , and get that down in a way that is not going to require a lot of rewriting .
For the time being , I 'm intending to fly with the speed of light through stuff .
SILBERMAN : Was that one of the things that attracted you to Rilke , the long lines ?
HUNTER : I had just always liked Rilke , and I had never seen a translation that I cared a whole lot for .
My wife went out one evening , and I felt drawn to reading the Duino Elegies , which I did from time to time , and I 'd be saying , " That 's not right .
That 's not right .
The flow is n't right .
This is too translational . "
I just took a pencil and looked over the German , and started making it sound the way I wanted to , with no intention whatsoever of translating Rilke .
I worked on it a little more until I had what I thought was a pretty fair translation of the first elegy .
Then just for kicks I continued , and did a little bit more , and I would say that I probably translated about half of the Duino Elegies before I realized that I was making a translation of the Duino Elegies .
Then I got hot .
I was sittin ' up until 3:00 in the morning with good cognac , which I would put in the microwave every time it cooled off .
I would sit there until Rilke would come and look over my shoulder and say , " No , it 's not just like that .
It 's a bit more like this .
Okay , now you got it , " and like that .
-- See the hair stand up on my arm ?
SILBERMAN : [ Laughing ]
Definitely !
HUNTER : This is quite an experience , because two or three in the morning Rilke would often visit me on this , you know -- I 'd get that far out , that I really felt that .
I thought to myself , " If there 's any such thing as spirits , and if somebody were working on a translation of Rilke - - doing it dutifully and working late hours -- where else would he be ? "
SILBERMAN : One of the things I admire about Rilke is his ability to sustain a tremendous amount of abstraction in a poem , without disrupting the reader 's ability to envision the landscape .
HUNTER : I think that can be done by the introduction of characters .
I guess it 's the last Elegy where he goes off pursuing the Muse through the carnival and then out behind it , pursuing the grief and sorrow , the " Lament . "
This is a wonderful trick .
Rather than talk abstract , make a character that is that ; chunk it full of the archetypes , and follow it around and see what it does .
Personalize it .
SILBERMAN : Melville has a great little poem called " On Greek Architecture " that goes ,
" Not magnitude , not lavishness ,
But Form -- the Site ;
Not innovating wilfulness ,
But reverence for the Archetype . "
HUNTER : I 've often had people tell me that I 've been writing about them in an uncanny fashion .
In fact , I 've had people come up to me in a restaurant and tell me to stop writing about their lives , and get nasty about it !
SILBERMAN : One of the unusual things about the way your work is received is that people are often tripping when they hear your lyrics .
Psychedelic experience brings one closer to the archetypal level of experience --
HUNTER : You betcha !
SILBERMAN : -- and a large part of your audience out there is using your characters and narratives as signs in mapless terrain .
HUNTER : The Ninth Elegy , which I had printed broadside , is pinned above the crapper in Kesey 's bathroom .
Anybody who sits down gets into the Ninth Elegy : " Exalt no inevitable ! " [ laughing ]
I have had some odd uses of my work , such as that Divine Light Maharishi thing -- I remember they were playing " Uncle John 's Band " at their big convention .
Some of this feels a bit funny to me .
People sometimes write and wonder which side I 'm on -- God or the Devil 's -- and things like that .
And I get nasty letters from Fundamentalists .
I do n't know what to make of it .
I 'm not preaching any religion .
I 'm a secularist , obviously .
SILBERMAN : Right -- although a secularist concerned with certain forms of the sacred that are not , perhaps , recognized by the established church .
HUNTER : I 'm not exactly a pantheist , but I would n't stop one on the street and start an argument .
I have a very , very strong religious impulse , and I have not found a religion that goes one - to - one with it .
I can see a bit of that calling , whatever it is , in almost any religion you want to plunk at me , but there 's none that I subscribe to -- either religious or poetic .
It 's terrain where you map your own territory , and what feels spiritually right for you because it fires for you , is the truth for the moment .
I write a lot about the soul .
SILBERMAN :
The soul , like the muses , has been unfashionable , though there 's been a considerable surge of interest lately in what is meant by soul .
I just read a very good book called Care of the Soul , by a Jungian therapist , Robert Moore .
People are realizing that even though you might not be able to nail the term " soul " to a specific entity , you 'll make more sense in talking about our inner being if you talk about the soul , and use it as an assumption , than if you claim it does n't exist .
HUNTER : Hey , listen , if you have not spent a certain amount of time standing in your soul , being that soul , and going where that soul goes , into the abstract realms and the poetries and the music which is the domain of that place , of course you would think that the soul did n't exist .
SILBERMAN : One of the interesting things in " American Adventure " is you talk about a " beckoning beam , " towards which your generation is journeying in the part of the poem that corresponds with the Haight - Ashbury era .
In the first part of the poem , there 's something slightly passive about the way your generation was receiving that light .
But then , it 's as if you say later in the poem that through an act of imagination and creation you can become conversant with that light again .
HUNTER : In the particular group of people that I 'm most involved with , of course , that 's what we 're up to , at our best .
At our normal and worst we 're as lame as any other pack of lame - o's around .
But there is something we 've stayed true to .
We 've wavered , but we 're helping to image this thing , and keep it happening .
SILBERMAN : Image this thing that 's always ahead of the images .
I 've been going to Dead shows since I was 17 , and one of the beautiful things about that has been the ongoing moving forward into new terrain , as new technology gets invented and new sounds can be made to come out of the stage , and the band and the audience grow up together .
The Dead have never ceased to be relevant for me because the nature of the band 's process -- improvisation -- is to move forward .
HUNTER : It 's a swamp , with high technology : Techno - swamp ! [ laughing ]
SILBERMAN : Did the success of the Dead 's single " Touch of Gray " change your experience of the band or your feeling about your own place in it ?
HUNTER : I had a terrible change of life experience that happened right at that time .
My son died , and it all turned to ashes in my mouth .
The " Touch of Gray " single was out there doing its number , and Dylan had just recorded " Silvio " for a single backed with " Ugliest Girl in the World " - - here 's Dylan doing my stuff , and I was healthy and oriented , it looked like everything was happening -- and then the rug was yanked out .
Also the Duino Elegies had just come out that week , and things were as good as they had ever been for me .
I got a good , big lesson in how this stuff passes away , and how relative everything is .
That was the specific instance that turned me to poetry .
The other stuff was too big , it was just too out there .
I needed to withdraw severely , examine everything , and poetry was my tool for doing this .
I was writing out of the depths of grief .
When tragedy hits , you find yourself doing what you do .
And it just saw me through .
All I wanted to do was put as many years as possible between me and that event .
Been five years now .
It 's like the " Dire Wolf " song , where I put somebody out in a totally white space , you know , which is nothin ' but snow , and a wolf at the door .
You get right down to very basic situations .
" Dire Wolf " is just a plea for life itself .
And " Standing on the Moon " is understanding that , whatever the basic human impulses are , they do not like existing in isolation .
We are interconnected .
We need to be back there with the folks .
And I do get isolated that way .
Less now .
I 've got a daughter who 's four now , Katie , who has helped the other thing heal over , real well .
So I do n't have that much isolation anymore .
SILBERMAN : Both " Standing on the Moon " and " Black Muddy River " came into the repertoire after Garcia 's coma , and both seem to be uncannily appropriate for what he had been through .
Were you conscious of that at all when you were writing those tunes ?
HUNTER : Not specifically , but Jerry and I have been hanging out since we were 18 and 19 respectively , and I know him as well as I know any other human being .
We were folk singers together , and I know what kind of song he loves .
So when I give him something I 'll give him something that I have a high degree of suspicion that he will love -- and sometimes I 'm right .
" Standing On the Moon " was one of those neat , sweet , quick things , like " It Must Have Been the Roses , " where the whole picture just came to me , and I grabbed a piece of paper and got it down .
No changes , no nothin ' .
Out of the head of Zeus , full - born , and clad in armor .
SILBERMAN : There 's a great poem by William Carlos Williams that I thought of when I heard " Black Muddy River " -- it 's the first poem in his selected poems -- called " The Wanderer . "
He talks about being anointed as a young man by the Passaic River , as a kind of initiation , or permission , to be a poet .
Did you ever read that poem ?
And it's not the clean , pristine Passaic , it 's full of muck and mire and . . .
HUNTER : The " filthy Passaic . "
SILBERMAN : Exactly .
It seems as if you guys have walked along the banks of similar rivers .
HUNTER : The black muddy river is a dream that I 've had maybe three or four times over my life , and it is one of the most chilling experiences that I 've had .
It 's enough to turn you religious .
I 've burrowed under this incredible mansion , gone down into the cellars , and I find myself down at this black , lusterless , slow - flowing Stygian river .
There are marble columns around , and cobwebs .
It 's vast and it 's hopeless .
It 's death , it 's death , with the absence of the soul .
It 's my horror vision , and when I come out of that dream I do anything I can to counter it .
SILBERMAN : And yet , in " Black Muddy River " you 're not saying flee the banks of this dark place .
You 're saying walk along the banks , and sing a song of your own making .
HUNTER : Right .
And what 's on the other side of it is . . . whatever it is .
It 's a bit of whistling in the dark .
I 'll face whatever it is , because I would n't have any choice , would I ?
So , you might as well go for it .
SILBERMAN : Who do you feel you 're writing for ?
HUNTER : If you can get that one straight you could probably write anything , if you knew .
Write to your own best lights .
Sometimes I 'm writing to my wife . . . whoever I know is going to read this next , I would like to delight them with it .
If I 'm writing a song , I would like to delight the person I 'm writing it for .
For poetry , sometimes I 'm writing for Harold Bloom [ laughing ] .
SILBERMAN : I saw Robert Duncan lecture on Pound and Williams right before he died , teaching his class at New College with a bottle of intravenous fluid dripping into his arm .
He was reading from the Cantos , and he was crying as he spoke about Pound 's sense that his life 's work had failed .
Duncan admonished his students , " If Dante reaches you , reach Dante ! "
HUNTER : Robert Duncan was important to me .
I met him and Diane diPrima the same night .
Diane 's daughter had a little get - together for us , and we drank lots of red wine .
He saw how unhappy I was -- it was at the time when everybody was slashing the Dead .
I was pretty distraught about all this , I took it personally , and Duncan talked me out of it forever , for ever responding to critics and letting 'em get a needle into my heart , for which I thank him very much .
SILBERMAN : He 's such a singular poet for , among other reasons , his standing up for the lyric in his work , beyond considerations of fashion .
HUNTER : There are very few poets that I do n't love .
Because every poem is somebody 's heart and ambitions , trying to get out there .
I see myself as somebody who 's desperately struggling to get one literate line out .
I keep writing from the feeling that I desperately missaid everything I want to say , writing from the feeling that I desperately missaid everything I want to say , or I 've been in the wrong territory .
You never can quite get it right .
When I was assembling Box of Rain , I was able to look back on something I wrote 15 or 20 years ago and say , " This is the poetry or lyric of a young man with a lot of dreams , a lot of surprises in store for him , " and feel , " Okay , that was well done . "
It 's almost as though you were someone else . . .
SILBERMAN : And in a sense you are .
HUNTER : I 've only read Kerouac rather recently , in the last three or four years , because when I made my early stabs at reading Kerouac , he was too much like me .
I thought , you know , " This is adolescent garbage ! "
And now when I read Kerouac there 's a young man in his full idiocy in bloom , and it's so sweet , and it takes you back .
A young person could maybe look up to him as a hero and try and live that same kind of confused pattern , without the talent Kerouac had of turning it into words , and would be seriously mistaken to do so , I feel .
I love his work .
I just read Pomes All Sizes .
SILBERMAN : " Flowers aim crookedly for the straight death . "
HUNTER : Right off the back burner , and into your ear !
I would say I was real good friends with Neal Cassady , so I did get a lot of horse 's mouth stuff .
But I was too young for that scene , and although Jerry and I and the guys all considered ourselves Beatniks back in the old days , I mean , Christ , we were eighteen or nineteen -- we could n't have been real Beatniks .
There were n't any hippies yet .
We were in that in - between state .
We had little beards .
We were doing what we could .
SILBERMAN : Did Neal ever talk to you about how he felt about being a character in Jack 's books ?
HUNTER : Yeah , he hated it !
When I knew him best was at a time when I think he and Jack were pretty much at odds .
It was a kind of younger brother - older brother scene , and he did n't have a lot good to say about Jack at that point .
He 'd just gotten out of San Quentin , and I think he felt at the time that Jack had taken his persona , and was maybe even responsible for that bust by making Neal famous enough that someone would want to go out and pop him for two joints .
I think a lot of that was his bitterness at the wasted years in San Quentin .
And yet at the same time he was out there being Neal Cassady in spades , you know , and riding the surf that Kerouac had whipped up .
. . .
SILBERMAN : And Jack loved him .
HUNTER : Oh , yeah !
Well , he loved Jack , too , and you do n't say some of the stuff , some of the bitter stuff that I heard him say about Jack , without love .
It hurts somehow .

No , really , which do you think there are more of in Manhattan : Subway sandwich shops or subway stations ?
If you guessed Subway sandwich shops , come claim your salmonella - tainted foot - long !
According to Subway ’s “ Restaurant ” Locator , ” there are now 171 Manhattan Subway shops versus 147 subway stations ( or 118 stops if you count transfer stations as just one ) .
Brooklyn fares much better : 70 Subway sandwich shops versus 155 ( or 170 ) subway stations ( in that borough , Robert Sietsema has sniffed out the anti-Dunkin ’ on Avenue J : the Donut Shoppe ) .
Then again , we suspect the store locator is underselling Subway ’s ubiquity — “ Queens , NY ” only yields one location , which is crazy wrong .
Anyway , whatever .

One of the scientists who works on the Kepler planet - hunting mission , Dimitar Sasselov , inadvertently set off a bit of a controversy when he appeared to announce that its first big data release implied that our galaxy is rich in Earth - like planets , with approximately 100 million habitable ones .
That might be great news , except for some awkward facts : he dropped the news during an informal TED talk , and nobody at NASA or elsewhere was prepared to back up his assertions .
In fact , the Kepler team has faced a bit of a backlash for its decision to limit the release of data on Earth - like candidates .
Had Sasselov spilled the beans ?
If you look at the video carefully , however , it 's clear that Sasselov was making the same sorts of arguments that appear in one of the Kepler papers .
Because of our methods of detection , our collection of exoplanets was biased towards massive gas giants ; the distribution of planetary candidates found by Kepler implies that smaller , rockier planets are far more common when you perform an unbiased search .
And that , as Sasselov noted , allows you to make some statistical inferences .
For example , Kepler has only been doing observations long enough to spot exoplanets orbiting close to the host star , but you can infer the distribution of sizes seen in those applies further out from the star and into the habitable zone .
You can also assume the portion of the galaxy being imaged is typical of the galaxy as a whole .
Put those together , and you apparently get the 100 million figure mentioned in the talk .
Given that the talk wound up receiving significant coverage in the press , NASA also convinced Sasselov to post a clarification on the Kepler blog .
In it , he helpfully points out that he was using a very liberal definition of " habitable " in his talk .
There 's a big difference between Earth - sized and Earth - like .
Even then , by a lot of criteria , Venus is pretty Earth - like , but has a surface temperature that can melt lead .
In the end , there seems to be little here that could n't have been inferred from papers that are already posted on the arXiv .
The news itself was mostly in the eye - popping 100 million habitable planets figure , but that clearly relies on making some very significant assumptions .
Unfortunately , it 's probably safe to assume that more people read the initial press coverage of Sasselov 's talk than will read his clarification .

EDIT : This post is now quite deprecated .
Installation instructions and new versions are posted on the github project page .
I just updated my original ” tangotango ” emacs color theme , based on the tango palette colors .
I ’ve tweaked some details and moved the source code to github .
Here are updated installation instructions and screenshots :
Installation instructions
Download and install the color - theme emacs package either via your linux distribution or via the source tarball Download and install color - theme - tangotango.el from github
Make sure that both color - theme.el and color - theme - tangotango.el are in your load path
There are several ways to load the tangotango color theme from your .emacs , as documented on emacswiki .
The way I currently use should work for a daemonized emacs and allows the selection of different themes for GUI or console based frames :
( require ' color - theme ) ( setq color - theme - load - all - themes nil ) ( require ' color - theme - tangotango ) ;; select theme - first list element is for windowing system , second is for console / terminal ;; Source : http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ColorTheme#toc9 ( setq color - theme - choices '( color - theme- tangotango color - theme - tangotango ) ) ;; default - start ( funcall ( lambda ( cols ) ( let ( ( color - theme - is - global nil ) ) ( eval ( append '( if ( window - system ) ) ( mapcar ( lambda ( x ) ( cons x nil ) ) cols ) ) ) ) ) color - theme - choices ) ;; test for each additional frame or console ( require 'cl ) ( fset ' test - win-sys ( funcall ( lambda ( cols ) ( lexical - let ( ( cols cols ) ) ( lambda ( frame ) ( let ( ( color - theme - is - global nil ) ) ;; must be current for local ctheme ( select - frame frame ) ;; test winsystem ( eval ( append '( if ( window - system frame ) ) ( mapcar ( lambda ( x ) ( cons x nil ) ) cols ) ) ) ) ) ) ) color - theme - choices ) ) ;; hook on after - make - frame - functions ( add - hook ' after - make - frame - functions ' test - win-sys ) ( color - theme - tangotango )
Note that I also had to add a ( color - theme - tangotango ) line at the end of my .gnus file in order to apply the color theme to Gnus .

After seven years of working on the surface of Mars , NASA 's Mars rover Opportunity has been upgraded to allow it to make some of its own decisions .
NASA announced Tuesday that its engineers this winter uploaded artificial intelligence software to enable the Mars rover to decide on its own whether it wants to stop and analyze rocks spotted during its travels across the Martian surface .
The space agency noted that the upgrade will provide a good test of robotic autonomy , which it hopes to use more fully in future NASA space missions .
" We spent years developing this capability on research rovers in the Mars Yard here at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , " said Tara Estlin , a senior member of the Artificial Intelligence Group at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory , in a statement .
" Six years ago , we never expected that we would get a chance to use it on Opportunity . "
NASA has two rovers on Mars -- Spirit and Opportunity .
The twin rovers have been slowly trekking across the planet 's surface for years , sending images and data back to NASA scientists .
The robots are among the most advanced technology ever built at the Jet Propulsion Lab , said Bruce Banerdt , a project scientist for the Mars Exploration Rovers , said in an earlier interview .
Overall , Opportunity rover has had better luck than its counterpart , Spirit .
In January , NASA announced that Spirit is permanently stuck in Martian dirt .
Nonetheless , NASA scientists hope that Spirit can conduct experiments from where it sits .
Meanwhile , Opportunity , is still mobile .
The artificial intelligence software is designed to Opportunity 's computer system recognize rocks that meet specified , pre-programmed criteria , such as a rounded shape or certain color .
If the object meets specific criteria , the rover then will use its narrower - angle panoramic camera to take multiple images of it .
" It 's a way to get some bonus science , " said Estlin .
The new software is called Autonomous Exploration for Gathering Increased Science , or AEGIS .
Previously , scientists at NASA would have to determine when rocks needed more analysis after studying photos sent back from the rover .

Diablo casts a long shadow over the action - RPG .
Few games have been able to dispel Blizzard 's gloomy dominance of the genre , though many have tried .
Only Torchlight shines in the dark .
A modest game in scale and price , made in a year by a small team , it is as accomplished a resurrection of the genre as anyone could want .
It 's cheery and accessible too , doing as much as it can to delight the player as they mop up hordes of monsters in its colourful , randomised dungeons .
Now its developers , Runic Games , plan to transform this success into a platform for an MMO based on the Torchlight world .
Despite its unassuming , accessible look , Torchlight 's creation was a far from trivial task .
Its DNA can be traced back to its makers ' work on the original Diablo , after which their careers criss and cross the wiki pages of MMO and RPG history .
Its long gestation survived the unmaking of Flagship Studios – and their almostmade Mythos , a Diablo - style MMO that sank along with Flagship in August 2008 .
It was only a month away from beta .
Yet within 24 hours of Flagship 's dissolution , the Mythos team had started anew , more determined than ever .
A month later they became Runic Games .
Then , by October the following year , there was Torchlight .
“ I guess it started back in 1993 , ” says Runic Games ' CEO , Max Schaefer .
“ Rather than get real jobs and be responsible people , my brother Erich , David Brevik and I decided to start a game company .
We were called Condor Incorporated .
We cut our teeth on Gameboy and Game Gear games , and ended up doing a Sega Genesis game called the Justice League Task Force .
It was a Street Fighter - style game with Batman , Wonder Woman and Superman .
The publisher had another company entirely make the Super Nintendo version , but did n't put us in touch with them .
We met them at one of the big game conventions and , of course , we had an instant rivalry – but they were really nice guys and we became friendly .
They turned out to be the group that started Blizzard , although they had the horrible name of Silicon And Synapse at the time .
Anyway , when we were looking for the next thing to do , we decided we wanted to make a PC game because we did n't know which console was going to be the next big thing and did n't want to bet on it .
So we wandered round the shows with our pitch packets looking for someone to give us money .
The Blizzard guys were one of the few that gave us the time of day .
They signed us to make Diablo .
And off we went .
Then , half way through making it they acquired us and we became Blizzard North . ”
Over the following decade , Blizzard North grew to a 60 - man company , creating the subsequent Diablo expansions and sequel .
But the Schaefers got nervous about the corporate ownership of Blizzard .
They 'd been passed between so many different divisions of parent company Vivendi that no one could keep track of who their bosses were .
“ We would read on Yahoo news every day about who they were going to sell us to next , ” says Max .
“ We decided we wanted to be in charge of our own fate again , so a bunch of us left Blizzard North and started Flagship Studios .
We started at a good time .
Publishers were throwing around money , and wanted to hear stories about how you were going to do the next great thing .
So we started Hellgate : London which was going to do everything for everybody . ”
Flagship , needless to say , did not meet expectations with Hellgate : London .
It was meant to be the AAA breakout monster hit – an MMO that was a perfect amalgam of Half - Life and Diablo 's finest features .
It was , instead , a total disaster .
But while Max Schaefer is frank about the mistakes that were made at Flagship , it 's clear that , alongside overpromising , Flagship fell victim to circumstances outside their control .
“ I do n't want to throw anyone under the bus , ” says Max Schaefer .
“ But there were a lot of logistical things that went wrong with Hellgate : London .
For example , our primary PC publisher ran into some trouble .
MMOs take a considerable amount of operations .
You have to be able to take people 's money , you have to do customer support , run servers – that was supposed to be done by other people , and yet half way through the project it was announced that they were n't going to be able to fulfil that , and so we had to figure out how to do it ourselves .
We did n't really have any money for it , we had to hire up quickly and it stretched our management thin .
It was just one more thing that made it too much to do in the budget and the time we had available . ”
While the troubles on Hellgate edged the company ever closer to the abyss , more promising developments were underway at the studio 's Seattle branch – itself something of a serendipitous creation .
“ Mythos began as a test of the network infrastructure we were making for Hellgate , ” says Max Schaefer .
“ We just needed a couple of guys doing something super basic to make sure it worked .
That 's when we hired Travis Baldree . ”
Travis Baldree , creator of Fate , a Diablo clone much admired by Diablo 's original developers , had interviewed at Flagship several months prior – but turned the job down , due to the hassle of relocation to San Francisco with a two month old baby in tow .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
A rumor that Fermilab ’s Tevatron may have discovered evidence of a light Higgs boson would n't be the first unsupported speculation from Tommaso Dorigo , a physicist at the University of Padua in Italy , on his lively blog , but it is probably one of the most intriguing .
Even a slight possibility that the world ’s second largest accelerator has beaten the largest , the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , in finding the last particle in the Standard Model is enough to catch most people ’s attention .
“ It reached my ear , from two different , possibly independent sources , that an experiment at the Tevatron is about to release some evidence of a light Higgs boson signal , ” Dorigo writes at his blog , A Quantum Diaries Survivor .
“ Some say a three - sigma effect , others do not make explicit claims but talk of a unexpected result .
That the result comes from the Tevatron is for sure , since the LHC experiments do not have nearly enough data yet to search for that elusive particle , and other particle physics experiments in the world have not nearly enough energy to produce it .
However , I am unable to understand whether the rumor comes from CDF or from D0 [ Fermilab's two particle detectors ] . ”
Both CDF and DZero have been collecting data for many years , and have been narrowing down the possible energies and masses at which a Higgs boson might appear .
As Dorigo notes , last November , the two experiments jointly released an improved Higgs limit .
With the additional data they ’ve gathered since then ( Dorigo estimates 50 % more data ) , the scientists may have narrowed the limit even further .
Last year , Fermilab physicists even predicted that they would have a 50 % chance of detecting the Higgs by the end of this year .
In Dorigo ’s blog post , the “ three - sigma effect ” refers to the statistical certainty of the result , corresponding to a 99.73 % chance of it being correct .
Generally , a three - sigma effect is n't classified as a true discovery ; rather , a five - sigma ( or 99.9999 % chance of accuracy ) is considered a high enough degree of certainty to be considered a fully acceptable discovery .
Yet , three - sigma would still mean strong evidence of the existence of the Higgs .
On the other hand , some physicists are hoping that the Higgs does n’t actually exist , since this could provide clues to a theory beyond the Standard Model .
Dorigo is not part of the group (s ) that may have discovered the Higgs evidence , and he is quick to admit that the rumor is pretty groundless right now .
It seems that he just wants to share the excitement of the rumor he ’s heard with the rest of the world .
He adds that more news about the subject may be revealed by physicists later this month at the International Conference on High Energy Physics in Paris .

The ' booze bra ' that can hold a whole bottle of wine ... just do n't wear it with a white shirt
Wine rack :
The bra , which can hold 750 ml of drink , is popular with New Jersey students
It 's certainly one way to boost your cup size - but a new bra that can hold a whole bottle of wine is unlikely to find much favour with bar and pub owners .
The ' Wine Rack ' , which holds 750 ml of drink and comes complete with a straw attached to the watertight tubing inside the cups , can inflate a girl 's chest by up to two sizes .
The bra , which is produced by New Jersey retailer BaronBob.com , has proved popular with students during the U.S. state 's recent heatwave .
' They are leak proof and are totally water tight or booze tight as the case may be , ' said store owner Paul Krasulja , 38 .
' The drinking tube has a stop start button which is siphoned off from the tubing around the bra .
' Fully filled , the bra is imperceptibly increased by two sizes .
But the bra should not be considered lingerie , he added .
' It is for partying and drinking .
' The only thing is that some girls will give off the wrong impression at the start of a night and deflate as the evening goes on . '
Boost : The ' Wine Rack ' can increase a girl 's cup size by up to two sizes
Mr Krasulja 's company is known locally for selling a wide variety of products including edible G - strings .
The ' Wine Rack ' bra is a successor to the firm 's ' Beer Belly ' - a similar product for men , which can be worn around the stomach .
I do n’t know about you , but I ’m sick to death of hearing about the polar bears as a proxy for Arctic ice issues .
Yesterday , Steve Goddard pointed out the ramifications related to polar bears of NSIDC ’s Dr. Walt Meier ’s part two on Arctic Sea Ice saying : Polar Bears Survived the Ice Free Arctic
Today , we have new research from the University of Alaska ( and they should know ) that shows polar bears did just fine in warmer periods of the past .
“ This is verifying that the polar bear lived through at least one warming period , ” Talbot says .
“ The Eemian was a very hot period , and polar bears survived it , ” she says .
So next time you have somebody sniffling and tearing up over polar bears and sea ice , show them this research and hand them a Kleenex .
Now , they can worry about the polar bears eating hippos in the future .
( see story )
This column is provided as a public service by the Geophysical Institute , University of Alaska Fairbanks , in cooperation with the UAF research community .
Ned Rozell is a science writer at the institute .
An ancient jawbone has led scientists to believe that polar bears survived a period thousands of years ago that was warmer than today .
Sandra Talbot of the USGS Alaska Science Center in Anchorage was one of 14 scientists who teamed to write a paper based on a polar bear jawbone found amid rocks on a frigid island of the Svalbard Archipelago .
The scientists determined the bear was an adult male that lived and died somewhere between 130,000 to 110,000 years ago , and that bear was similar to polar bears today .
Charlotte Lindqvist of the University at Buffalo in New York was the lead author on the paper , published in the March 2010 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
An Icelandic researcher in 2004 found a fossilized lower jawbone , in excellent condition and complete with a canine tooth , on a narrow spit of land on the far west edge of Norway ’s Svalbard Archipelago .
It was a stunning find because there are n’t many fossils of polar bears around .
The largest bears in the world spend most of their lives on sea ice , so they often die there , and their remains either sink or get scavenged by something else .
With bone and tooth in hand , scientists got to work with the latest techniques for finding the age of formerly living creatures and determining their genetic backgrounds .
The latter is the specialty of Sandra Talbot .
She is a research wildlife geneticist who earned her doctorate degree at the University of Alaska Fairbanks by helping determine that the mitochondrial DNA of brown bears on Admiralty , Baranof and Chichagof islands of Southeast Alaska is more closely related to that of polar bears than to the DNA of other brown bears .
Talbot says the evidence of a polar bear from 130,000 years ago shows that the creatures somehow survived conditions warmer than they face today .
“ This is verifying that the polar bear lived through at least one warming period , ” Talbot says .
“ The Eemian was a very hot period , and polar bears survived it , ” she says .
During the Eemian , about 125,000 years ago , the planet was warm enough that hippos lived where London is now .
Polar bears , now adapted to eating seals that live only near sea ice , somehow made it through a few thousand years when there may not have been much sea ice , if any existed at all .
“ It gives us hope that they survived that stage , ” Talbot says .
“ It does make you think about refugia more . ”
“ Refugia ” are places that polar bears may survive without ice .
The Svalbard Archipelago may have been one of those places .
Biologists today think polar bears would have a difficult time living on land , because other species like the grizzly bear could outcompete them .
The warm period of the Eemian might have come at a time when the polar bear was n’t such an ice specialist , Talbot says .
“ We ca n’t predict whether the polar bear is too far out ( in its evolution towards a life on ice ) , ” she says .
“ It ’s interesting that there are a few examples of hybridization ( between polar bears and brown bears ) .
That ’s something worth watching . ”
And maybe polar bears have been trying to adapt to life on land , but one species has blocked that avenue of evolution .
Polar bears that wander onto land , especially near a human settlement , tend to get shot .
And humans — who did n’t wander out of Africa until about 45,000 years ago — were n’t present on the edge of the sea ice when polar bears first made it their home .
“ We were n’t impacting them then the way we are now , ” Talbot says .
Though the polar bear perhaps prospered through hot times in the past , what they have in store ahead may be their greatest challenge ever .
“ We ’re going into a very similar period of time , but it ’s generally thought that this is going to be warmer than ( the last great warm period ) , ” Talbot says .

The credit crunch that caused bankers around the country to stamp " REJECTED " on millions of college loan applications appears to be easing .
Banks , credit unions , nonprofits , and new alternative lenders are approving more and cheaper tuition loans with variable interest rates starting as low as 1.8 percent for parents and even a few creditworthy students .
And they are attracting parents with opportunities to switch responsibility for payments to the student after a year or two of payments .
[ Read about new web tools that can help you find a cheap student loan . ]
Although they are offering some bargains , lenders advise all students to apply first for federal aid , including low - cost government loans , by filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid .
The Department of Education lends undergraduates as much as $ 12,500 a year in Stafford loans at fixed rates as low as 4.5 percent without cosigners or credit scores .
And it offers students unique perks such as income - based repayment and loan forgiveness for public service .
Most young adults have n't built good credit scores , so they do n't qualify for private loans without cosigners .
And private lenders such as Sallie Mae , banks , and credit unions only give the cheapest advertised rates to families with top credit scores .
Parents who want to borrow to pay their childrens ' college bills have different considerations .
The federal parent loan program , PLUS , lends parents with minimally acceptable credit their student 's full cost of attendance ( after subtracting out other financial aid ) .
It also offers perks such as the chance to defer payments while the student is in school , and free insurance that cancels the loan if the student or parent dies .
But the PLUS annual percentage rate is fixed at about 8.8 percent , after fees .
And PLUS borrowers could have a hard time getting out of financial trouble because educational loans are rarely discharged in bankruptcy .
[ Read about 2010 's cheaper and easier federal student loans . ]
While private educational loans are also hard to escape , recent law reforms and improvements in the economy have sparked seven big improvements over the high - priced , tough - to - get private loans of 2009 .
1. Lower costs .
The state - owned Bank of North Dakota is offering a remarkable bargain to students from — or attending college in — that state : a variable rate that currently rests at just 1.78 percent .
( Of course , like all variable loans , it will get more expensive when interest rates rise above their current lows . )
The bank will also make private loans to students from or attending school in neighboring states at 3.2 percent .
Other lenders are cutting their rates as well .
In May , Sallie Mae , the nation 's biggest educational lender , stopped charging a 3 percent up - front fee , and cut its variable rates by about 2.5 percentage points .
Better investment markets and repayment rates are allowing the company to offer other discounts , such as a new 2 percent rebate for on - time payments , adds Charlie Rocha , a company senior vice president .
2. Fewer rejections .
More lenders are now approving loans to borrowers with FICO scores below 700 , says Tim Ranzetta , who analyzes the lending industry at Student Lending Analytics .
The Bank of North Dakota considers applications from students and parents with FICO scores as low as 575 .
Some members of Studentchoice.org , an association of credit unions , are waiving standard cosigner and citizenship requirements for students at highly ranked business schools .
3. Easier repayment .
During the credit crunch , many private lenders started requiring borrowers to begin repayments immediately , instead of waiting until the student left college .
But many of the credit unions who lend through Studentchoice.org are now allowing borrowers to defer payments while the student is in school .
Starting at the end of June , Sallie Mae will allow borrowers to make token payments of as little as $ 25 a month .
4 . More parent relief .
Sallie
Mae announced this spring that it would shorten the time period before allowing co-signers to apply for release from repayment responsibility from 24 on - time payments to 12 .
Of course , the company will only approve parental relief if the student has developed a good credit score .
Many other lenders now allow parents to apply for release after 24 payments .
And some credit union members of the Student Choice network are now offering no -cosigner private loans to students in some graduate business programs .
5 . More choices .
Private lenders are offering rates that rise and fall with LIBOR and rates that remain fixed at anywhere from 6 percent to 12 percent , depending on the borrower 's credit score .
Borrowers can choose among traditional lenders , neighborhood credit unions , or new peer - to - peer lending websites .
At People Capital 's new anonymous student loan auction site , lenders only see financial and academic information , without knowing the name of the borrower .
The bidder with the lowest interest rate wins the right to lend the student money .
6. Clearer information .
A 2009 government crackdown led to new laws requiring lenders to give specific rates , terms , and costs before borrowers commit to a private student loan .
Lenders must also now warn applicants of the maximum monthly payments they could face .
7 . More consumer protection .
Year - old reforms to the federal Truth in Lending
Act require private lenders to give students and parents 30 days after a private loan is approved to decide whether they want to take the money .
Lenders cannot change the terms in those 30 days .
Borrowers also now have three days after they accept a private educational loan to change their minds .

As you 're planning your wedding , you 'll likely need to put some thought into how you 'll decorate your reception .
While most couples opt for floral arrangements — which they place in the center of their tables — the options extend far beyond simple bundles of one kind of bloom .
With so many flower varieties out there , as well a whole spectrum of petal shades , choosing blossoms for your centerpieces can be overwhelming .
Plus , not all brides and grooms want to use flowers at all — some choose to work with other elements , like candles .
How can you decide on the right decorations for your celebration 's color scheme and theme ?
There are a few decisions you 'll have to make before settling on one or more centerpiece designs .
First , you 'll need to decide what palette you want to work with .
Second , you 'll need to decide what you 're using , whether that means picking flowers or non-floral alternatives .
The season can play a role in the selection process , as not all blooms are available at all times of year .
The vibe of the rest of your event also matters — you probably do n't want modern centerpieces if the rest of your affair is vintage - inspired .
To help you find the perfect fit for your wedding , we 've rounded up a list of 50 different centerpiece ideas .
Our selections includes colors like red , pink , and purple ( and the pink - and - white option seen here ) plus flowers like roses , peonies , and dahlias .
There are also flower - less options , like garlands of greenery .
Discover what your options are and get inspired for your own décor .
It seems to have been meant to be — and not in that predestination way .
After endless months of testimony and debate , the Texas State Board of Education ( SBOE ) , led by Don McLeroy , passed standard after controversial standard in its attempt to refashion education in the Lone Star State for the next ten years .
Fate or God ’s will aside , there is plenty of cause to complain about who and what got included and why , but there ’s something deeper here in the heart of Texas than just a debate about events and dates .
It ’s about who we are as Westerners — and I mean Western civilization — and how we think of ourselves as individuals and citizens .
Because in Texas , that ’s about to change big time .
And if we all buy their textbooks , it ’s going to change for us , too .
If anything , this little escapade that started about national textbook sales and has now turned into an epic ideological battle about how the West understands itself has been healthy for all of us .
I find it to be a nice cleansing of the palate about what it means to be citizens and how we understand and teach our own identity .
We get lazy and , since we live in a technology - driven service economy , we forget the importance of how the humanities and the arts express and define us and our society .
Monarchist or Marxist , We Educate in Our Image
The humanities do n’t make us materially wealthy .
They do n’t increase our market share or increase the size of our homes .
They do n’t lower our taxes or pay our medical bills .
And so they get pushed aside in our everyday affairs .
The humanities of history and literature and philosophy and religion speak to the human condition — something invaluable .
And people take them for granted , until someone else begins to define and delineate for them what it means to be human and free .
Only then do people get up in arms .
If we are going to conserve our humanities , we must be actively involved in our politics and education .
Only through the reflection on what it means to be human — a reflection that engages with those beyond our immediate community , state , and nation — can we teach and learn to become better humans for both ourselves and each other .
As Americans , we like to think that what our children learn in school is outside of politics , and that our kids can learn facts and figures and how to play well with one another so they can grow up and get jobs and follow their dreams .
But public education , by nature of the word “ public , ” is political .
States use public schools to educate their future citizens for their own purposes .
Through those public schools , state governments develop their citizens and train their future workforce to ensure economic competitiveness and social cohesion .
Public schools instill within children identities of many kinds ; including those at the local , state , federal , and international levels .
It ’s what makes us a community , a nation , a people .
Now this may bump up against our lofty ideas about education , but I do not mean the ideal of education , concerned with the liberal arts and the natural sciences ; I mean the role of education for the ensured success of a political body , whatever that body may be .
Furthermore , we must always remember that governments are conservative by nature .
It ’s no surprise that people and parties in power want to solidify , maintain , and expand that power .
Every institution will act in conservative ways to ensure the success and future of its own ideas .
Followers of both monarchism and Marxism , for example , are deeply conservative in their beliefs and methods to remain monarchists and Marxists .
So the government of the State of Texas , like every other state , has the obligation to itself to create citizens — from an early age — in its own image .
This image , then , requires the inculcation of a particular identity , which is accomplished primarily through social studies courses like history and government .
And this is what the Texas SBOE has recently accomplished : the establishment of standards , through a simple majority vote , of a certain kind of identity .
Now , this new Texas identity is , by definition , distinct from every other state’s .
But more importantly , this particular incarnation of the Texas SBOE has sought to establish for its youth and itself a particular and narrow kind of Christian narrative .
It ’s a revisionist narrative about the founding and purpose of the United States as a whole , whether the majority of the citizens of Texas ( or the United States ) believe this narrative or not .
On the day of the final vote , board member Cynthia Dunbar , opening the meeting in prayer , said as much when she prayed : “ I like to believe we are living today in the spirit of the Christian religion .
I like also to believe that as long as we do so , no great harm can come to our country . ”
Dunbar was quite clear : only our citizens ’ shared belief in Jesus and Divine Providence can save and preserve Texas and the nation — and the SBOE ’s new social studies curriculum will teach the youth of Texas just that .
Why Keep Calvin ?
More important than the battle to include Thomas Jefferson as an Enlightenment thinker in the standard was the inclusion of the Age of Enlightenment in the standard at all .
The Enlightenment focuses on the intellectual reasoning of individuals for their self - determination , not the divine revelation of God through the Christian Scriptures .
To counter teaching the Enlightenment , the SBOE ’s conservative Christian bloc had removed both Jefferson and the Enlightenment , replacing them instead with Saint Thomas Aquinas , John Calvin , and the English jurist Sir William Blackstone .
In the course of the final debate , Dunbar loudly opposed the removal of Calvin and she got her way .
But why ?
And what role does Calvin , the French - born theologian of the Protestant Reformation , have to do with our understanding of American government ?
Throughout The Institutes of the Christian Religion , Calvin , a lawyer by training , comprehensively establishes and describes God ’s authority and action as complete in every moment of human existence .
He opens his volume with these words :
Our wisdom , in so far as it ought to be deemed true and solid wisdom , consists almost entirely of two parts : the knowledge of God and ourselves .
If there ever was an anti-Enlightenment axiom , this is it .
And Dunbar knows this .
Calvin ’s Divine Providence , through the exclusive salvific death and resurrection of Jesus Christ , is absolute .
Everything is predestined for God ’s own glory and has been manifested in the Gospel for humanity ’s salvation and damnation .
In light of this , in his very last chapter , Calvin offers his concept of government .
Basically , it is The Institutes put into civil practice .
With his high view of inerrant , God- breathed Scripture , Calvin employs story after biblical story to establish God ’s choice in the determination of every ruler from David to Nebuchadnezzar and beyond .
By Divine Providence and holy decree , God ( not the people ) chooses the rulers , though the people may think they have some sort of democratic power .
And those who believe that laws do not come from God Calvin calls “ seditious . ”
He writes , “ the first duty of subjects towards their rulers , is to entertain the most honorable views of their office , recognizing it as a delegated jurisdiction from God , and on that account receiving and reverencing them as the ministers and ambassadors of God . ”
Later , he writes “ let no man here deceive himself , since we cannot resist the magistrate without resisting God . ”
In The Institutes , Calvin begins with our knowledge of God the Creator and ends with the complete manifestation of God ’s will in our governments and social lives .
What ’s worse is that if teachers present this view of history and government , students will encounter the Age of Enlightenment in light of Calvin ’s all - encompassing theocratic system .
Even the deist Voltaire will write in light of Calvin ’s statecraft .
So comprehensive and extensive is Calvin ’s concept of predestined government , it effectively invalidates the concept of the Separation of Church and State before it is even introduced !
Dunbar , McLeroy , and the rest of the Board members have offered a major blow against our culture ’s own post -Enlightenment understanding of self - determination and free will .
Texas does not go back two hundred years to the Framers of the Constitution .
It goes back 400 years to the Reformation itself , before democracy was even a modern concept .
For a full decade , Texas students will not learn the distinct intellectual role the Enlightenment played in contrast to the Reformation .
So much for the concepts of free will and self determination in life and government in the State of Texas for many years to come .
So , what does this mean for the population and people of Texas ?
Well , ten years of this new Christian identity will be taught to their children until the standards are again debated , voted upon , and rewritten .
Meaning that , for a distinct population of Texas , if they are educated through the entire primary and secondary public school system , as far as the majority of this SBOE is concerned they will be excellent voting citizens within this distinct period of Texas history and culture — as long as these students remain within the state and are not required to interact with any other citizen of the United States or some other country .
Texas ’ sovereignty over and within its own education system ensures this .
Up until the age of eighteen , Texas students will be expected ( through rigorous state testing ) to understand their political and social selves , their communities , their state , their nation , and their world in a distinct and specific way , decided by this board in the face of accredited academic experts and concerned parents .
Upon graduation in June , they will receive their diploma from their high school and their independent school district of the State of Texas as fully educated by the State and for the State .
Then , if they have high grades and test scores , the intellectual capability , and the resources to attend higher education , they will matriculate and discover that they are both woefully unprepared and underqualified to enroll in their chosen academic program .
This is because the educational mandates of the State of Texas have taken them on a trajectory antithetical not just broadly to the rest of the world , but even to the flagship public universities of their own state , the University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&M University , which , like every institution of Texas higher education , is not under the jurisdiction of the SBOE .
A population educated in a political vacuum unwittingly and ironically undermines the preservation of its own government and citizenry .
And to undermine unexpectedly is to engage in an undesired and uncalculated revolution , not conservation .
It ’s up to us to make this choice not only for our future , but our past as well .
After you ’re done admiring this picture of Ashton Kutcher driving his 15,000 pound CXT truck which gets 7 miles to the gallon , you should check out this video of Ashton blaming the Republicans for the BP oil spill and shedding a tear for the environment .
As you watch it keep in mind that the drill that blew up and started the leak was ordered in 1998 and laid down in 2000 , while the convention he refers to was in 2008 .
And there ’s also this .
But whatever .
Ashton says …
“ If you could go back to the Republican national convention and look the guys in the eyes that were saying , ‘ DRILL DRILL DRILL ’ , at the Republican national convention , those guys , there you go , that ’s what we got , like , we did it , we drilled drilled drilled . ”
The Republican party is filled with reprehensible men and women but luckily for them Ashton is a fucking moron so he ca n’t get to that point without taking everyone on a 10 hour journey with no end in sight where , in no particular order , he stammers off things he thinks he heard about politics at a coke party in Malibu .
It ’s no wonder everyone holds Hollywood actors in such high regard .
Micawber , a python library for extracting rich content from URLs
OEmbed is a simple , open API standard for embedding rich content and retrieving content metadata .
The way OEmbed works is actually kind of ingenious , because the only things a consumer of the API needs to know are the location of the OEmbed endpoint , and the URL to the piece of content they want to embed .
YouTube , for example , maintains an OEmbed endpoint at youtube.com / oembed .
Using the OEmbed endpoint , we can very easily retrieve the HTML for an embedded video player along with metadata about the clip :
GET https://www.youtube.com/oembed?url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nda_OSWeyn8
Response :
{ " provider_url " : " https://www.youtube.com/ " , " title " : " Leprechaun in Mobile , Alabama " , " type " : " video " , " html " : " < iframe width= \ " 459 \ " height= \ " 344 \ " src= \ " https://www.youtube.com/embed/nda_OSWeyn8?feature=oembed\ " frameborder= \ " 0 \ " allowfullscreen ></iframe > " , " thumbnail_width " : 480 , " height " : 344 , " width " : 459 , " version " : " 1.0 " , " author_name " : " botmib " , " thumbnail_height " : 360 , " thumbnail_url " : " https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nda_OSWeyn8/hqdefault.jpg " , " provider_name " : " You Tube " , " author_url " : " https://www.youtube.com/user/botmib " }
The oembed spec defines four types of content along with a number of required attributes for each content type .
This makes it a snap for consumers to use a single interface for handling things like :
youtube videos
flickr photos
hulu videos
slideshare decks
and many more
A quick note on embed.ly
If you click that last link in the list it will send you to http://embed.ly/ -- a service that launched a year or so ago that provides a single endpoint for all sorts of different content .
Many big sites provide their own endpoints , however , so the decision to use a service like embedly really depends on your individual needs .
I tried out their free tier and found it to be much slower than using the native endpoints provided by youtube and flickr , however the sheer number of sites they support makes them a pretty good option .
Luckily , you do n't have to decide right now , micawber supports both workflows .
Back to micawber
Micawber was designed for embedding rich content using the oembed API .
In many ways it is a successor to an earlier project djangoembed , which I have not been very good at maintaining , but instead of being limited to django micawber can be used with any python project .
It supports a low - level API capable of :
requesting rich metadata for a URL from a given endpoint
extracting metadata from a block of text or html
parsing a block of text or HTML and replacing URLs with rich content
If you 're using Flask or Django , there is a higher - level API consisting of a couple of template filters which do the same things .
I put a demo up on appengine ( hoping it does n't break too bad , this will be my first appengine deploy ) .
Try entering some URLs to things like youtube videos or flickr photos : http://micawberdemo.appspot.com/
Providers
Behind - the - scenes , your app creates a mapping of partial URL regex to a particular endpoint , e.g. :
http://\S*.youtu(\.be|be\.com)/watch\S* -->
http://www.youtube.com/oembed
What happens when you ask the youtube oembed endpoint for metadata about a video simply by providing that video 's URL ?
curl http://www.youtube.com/oembed?url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nda_OSWeyn8
Results in the following output :
{ ' author_name ' : u'botmib ' , ' author_url ' : u'http://www.youtube.com/user/botmib', ' height ' : 344 , ' html ' : u' < iframe width= " 459 " height= " 344 " src= " http://www.youtube.com/embed/nda_OSWeyn8?fs=1&feature=oembed " frameborder= " 0 " allowfullscreen ></iframe >' , ' provider_name ' : u' YouTube ' , ' provider_url ' : u'http://www.youtube.com/', ' thumbnail_height ' : 360 , ' thumbnail_url ' : u'http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/nda_OSWeyn8/hqdefault.jpg', ' thumbnail_width ' : 480 , ' title ' : u'Leprechaun in Mobile , Alabama ' , ' type ' : u'video ' , ' version ' : u'1.0 ' , ' width ' : 459 }
Using these providers it is a snap to add nice thumbnail previews of content within blocks of text , or to even parse blocks of text or HTML and replace URLs with rich content ( e.g. URL becomes flash player or img tag ) .
For simplicity , micawber comes with two " bootstrap " functions to get you a prepopulated list of providers :
bootstrap_basic( ) , which loads up a list of providers with native endpoints
bootstrap_embedly ( ) , which asks embedly for a list of providers and configures them
Interactive shell session
Below is an annotated interactive shell session showing how these components work .
Import micawber and load up a list of providers .
It comes prepopulated with a handful of providers .
>>> import micawber >>> providers = micawber . bootstrap_basic ( ) >>> providers < micawber.providers.ProviderRegistry at 0x2681690 > >>> providers .
_registry { '
http://\S*.youtu(\\.be|be\\.com)/watch\\S*' : < micawber.providers .
Provider at 0x2681d90 > , ' http://\S*?flickr.com/\\S*' : < micawber.providers .
Provider at 0x2681d50 > , ' http://vimeo.com/\S*': < micawber.providers .
Provider at 0x2681e10 > , ' http://www.hulu.com/watch/\S*': < micawber.providers .
Provider at 0x2681dd0 > , ' http://www.slideshare.net/[^\\/]+/\S*': < micawber.providers .
Provider at 0x2681e50>}
Request some metadata about a URL we know about and a dictionary is returned .
All metadata returned follows the oembed spec , which specifies various response parameters :
>>> providers .
request ( ' http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nda_OSWeyn8' ) {' author_name ' : u'botmib ' , ' author_url ' : u'http://www.youtube.com/user/botmib', ' height ' : 344 , ... }
URLs we do not have providers for will raise ProviderException
>>> providers .
request ( ' http://www.google.com/' ) ProviderException : Provider not found for " http://www.google.com/ "
There are higher - level functions which can parse text or HTML , either replacing the URLs with rich content or extracting the metadata and returning it in a dictionary .
The extract functions return a 2 - tuple containing a list of all URLs in order of appearance , and then a dictionary keyed by URL containing any URLs we found metadata for :
>>> micawber .
extract ( " http://google.com/ and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nda_OSWeyn8 " , providers ) ( [ ' http://google.com/', ' http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nda_OSWeyn8'], { 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nda_OSWeyn8': { ' author_name ' : u'botmib ' , ' author_url ' : u'http://www.youtube.com/user/botmib', ' height ' : 344 , ... etc ... } } ) >>> print micawber .
parse_text ( " this is a test
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nda_OSWeyn8 " , providers ) this is a test < iframe width = " 459 " height = " 344 " src= " http://www.youtube.com/embed/nda_OSWeyn8?fs=1&feature=oembed " frameborder= " 0 " allowfullscreen ></ iframe >
Finally , if using Django or Flask there are template filters for doing the same :
>>> from django.template import Template , Context >>> t = Template ( '{ % lo ad micawber_tags %}{{ " http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nda_OSWeyn8 " |oembed }} ' ) >>> t . render ( Context ( ) ) < iframe width = " 459 " height = " 344 " src= " http://www.youtube.com/embed/nda_OSWeyn8?fs=1&feature=oembed " frameborder= " 0 " allowfullscreen ></ iframe >

A near - riot erupted on an aeroplane over South Africa as football fans rushed towards the cockpit to protest at missing last night 's World Cup semifinal between Germany and Spain , witnesses have claimed .
The fans were among hundreds of angry ticket holders whose flights were delayed or turned back because Durban 's new King Shaka international airport was full .
Some complained that priority had been given to private jets used by celebrity spectators such as Paris Hilton and Leonardo DiCaprio .
The atmosphere became fraught on a flight from Cape Town to Durban when the captain announced it was being redirected to Johannesburg , passenger Jay Moodley told the Mercury newspaper .
" There was almost a riot on the plane and about 10 foreigners rushed towards the cockpit , " he was quoted as saying .
" The captain told them that they would be arrested if they did not sit down .
Things were very tense . "
About 20 minutes later it was announced that a slot at King Shaka airport had become available and the plane would land at 8.50 pm – two hours late .
Moodley added : " People rushed off the plane and were trying to make it to the stadium in time for the second half .
There was a huge anticlimax when we landed and people were giving Durban the thumbs - down . "
In the chaos two planes were forced to turn back , while three others were allowed to land after severe delays .
Passengers were given a police escort to the game but still missed most or all of it .
Attendance at the Moses Mabhida stadium was 1,800 below capacity for Spain 's 1 - 0 victory .
Today many fans , some of whom spent thousands of pounds to be at the World Cup , said they were considering suing Airports Company South Africa ( ACSA ) .
Fifa spokesman Nicolas Maingot promised the football body would look at the cases of fans affected by flight problems .
There were other reports of emotions running high on the affected planes .
Some passengers shouted and screamed at cabin crew staff on the Kulula airline , according to the Star newspaper .
A 37 - year - old man broke down in tears when looking at his children crying over missing the semifinal , the paper said .
Kiran Singh , who was with his 11 - year - old twins , 14 - year - old son and two nephews aged 16 and 21 , had bought match tickets for R1,750 ( £ 152 ) each but arrived at King Shaka airport only five minutes before the end of the game .
" We were devastated , " he told the Star .
" We had waited a whole month for the semifinal .
We missed everything ...
We saw nothing .
I cried when I looked at my crying children .
If ACSA had a heart , they would give us tickets to the final .
We do n't want money , we just want to go and see the game . "
ACSA said problems arose because some VIP planes , which were supposed to land at King Shaka airport and later park at an old airport some 40 miles away , would not move .
" The congestion problem was caused by some private airplanes [ which ] refused to move ... after landing , therefore blocking landing space for other planes , " airports chief Monhla Hlahla told 702 Radio .
" Priority had to be given to VIPs who were caught up in the situation .
We had too many flights wanting to land and at some point we had to instruct them to turn back . "
The company insisted passengers would not be reimbursed .
The disarray was a rare setback for a tournament that has defied sceptics with its smooth running and few hiccups .
Organisers have , perhaps prematurely , already hailed it an unqualified triumph .
Rich Mkhondo , spokesman for the World Cup local organising committee , told Reuters there was nothing the organisers could do about the incident now .
" Unfortunately , these kind of things happen , " he said .
" We will be meeting with ACSA later today to make sure this does n't happen again during the final . "
Paris Hilton , meanwhile , posted on Twitter after last night 's game : " Back in Johannesberg [ sic ] already .
Shortest flight ever .
Only 15 minutes . "
The large majority of content found on BitTorrent is illegal , a new study out of the University of Ballarat in Australia has confirmed .
Researchers from the university 's Internet Commerce Security Laboratory scraped torrents from 23 trackers and looked up the content to determine whether the file was confirmed to be copyrighted .
They found that 89 percent of the files they sampled were confirmed to be illegally shared , and most of the remaining ambiguous 11 percent was likely to be infringing .
The total sample consisted of 1,000 torrent files — a random selection from the most active seeded files on the trackers they used .
Each file was manually checked to see whether it was being legally distributed .
Only three cases — 0.3 percent of the files — were determined to be definitely not infringing , while 890 files were confirmed to be illegal .
Additionally , 16 files were of ambiguous origin and 91 files were pornographic , which were unclear due to their oft - mislabeled nature .
" [ M ] any files were tagged as amateur ( suggesting no copyright infringement ) but further inspection revealed that they were in fact infringing , " wrote the researchers .
Basically , the 89 percent is a baseline number when it came to infringing files , and the three most shared categories were movies , music , and TV shows — among those categories , there were zero legal files being shared .
Assuming all 16 files of ambiguous legality were in fact legal , the researchers said that there was an overall figure of 97.9 percent infringing content being distributed on BitTorrent .
This report echoes similar results out of Princeton that were published earlier this year .
Though the top categories were slightly different — Princeton found that movies and TV were the most popular , while music fell behind games / software , pornography , and unclassifiable files — that study found that all of the movie , TV , and music content being shared was indeed infringing .
Overall , Princeton said that 99 percent of the content on BitTorrent was illegal .
The University of Ballarat said that just four percent of torrents were responsible for 80 percent of the seed population .
And , according to the list of the top 10 most seeded files , they were all Hollywood films ( save for Lady Gaga 's album , The Fame Monster , at number 7 ) — it 's clear that Linux distros were n't exactly dominating the charts here .
Copyright holders have one consolation , however : P2P users seem to buy more content than the average person , so there 's still some chance of earning those users ' money after all .
Update :
There are a number of criticisms about the study that have popped up since Friday .
Most notably , TorrentFreak raises questions about the categorization of files , the use of older data , and the numbers being used by the researchers .
We have contacted those behind the study for comment .
Update x2 : Paul Watters , one of the researchers behind the study , has responded :

Saber Kushour , an Arab convicted of ' rape by deception ' of a Jewish woman , gives his side of the story in an exclusive interview
Saber Kushour apologises as he asks his guests to move the plastic chairs on his breeze - block balcony a little closer to the door to his house .
If he were to sit where they are now , he explains , the electronic tag attached to his ankle would set off an alarm .
Kushour 's edginess is understandable – he is recalling a 15 - minute encounter almost two years ago which he says " has destroyed my life " .
Last week the married father of two from east Jerusalem was sentenced to 18 months in jail for the " rape by deception " of a Jewish woman who claimed she would not have had sex with him had she known he was an Arab .
What might have been a tawdry episode – casting neither Kushour nor the woman in a favourable light – exploded into a debate in Israel about racism , sexual mores and justice .
" I am paying the price for a mistake that she made , " Kushour , 30 , told the Observer .
" I was shocked at the sentence – it shows a very vivid and clear racism . "
The message from the judge , he says , was that " because you are an Arab and you did n't make that clear , we are going to punish you " .
In his verdict , Judge Zvi Segal conceded that it was not " a classical rape by force " .
He added : " If she had n't thought the accused was a Jewish bachelor interested in a serious romantic relationship , she would not have co-operated .
The court is obliged to protect the public interest from sophisticated , smooth - tongued criminals who can deceive innocent victims at an unbearable price – the sanctity of their bodies and souls . "
At his home in Sharafat , where he is confined while awaiting an appeal , Kushour tells a different story .
The woman has not been identified and has not gone public with her account .
Kushour was buying cigarettes in September 2008 when an unexpected opportunity presented itself for a casual sexual encounter .
" Any person in my shoes would have done the same thing , " he says .
A woman in her 20s struck up a conversation as he left the shop to return to his job delivering legal papers around Jerusalem by scooter .
" She said ' you have a nice bike ' and other things which I do n't remember . "
Within minutes , he says , he realised that her interest was not confined to small talk .
Kushour speaks fluent , unaccented Hebrew , as do many Palestinians living and working in Jerusalem .
The woman asked his name and Kushour replied " Dudu " – a common Israeli name .
" Since I was a kid everyone calls me Dudu – even my wife calls me Dudu .
It 's a nickname . "
At no point , he says , did the woman – who gave her name as Maya – ask if he was Jewish , although he has acknowledged that he said he was single .
The pair went to a small roof area in a nearby office block .
" When we were having sex , she was worried that someone would see us , but she never told me to stop .
She was more than willing – she initiated it . "
It has been suggested that Kushour presented himself as a bachelor interested in a long - term relationship .
If that had been Maya 's concern , Kushour points out , she might have asked him more about his background .
After the brief encounter , Kushour tapped Maya 's mobile number into his phone and left .
" I did n't treat her like garbage – this is what she wanted . "
Unknown to him , Maya contacted the police after the encounter to lodge a complaint .
Kushour says he does n't know how or when she realised he was not Jewish .
The woman was given a medical examination , presented in court , which showed , according to Kushour , no signs of force or injury .
Six weeks later Kushour was idly flicking through numbers in his mobile 's address book .
" I saw ' Maya ' and I thought ' who is Maya ? '
I had already forgotten about her .
I rang the number to see who it was , and then I realised it was the girl .
I said ' Can I see you ? ' and we arranged to meet . "
Maya did n't show up and did n't respond to Kushour 's calls and texts .
But , crucially , she now had a vital piece of information for the pursuit of her complaint – his contact details .
Three days later Kushour received a phone call from the police .
" They told me I had a problem and to come to the police station . "
He was interrogated for five to six hours , without a lawyer .
In the final hour of questioning , the police began to mention a rape claim .
Eventually Kushour was handcuffed and taken to a cell .
Over three days the questioning continued .
" This was the hardest moment of my entire life , " says Kushour .
" I did n't have a clue what they were going to do . "
On the third day , Kushour was taken to court – by this time represented by a lawyer found by his brother – and charged with rape .
He spent the next two months in prison and since then has been electronically tagged and confined to his home .
The case came to court last week .
His lawyer has told him that , because of the publicity surrounding the case , the appeal may be expedited .
In the meantime , says Kushour , " I can't leave the house , I can't work , I can't feed my children . "
Kushour 's conviction has transfixed Israel .
Some see echoes of a primeval – and racist – instinct to protect " our " women against outside marauders .
Others are outraged at what they see as a blatant injustice , pointing to a backdrop of widespread , systematic and – some say – growing discrimination against Arabs who make up 20 % of Israel 's population .
" This is a most amazing decision by the court , " says Tamar Hermann of the Israel Democracy Institute .
" Deception is one thing – but to be convicted of rape ? "
It has , she says , " struck a sensitive chord in the Israeli mainstream of Arabs pretending to be Jews . "
The issue of identity is paramount in a land where both communities regard each other with suspicion and hostility .
Yuval Yonay , a sociology professor at Haifa University , in one of Israel 's few mixed cities , says Kushour 's behaviour " might be improper but it is not rape " .
He says that in 16 years of teaching at a university where 20 - 25 % of the student population is Arab , he has " never even heard of a mixed relationship " .
Discrimination against Arabs is , he says , evident at all levels .
Some have defended the verdict .
" We all have different characteristics , and it is a person 's right to have sexual relations with a person knowing the facts about those characteristics , " Dana Pugach of the Noga Centre for Victims of Crime told the Israeli daily Haaretz .
Kushour says he has had a lot of support over the past week from Israeli Jews .
" The problem is not with the people themselves , but those in power , " he says .
" I just want justice . "
Whatever the outcome of his appeal , his brief encounter with Maya has turned his life upside down .
His relationship with his wife has been severely tested .
" I asked her last night to forgive me .
She said yes , but I can see the pain and hurt in her eyes . "

We referred to Saber Kushour as an Arab Israeli but Kushour is Palestinian .
This has been corrected .
Would you like to learn how to write a screenplay from a professional screenwriter and Script Doctor who has worked for major movie studios and is based in Los Angeles , California , Hollywood , the entertainment capital of the world ?
I can give you the TOOLS — the professional screenwriting how to — to write a great movie screenplay or television script .
My method is called Story Maps Screenwriting and it is the most simple , clear and effective roadmap to take you from your initial concept all the way to a polished draft that you can submit to agents , managers and producers in the movie industry in Hollywood .
95 % of great movies follow the Story Map
Let ’s look at a few examples from popular movies :
The Dark Knight , a Superhero action thriller , The Matrix , a Science Fiction action thriller and As Good as it Gets , a Dramatic Comedy .
These movies are all blockbuster hit films and employ strong Story Maps .
They are very different stories in completely different genres , but employ the same storytelling structure .
As an example , I will highlight one of the unique beats found in my Story Maps structure .
The INCITING INCIDENT is an event of HIGH CONFLICT that …
Upsets the established ORDER Ups the STAKES for the Protagonist Acts as a crucial CATALYST for the story .
Occurs in the range of page 8 – 10 of the screenplay , or 8 – 10 minutes into the movie .
The Dark Knight
Exactly 10 minutes into the movie , BATMAN ( Christian Bale ) uses his incredible strength and technology to apprehend The Scarecrow and the last of crime boss Moroni ’s crew , dealing another blow to crime in Gotham City and paving the way for a new threat , THE JOKER ( Heath Ledger ) .
One minute later , Batman pledges to Police Captain JIM GORDON ( Gary Oldman ) that he will stop The Joker , launching Batman ’s EXTERNAL GOAL ( to save Gotham City ) , the Main Dramatic CONFLICT ( The Joker ) and the THEME ( Desperation leads to destruction ) .
The Matrix
Exactly 10 minutes into the movie , NEO ( Keanu Reeves ) meets TRINITY ( Carrie - Anne Moss ) , who tells Neo that the answer to the question “ What is the Matrix ? ” will find him , but only if he wants it to .
This introduces the LOVE INTEREST ( Trinity ) , the THEME ( Free Will vs. Destiny ) and the main STORY ENGINE for Act One ( Neo searches for “ the Matrix . ” ) .
As Good As It Gets
Exactly 10 minutes into the movie , MELVIN ( Jack Nicholson ) meets CAROL the waitress ( Helen Hunt ) for his daily meal .
As they talk , Melvin makes a horrible remark about how her sick son will die just like the rest of us .
This introduces Melvin ’s LOVE INTEREST , the powerful CONFLICT between them ( negative vs. positive ) , the THEME ( Do n’t let pessimism rule you ) and Melvin ’s central GOAL : to learn to love .
There are 9 other crucial story beats in the Story Maps structure , as well as 4 story engines and 9 main dramatic elements .
These are the BUILDING BLOCKS of your story , and once you understand how to use them I can teach you about proper screenplay format , how to write a screenplay treatment or synopsis and how to sell a screenplay .
Where are you at in the screenwriting process ?
No matter if you ’re just starting out or have written several scripts , I can help you to achieve your goals .
Good luck and happy writing !

At a Slaughterhouse ,
Some Things Never Die Who Kills , Who Cuts ,
Who Bosses Can Depend on Race
Edward Keating / The New York Times A black Kill - floor worker at the Smithfield slaughterhouse in Tar Heel , N.C .
• MORE PHOTOS By CHARLIE LeDUFF About This Series
AR HEEL , N.C. --
It must have been 1 o'clock .
That 's when the white man usually comes out of his glass office and stands on the scaffolding above the factory floor .
He stood with his palms on the rails , his elbows out .
He looked like a tower guard up there or a border patrol agent .
He stood with his head cocked .
One o'clock means it is getting near the end of the workday .
Quota has to be met and the workload doubles .
The conveyor belt always overflows with meat around 1 o'clock .
So the workers double their pace , hacking pork from shoulder bones with a driven single - mindedness .
They stare blankly , like mules in wooden blinders , as the butchered slabs pass by .
It is called the picnic line : 18 workers lined up on both sides of a belt , carving meat from bone .
Up to 16 million shoulders a year come down that line here at the Smithfield Packing Co. , the largest pork production plant in the world .
That works out to about 32,000 a shift , 63 a minute , one every 17 seconds for each worker for eight and a half hours a day .
The first time you stare down at that belt you know your body is going to give in way before the machine ever will .
On this day the boss saw something he did n't like .
He climbed down and approached the picnic line from behind .
He leaned into the ear of a broad - shouldered black man .
He had been riding him all day , and the day before .
The boss bawled him out good this time , but no one heard what was said .
The roar of the machinery was too ferocious for that .
Still , everyone knew what was expected .
They worked harder .
The white man stood and watched for the next two hours as the blacks worked in their groups and the Mexicans in theirs .
He stood there with his head cocked .
At shift change the black man walked away , hosed himself down and turned in his knives .
Then he let go .
He threatened to murder the boss .
He promised to quit .
He said he was losing his mind , which made for good comedy since he was standing near a conveyor chain of severed hogs ' heads , their mouths yoked open .
" Who that cracker think he is ? " the black man wanted to know .
There were enough hogs , he said , " not to worry about no fleck of meat being left on the bone .
Keep treating me like a Mexican and I 'll beat him . "
The boss walked by just then and the black man lowered his head .
Who Gets the Dirty Jobs
The first thing you learn in the hog plant is the value of a sharp knife .
The second thing you learn is that you do n't want to work with a knife .
Finally you learn that not everyone has to work with a knife .
Whites , blacks , American Indians and Mexicans , they all have their separate stations .
The few whites on the payroll tend to be mechanics or supervisors .
As for the Indians , a handful are supervisors ; others tend to get clean menial jobs like warehouse work .
With few exceptions , that leaves the blacks and Mexicans with the dirty jobs at the factory , one of the only places within a 50 - mile radius in this muddy corner of North Carolina where a person might make more than $ 8 an hour .
While Smithfield 's profits nearly doubled in the past year , wages have remained flat .
So a lot of Americans here have quit and a lot of Mexicans have been hired to take their places .
But more than management , the workers see one another as the problem , and they see the competition in skin tones .
The locker rooms are self - segregated and so is the cafeteria .
The enmity spills out into the towns .
The races generally keep to themselves .
Along Interstate 95 there are four tumbledown bars , one for each color : white , black , red and brown .
Language is also a divider .
There are English and Spanish lines at the Social Security office and in the waiting rooms of the county health clinics .
This means different groups do n't really understand one another and tend to be suspicious of what they do know .
You begin to understand these things the minute you apply for the job .
Blood and Burnout " Treat the meat like you going to eat it yourself , " the hiring manager told the 30 applicants , most of them down on their luck and hungry for work .
The Smithfield plant will take just about any man or woman with a pulse and a sparkling urine sample , with few questions asked .
This reporter was hired using his own name and acknowledged that he was currently employed , but was not asked where and did not say .
Slaughtering swine is repetitive , brutish work , so grueling that three weeks on the factory floor leave no doubt in your mind about why the turnover is 100 percent .
Five thousand quit and five thousand are hired every year .
You hear people say , They do n't kill pigs in the plant , they kill people .
So desperate is the company for workers , its recruiters comb the streets of New York 's immigrant communities , personnel staff members say , and word of mouth has reached Mexico and beyond .
The company even procures criminals .
Several at the morning orientation were inmates on work release in green uniforms , bused in from the county prison .

The new workers were given a safety speech and tax papers , shown a promotional video and informed that there was enough methane , ammonia and chlorine at the plant to kill every living thing here in Bladen County .
Of the 30 new employees , the black women were assigned to the chitterlings room , where they would scrape feces and worms from intestines .
The black men were sent to the butchering floor .
Two free white men and the Indian were given jobs making boxes .
This reporter declined a box job and ended up with most of the Mexicans , doing knife work , cutting sides of pork into smaller and smaller products .
Standing in the hiring hall that morning , two women chatted in Spanish about their pregnancies .
A young black man had heard enough .
His small town the next county over was crowded with Mexicans .
They just started showing up three years ago -- drawn to rural Robeson County by the plant -- and never left .
They stood in groups on the street corners , and the young black man never knew what they were saying .
They took the jobs and did them for less .
Some had houses in Mexico , while he lived in a trailer with his mother .
Now here he was , trying for the only job around , and he had to listen to Spanish , had to compete with peasants .
The world was going to hell .
" This is America and I want to start hearing some English , now ! " he screamed .
One of the women told him where to stick his head and listen for the echo .
" Then you 'll hear some English , " she said .
An old white man with a face as pinched and lined as a pot roast complained , " The tacos are worse than the niggers , " and the Indian leaned against the wall and laughed .
In the doorway , the prisoners shifted from foot to foot , watching the spectacle unfold from behind a cloud of cigarette smoke .
The hiring manager came out of his office and broke it up just before things degenerated into a brawl .
Then he handed out the employment stubs .
" I do n't want no problems , " he warned .
He told them to report to the plant on Monday morning to collect their carving knives .
$ 7.70 an Hour , Pain All Day Monday .
The mist rose from the swamps and by 4:45 a.m. thousands of headlamps snaked along the old country roads .
Cars carried people from the backwoods , from the single and doublewide trailers , from the cinder - block houses and wooden shacks : whites from Lumberton and Elizabethtown ; blacks from Fairmont and Fayetteville ; Indians from Pembroke ; the Mexicans from Red Springs and St. Pauls .
They converge at the Smithfield plant , a 973,000 - square - foot leviathan of pipe and steel near the Cape Fear River .
The factory towers over the tobacco and cotton fields , surrounded by pine trees and a few of the old whitewashed plantation houses .
Built seven years ago , it is by far the biggest employer in this region , 75 miles west of the Atlantic and 90 miles south of the booming Research Triangle around Chapel Hill .

" We 're going backwards as black people economically , " he says , and attributes the decline to the Mexicans .

The workers filed in , their faces stiffened by sleep and the cold , like saucers of milk gone hard .
They punched the clock at 5 a.m. , waiting for the knives to be handed out , the chlorine freshly applied by the cleaning crew burning their eyes and throats .
Nobody spoke .
The hallway was a river of brown - skinned Mexicans .
The six prisoners who were starting that day looked confused .
" What the hell 's going on ? " the only white inmate , Billy Harwood , asked an older black worker named Wade Baker .
" Oh , " Mr. Baker said , seeing that the prisoner was talking about the Mexicans .
" I see you been away for a while . "
Billy Harwood had been away -- nearly seven years , for writing phony payroll checks from the family pizza business to buy crack .
He was Rip Van Winkle standing there .
Everywhere he looked there were Mexicans .
What he did n't know was that one out of three newborns at the nearby Robeson County health clinic was a Latino ; that the county 's Roman Catholic church had a special Sunday Mass for Mexicans said by a Honduran priest ; that the schools needed Spanish speakers to teach English .
With less than a month to go on his sentence , Mr. Harwood took the pork job to save a few dollars .
The word in jail was that the job was a cakewalk for a white man .
But this was n't looking like any cakewalk .
He was n't going to get a boxing job like a lot of other whites .
Apparently inmates were on the bottom rung , just like Mexicans .
Billy Harwood and the other prisoners were put on the picnic line .
Knife work pays $ 7.70 an hour to start .
It is money unimaginable in Mexico , where the average wage is $ 4 a day .
But the American money comes at a price .
The work burns your muscles and dulls your mind .
Staring down into the meat for hours strains your neck .
After thousands of cuts a day your fingers no longer open freely .
Standing in the damp 42 - degree air causes your knees to lock , your nose to run , your teeth to throb .
The whistle blows at 3 , you get home by 4 , pour peroxide on your nicks by 5 .
You take pills for your pains and stand in a hot shower trying to wash it all away .
You hurt .
And by 8 o'clock you 're in bed , exhausted , thinking of work .
The convict said he felt cheated .
He was n't supposed to be doing Mexican work .
After his second day he was already talking of quitting .
" Man , this ca n't be for real , " he said , rubbing his wrists as if they 'd been in handcuffs .
" This job 's for an ass .
They treat you like an animal . "
He just might have quit after the third day had it not been for Mercedes Fernández , a Mexican .
He took a place next to her by the conveyor belt .
She smiled at him , showed him how to make incisions .
That was the extent of his on - the - job training .
He was peep - eyed , missing a tooth and squat from the starchy prison food , but he acted as if this tiny woman had taken a fancy to him .
In truth , she was more fascinated than infatuated , she later confided .
In her year at the plant , he was the first white person she had ever worked with .
The other workers noticed her helping the white man , so unusual was it for a Mexican and a white to work shoulder to shoulder , to try to talk or even to make eye contact .
As for blacks , she avoided them .
She was scared of them .
" Blacks do n't want to work , " Mrs. Fernández said when the new batch of prisoners came to work on the line .
" They 're lazy . "
Edward Keating / The New York Times Mexicans , who get lower paying jobs at the plant , gather for a saint 's festival .
The work force at the Smithfield plant is 60 percent Latino , compared to 30 percent 5 years ago .

Everything about the factory cuts people off from one another .
If it 's not the language barrier , it 's the noise -- the hammering of compressors , the screeching of pulleys , the grinding of the lines .
You can hardly make your voice heard .
To get another 's attention on the cut line , you bang the butt of your knife on the steel railings , or you lob a chunk of meat .
Mrs. Fernández would sometimes throw a piece of shoulder at a friend across the conveyor and wave good morning .
The Kill Floor
The kill floor sets the pace of the work , and for those jobs they pick strong men and pay a top wage , as high as $ 12 an hour .
If the men fail to make quota , plenty of others are willing to try .
It is mostly the blacks who work the kill floor , the stone - hearted jobs that pay more and appear out of bounds for all but a few Mexicans .
Plant workers gave various reasons for this :
The Mexicans are too small ; they do n't like blood ; they do n't like heavy lifting ; or just plain " We built this country and we ain't going to hand them everything , " as one black man put it .
Kill - floor work is hot , quick and bloody .
The hog is herded in from the stockyard , then stunned with an electric gun .
It is lifted onto a conveyor belt , dazed but not dead , and passed to a waiting group of men wearing bloodstained smocks and blank faces .
They slit the neck , shackle the hind legs and watch a machine lift the carcass into the air , letting its life flow out in a purple gush , into a steaming collection trough .
The carcass is run through a scalding bath , trolleyed over the factory floor and then dumped onto a table with all the force of a quarter - ton water balloon .
In the misty - red room , men slit along its hind tendons and skewer the beast with hooks .
It is again lifted and shot across the room on a pulley and bar , where it hangs with hundreds of others as if in some kind of horrific dry-cleaning shop .
It is then pulled through a wall of flames and met on the other side by more black men who , stripped to the waist beneath their smocks , scrape away any straggling bristles .
The place reeks of sweat and scared animal , steam and blood .
Nothing is wasted from these beasts , not the plasma , not the glands , not the bones .
Everything is used , and the kill men , repeating slaughterhouse lore , say that even the squeal is sold .
The carcasses sit in the freezer overnight and are then rolled out to the cut floor .
The cut floor is opposite to the kill floor in nearly every way .
The workers are mostly brown -- Mexicans -- not black ; the lighting yellow , not red .
The vapor comes from cold breath , not hot water .
It is here that the hog is quartered .
The pieces are parceled out and sent along the disassembly lines to be cut into ribs , hams , bellies , loins and chops .
People on the cut lines work with a mindless fury .
There is tremendous pressure to keep the conveyor belts moving , to pack orders , to put bacon and ham and sausage on the public 's breakfast table .
There is no clock , no window , no fragment of the world outside .
Everything is pork .
If the line fails to keep pace , the kill men must slow down , backing up the slaughter .
The boxing line will have little to do , costing the company payroll hours .
The blacks who kill will become angry with the Mexicans who cut , who in turn will become angry with the white superintendents who push them .
10,000 Unwelcome Mexicans
The Mexicans never push back .
They cannot .
Some have legitimate work papers , but more , like Mercedes Fernández , do not .
Even worse , Mrs. Fernández was several thousand dollars in debt to the smugglers who had sneaked her and her family into the United States and owed a thousand more for the authentic - looking birth certificate and Social Security card that are needed to get hired .
She and her husband , Armando , expected to be in debt for years .
They had mouths to feed back home .
The Mexicans are so frightened about being singled out that they do not even tell one another their real names .
They have their given names , their work - paper names and " Hey you , " as their American supervisors call them .
In the telling of their stories , Mercedes and Armando Fernández insisted that their real names be used , to protect their identities .
It was their work names they did not want used , names bought in a back alley in Barstow , Tex .
Rarely are the newcomers welcomed with open arms .
Long before the Mexicans arrived , Robeson County , one of the poorest in North Carolina , was an uneasy racial mix .
In the 1990 census , of the 100,000 people living in Robeson , nearly 40 percent were Lumbee Indian , 35 percent white and 25 percent black .
Until a dozen years ago the county schools were de facto segregated , and no person of color held any meaningful county job from sheriff to court clerk to judge .
At one point in 1988 , two armed Indian men occupied the local newspaper office , taking hostages and demanding that the sheriff 's department be investigated for corruption and its treatment of minorities .
A prominent Indian lawyer , Julian Pierce , was killed that same year , and the suspect turned up dead in a broom closet before he could be charged .
The hierarchy of power was summed up on a plaque that hangs in the courthouse commemorating the dead of World War I .
It lists the veterans by color : " white " on top , " Indian " in the middle and " colored " on the bottom .
That hierarchy mirrors the pecking order at the hog plant .
The Lumbees -- who have fought their way up in the county apparatus and have built their own construction businesses -- are fond of saying they are too smart to work in the factory .
And the few who do work there seem to end up with the cleaner jobs .
But as reds and blacks began to make progress in the 1990's -- for the first time an Indian sheriff was elected , and a black man is now the public defender -- the Latinos began arriving .
The United States Census Bureau estimated that 1,000 Latinos were living in Robeson County last year .
People only laugh at that number .
" A thousand ?
Hell , there 's more than that in the Wal - Mart on a Saturday afternoon , " said Bill Smith , director of county health services .
He and other officials guess that there are at least 10,000 Latinos in Robeson , most having arrived in the past three years .
" When they built that factory in Bladen , they promised a trickledown effect , " Mr. Smith said .
" But the money ai n't trickling down this way .
Bladen got the money and Robeson got the social problems . "
In Robeson there is the strain on public resources .
There is the substandard housing .
There is the violence .
Last year 27 killings were committed in Robeson , mostly in the countryside , giving it a higher murder rate than Detroit or Newark .
Three Mexicans were robbed and killed last fall .
Latinos have also been the victims of highway stickups .
In the yellow - walled break room at the plant , Mexicans talked among themselves about their three slain men , about the midnight visitors with obscured faces and guns , men who knew that the illegal workers used mattresses rather than banks .
Mercedes Fernández , like many Mexicans , would not venture out at night .
" Blacks have a problem , " she said .
" They live in the past .
They are angry about slavery , so instead of working , they steal from us . "
She and her husband never lingered in the parking lot at shift change .
That is when the anger of a long day comes seeping out .
Cars get kicked and faces slapped over parking spots or fender benders .
The traffic is a serpent .
Cars jockey for a spot in line to make the quarter - mile crawl along the plant 's one - lane exit road to the highway .
Usually no one will let you in .
A lot of the scuffling is between black and Mexican .
Black and Bleak
The meat was backing up on the conveyor and spilling onto the floor .
The supervisor climbed down off the scaffolding and chewed out a group of black women .
Something about skin being left on the meat .
There was a new skinner on the job , and the cutting line was expected to take up his slack .
The whole line groaned .
First looks flew , then people began hurling slurs at one another in Spanish and English , words they could hardly hear over the factory 's roar .
The black women started waving their knives at the Mexicans .
The Mexicans waved theirs back .
The blades got close .
One Mexican spit at the blacks and was fired .
After watching the knife scene , Wade Baker went home and sagged in his recliner .
CNN played .
Good news on Wall Street , the television said .
Wages remained stable .
" Since when is the fact that a man does n't get paid good news ? " he asked the TV .
The TV told him that money was everywhere -- everywhere but here .
Still lean at 51 , Mr. Baker has seen life improve since his youth in the Jim Crow South .
You can say things .
You can ride in a car with a white woman .
You can stay in the motels , eat in the restaurants .
The black man got off the white man 's field .
" Socially , things are much better , " Mr. Baker said wearily over the droning television .
" But we 're going backwards as black people economically .
For every one of us doing better , there 's two of us doing worse . "
His town , Chad Bourne , is a dreary strip of peeling paint and warped porches and houses as run-down as rotting teeth .
Young men drift from the cinder - block pool hall to the empty streets and back .
In the center of town is a bank , a gas station , a chicken shack and a motel .
As you drive out , the lights get dimmer and the homes older until eventually you 're in a flat void of tobacco fields .
Mr. Baker was standing on the main street with his grandson Monte watching the Christmas parade march by when a scruffy man approached .
It was Mr. Baker 's cousin , and he smelled of kerosene and had dust in his hair as if he lived in a vacant building and warmed himself with a portable heater .
He asked for $ 2 .
" It 's ironic is n't it ? " Mr. Baker said as his cousin walked away only eight bits richer .
" He was asking me the same thing 10 years ago . "
A group of Mexicans stood across the street hanging around the gas station watching them .
" People around here always want to blame the system , " he said .
" And it is true that the system is antiblack and antipoor .
It 's true that things are run by the whites .
But being angry only means you failed in life .
Instead of complaining , you got to work twice as hard and make do . "
He stood quietly with his hands in his pockets watching the parade go by .
He watched the Mexicans across the street , laughing in their new clothes .
Then he said , almost as an afterthought , " There 's a day coming soon where the Mexicans are going to catch hell from the blacks , the way the blacks caught it from the whites . "
Wade Baker used to work in the post office , until he lost his job over drugs .
When he came out of his haze a few years ago , there was n't much else for him but the plant .
He took the job , he said , " because I do n't have a 401K . "
He took it because he had learned from his mother that you do n't stand around with your head down and your hand out waiting for another man to drop you a dime .

• MORE PHOTOS Evelyn Baker , bent and gray now , grew up a sharecropper , the granddaughter of slaves .
She was raised up in a tar - paper shack , picked cotton and hoed tobacco for a white family .
She supported her three boys alone by cleaning white people 's homes .
In the late 60's something good started happening .
There was a labor shortage , just as there is now .
The managers at the textile plants started giving machine jobs to black people .
Mrs. Baker was 40 then .
" I started at a dollar and 60 cents an hour , and honey , that was a lot of money then , " she said .
The work was plentiful through the 70's and 80's , and she was able to save money and add on to her home .
By the early 90's the textile factories started moving away , to Mexico .
Robeson County has lost about a quarter of its jobs since that time .
Unemployment in Robeson hovers around 8 percent , twice the national average .
In neighboring Columbus County it is 10.8 percent .
In Bladen County it is 5 percent , and Bladen has the pork factory .
Still , Mr. Baker believes that people who want to work can find work .
As far as he 's concerned , there are too many shiftless young men who ought to be working , even if it's in the pork plant .
His son - in - law once worked there , quit and now hangs around the gas station where other young men sell dope .
The son - in - law came over one day last fall and threatened to cause trouble if the Bakers did n't let him borrow the car .
This could have turned messy ; the 71 - year - old Mrs. Baker keeps a .38 tucked in her bosom .
When Wade Baker got home from the plant and heard from his mother what had happened , he took up his pistol and went down to the corner , looking for his son - in - law .
He chased a couple of the young men around the dark dusty lot , waving the gun .
" Hold still so I can shoot one of you ! " he recalled having bellowed .
" That would make the world a better place ! "
He scattered the men without firing .
Later , sitting in his car with his pistol on the seat and his hands between his knees , he said , staring into the night : " There 's got to be more than this .
White people drive by and look at this and laugh . "
Living
It , Hating It Billy Harwood had been working at the plant 10 days when he was released from the Robeson County Correctional Facility .
He stood at the prison gates in his work clothes with his belongings in a plastic bag , waiting .
A friend dropped him at the Salvation Army shelter , but he decided it was too much like prison .
Full of black people .
No leaving after 10 p.m .
No smoking indoors .
" What you doing here , white boy ? " they asked him .
He fumbled with a cigarette outside the shelter .
He wanted to quit the plant .
The work stinks , he said , " but at least I ai n't a nigger .
I 'll find other work soon .
I 'm a white man . "
He had hopes of landing a roofing job through a friend .
The way he saw it , white society looks out for itself .
On the cut line he worked slowly and allowed Mercedes Fernández and the others to pick up his slack .
He would cut only the left shoulders ; it was easier on his hands .
Sometimes it would be three minutes before a left shoulder came down the line .
When he did cut , he did n't clean the bone ; he left chunks of meat on it .
Mrs. Fernández was disappointed by her first experience with a white person .
After a week she tried to avoid standing by Billy Harwood .
She decided it was n't just the blacks who were lazy , she said .
Even so , the supervisor came by one morning , took a look at one of Mr. Harwood 's badly cut shoulders and threw it at Mrs. Fernández , blaming her .
He said obscene things about her family .
She did n't understand exactly what he said , but it scared her .
She could n't wipe the tears from her eyes because her gloves were covered with greasy shreds of swine .
The other cutters kept their heads down , embarrassed .
Her life was falling apart .
She and her husband both worked the cut floor .
They never saw their daughter .
They were 26 but rarely made love anymore .
All they wanted was to save enough money to put plumbing in their house in Mexico and start a business there .
They come from the town of Tehuacán , in a rural area about 150 miles southeast of Mexico City .
His mother owns a bar there and a home but gives nothing to them .
Mother must look out for her old age .
" We came here to work so we have a chance to grow old in Mexico , " Mrs. Fernández said one evening while cooking pork and potatoes .
Now they were into a smuggler for thousands .
Her hands swelled into claws in the evenings and stung while she worked .
She felt trapped .
But she kept at it for the money , for the $ 9.60 an hour .
The smuggler still had to be paid .
They explained their story this way :
The coyote drove her and her family from Barstow a year ago and left them in Robeson .
They knew no one .
They did not even know they were in the state of North Carolina .
They found shelter in a trailer park that had once been exclusively black but was rapidly filling with Mexicans .
There was a lot of drug dealing there and a lot of tension .
One evening , Mr. Fernández said , he asked a black neighbor to move his business inside and the man pulled a pistol on him .
" I hate the blacks , " Mr. Fernández said in Spanish , sitting in the break room not 10 feet from Mr. Baker and his black friends .
Mr. Harwood was sitting two tables away with the whites and Indians .
After the gun incident , Mr. Fernández packed up his family and moved out into the country , to a prefabricated number sitting on a brick foundation off in the woods alone .
Their only contact with people is through the satellite dish .
Except for the coyote .
The coyote knows where they live and comes for his money every other month .
Their 5 - year - old daughter has no playmates in the back country and few at school .
That is the way her parents want it .
" We do n't want her to be American , " her mother said .
' We Need a Union '
The steel bars holding a row of hogs gave way as a woman stood below them .
Hog after hog fell around her with a sickening thud , knocking her senseless , the connecting bars barely missing her face .
As co-workers rushed to help the woman , the supervisor spun his hands in the air , a signal to keep working .
Wade Baker saw this and shook his head in disgust .
Nothing stops the disassembly lines .
" We need a union , " he said later in the break room .
It was payday and he stared at his check : $ 288 .
He spoke softly to the black workers sitting near him .
Everyone is convinced that talk of a union will get you fired .
After two years at the factory , Mr. Baker makes slightly more than $ 9 an hour toting meat away from the cut line , slightly less than $ 20,000 a year , 45 cents an hour less than Mrs. Fernández .
" I do n't want to get racial about the Mexicans , " he whispered to the black workers .
" But they 're dragging down the pay .
It 's pure economics .
They say Americans do n't want to do the job .
That ai n't exactly true .
We do n't want to do it for $ 8 .
Pay $ 15 and we 'll do it . "
These men knew that in the late 70's , when the meatpacking industry was centered in northern cities like Chicago and Omaha , people had a union getting them $ 18 an hour .
But by the mid-80's , to cut costs , many of the packing houses had moved to small towns where they could pay a lower , nonunion wage .
The black men sitting around the table also felt sure that the Mexicans pay almost nothing in income tax , claiming 8 , 9 , even 10 exemptions .
The men believed that the illegal workers should be rooted out of the factory .
" It 's all about money , " Mr. Baker said .
His co-workers shook their heads .
" A plantation with a roof on it , " one said .
For their part , many of the Mexicans in Tar Heel fear that a union would place their illegal status under scrutiny and force them out .
The United Food and Commercial Workers Union last tried organizing the plant in 1997 , but the idea was voted down nearly two to one .
One reason Americans refused to vote for the union was because it refuses to take a stand on illegal laborers .
Another reason was the intimidation .
When workers arrived at the plant the morning of the vote , they were met by Bladen County deputy sheriffs in riot gear .
" Nigger Lover " had been scrawled on the union trailer .
Five years ago the work force at the plant was 50 percent black , 20 percent white and Indian , and 30 percent Latino , according to union statistics .
Company officials say those numbers are about the same today .
But from inside the plant , the breakdown appears to be more like 60 percent Latino , 30 percent black , 10 percent white and red .
Sherri Buffkin , a white woman and the former director of purchasing who testified before the National Labor Relations Board in an unfair - labor - practice suit brought by the union in 1998 , said in an interview that the company assigns workers by race .
She also said that management had kept lists of union sympathizers during the ' 97 election , firing blacks and replacing them with Latinos .
" I know because I fired at least 15 of them myself , " she said .
The company denies those accusations .
Michael H. Cole , a lawyer for Smithfield who would respond to questions about the company 's labor practices only in writing , said that jobs at the Tar Heel plant were awarded through a bidding process and not assigned by race .
The company also denies ever having kept lists of union sympathizers or singled out blacks to be fired .
The hog business is important to North Carolina .
It is a multibillion - dollar - a - year industry in the state , with nearly two pigs for every one of its 7.5 million people .
And Smithfield Foods , a publicly traded company based in Smithfield , Va. , has become the No. 1 producer and processor of pork in the world .
It slaughters more than 20 percent of the nation 's swine , more than 19 million animals a year .
The company , which has acquired a network of factory farms and slaughterhouses , worries federal agriculture officials and legislators , who see it siphoning business from smaller farmers .
And environmentalists contend that Smithfield 's operations contaminate local water supplies .
( The Environmental Protection Agency fined the company $ 12.6 million in 1996 after its processing plants in Virginia discharged pollutants into the Pagan River . )
The chairman and chief executive , Joseph W. Luter III , declined to be interviewed .
Smithfield 's employment practices have not been so closely scrutinized .
And so every year , more Mexicans get hired .
" An illegal alien is n't going to complain all that much , " said Ed Tomlinson , acting supervisor of the Immigration and Naturalization Service bureau in Charlotte .
But the company says it does not knowingly hire illegal aliens .
Smithfield 's lawyer , Mr. Cole , said all new employees must present papers showing that they can legally work in the United States .
" If any employee 's documentation appears to be genuine and to belong to the person presenting it , " he said in his written response , " Smithfield is required by law to take it at face value .
"
The naturalization service -- which has only 18 agents in North Carolina -- has not investigated Smithfield because no one has filed a complaint , Mr. Tomlinson said .
" There are more jobs than people , " he said , " and a lot of Americans will do the dirty work for a while and then return to their couches and eat bonbons and watch Oprah . "
Not Fit for a Convict
About This Series
Two generations after the end of legal discrimination , race still ignites political debates -- over Civil War flags , for example , or police profiling .
But the wider public discussion of race relations seems muted by a full - employment economy and by a sense , particularly among many whites , that the time of large social remedies is past .
Race relations are being defined less by political action than by daily experience , in schools , in sports arenas , in pop culture and at worship , and especially in the workplace .
These encounters -- race relations in the most literal , everyday sense -- make up this series of reports , the outcome of a yearlong examination by a team of Times reporters .
When Billy Harwood was in solitary confinement , he liked a book to get him through .
A guard would come around with a cartful .
But when the prisoner asked for a new book , the guard , before handing it to him , liked to tear out the last 50 pages .
The guard was a real funny guy .
" I got good at making up my own endings , " Billy Harwood said during a break .
" And my book do n't end standing here .
I ought to be on that roof any day now . "
But a few days later , he found out that the white contractor he was counting on already had a full roofing crew .
They were Mexicans who were working for less than he was making at the plant .
During his third week cutting hogs , he got a new supervisor -- a black woman .
Right away she did n't like his work ethic .
He went too slow .
He cut out to the bathroom too much .
" Got a bladder infection ? " she asked , standing in his spot when he returned .
She forbade him to use the toilet .
He boiled .
Mercedes Fernández kept her head down .
She was certain of it , she said : he was the laziest man she had ever met .
She stood next to a black man now , a prisoner from the north .
They called him K. T. and he was nice to her .
He tried Spanish , and he worked hard .
When the paychecks were brought around at lunch time on Friday , Billy Harwood got paid for five hours less than everyone else , even though everyone punched out on the same clock .
The supervisor had docked him .
The prisoners mocked him .
" You might be white , " K. T. said , " but you came in wearing prison greens and that makes you good as a nigger . "
The ending was n't turning out the way Billy Harwood had written it : no place to live and a job not fit for a donkey .
He quit and took the Greyhound back to his parents ' trailer in the hills .
When Mrs. Fernández came to work the next day , a Mexican guy going by the name of Alfredo was standing in Billy Harwood 's spot .
In August of 2005 , Houston banking executive Matthew Simmons ( one of the world 's " leading experts " on the topic of peak oil , although not very good at predicting oil prices ) and New York Times columnist John Tierney each put up $ 5,000 and made a bet about the price of oil in 2010 .
The wager was based on the price of oil in 2010 , specifically on the average daily price for the entire year , adjusted for inflation into 2005 dollars .
If the inflation - adjusted oil price this year is $ 200 or more per barrel , Mr. Simmons wins $ 10,000 plus interest , and if
the average price this year is less than $ 200 , Tierney wins the bet .
The bet was made public in Tierney 's New York Times column on August 23 , 2005 called "
The $ 10,000.00 Question
. " Economist Julian Simon 's widow put up $ 2,500 towards Tierney 's $ 5,000 obligation , to honor the tradition of her husband 's famous wager with Paul Ehrlich .
The chart above shows monthly oil prices in 2010 ( converted to 2005 dollars ) , including monthly projections through the end of the year , from the
Energy Information Administration
.
Now that we 're halfway through 2010 , it looks pretty certain that average oil prices this year wo n't even be anywhere close to $ 100 , and will probably average less than $ 70 , far below the $ 200 price predicted by Simmons .
Unless oil somehow averages more than $ 330 per barrel for the rest of the year , I think it 's pretty safe to assume that Tierney has won the " peak oil bet . "
Evidence of life on Saturn 's moon Titan just keeps piling up , and now we can add experimental proof to the list .
Recreating the satellite 's nitrogen - rich atmosphere and bombarding it with UV rays produces the organic molecules that lead to life .
Advertisement
We know that Titan 's atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen and methane gas , and data from the Cassini probe has shown the moon is covered in constant , extreme UV radiation .
A pair of researchers at the University of Arizona replicated these atmospheric conditions by placing nitrogen and methane in a stainless steel container , then subjecting it to constant UV rays .
The nitrogen gas behaved just as hoped , generally moving directly to solid , nitrogen - containing organic molecules .
These molecules are the precursors of life , and there 's good reason to think the scientists replicated not just the atmosphere of Titan , but also the conditions of the primordial Earth .
( And we all know how that turned out on the whole life front . )
This obviously does n't prove there 's life on Titan , but it 's a good indicator that organic molecules are being created in the moon 's atmosphere that would greatly increase the chance of life developing .
For more information on this research , including the comically insane lengths the researchers had to go to in setting up what sounds like a very simple experiment , check out the University of Arizona 's report .

The immune system : can you improve your immune age ?
In a year where we ’ve seen the largest oil spill in American history , the decimation of a tourist economy in the Gulf of Mexico , and oh yeah , and some of the most sweltering temperatures in cities from Chicago to Boston , the Democrats have scrapped any immediate plans to put a price on carbon emissions .
Sadly , this decision has been made in the face of four socio-economic realities of the moment :
The White House ’s fear of losing significant ground at the midterm in November ( is n’t this already a certainty ? )
Crude oil ’s surprisingly flat position over the past year — currently at $ 78.69 / barrel Lindsey Graham ’s about face Abysmal job growth .
The EU , Australia and recently China , all have plans in motion to make drastic policy prescriptions to mitigate carbon emissions and stimulate long - term green energy investments .
American government has shown little resolve on energy beginning with the dud it fired on Copenhagen late last year .
So , what now ?
How will the government ’s inaction on energy reform affect CSR , which to a large extent has been strategically focused on carbon intensity reduction ahead of anticipated government intervention ?
As my colleague Emily DeMasi discussed in her post on CSR ’s core role in society , government protects people unconditionally and the corporation protects people when it is in its best interest .
So , what happens when government fails as in the current moment ?
Can we rely on CSR to actually push the needle with respect to combating our emission problem ?
What ’s certain is a vacuum for leadership on energy reform exists .
Perhaps this is a moment for greater human capital investment in CSR leadership to get ahead of the government and restore innovation and integrity to American business .
I once wrote a nice rant about the inadequacy of the desktop metaphor .
In the light of the upcoming GNOME 3 , the more document - centric Shell and the browser - mode nautilus ( instead of spatial mode ) , I wanted to remix my thoughts a bit .
Note : I am not a developer and I am not on the Shell or Nautilus teams .
The idea of a desktopless environment was briefly raised on the Nautilus mailing list months ago and has hesitantly appeared at the end of the GNOME Shell Design Document , as quoted below :
Used for both ephemeral , and working set data finding and reminding .
Given time , the constant stream of things to do , the constant remainder that does not get done , and the unwillingness to categorize and archive manually , and the fact that the solution does n’t scale ( due to being spatially bound ) results in the system breaking down .
On top of this – so to speak – is the problem that this data lives underneath all of the current activities on the computer and is therefore very difficult to reach .
Which also tends to reduce its effectiveness for finding and reminding .
It also does n’t provide any form of prioritization .
In the Shell design , the “ desktop ” folder should no longer be presented as if it resides behind all open windows .
We should have another way of representing ephemeral and working set objects .
The reminding function of the desktop is really only available immediately after login .
Once any activities are started its effectiveness is dramatically diminished .
Starting the Journal automatically at login will have a equivalent effect and have the advantage of being easier to access later .
However , I have n’t seen much more happening since then , and I believe this to be a fundamental question to settle .
GNOME 3 would be , in my humble opinion , a perfect window of opportunity for an “ intrusive ” paradigm shift like killing the aging desktop metaphor .
I believe the concept of “ icons on the desktop ” to be counterproductive and perhaps counterintuitive .
This blog post is a humble attempt at demonstrating why .
Windows obfuscating contents
Most of the time , the desktop is hidden by multiple windows .
To access your desktop contents , you need to manually minimize your windows , hit Ctrl + Alt+D , or use the “ Show desktop ” panel applet ( which probably wo n’t exist in the Shell anyway ) .
Then , when you are done interacting with your desktop , you need to raise all your windows again .
You keep moving things out of the way and putting them back in the way , all the time !
Alternatively , you could use nautilus to access the contents of the desktop folder , which defeats the purpose of having contents on the desktop .
Or you could always keep an empty virtual workspace to switch to , but it quickly fills itself with windows and the cycle repeats itself .
Icons , visual clutter and cognitive strain
The Desktop is typically “ designed ” for transient files ( though , as I ’m arguing here , the vast majority of users do n’t actually use it for its intended purpose ) .
By transient files , I mean the following categories / scenarios :
Files that I received or downloaded ( through instant messaging , or files that the web browser auto - downloaded for me , for example )
Temporary crap : blogging material , files to be attached to bug reports , files from bug reports , emails , etc .
Usually files with a lifespan of five minutes .
“ Reminder ” files , there just to annoy me into doing something about them .
, there just to annoy me into doing something about them .
Files that I am currently working on ( though , in theory , nothing prevents us from working on files that were already filed properly in folders )
( though , in theory , nothing prevents us from working on files that were already filed properly in folders )
Files that are “ waiting ” for something ( for example , files I would need for project X in 2 months )
The distinguishing lines between those scenarios is often blurry , to say the least .
The problem with desktops is that we , modern “ information workers ” , have heaps of data to process , and we have the following choices to make about a file ( GTD / Inbox Zero fans will see that one coming ) :
Process it immediately ( and then delete or archive it )
Defer it ( “ I need to wait 2 weeks for event X to happen before I can touch this ” )
Archive it ( in that case , it should not be on the desktop )
Get lazy and let it sit there
Oftentimes , this means items start accumulating on the desktop for weeks on end , waiting for the right moment / motivation / energy to be used .
All this has a price .
For some , it can be annoying to have all that stuff in your face all the time , or it can become a chore to “ clean up ” .
Ironically , the inverse tendency can also be true : the less there is , the more we are inclined towards piling up new stuff .
Keeping the balance takes determination and technique ( not everyone is a GTD / Inbox Zero maniac ) .
For less organized people , the desktop just becomes a dumping ground , full of “ stuff ” constantly in your face , “ urging ” you to be processed and reminding you that you should be doing something else but do n’t have the energy or resources needed .
My point is a bit hard to prove here because , to some , it may look like I am advocating “ hiding stuff under the rug ” .
For the sake of the argument though , I shall say that I have been running my computers without a desktop since 2007 .
This is what it typically looks like :
And this is what happens if I reactivate the “ icons on the desktop ” :
As a real world analogy , my current summer job involves office work .
Pure , old - fashioned office work with actual folders , tons of paper , a hole puncher , stapler , and pencils .
I process a couple of dozen cases per day , which means that my desk is a constant mess , with me pushing and pulling folders around , using aforementioned tools , throwing them back in the pile while I go fetch printouts , letting objects fall on the floor , leaving bits of memos everywhere , etc .
It does n’t look exactly like this , but close enough :
( picture by Rob )
It is Hell .
Why would I ever want to reproduce this kind of chaos onto my computer screen ?
Is n’t it the computer ’s job to give me unlimited storage and triaging capability for me not to shuffle things around constantly ?
Text legibility
Partly due to Bug 317764 , GNOME ’s text readability on the desktop is very poor , to put it nicely .
As I do n’t want to nitpick on a bug report that I filed years ago , I wo n’t comment further on the matter .
Suffice to say , reading text without a solid , contrasting background is an accessibility disaster .
Those who want to dig the matter can take a look at the bug report linked above .
Wallpaper enjoyment
Not only complex wallpapers impair text legibility ( as mentioned above ) , but the reverse is also true : text and icons take away from your enjoyment of a good wallpaper because they add visual clutter .
When I wrote my original article a couple of years ago , I had calculated that out of my 2500 + wallpapers , about 5 - 10 % of them could actually be used with the traditional desktop metaphor .
Here ’s the thing : our icons are mostly bright , and their text labels are bright too .
Even with sufficient text borders ( if bug 317764 was fixed ) , having items on the desktop interferes with the artistic complexity of most wallpapers in terms of clutter , brightness , contrast , etc .
For that reason , only a minority of minimalistic wallpapers are truly suitable for use with icons on a desktop .
Incoherence with the “ file manager ”
By exposing the desktop folder as a special use case , we lose a great amount of functionality and break the consistency with “ normal ” folders ; the desktop does not have the same features as the “ full - featured ” file browser Nautilus .
No side pane , menubar , toolbars , no listview / treeview / compact view / infrared view , etc .
It made “ some ” sense when spatial mode was the default behavior , but it does n’t make much sense now that browser mode is the default .
TL ;DR / summary : the desktop metaphor sucks .
We are stuck with a limited surface , limited file management tools , and a background that actively impairs legibility of the files sitting on it ( unless you ’re using a solid black background ) .
Not so intuitive ?
The desktop metaphor is often presumed to be more intuitive to use , because :
The user would interact solely with that desktop , thus see the entirety of his / her ’s important files .
This falls short for anything but the simplest use cases .
Users come from Windows / Mac OS / Altimit OS and are used to the desktop metaphor .
This is one of the eternal debates of usability , “ Do we make drastic changes or do we keep everything ‘ familiar ’ ? ”
It struck me , however , that one day my mom asked me directly if those desktop folders could vanish !
A similar observation applies to a couple of other relatives : I suggested disabling the desktop because it was a mess and … they actually agreed !
In my opinion , for someone who was not trained for using the desktop ( others can be retrained , or brainwashed ) , not having a desktop does not make a computer less intuitive .
Actually , I believe having a desktop increases the difficulty , due to the reasons mentioned earlier and because it creates “ another ” way to access your files and folders .
You can easily explain to someone that “ Whenever you need to access some of your documents , you just have to access the Activities screen and click your Documents folder , or your Home folder ” .
Explaining why some things appear on the desktop but at different places in the file chooser or Nautilus ?
Not so much .
As a matter of fact , unless the gconf key “ desktop_is_homedir ” is set to True , the standard XDG directories ( Documents , Images , Music , etc. ) are not even located on the desktop , so the user has to use the Activities menu to access them anyway .
Many users do n’t bother .
And many users have no abstract conception of the distinction between the Home folder and the Desktop folder .
I have observed this time and again .
In GNOME 2.x , switching non-geeks to launching their Home folder from the Places menu is a bit of a stretch , since it requires more abstract thinking ( knowing what files and folders are ) .
Things change with the GNOME
Shell : the incredible elegance of the Shell ’s concept is that it combines applications , recent documents and places all into the Activities menu , which is accessible simply by a flick of the mouse .
This means that accessing the home folder takes exactly one click , and is much , much less painful .
The fact that the Home folder can now be accessed so easily is one more reasons why I believe the time is right to get rid of the desktop .
The fact that removable devices can be accessed ( and unmounted ) directly from the Shell is icing on the cake .
Back when I wrote the first version of this essay a few years ago , the ecosystem was different .
We were in the middle of a stable GNOME 2.x series , with no revolutionary 3.x redesign at our doorstep , and the thought of advocating a desktopless GNOME 2.x as the default behavior did n’t even cross my mind .
However , at the dawn of a groundbreaking release , I believe now is the time to voice one of my deep convictions : we ought to kill the desktop by default .
This means :
Set the key “ /apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop ” to False by default
Set the key “ /apps/nautilus/preferences/desktop_is_home_dir ” to True ( unless we have a new use for the desktop folder )
Ensure that the interaction between the Shell ’s and its places shortcuts is rock - solid : it needs to fully support dragging and dropping items onto places such as Images , Documents , Home , etc ; it needs to be reliable in showing all the removable storage devices and reliable in mounting / unmounting them .
Have 20 usb keys plugged in ?
They should all be easily accessible without even launching Nautilus .
Eventually : complement this vision with tools like GNOME Activity Journal and the ( experimental ) idea of “ project - centric ” workspaces .
Surely someone smarter than me will be able to come up with a brilliant solution to the eternal problem of “ limbo/ temporary files ” ; perhaps a zone where files have “ expiration ” dates and where users can “ pin ” files to prolong their life before they are either archived ( put in another folder ) or trashed .
What about “ @Waitingfor ” files ?
As I mentioned previously , there are some kinds of files that you need to work on at a later time .
Back in the day , I wrote a horrible , hacky python script to deal with this , called FrontBringer .
Again , perhaps that the great minds behind the 3.x vision could come up with a better way to handle this use case , with files that you can “ pin ” or put in a “ cryogenic storage ” .
Or something based on Lucas ’ newly announced Board .
Perhaps Guadec would be a great time to discuss these things ( I will not be able to attend , sadly ) .
Gentlemen , start your flamethrowers .
Using Text Substitution , you can easily write any special character or symbol like ™ or ® just by typing something like TM or ( r ) .
It can also be used to expand long phrases or particular words by typing shorter abbreviations , for example you could type “ myeml ” to instantly type out an email address , and it can also be used to quickly type out emoji rather than digging around in Character menus .
Everything is automated and the options are unlimited , in that you can have as many text replacement substitutes as you want setup .
Getting this working is quite simple , but you ’ll find that some apps in past versions of Mac OS also need the ability to use the substitutions enabled individually , not to worry , we ’ll cover that as well .
Configuring Text Substitution on a Mac
First , let ’s create a substitution or two :
Go to the  Apple menu and down to “ System Preferences ”
Click the “ Language & Text ” preference pane
Click on the “ Text ” tab
Adjust text to replace with a symbol or other text , add more text to replace by hitting the + button
The column on the left represents the shortcut , the column on the right represents the expansion that becomes substituted .
For an example shown in the screenshot below , “ OXD ” is set to be replaced with “ OS X Daily ” , so anytime the characters OXD are typed together and then followed by a spacebar or return key , the text will be replaced instantaneously .
Generally , the substitutions are best used for phrases that are commonly used , sequences that are difficult to type , or for things like certain characters or alternate spelling thats are commonly flagged as typos .
Usability wise , setting up a replacement for typing out email addresses is a great trick and goes for both Mac OS X and iOS on the mobile side of things too .
Note that in some apps prior to OS X 10.8 you will also need to enable Text Replacement individually .
This is not always the case going forward , but if you are having trouble getting text replacement to work in some apps this is the first place you should look .
Enabling Text Replacements in Mac Applications
Now here comes the interesting part , the Text Substitution feature is not enabled by default in many Mac OS X applications and it has to be manually enabled on a per application basis .
This is easy enough , but oddly Apple has named it something different once inside the application , it ’s called “ Text Replacement ” , and here ’s how to enable it :
In most applications , open the “ Edit ” menu and scroll down to “ Substitutions ”
Select “ Text Replacement ” and a check will appear next to it in the submenu , signifying text replacement is enabled for that application
Now just type a shortcut that you had set earlier and your text will be replaced with the substitution set within the System Preferences
Text substitution ( or replacement , whatever you want to call it ) is an incredibly helpful feature , and I hope Apple allows you to enable it across all applications in future versions of Mac OS X with a simple ‘ Enable for all applications ’ switch within the Language & Text system prefs .
Note : New to OS X 10.8 and beyond is an ability to see Substitutions and to edit them directly , this can be found in the “ Edit ” menu of compatible apps , then pull down to Substutions and choose “ Show Substitutions ” to enable the pop - up hovering window .
Checking the box within this window for “ Text Replacement ” toggles the feature on and off directly , and also lets you use a nice Replace All feature to go through documents where substitution did not take place and them implement those changes .
iOS also has this feature , though it ’s called “ Shortcuts ” there , and we highly recommend using it there since it can make typing on the touchscreen keyboards easier and significantly faster , not to mention more accurate with some otherwise difficult words and phrases .
On Wednesday , May 26 , 2010 , just after 2:30 p.m. , the unthinkable happened : Apple became the largest company in the tech universe , and , after ExxonMobil , the second largest in the nation .
For months , its market capitalization had hovered just under that of Microsoft — the giant that buried Apple and then saved it from almost certain demise with a $ 150 million investment in 1997 .
Now Microsoft gets in line with Google , Amazon , HTC , Nokia , and HP as companies that Apple seems bent on sidelining .
The one - time underdog from Cupertino is the biggest music company in the world and soon may rule the market for e-books as well .
What ’s next ?
Farming ?
Toothbrushes ?
Fixing the airline industry ?

Right now , it seems as if Apple could do all that and more .
The company ’s surge over the past few years has resembled a space - shuttle launch — a series of rapid , tightly choreographed explosions that leave everyone dumbfounded and smiling .
The whole thing has happened so quickly , and seemed so natural , that there has been little opportunity to understand what we have been witnessing .
The company , its leader , and its products have become cultural lingua franca .
Dell wants to be the Apple for business ; Zipcar the Apple for car sharing .
Industries such as health care and clean energy search for their own Steve Jobs , while comedian Bill Maher says the government would be better run if the Apple CEO were head of state .
( The Justice Department and FTC , which are both investigating Apple ’s tactics , might disagree . )
A Minnesota Vikings fan dubs his team the “ iTunes of quarterbacks , ” serially sampling one track from a player ’s career , as with Brett Favre , rather than buying the whole album as the Colts have done with Peyton Manning .
This shorthand is useful but tends to encourage a shallow notion of what it takes to emulate Apple .
And Apple does n’t delineate the key factors of its success .
Those principles are more closely guarded than its product pipeline .
Jobs did not comment for this article .
On - the - record comments from the CEO occur in only the most orchestrated environments ( at MacWorld , say , or in newsweekly magazine stories timed to new product announcements ) , or in late - night email messages that defy explication .
When it comes to the special sauce that makes his company the paragon of U.S. and global business , the CEO is silent .
How does one become the “ Apple of [ insert industry here ] ” ?
After speaking with former employees , current partners , and others who have watched Apple for many years , it ’s clear that the answers center around discipline , focus , long - term thinking , and a willingness to flout the rules that govern everybody else ’s business .
It ’s an approach that ’s difficult to discern and tougher to imitate .
But everyone wants to give it a try .
Here , then , is our report on the Apple playbook .
Short of something falling into your hands in a Bay Area bar , this may be as close to the truth about Apple as you ’re going to get .
{ 1 } Go Into Your Cave If Steve Jobs were an architect , he ’d work at the futuristic glass - and - steel San Francisco offices of international architecture and design firm Eight Inc .
The walls are bathed in white , and the vibe is akin to working behind the Genius Bar .
Here , on the second floor , look to the back wall .
There you ’ll discover a frosted - glass door emblazoned with a white Apple logo .
Behind it is Eight ’s Apple team — a small group that has worked with the company since the late 1990s to conceive the look and feel of its “ branded consumer experiences , ” which include its trade shows , high - impact product announcements , and 287 retail stores .
The door is locked .
advertisement
What goes on behind the locked door ?
“ We really ca n’t say too much , ” says Wilhelm Oehl , a principal designer , when I visit him one cloudy spring afternoon .
He describes his work with Apple in only the vaguest , most anodyne terms — to “ redefine elegance , ” to keep an “ integrity of design ” that “ makes the product the hero . ”
Finally ,
Oehl mumbles , “ We try to capture something that feels like magic . ”
These frosted - glass doors , and similar ones all around the world protecting other caves of Apple thinkers , are emblematic of Apple ’s fanaticism for secrecy .
But those doors are more than mere paranoia .
Apple sets its own agenda and tunes out the tech wags — competitors , industry observers , analysts , bloggers , and journalists like myself — who constantly spew torrents of advice , huzzahs , and brickbats in its direction .
Behind its doors , Apple can ignore us all .
Jobs has never cared much about what the tech industry has to say .
Back in the early 1980s , when he was leading the team building the Mac , Jobs would often give his engineers guidance on what the computer should look like .
“ Once , he saw a Cuisinart at Macy ’s that he thought looked incredibly great , ” says Andy Hertzfeld , one of the engineers on the original Mac team and the author of Revolution in the Valley : The Insanely Great Story of How the Mac Was Made .
“ And he had the designers change the Mac to look like that . ”
Another time , he wanted it to look like a Porsche .
Get the picture ?
Computers should be more like sports cars and kitchen appliances .
That ’s Apple ’s audience : high - end mainstream , the folks who buy — or aspire to buy — Porsches .
You do n’t connect with those consumers by listening to Silicon Valley .
Techies , even after all these years of Apple watching , still get bogged down in specs , speeds , and developer contracts .
Magic does n’t happen in an echo chamber . { 2 }
It ’s Okay to Be King
advertisement
Mike Evangelist ( yep , that ’s his name ) still remembers one of his first meetings with Jobs .
It took place in the Apple boardroom in early 2000 , just a few months after Apple purchased the American division of Astarte , a German software company where Evangelist was an operations manager .
Phil Schiller , Apple ’s longtime head of marketing , put Evangelist on a team charged with coming up with ideas for a DVD - burning program that Apple planned to release on high - end Macs — an app that would later become iDVD .
“ We had about three weeks to prepare , ” Evangelist says .
He and another employee went to work creating beautiful mock - ups depicting the perfect interface for the new program .
On the appointed day , Evangelist and the rest of the team gathered in the boardroom .
They ’d brought page after page of prototype screen shots showing the new program ’s various windows and menu options , along with paragraphs of documentation describing how the app would work .
“ Then Steve comes in , ” Evangelist recalls .
“ He does n’t look at any of our work .
He picks up a marker and goes over to the whiteboard .
He draws a rectangle .
‘ Here ’s the new application , ’ he says .
‘ It ’s got one window .
You drag your video into the window .
Then you click the button that says burn .
That ’s it .
That ’s what we ’re going to make . ’ “ “ We were dumbfounded , ” Evangelist says .
This was n’t how product decisions were made at his old company .
Indeed , this is n’t how products are planned anywhere else in the industry .
The tech business believes in inclusive , bottom - up , wisdom - of - crowds innovation .
The more latitude extended , the greater the next great thing will be .
Nowhere is this ethos more celebrated than at Google , where employees are free to spend some of their working hours building anything that strikes their fancy .
A few of these so - called 20 % - time projects have become hits for Google , including Gmail and Google News .
Apple ’s engineers spend 100 % of their time making products planned by a small club of senior managers — and sometimes entirely by Jobs himself .
The CEO appoints himself the de facto product manager for every important release ; Jobs usually meets with the teams working on these new gadgets and apps once a week , and he puts their creations through the paces .
“ He gets very passionate , ” Evangelist says .
“ He ’ll say , ‘ This is shit , we can do much better . ’ “
advertisement
How can it be wise for so few people to have the authority — not to mention the time — to make most of the creative decisions at a company as large as Apple ?
Bottlenecks do result .
According to one former Apple engineer , a staff of about 10 “ human interface ” designers is in charge of the entire Mac operating system .
With such a small group making decisions , Apple can put out only one or two new products a year .
But this approach works because Jobs and his team know exactly what they want .
A more decentralized company like Google may launch dozens of products a year , but more of them fail .
( Have you Waved much lately ? )
Apple hits for a high average .
And Apple ’s strong management keeps the troops focused .
“ Everybody knows what the plan is , ” says Glenn Reid , a former Apple engineer who created iMovie and worked on several other iLife apps .
“ There ’s very little infighting . ”
“ I still have the slides I prepared for that meeting , and they ’re ridiculous in their complexity , ” Evangelist says , remembering how everyone in the room understood , immediately , that Jobs ’s rectangle was right .
“ All this other stuff was completely in the way . ” { 3 } Transcend Orthodoxy
A battle rages in the tech industry , fought on the side of “ good ” by those who believe that software should be “ open ” — in other words , accessible to developers of all stripes — and on the other by misanthropes who feel that it ’s fine to limit development .
Techies generally believe that open is not only trendy but virtuous .
Google trumpets that its Android phone is more open than the iPhone .
Adobe brags that because its software tools help developers create write - once , run-anywhere software , it is the epitome of openness .
Apple counters that it wants to replace Adobe ’s proprietary Flash with HTML5 and H.264 , which are actually open Internet standards .
Nonetheless , Apple is perceived as being closed .
Cory Doctorow , author and co-editor of the widely noted tech blog Boing Boing , distilled the anti-Apple argument into a single line : “ If you want to live in the creative universe where anyone with a cool idea can make it and give it to you to run on your hardware , the iPad is n’t for you . ”
advertisement
This argument may not engage you , and perhaps you even find it boring .
That makes you just like Apple .
Despite all the noise about Apple ’s closed ideology , the company adopts positions based on whether they make for good products and good business :
You know , like a results - focused company , not a dogmatic college philosophy major .
For example , Apple happily accepted the music industry ’s copy - protection requirements because they helped it successfully launch the iTunes store .
When they no longer made business sense , it dropped them .
For Apple , the ideas of closed and free are n’t in conflict .
“ We ’re just doing what we can to try and make [ and preserve ] the user experience we envision , ” Jobs emailed Gawker blogger Ryan Tate , who had baited the CEO in the wake of Apple ’s decision to ban Flash from the iPhone and iPad .
“ You can disagree with us , but our motives are pure . ”
The App Store , Jobs wrote Tate , offers “ freedom from programs that steal your private data .
Freedom from programs that trash your battery .
Freedom from porn .
Yep , freedom . ”
Developers have griped loudly that the App Store is closed because it dictates how apps get built .
But that ’s misleading :
The problem is n’t that it ’s closed , but that its rules are arbitrary , hidden , and frequently changing .
If Apple embraced transparency , it could avoid much of this debate .
But fundamentally , who really cares about the verbiage ?
While the bloggers rage on , the App Store is a total success , and even its fiercest foes admit that it offers a dead - easy , totally fun way to find useful things to soup up your phone and tablet .
For Apple , that ’s the only philosophy that matters .
{ 4 } Just Say No The new MacBook Touch is bendable .
Its single OLED screen features a flexible seam , allowing the machine to function as a laptop , a 13 - inch tablet , or even a desktop , depending on how you flex it .
The computer has half a dozen peripheral ports , includes a stylus , and comes in two colors .
And , I should add , it does n’t exist .
It was designed by Tommaso Gecchelin , a student in Venice , Italy , who is unaffiliated with Apple , but is one of a growing subculture of people around the globe who create and share concept designs of the Apple products they ’d like to see .
Although many of these illustrated fantasies are quite beautiful , and some are uncannily realistic , their fatal flaw is often the same .
They ’re larded with features .
Apple is about less ( those six ports on the MacBook Touch should have been a dead giveaway that this was n’t an Apple product ) .
Even Gecchelin concedes , “ This is not the Apple philosophy . ”
advertisement
Jobs ’s primary role at Apple is to turn things down .
“ He ’s a filter , ” says the Mac engineer Hertzfeld .
Every day , the CEO is presented with ideas for new products and new features within existing ones .
The default answer is no .
Every engineer who has gone over a product with him has a story about how quickly Jobs reaches for the delete key .
“ I ’m as proud of the products that we have not done as the ones we have done , ” Jobs told an interviewer in 2004 .
It ’s not just Jobs ’s consistent aversion to complexity that prompts him to say no .
Apple thrives on high profit margins , and having the willpower to say no keeps production costs down .
Eliminating features also helps build buzz .
“ The great thing about omitting a feature that people want is that then they start clamoring for it , ” says Reid , the former Apple engineer .
“ When you give it to them in the next version , they ’re even happier somehow . ”
Apple has pulled off this trick time and again , most recently with the iPhone OS 4 .
It includes multitasking , a feature that customers began asking for in 2007 , intensifying their pleas after Palm debuted multitasking in its WebOS last year .
How could the iPhone not have something this elemental until its fourth generation ?
Or take the iPad : Really , no camera ?
In 2010 ?
Even the iPad - adept 2 - and - a- half - year - old girl in the YouTube video complained about it .
Come on , Apple , what are you thinking ?
Maybe it ’s thinking of a reason for you to come back next year .
{ 5 } Serve Your Customer .
No , Really
advertisement
Among the many angry customers whom Jeremy Derr encountered during his time as an Apple Genius , the one he remembers best is the professional photographer with the bad FireWire port .
“ This guy had been dealing with the issue for weeks , so by the time he came in , he was pretty distraught , ” says Derr , who began working as a Genius at Apple ’s Houston Galleria store in 2002 .
Derr determined that the machine would need to go in for service and the repair would take a week .
“ That ’s when he absolutely lost it . ”
However great your product , something will invariably go wrong — and as the classic customer - service maxim goes , only then will the customer take the true measure of your firm .
In recent years , companies of all kinds — but especially Apple ’s competitors in the computer and phone businesses — have adopted strategies that amount to customer avoidance rather than service .
They shunt their customers off to outsourced call centers staffed with underpaid agents who read from scripts , or worse , send them to an online FAQ .
When Google launched its Nexus
One smartphone through its online store in January , it forgot to make any real people available to field support questions .
It did n’t take long for the company ’s online forums to be flooded with angry customers .
When Apple devised its retail strategy a decade ago , the company had a single overriding goal : to launch stores that were unlike anything that customers associated with the computer industry .
Apple hired Ron Johnson from Target and George Blankenship from Gap .
( Last year , Blankenship decamped to Microsoft ’s new retail - store effort . )
Johnson began by asking shoppers to name their best customer - service experience , and he found that most of them agreed on a single setting , the hotel concierge desk .
Their effort to re-create the same friendliness you ’d find in a Four Seasons Hotel lobby led to the Genius Bar , which Johnson calls the “ heart and soul ” of every Apple Store .
Geniuses will look at any Apple product for free , regardless of where you bought your item .
They ’ll take a stab at fixing non-Apple software , and they ’ll even help customers with non -tech - support tasks .
“ I once helped a woman learn iMovie so she could record her wedding reception , ” Derr says .
Apple does n’t charge for any of this .
Customers pay only for repairs on out - of - warranty goods , and Derr notes that Geniuses have almost total leeway to waive these fees .
How can Apple afford to be so generous ?
“ It ’s a loss leader , ” says Derr , who left the Apple Store in 2006 to start a software company .
“ Sometimes someone comes in for help and decides to buy something on the way out . ”
That ’s exactly what happened with Derr ’s angry photographer .
As the man ranted about being unable to do without his computer , Derr suggested that perhaps he should invest in another laptop as a backup .
“ It was like I ’d said the magic words , ” Derr says .
The photographer left the store with a brand - new machine .

{ 6 } Everything Is Marketing Just as the Genius Bar has proved to be genius , the now - classic Apple slogan “ Think Different ” also turns out to be more than just words :
The brains of Apple fans really are different .
When Martin Lindstrom , a brand consultant and author of Buyology : The Truth and Lies About Why We Buy , examined those brains under a functional magnetic - resonance - imaging scanner , he discovered that Apple devotees are indistinguishable from those committed to Jesus .
“ Apple ’s brand is so powerful that for some people it ’s just like a true religion , ” Lindstrom says .
Apple cultivates religious fervor among its adherents in a number of subtle ways , including its mysteriousness and its suggestion that customers are among the chosen ones .
Perhaps most important , though , is Apple ’s devotion to symbology .
Its most effective marketing efforts , Lindstrom says , are built into the products themselves .
Think of the iPod ’s white earbuds , the Mac ’s startup sound , or the unmistakable shape of the MacBook ’s back panel .
None of these choices were accidental .
Apple understands the lasting power of sensory cues , and it goes out of its way to infuse everything it makes with memorable ideas that scream its brand .
This extends to the fanatic attention to detail that Apple brings to its biggest product launches .
These usually commence after months , possibly years , of rumors ( we ’d been hearing about an Apple tablet since 2002 ) .
The actual launch day is choreographed like a dictator ’s display of military splendor .
One example : Apple buys up all the bus-stop ad space near the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts , the San Francisco venue where it has held its recent events .
It then switches its posters while Jobs is speaking .
So this past January 27 , when I walked into Apple ’s iPad debut , the street ads depicted something old ; when I left , there ’s the iPad everywhere you look .
Study the iPad in the poster and its clock says 9:41 a.m .
Why ?
Apple thought of that , too .
That ’s the exact moment that Jobs revealed the iPad to the world .
Somewhere , Kim Jong - il is smiling .
Who else but Apple orchestrates its branding to this nth degree ?
There may be a limit to the value of Apple ’s increasing cultural ubiquity .
The company risks a Starbucksian - level backlash .
This , Lindstrom says , is Apple ’s main branding problem today .
Once we ’re all members of the church of Apple , will we all keep praying together ?
Or will the pioneers strike out in search of something less common , the next insanely great thing ?

{ 7} Kill the Past Do n’t be surprised if Apple someday unveils a “ desk - free ” computer — a machine that lets you slump on the couch with a wireless keyboard while surfing on a giant projected screen .
Or a surface that can recognize handwriting gestures , in order to let you sign your name on a touch screen without using a stylus .
There may also be a bright future in three - dimensional computing .
Instead of fussing with flat windows on your iMac , cubes , prisms , and pyramids would represent apps , and you ’d rotate one in 3 - D space to interact with different parts of the program .
More fanboy hallucinations ?
Nope .
They ’re all mentioned in recent Apple patent filings .
We may never see any of these products , but no other company reimagines the fundamental parts of its business as frequently , and with as much gusto , as Apple does .
In just the past few years , for instance , we saw the company remake its entire line of notebook computers by instituting a “ unibody ” production process .
Now its computers are laser - cut out of a single slab of aluminum or polycarbonate plastic , a dramatic shift from the way the industry has made portables since their inception .
Apple disregards the entire concept of backward compatibility , which is both a blessing and a curse for rivals such as Microsoft .
Over its history , Apple has adopted new operating systems and underlying chip architectures several times — decisions that rendered its installed base instantly obsolete .
Jobs killed the floppy disk in the iMac , and he claimed that optical drives were on their way out with the MacBook Air .
Now , with the company ’s embrace of touch screens , Apple seems to be gunning for the mouse , a technology that it helped bring into wide use in the 1980s .
Does this relentless eye toward the future always work ?
No .
Jobs killed the arrow keys on the first Mac ; Apple was forced to add them back in a later version , and it has kept them in all its Macs ever since .
More often , though , Apple ’s willingness to abandon the past makes for better products .
Nothing holds it back , so it can always stay on the edge of what ’s technologically possible .
Plus , the strategy forces the faithful to keep buying new versions .
One Apple customer recently emailed Jobs to ask whether Apple would continue to support the first iPhone , which launched in 2007 .
Jobs ’s response : “ Sorry , no . ”

{ 8} Turn Feedback Into Inspiration Steve Jobs has often cited this quote from Henry Ford : “ If I ’d have asked customers what they wanted , they would have told me , ‘ A faster horse ! ’ “ This is Jobs ’s defense of Apple ’s reluctance to listen to even its most passionate customers , and the line is a good one to remember the next time you ’re considering a new round of focus groups .
“ The whole approach of the company is that people ca n’t really envision what they want , ” says Reid .
“ They ’ll tell you a bunch of stuff they want .
Then if you build it , it turns out that ’s not right .
It ’s hard to visualize things that do n’t exist . ”
But Jobs does n’t exactly ignore customers ; he uses their ideas as inspiration , not direction ; as a means , not an end .
Ever since the netbook boom began , many people have begged Apple to put out its own .
These tiny , ultra - portable machines represented the fastest - growing segment of the PC business , and the company seemed to be missing out .
Some people ( yours truly included ) even went so far as to hack PC netbooks in order to run the Mac OS .
Jobs could not have been more dismissive .
“ We do n’t know how to make a $ 500 computer that ’s not a piece of junk , ” he said of the prospect of an Apple netbook .
Cut to January 2010 , and there ’s Jobs unveiling a $ 500 computer that is n’t a piece of junk .
But the iPad is n’t a netbook .
It ’s both more , and less — not just a faster horse . { 9 } Do n’t Invent , Reinvent

“ Revolutionary ” is one of Jobs ’s favorite words .
When he revealed the iPhone , he said , “ Today , we are introducing three revolutionary products ” ( the punch line being that he debuted just one device with the power of three ) .
Three years later , he introduced the iPad by saying , “ We want to kick off 2010 by introducing a magical and revolutionary product . ”
He ’s been doing this a long time :
In 1989 , he introduced the Next computer as the “ next computing revolution . ”
Revolutionary is a word that drives his critics batty .
Jobs touts each creation as unique and original .
Detractors insist that they all borrow freely from preexisting technologies .
And it ’s hard to argue , given that music players existed well before the iPod , and smartphones predate the iPhone .
Some of those critics , most recently Nokia and HTC , have taken Apple to court for patent infringement , a charge that Apple is quite familiar with , having settled suits leveled against it relating to the iPod ( paying $ 100 million to portable media maker Creative Technology ) and the iPhone ( Klausner Technologies , a patent holding firm , had a patent on visual voice mail ) .
This all depends on what your definition of revolutionary is .
Apple ’s talent is far more cunning and more profitable than mere infringement .
To use a musical analogy , Apple ’s specialty is the remix .
It curates the best ideas bubbling up around the tech world and makes them its own .
It ’s also a great fixer , improving on everything that ’s wrong with other similar products on the shelves .
( One of the underrated joys of a Jobs product demo is the trash talking about what everyone else in the market does n’t understand . )
The iPad is a perfect example .
Much of it has been done before ; Bill Gates demonstrated a Windows - based tablet in 2001 , and he predicted that it would become the dominant computing format in five years ’ time .
Windows tablets flopped immediately .
Why ?
First , Microsoft lamely re-created the desktop ’s interface , and it required users to deal with a clunky stylus to get anything done .
Gates also did n’t encourage developers to create tablet - specific apps .
Indeed , as Dick Brass , a former Microsoft executive , wrote in The New York Times last February , Microsoft ’s own Office team refused to modify the productivity suite for tablet computing .
Jobs saw that Apple could fix all these issues .
The operating system : Apple had solved that problem , to great acclaim , with the iPhone .
Interface : The iPhone ’s multi - touch did away with the need for a stylus .
Apps : The App Store had already proved remarkably capable of encouraging developers to create programs for a new gadget .
All that , plus a lot of thinking about design and marketing , and voilà !
A tablet that the whole world finally wanted .
Was the iPad truly a “ new ” device ?
Does it even matter ?
Apple sold 2 million of them in the first 60 days .

{ 10} Play by Your Own Clock A few weeks after the iPad hit the shelves , word leaked that HP had decided to delay and retool the Slate , the tablet PC that it had promised would rival Apple ’s “ Jesus tablet . ”
The same day , Gizmodo reported that Microsoft had killed the Courier , another reputed iPad killer .
Research in Motion , too , has delayed its planned tablet until 2011 .
From what we saw and heard of these devices , they were more complicated than the iPad — full - blown computers in tablet form rather than the streamlined iPad .
Caught off guard by the market response , these rivals realized that they ’d be releasing their version of a faster horse .
They went back to the drawing board .
Meanwhile , other Apple rivals , including Google , British Telecom , and Intel , are now scrambling to enter the tablet game .
Apple does n’t get caught up in this competitive frenzy ( perhaps because it ’s working behind those locked doors ) .
It plays by its own clock .
Apple ’s release schedule is designed around its own strategy and its own determination of what products will advance the company ’s long - term goals .
It can do this , in part , because of Jobs ’s exalted position among chief executives .
The average American CEO ’s tenure is about six years , and it ’s steadily declining .
Many CEOs are just a couple of consecutive bad quarters away from pink slips .
Jobs knows he ’s never going to get fired , so he ’s liberated to devote years — if that ’s what it takes — to attain Apple ’s high standards and hit the fat part of the adoption curve .
Most CEOs are n’t so lucky .
The company ’s long - range focus allows it to do something much more sophisticated as well : build the future into its current products .
For the past decade , the company has released a series of platforms — Mac OS X , the iPhone OS , iTunes , its retail stores , the App Store , and recently its own microprocessors and iAd , a mobile - advertising system — that give it a stepping stone to its next products .
The iPad is the culmination of all these things .
Its glass screen , interface , unibody construction , operating system , and App Store all originated in other Apple products .
Within the iPad are clues to Apple ’s future gadgets and services , though we ’ll only be able to spot them in retrospect .
Of all the points we ’ve covered here , Apple ’s willingness to go long is perhaps its greatest strength .
The company has a plan .
It ’s on the right path , and that fuels both confidence and grand ambitions .
It ’s executing , to say the least .
Which is why the “ Apple of American business ” is , well … Apple .

When light is absorbed by atoms , the electrons become excited .
If the light particles , so - called photons , carry sufficient energy , the electrons can be ejected from the atom .
This effect is known as photoemission and was explained by Einstein more than hundred years ago .
Until now , it has been assumed that the electron start moving out of the atom immediately after the impact of the photon .
This point in time can be detected and has so far been considered as coincident with the arrival time of the light pulse , i.e. with " time zero " in the interaction of light with matter .
Their measurements revealed that electrons from different atomic orbitals , although excited simultaneously , leave the atom with a small but measurable time delay of about twenty attoseconds .
German scientists hit electrons with light and then measured how they soon they moved .
The delay between the bombardment and the movement of those electrons is the shortest interval of time ever measured , which is 20 attoseconds .
An attosecond is one quintillionth of a second .
The scientists tested the assumption , and this is what happened : Link via Popular Science | Photo : Thorsten Naeser / Max -Planck - Institute of Quantum Optics
1842 , " ancient obscene painting , especially in temples of Bacchus , " from French pornographie , from Greek pornographos " ( one ) depicting prostitutes , " from graphein " to write " ( see - graphy ) + pornē " prostitute , " originally " bought , purchased " ( with an original notion , probably of " female slave sold for prostitution " ) , related to pernanai " to sell " ( from PIE * perə - , variant of root * per - ( 5 ) " to traffic in , to sell " ) .
A brothel in ancient Greek was a porneion .
In reference to modern works by 1859 ( originally French novels ) , later as a charge against native literature ; the sense of " obscene pictures " in modern times is from 1906 .
Also sometimes used late 19 c. for " description of prostitutes " as a matter of public hygiene .
Pornography , or obscene painting , which in the time of the Romans was practiced with the grossest license , prevailed especially at no particular period in Greece , but was apparently tolerated to a considerable extent at all times .
Parrhasius , Aristides , Pausanias , Nicophanes , Chaerephanes , Arellius , and a few other [ pornographoi ] are mentioned as having made themselves notorious for this species of license .
[ Charles Anthon , " Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities , " New York , 1843 ]
I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description [ hard - core pornography ] ; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so .
But I know it when I see it , and the motion picture involved in this case is not that .
[ U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart , concurring opinion , " Jacobellis v. Ohio , " 1964 ]
E. Bray in The Medical Archives [ December 1872 ] proposed porniatria for " the lengthy and really meaningless expression ' social evil hospital ' .... "
In ancient contexts , often paired with rhypography , " genre painting of low , sordid , or unsuitable subjects . "
Pornocracy ( 1860 ) is " the dominating influence of harlots , " used specifically of the control of the government of Rome and the election to the Papacy during the first half of the 10th century by the noble but profligate Theodora and her daughters .
Pornotopia ( 1966 ) was coined to describe the ideal erotic - world of pornographic movies .
Two more women have come forward claiming Steven Seagal made unwanted sexual advances toward them while they worked for the actor ... but Seagal 's lawyer tells a very different story .
TMZ has learned both women have provided Kayden Nguyen with sworn declarations , to assist Nguyen 's lawsuit against Seagal -- in which the 23 - year - old claims she was sexually assaulted by the actor during her stint as his personal assistant .
In one woman 's declaration , obtained by TMZ , Seagal is accused of luring her into his bedroom , putting his hands on the woman 's breasts and stating that he was " checking just as a doctor would for lumps . "
The declaration continues , " Seagal reached his hand down my pants .
He said , ' I just wanted to touch it for a second to see what it felt like . ' "
The woman claims she screamed and cried until Seagal let her go .
Like Nguyen , both women claim they were hired by Seagal to serve as his assistant , but quit after Seagal made inappropriate sexual advances .
TMZ spoke with Seagal 's lawyer , Marty Singer , who tells us , " My client has no knowledge of these women and a preliminary check of his employment records does not show that they ever worked for him . "
Singer also stated that regardless of whether they worked for him or not , their claims are " absurd . "

DINOSAURS were shape - shifters .
Their skulls underwent extreme changes throughout their lives , growing larger , sprouting horns then reabsorbing them , and changing shape so radically that different stages look to us like different species .
This discovery comes from a study of the iconic dinosaur triceratops and its close relative torosaurus .
Their skulls are markedly different but are actually from the very same species , argue John Scannella and Jack Horner at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman , Montana .
Triceratops had three facial horns and a short , thick neck - frill with a saw - toothed edge .
Torosaurus also had three …
The UN has confirmed that it is considering a formal review of its Clean Development Mechanism ( CDM ) after a new report leveled fresh criticism at the high profile carbon offsetting scheme .
A coalition of green groups working under the banner CDM Watch yesterday tabled a formal request calling on the UN 's climate change secretariat to overhaul the CDM and crack down on alleged " gaming " of the system that has allowed some firms to benefit from increasing their greenhouse gas emissions .
The controversy surrounds companies which currently receive carbon credits for capturing and destroying the powerful greenhouse gas HFC - 23 - a by product resulting from the production of the refrigerant gas HCFC - 22 .
CDM
Watch has alleged the way the CDM is structured means that chemical gas manufacturers based in China and India and South and Central America have been incentivised to increase the production of HCFC - 22 and HFC - 23 as they can then earn Certified Emissions Reductions ( CERs ) carbon credits , which can be sold into carbon markets such as the EU Emissions Trading Scheme .
Lambert Schneider , a former member of the UN climate change secretariat 's Methodologies Panel and one of the original designers of the CDM system , has joined the ranks of its critics .
" The amount of HCFC - 22 production and HFC - 23 generation appears to be mainly driven by the possibility to generate offset credits rather than other factors , " he said .
Speaking to BusinesGreen.com , CDM Watch director Eva Filzmoser said the CDM iniative was creating perverse incentives that ran counter to its original goals of promoting more sustainable activities .
" The essence of our complaint is that we accuse the CDM Project of massively inflating HCFC - 22 production , " she said .
" We would like to see the UN respond to this concern by amending the methodology that is in place at this stage . "
According to Filzmoser the CDM is not the right place to deal with the destruction of HFC - 23 .
" We think it should all be dealt with under the Montreal Protocol [ covering ozone depleting gases ] , " she said .
" Until this happens we think the CDM incentives need to be lowered as they are much too high at the moment . "
The Montreal Protocol dates back to 1987 and aims to phase out the use of ozone depleting chemicals , including several groups of halogenated hydrocarbons .
David Abbass , public information officer at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat , told BusinessGreen.com that the UN is considering the evidence of abuse of the CDM system and will adjust its safeguards if necessary ,
" A request for revision of the methodology used in these projects is now with the CDM Executive Board 's Methodologies Panel , " he said .
He added that there were already safeguards in the existing CDM project assessment methodology designed to prevent abuse of the system .
" Specifically , no new plants can qualify to earn credits and the amounts that can qualify are pegged to historic production levels , " he said .
" The question now is whether the safeguards need to be adjusted or added to .
That 's what the Board will be looking at . "
The CDM board is due to discuss the issue at its next meeting from the 26 to 30 July .
However , CDM Watch maintains that the abuse of the system is widespread and endemic and will not be easy to correct .
" There might be some projects out there that are not flawed but they are hardly even countable let 's say , " said Filzmoser .
" If a rule incentivises abuse you are much more likely to see that abuse than if the framework tries to set in place measures that would avoid gaming the system .
Unfortunately industry always wants to get more money . "
There are big hints on what lies ahead for Syfy 's twin flagship shows : Felicia Day is coming to Eureka , major secrets of the Warehouse will be revealed , a Eureka resurrection , and the simple joys of crossing over Claudia and Fargo .

Each panel started with specially made trailers that cut together footage from the episodes that have already aired , along with glimpses of what lies ahead .
The major reveal for Eureka : Nathan Stark is back , announcing his return with a super - cool , " Hey Carter .
Miss me ? "
There were no details as to how exactly he 's come back from the dead , although that whole altered timeline business probably has a lot to do with it .
Indeed , the cast of Eureka just keeps on growing - the panel confirmed Wil Wheaton will be appearing in a bunch of episodes beyond his initial appearance in this week 's episode ( and our thoughts on that episode will be coming later today ) , and there was a surprise appearance by the show 's newest cast member .
Felicia
Day has officially signed on for ten episodes , and her unexpected drop - in at the panel made it quite clear just how thrilled she was to be joining the show .
Again , there were no details on just what she 'll be doing on the show , but still ... half a season 's worth of Felicia Day on Eureka ?
Yeah , we do n't need any convincing .
Advertisement
And what about the show 's major cast addition that 's already happened ?
James Callis explained why he took on the role so soon after playing Gaius Frakking Baltar :
" To be really honest , I was n't looking for an opportunity to return to the genre .
But when you 're presented with an amazing opportunity - you 're going to be traveling through time , from the 1940s , a bit of a mystery , a fish out of water - I just had to take it . "
As for the altered timeline itself , co-creator Jaime Paglia explained it 's something they 've wanted to do for a very , very long time :
" The network wanted us to stretch our wings in season four and prove we actually deserved one .
One of the ideas that we had had for an episode going way back was ' Founder 's Day ' , and we had an episode where everyone would wake up and do things that we did n't normally see on the show , and over the course of the episode they would figure out what 's going on . "
Advertisement
He explained SyFy was thrilled with the altered timeline plot , even telling us that one executive did a little happy dance when they said Fargo would be the new head of Global Dynamics .
Admittedly , the executives suddenly got very , very nervous when they told them that they would n't be pressing a reset button , that this would be the new status quo for Eureka .
They said they wo n't be copping out of the big cliffhanger , and that there are just too many great stories to tell in this new timeline .
One such story is Zane , who 's suddenly been reverted to his original roguish state .
The producers explained that they felt Zane had lost some of his spark as he became reformed .
They wanted to see Jo have to struggle again to find the good in Zane , because everything that made him good is still there - it 's just a lot harder to see now .
This was , in the end , an effort to get Zane back to the elements that made them fall in love with him in the first place .

We asked whether the show could ever really go back to completely self - contained stories like the show had done for so long , and they agreed it 's going to be a challenge telling stories that are n't somehow involved with the altered timeline arc , but there will be some episodes that focus really heavily on the timeline change , and some that will feel more or less like more traditional episodes of Eureka .
On Fargo 's big promotion , Neil Grayston exclaimed :
" Fargo 's running Global Dynamics !
That 's awesome !
It 's the worst idea in the world but the funnest thing to do .
He has access to every single button now .
That 's a lot of doomsday scenarios . "

We later asked Neil Grayston whether we might someday get to see the original , fearsome Fargo of the new timeline .
He said there are n't any plans right now to do it , but he thought it would be interesting to see something like old security footage of the characters from the new timeline .
( Or , as we suggested , an old Eureka episode retold with the characters in their altered roles and personalities . )
For now , the show will focus on Fargo trying to be his altered timeline counterpart and attempting to work out what he did to get so much power and authority .
And he is n't the only person on the show getting additional authority , although most of this will be behind the camera .
Colin Ferguson ( Carter ) , Salli Richardson - Whitfield ( Allison ) and Joe Morton ( Henry ) will all be directing episode 's this year .
We did n't learn anything about what the last two will be doing with their episodes , but Colin Ferguson will be directing Eureka 's rocket trip to the moon .

Now on to Warehouse 13 .
Showrunner Jack Kenny gave us some tantalizing hints as to what lies ahead for the show .
Episodes 11 and 12 will involve some heavy - duty green screen as they head to Egypt 's Warehouse 2 , and there 's a big holiday episode coming up in December .
There 's also a very cool new character joining the show , as Iron Man and Star Trek actor Faran Tahir is coming on board later this season as a new regent of the Warehouse .
We asked him if the H.G. Wells arc is the start of a shift away from artifact - of - the - week plots to more ongoing stories , and he essentially split the difference between the two .
He explained that the characters are what drives the show 's arcs , and they build a lot of mini-arcs around the guest stars and how long they 'll be around for .
He also said that they always want to wrap any ongoing story they 're telling around a new artifact , and to be sure both aspects comment in some way on the characters .
Advertisement
A big topic for the Warehouse 13 cast was all their romantic entanglements .
On the multiple girlfriends he 'll have over the course of the next season , Eddie McClintock explained :
Pete likes chicks .
I 've been lucky enough to have a writing team that lets
Pete do other things than besides solve cases and look for artifacts and Paula Garces and Tia Carrere do a great job in fulfilling that little niche , and I got a little kiss with Jaime Murray [ H.G. Wells ] .

Claudia also gets a boyfriend this season , and Artie will have his abilities as a father figure severely taxed in advising her on a topic he knows nothing about , leading to a lot of " awkward clumsiness " between the two .
Artie will indeed develop a crush on a librarian played by Lindsay Wagner , although all indications suggest it 's just going to remain an unrequited infatuation .
Myka will remain without romance , although she does develop a very interesting platonic relationship with someone , and she gets to make out with a professional wrestler .
( It was unclear whether Joanne Kelly considered this a fair consolation . )
And what about the mysterious Mrs. Fredric ?
Showrunner Jack Kenny confirmed we 're going to learn a lot more about Mrs. Fredric , where she comes from , and how she 's connected to the Warehouse through time .
In terms of how Artie deals with the character , Saul Rubinek explained :
" There 's kind of an abject terror that I keep undercover .
There 's a mysterious quality to this woman both as a woman and as a character .
So there 's a respect and just keeping my distance enough just to protect ourselves . "

C.C.H .
Pounder said she actually knows nothing about her character 's identity , and she honestly likes it that way .
She speculated that fans would likely figure out what was going on with Mrs. Fredric long before she did .
If nothing else , we know she wo n't be getting any romantic entanglements anytime soon .
As Jack Kenny explained , her lover is the Warehouse , quipping , " It 's big , dark , and complex - what more could a woman want ? "
When the panel was asked how big the Warehouse actually is , the answers ran the gamut from extremely large to impossibly huge .
Joanne Kelly said it was infinite , while Allison Scagliotti suggested it was constantly expanding , much like the universe itself .
Saul Rubinek tried for a more prosaic answer , guessing that , since the Warehouse is the sum of all twelve that came before it , it must extend about three miles into the mountain .
Jack Kenny suggested the precise dimensions did n't matter - what was really important is that we never see the back of the warehouse , that it continue to go on forever .
Advertisement
He also mentioned a cool feature of Warehouse 13 that most of the cast did n't even know about : an observatory at the top of the mountain with a giant telescope and a spiral staircase linking it back to the warehouse proper .
He explained that they were going to show it at the end of this season , but the story changed .
He later explained to us that the story was going to be about an asteroid headed towards Earth , but they decided that was just too huge a story to tell at this point in the show .
He did confirm that that 's still a story they hope to tell , along with an intriguing story about the most sinister artifact imaginable : Hitler 's microphone .
Of course , so much of the discussion was centered on the big crossover between the two shows , particularly with Neil Grayston and Allison Scagliotti moderating the panels for each other 's shows .
Scagliotti explained she lobbied for three things in the new season : a boyfriend , a crossover with Fargo , and to brandish a Tesla gun - and she got all of it !
The Eureka trailer showed the two on the ground together , and the two confirmed there would be a little romance between the two characters :
Neil Grayston : " There was lots of explosion and lots of fire . "
Alison Scagliotti : " There was romance .
Sparks were bound to fly . "
Advertisement
And it hardly sounds like the end of the line for these crossovers .
Saul Rubinek hopes
Artie crosses over at some point , suggesting to us that perhaps his Eureka character could be revealed as Artie 's twin brother who changed his name .
( Or they could just sort of ignore it , like Doctor Who and Star Trek have so often done with actors in multiple roles . )
We asked Jack Kenny whether we might ever see a gigantic , JLA / JSA - style team - up between the two shows .
He said it would be hugely difficult to do justice for all the members of such a big cast , but he definitely sounded up for it - suggesting that could even be the premise of an eventual movie .
And , if nothing else , there may be a minor but permanent crossover between the two shows : at the end of the Warehouse 13 panel , Neil Grayston suggested they add another artifact to the Warehouse shelves that is the symbol of one of the world 's great geniuses ... and then gave them a Fargo bobblehead .

This article presents the case that the phenomena of free software is an important tool in pushing forward anarchist ideals and raising awareness in the wider public through example .
Free Software as Part of the Anarchist Toolkit
Background History
The way we write software both now and in the past is heavily influenced by the history of software and computers .
People tend to think as software being a recent phenomena , which it is and thus they do not tend to think in terms of histories .
Its as if not a long enough time period has elapsed for history to begin .
The beginnings of software got off to a relatively slow start and was restricted to a very limited number of individuals , although they made huge progress and contributions .
It was n't really until the late 70's and onwards into the 80's that it became something , done by masses of people to the present situation where perhaps a million or more people now write software .
Looking back at the roots of computers and software , we can see that their primary usage then was largely of mathematical origin as were the immediate goals .
The people involved at the beginning were nearly all either mathematicians , physicists and engineers .
Much like the development of science and scientific knowledge , information and ideas were shared and in the early days of software , much of it was shared and given away free .
In certain respects then , it paralleled the trajectory of science .
With the arrival of the personnel computer ( PC ) , companies started charging for software .
However there were clearly some people who were not happy with this development and whether it was a result of it or not , or just a spontaneous thing , the Free Software movement of open source and freeware got started and quickly flourished .
In the early days , programs were shared by floppy disks and even through listings in PC magazines like ' Byte ' for example .
With the arrival of the Internet and widespread availability of modems , bulletin boards and other such sites ( e.g. the famous SimTel site ) become the dominant means of sharing software .
And with the arrival of the Web there are hundreds if not thousands of websites offering free software .
In many ways though this idea of giving ' information ' is not new .
One could argue that for thousands of years folk music was and largely still is free , where musicians are free to copy and modify songs and music as they see fit .
Only in recent times has music become more commercial and fenced off under the banner of private property through the legal invention called copyright .
Still though that does not prevent literally millions of people from playing music themselves and creating it via their own instruments .
Had music been copyrighted from day one it is certain that we would have never have the rich heritage of traditional music found all over the world .
The same applies to the progress and advancement of science .
There would basically be none .
What if , Newton , Faraday , Maxwell and many others , had patented their discoveries ?
We are in a similar position with software , except thankfully we have not been fenced in yet , although software patents are capitalism 's current battering ram to crush the movement and fence off intellectual ideas .
The Nature of Software .
What is it ?
And this brings us neatly to the idea of software and what it really is ?
It could be defined in various ways depending on where you are coming from .
So if you were writing a mathematical program , you might call it an algorithm which was a common enough term not so long ago .
A slightly different perspective might describe it as a state machine bringing in the notion of its roots in logic and logic processing .
And this brings us neatly to the idea of software and what it really is ?

So if you were writing a mathematical program , you might call it an algorithm which was a common enough term not so long ago .
A slightly different perspective might describe it as a state machine bringing in the notion of its roots in logic and logic processing .
Getting more philosophical one might simply say software is information or can be representative of an idea harking back to the algorithm concept .
Some might argue that describing software as information is incorrect , but to some extent we can think of HTML ( used for creating web pages ) or XML as both a program or state - data and at the same time as information .
Since we mentioned music earlier , it is worth returning to it .
About 50 years ago most people would have described music as sound but now in this age of CDs and MP3 players , it can definitely be thought of as data .
As the data stream from a MP3 file is processed by a piece of software it can produce music , although we would all agree it is necessary to produce sound , we would also all agree that the characteristics of that piece of music is embodied in the data .
So where does all that leave software ?
Probably nowhere extra special really and it is just another variant and in the same category as information , music ( + video ) and ideas .
The universe of information is different to the physical world of stuff , because in the physical world you have to get stuff , it tends to be fixed in size , takes up lots of space , is very finite ( e.g. gold ) and takes lots of energy and time to lug it around .
That makes sharing difficult and means there will always be limited supplies .
Not so with information , where you can have as much as you want for very little effort and it can be passed around to everyone with tremendous ease and little cost .
All of this obviously makes it much harder to control as opposed to the physical world where it is easier to hold territory and horde resources which might explain the much better success that capitalism has had in taking the commons ( land ) and privatising it thus denying people the ability to sustain themselves and therefore make them dependent on capitalists for survival .
The Means of Production in our Hands
If we take a Marxists view of software in relation to work or the economy , then it is another angle on the means of production and it 's social consequences .
As everyone knows , capitalists through owning the means of production ( i.e. factories and machines ) control it and make the workers dependent on them , since they already , as stated above , took away their means of growing their own food .
By owning the means of production , it gives capitalists a big role in determining the uses that the outputs of industry will be put to and the resulting wider social effects .
In this respect it might be worth considering the priority and large amount of resources given over by capitalism to the production of things like cars , tanks , fighter aircraft , missiles and nuclear weapons .
It might be counter argued the former USSR produced these things , but then again that was a State Capitalist system .
However the common denominator being that it is the tiny minority of those in power ( in the case of the USSR ) or the owners of capital that make the decisions .
Not only that , this power is nearly always unaccountable too .

Contrast this with the fruits of the free software movement so far , where the means of production is back in the hands of the ordinary people - well programmers at least but who are not driven by the motive of profit but seem instead to be acting out the human values of creativity , inquisitiveness and solidarity and sharing .
Instead of the destructive products some of which were listed above , I think it would be fair to say that the products produced have enhanced human culture , and helped in the exchanged of ideas and further advancement of communication amongst and between people directly .
When I say this , I am thinking of course of software like the Mozilla / Firefox browser , Apache webserver ( reckoned 50 % of all webservers are run on Apache ) , Perl and PHP programming languages , various free music players , email programs ( Mozilla Thunderbird ) , ftp software , wikis , blogs , free publishing tools , free image , video and audio players and editing tools ( gvim ) and loads of other stuff .
And of course Linux .
And this has not been restricted to just the English speaking Western world because a lot of this software has been translated into numerous languages and the benefits of this intellectual capital is available to all the countries of the world .
And yet potentially this is really only the beginning .
The Current Situation Already at this juncture there is a vast array of sites and tools to push the evolution of the free software movement further along .
For example there are sites like Already at this juncture there is a vast array of sites and tools to push the evolution of the free software movement further along .
For example there are sites like sourceforge .
net that offer free disk space for hosting free software projects and there are thousands of websites and email lists and forums .
The amount of free software and projects seems to be growing all the time and the number and range of ideas is huge where it seems each success seems to inspire and spur others on .
It ought to be acknowledged though that most projects are small and not very active , while the number of big and successful projects is small but they do tend to have relatively big impact .
Briefly dwelling on the negatives , Capitalism is well aware of the potential threat that free software represents whether that be directly to profits or to long term objectives like the control of information and ideas .
Free software is fundamentally at odds with the nature of capitalism , but it would be fool hardy to not accept that capitalism can be and is very flexible in accommodating and ultimately co-opting any of the threats it faces , as it has done throughout the 20th century .
We have to be ever vigilant against the dead hand of control .
What 's more , humanity is at a turning point because we are faced with a number of grave issues all coming together simultaneously .
In large measure these would be the current 6th mass extinction event as agreed by 400 of the worlds top biologists and ecologists 1 and which we are experiencing in the biosphere as we speak .
The second issue is global warming where now the consensus of atmospheric scientists seems to indicate we will experience not just the low end of the forecast , but the medium scale warming of up to 4odegrees globally .
And in the past few years , there is increasing discussion amongst leading atmospheric scientists that we are in danger of triggering the high end of the forecast with 6 + degrees and that would be a direct threat to continuation of the species .
( For example it is estimated without global warming as part of the mass extinction we will lose ~ 50 % of species .
Including global warming brings those estimates up into the 60 % to 70 % bracket . )
The third issue is Peak Oil 2 and the long term consequences for industrial society .
So the question is , should we fail the above challenges and humanity enters a long slide downwards and the decay of industrial society , will this era of rapid global communications , vast amounts of digital storage and spare time to write software - disappear , only to be a short lived and unique phenomena in the history of humankind ?
In other words will the problems we face overwhelm the infrastructure needed to support all these technologies ?
( And which is suggested in the original Club of Rome reports .
These were published in the 1970s and identified not just resource limits , but the possibility of a pollution crisis too as overwhelming industrial society and causing its downfall . )
Of course the answer wo n't be found here but I think a small part of finding the solution is in fact here in the form of free software .
For free software has two roles .
1 ) and it is doing this already , is to make available the tools to spread out and share information as widely and as easily as possible , thereby making society more informed and achieving rapid ( and needed ) culture change and 2 ) to help the transformation from the current fragmentary representative and badly functioning democracy to one of participatory democracy .
This is of course very much along the lines of what Anarchism is about .
And I say participatory because it is in the nature of free software that it encourages people to get involved in whatever way is possible for them .
To achieve such a transformation on the wider scale , requires people to have already tried the equivalent or similar at the smaller scale and to become familiar with it .
And free software is potentially one of those opportunities .
Wikipedia is one of those things that springs to mind in drawing people in to participate and add their worth .
Forging Ahead and Creating Alternative Futures Returning to one of the core features of free software that of controlling what you produce ; this very much ties in with the slogan : Another world is possible .
Indeed it is and many of those who repeat this slogan often talk about how there ought to be more democracy and giving people voices .
As we 've seen already when we have that , the results are really good .
Free software is all about this and has already produced the goods .
At this stage , events in the world of information should be influencing the physical world and inspiring people to action .
Others might caution that since these are quite different domains , we should not be drawing lessons and coming to the wrong conclusions .
Well that 's too weak an argument to do nothing .

Well that 's too weak an argument to do nothing .
In earlier times , during the Industrial Revolution and probably a time when there was a greater sense of community than is currently the case in any part of suburbia , there were many voluntary groups that arose to provide free services .
Examples are the early Fire Brigades , Ambulances and Lifeboats .
Over the years these functions have been taken over by the State , but certainly that Anarchist spirit was there even if the people involved did n't think of it that way .
Around the same time many charities sprung up and again these reflect the inherent human traits that some people have for sharing , empathy and so forth , although one could argue on an intellectual level these were often co-opted even to this day by religious notions .
It is to this tradition that we need to rekindle these ideas amongst the wider public but in new forms applicable to society today .
And so we need to start the process of migrating , these ideas and concepts of free software to which more and more people are exposed and familiar with in their daily lives , across to the real ( physical ) world .
And one of the leading ideas that comes to mind is the freecycle groups which are basically email lists for local regions where people can offer up things for giving away free like furniture , clothes , books , or whatever .
Presumably it is things they no longer need or have a use for .
But it does represent a foothold in the physical world of free software concepts , largely because in people 's minds it is associated with the Internet , PCs and software since the email list is the thing that glues it altogether .
Further ideas are free travel on public transport which actually exists very sporadically in places ( Perth ? , Australia ) , although free travel for certain groups of people like old age pensioners is more common ( e.g. Ireland ) and indeed very liberating for them .
Free public transport is something that can be pushed much harder now by using the argument that it would cut down oil consumption and CO - 2 emissions immediately , unlike waiting and paying a fortune for magic technologies to be invented and save us .
It is something that can be done right now .
While it makes a lot of sense , we all know that without the big push it will not be accepted , because in the present scheme only solutions that do n't challenge capitalism can be accepted or even considered .
We also have the age old concept of public libraries and many of these have extended this concept by providing free Internet access .
For the person who is technically oriented , these days many firms and corporations get rid of their old PCs that are more than about 4 or 5 years old because they are not powerful enough to run the latest bloated Microsoft software .
Refitting these PCs entirely with free software can give you a very useable PC that will allow you to email and surf the Internet .
These could then be made available to those who do n't have the finances to buy one .
As the saying goes teach a man to fish and you can feed him every day , although I guess that does not take on board the notion of depleting fish stocks .
Likewise the Internet and free software could play a role here by helping to setup websites and provide the details for people to self learn and share ideas on how to maintain and repair things from everyday things like bikes , washing machines and the vast range of DIY skills from plumbing , carpentry , building and electrical skills .
How many times have you tried to fix something but can't because you are either not skilled enough or do n't know what to do next ?
Currently the barricade of copyright prevents people from posting detailed diagrams and information about the workings of various machines .
If we could help open this up , it could provide the means to slowdown the consumerism and the throwaway attitude so prevalent .
It would also mean especially for those who perhaps can't afford a new bike or washing machine or whatever nor can afford to pay someone to fix it , that we provide them with the means to do it themselves .
We need wikiMechanic , wikiRepair , wikiDiY etc .
On the education front , the Internet and free software provide huge opportunities .
They are an effective means for creating self help , educational groups and resources and importantly provide a viable if not alternative , then certainly additional aid to the state education system which so often fails many .
Indeed if you read the writings of John Gatto 3 you will come to realize State education is not about producing intellectually stimulated people at all .
So as we can see the concept of free software easily and already has transferred over to the idea of providing knowledge ( and education ) for free .
As hinted earlier , this activity to some extent predates free software , but is obviously extremely effective with the Internet .
Into this field , coming directly from the free software domain , has been the creation of Wikipedia and all it 's variants as alluded to above .
Again while there are some valid criticisms of them , they would seem to be quite beneficial and most importantly useful and available to all .
Not only that they have taken participation by the public to a new level .
wikitravel.org is a good example of where most people could probably add something .
Not exactly politically revolutionary but yet another working example of how sharing , mass participation and making things free , benefits everyone .
Other wikipedia like possibilities are undertakings like the " California Coastlines " website which is an online catalogue of digital images of the entire coastline and has proved invaluable to environmentalists .
Similar projects could easily be initiated for other things that people value .
This might be a good time to photograph the view of and view from every mountain top in your area before wind turbines surely dominate the landscape .
Most importantly though with so many people with digital cameras , it gets them all involved and suddenly they will feel a greater sense of concern if that thing they photographed and put online for the world to see , is threatened .
And thats the key , to get people to actually do something , because after the first step , they are more like to do more and think about things a bit more .
Another concept worth discussing , is the annual CoastWatch survey that takes place in Europe every autumn to survey the coastlines and is carried out by ordinary members of the public ( walking along beaches ) using a standard form for reporting .
( It is not clear if it is still taking place , but did so through most of the 1990s ) .
It is relevant here because it involves the public in both science and environmental protection , monitoring and education in an active rather than passive way .
Apparently similar one off type of events have been done for counting particular species of butterflies and birds .
People might laugh at such things if they do n't interest them and they also might seem trivial , but the more of this type of activity , the more it will spread out into other areas and the result will be the beginnings of a society where regularly thousands and thousands of people work together for an overall good and not for any commercial benefit .
And these sort of things are ideally advertised and coordinated by the Internet and free software .
The rapid increase in access to broadband and availability of webcams makes this coordination amongst groups even easier .
In general if people get involved in something , anything , then the more likely they will with other things because those first steps often break down many barriers and frequently opens up new possibilities in their mind .
The Role of Access to Resources in the Real World and Virtual World Capitalists have always had huge resources at their disposal .
In general that is one of the main characteristics of power in that you control resources .
This is normally in the form of armies , industrial capacity or in this context computing power and storage .
Battles of all kind tend to be about who has the most resources and in the case of war your industrial capacity can be a good correlator of your chances of winning .
In our everyday physical world of the state we as individuals are hopelessly at a disadvantage because the resources at the State 's command are vastly greater than the individual .
Only through our own organisations can we gain any sort of chance of something remotely approaching an equal footing .
Hence it always has been and always will be in the state 's interest to co-opt and crush the movements and organisations of the people , the prime example because of its historical importance being the unions .
And as any activist knows it always tries to stop any type of movement growing from a small group of people , chiefly by preventing it from getting any decent media coverage and intimidating members in all sorts of shadowy ways away from mainstream public gaze , when those issues are of great importance .
It goes without saying that our greatest resource is our large numbers and that too has been addressed by measures to divide by ( socio- economic ) class and the careful maintenance of the manufacture of consent through the media to control our knowledge of our own situation and preventing us from acting on our predicament .

Thankfully in the software world it is not quite as bad .
We through peer to peer networks , sharing of computers can leverage large resources in terms of communications , computing power and storage .
One should not be totally naive though and remain unaware of how agencies like the NSA can hoover up and tap as much as that information as they wish .
Again though we probably outnumber them in the number of people now engaged in the free software movement and the creativity within it .
Creativity is not lacking in the non free software world , but it is more likely to be stifled and left untapped .
Overall though the state almost certainly still has the upper hand in this domain too .
And obviously most people involved in free software are not anarchists nor think of themselves as such , just to make that point clear .
Nevertheless this pleasant and perhaps temporary period where we have more equal access ( than normal ) and crucially control of resources means we can circumvent some of the chains put on us in the real world , namely our ability to organise and the means to breakout of the walled gardens of news and information and escape the framing of debates and shaping of public opinion .
But we must be ever vigilant because continually the capitalist system is trying to impose new rules to control the Internet and free software and each time an initiative is rejected , it relentlessly tries a new approach .
Conclusion
The free software movement has unwittingly presented the peoples of the world with an important tool to avail of , on the frontlines of democracy .
Many of those previously and currently engaged in the free software movement are unlikely to be fully aware of the consequences and benefits of their work and may still be living in the fantasy belief world of neo-liberalism , free markets , trickle down economics , endless growth , domination and mindless consumerism .
This is simply because many of the participants just do it ( - i.e. write code ) and are not in any formal way a member of anything in particular , or politically motivated .
Undoubtedly global capitalism has also fed off the free software movement and gained its own benefits , but on balance it would seem it has been positive to ordinary people too .

It is clear that most people like and want to be part of something constructive and it is inspiring projects and ideas about the future that are always more appealing than the often necessary dwelling on the negatives .
And this is something we need to tap into .
The next stage of development of the free software movement most likely will be just as important as the last , but it is incumbent on us all to get involved to some degree to protect the gains we have made and push it even further and help usher in the rapid cultural change needed to get society to make the necessary change to go down the path of sustainability and survive .

While champion Brock Lesnar has never been one to pull any punches – although Shane Carwin is hoping he will Saturday night when they collide at UFC 116 for the undisputed heavyweight crown – the brash wrestler was n’t interested in kicking a downed Fedor Emelianenko .
“ It was disappointing .
I hate to see a guy like that , ” Lesnar told The Jim Rome Show of Fedor ’s abrupt fall from grace .
“ Whether his legacy was more of a mystique than it was , he stood up and he was respectful and it was tough to see .
It reminded me of my first fight against Frank [ Mir ] when I got really anxious and fell right into the trap .
“ That ’s a tough pill to swallow .
That ’s a big pill to swallow and I definitely do not want to try to swallow that pill again . ”
When asked if it was possible to sympathize with the man most consider the planet ’s top 265 - pounder – despite his uncanny ability to dodge , duck , dip , dive and dodge the Octagon – the former WWE superstar claimed to be spearheading the “ 2 - 4 - 6 - 8 - Who - Do - We - Appreciate ” charge .
“ I feel bad for him , ” Lesnar candidly stated .
Although Lesnar witnessed Fabricio Werdum end Emelianenko ’s nearly decade - long winning streak in :69 OH MY GOD seconds , he believes his legacy is still intact because it happens to the best of them – including Lesnar .
“ No I do n’t .
I do n’t think any less of him , ” Lesnar said of the Russian .
“ We ’re human beings and we all make mistakes and it ’s whether or not we can get up and better ourselves .
That ’s what true champions are made of , I believe . ”
Emelianenko ’s resume still reads an unprecedented 31 - 2 .
He rattled - off 27 straight W’s the last time he lost a scrap .
Loss is a natural part of our everyday lives , and there are many different kinds of loss .
Loss of a job , loss of a friend who moves out of state , loss of a marriage through divorce or separation , loss of a child who goes away to school , loss of a sibling through marriage or moving away , loss of health or abilities through an accident , loss of a loved one or pet through death .
Many people find these situations traumatic because their lives are irrevocably affected by these events , yet they have little control over them or the emotions they generate .
The only thing that can be controlled is how one reacts to them .
In that , we do have a choice .
I am not speaking as a professional trained in grief counseling ; I am speaking as someone with much too much personal experience with loss .
I have lost eight friends and loved ones to death since 2002 – that averages out to one person a year for the past eight years .
Let ’s just say , this has not been a very fun decade for me .
As I have had the most experience with death , although I have experienced other losses over the years , this article will focus mainly on that aspect .
Please be aware , however , that the majority of these observations and insights may be applied to any kind of traumatic loss .
As the song goes ( quoted from the Bible , I presume ) , there is “ a time to be born … a time to die . ”
We all know that ’s true ; there ’s no use in debating that point .
How could a “ natural ” part of life feel so unnatural ?
Simply put , because death sucks .
Anyone who tells you to “ get over it ” has never experienced first - hand the death of a loved one , I will guarantee you that .
It ’s not something you can understand through reading brochures or text books , not even watching someone you love experience it first - hand will give you a clue as to how it feels when it happens to you .
The only way to truly understand someone else ’s grief is the one thing we all fear and want to avoid at all costs … having to live through it ourselves .
And we all will , at one time or another , because there is no escaping it .
The only way to avoid that particular pain is not to love anyone , ever .
If you have nothing to lose , then you ca n’t experience loss .
But , let ’s face it … who really wants to live that way ?
Nobody I know .
So , given its inevitability , how do we deal with this grief ?
What I have found is that no two people experience grief in the same way .
Even if you have experienced grief before , you may not experience it the same way the next time .
Although Dr. Elisabeth Kübler - Ross and David Kessler established five stages of loss in their book “ On Grief and Grieving : Finding the Meaning of Grief Through the Five Stages of Loss , ” I have found that people do n’t necessarily experience all of them …or if they do , not necessarily in sequential order .
They are :
1. Denial and Isolation
2. Anger
3. Bargaining – making bargains with God to take away the pain and / or loss
4. Depression
5. Acceptance
Personally , I have never bargained with God .
In fact , I resented him for taking away those who meant so much to me ( my apologies to any devout religious readers , but I considered myself a “ lapsed Catholic ” long before 2002 , as I disagree with many of the fundamental doctrines of the Roman Catholic religion in which I was raised ) .
With time , I have learned to get past my resentment .
I truly believe everything happens for a reason … I just have n’t yet figured out what those reasons are , or I just flat - out do n’t like them if I have .
I have been studying astrology and tarot card reading in the past year or two , which contend that the Universe leads us where we need to go in order to grow and develop into the people we were meant to be .
I have no fundamental problem with this theory … it makes sense in a “ big picture ” kind of way , especially if you believe in reincarnation ( the jury ’s still out on that for me , but I am leaning more toward yes these days ) .
What bothers me is that , in theory , people I love have had to die in order for me to learn some of these “ lessons . ”
That , frankly , ticks me off !
A true - life example of the Anger stage , no doubt . ;)
In my opinion , there are two courses to take in dealing with any of these stages ( this is where the choice comes in ) .
There are constructive ways of coping and destructive ways of coping .
Constructive ways of coping include any positive steps that help you get through the day .
For example , some people like to have mementos of their loved ones to hang onto and be surrounded by , while others can’t tolerate that and rid themselves of anything that reminds them of their loss .
Some people talk to their loved ones out loud ; visit their gravesites ; scream , cry , and throw things in frustration ; start foundations in the names of their loved ones to help research a cure for a particular disease ; donate to or volunteer for existing charitable organizations .
None of these responses is right or wrong …it ’s all a matter of personal choice , what makes you most comfortable , and what gets you out of bed every morning .
Destructive ways of coping are the ones to watch out for , as they will ultimately cause more suffering than that caused by the grief itself .
These include indulging in any vices that are unhealthy , either physically or emotionally .
Most notable among them are alcoholism , drug dependency , indiscriminate promiscuity , excessive gambling , binge eating , etc .
The most extreme of the destructive coping mechanisms is causing physical harm to oneself in desperation , such as cutting or attempting / committing suicide .
Unfortunately , the people exhibiting any of these disturbing coping mechanisms are usually too close to the situation to see what damage they are causing to themselves and others , leaving their friends and family members to deal with the fallout .
During my darkest days , I kept telling myself “ one step at a time . ”
That “ step ” may have been a day , an hour , or a few minutes .
It took nearly two years for me to start seeing the light at the end of the tunnel , only to experience another loss right around the time the fog was clearing .
C’est la vie .
As the saying goes , “ that which does not kill you makes you stronger . ”
I have proven myself over and over again as being stronger than I ever wanted to be .
And it does n’t matter if the loved one lost was old or much too young , suffering a long - term illness or taken by a dramatic twist of fate .
There is no “ good ” way to lose someone or something that is important to you .
Ever .
What I have learned is that I will never “ get over ” these losses , but I will “ get through ” them the best way I can and live on .
And my friends and loved ones will live on with me in my memory and my heart forever .
I am grateful to have had each and every one of them in my life for as long as I did .
Quinton " Rampage " Jackson file photo : Dave Mandel | Sherdog.com
All the back and forth regarding boxing ’s ills and MMA ’s emergence as the dominating combat sport can really be boiled down to one thing : boxers have autonomy .
Mixed martial artists do not .
And while that independence may be the best thing for the fighters , it ’s crushing to their industry .
Take Quinton Jackson , who has thrown repeated tantrums over the possibility of a fight with Lyoto Machida .
Machida is “ boring , ” Jackson said , and he did n’t want to follow up a lackluster performance against Rashad Evans with another deliberately - paced bout .
( Jackson may also perceive Machida as a poor match for his style , but you wo n’t catch him saying it . )
What happens ?
According to MMAJunkie and other outlets , Jackson will fight Machida in November .
So much for freedom of choice .
If Jackson were a boxer , he ’d happily arrange for a heavy bag with lungs in order to absolve himself of the Evans bout .
After a few “ warm - up ” fights , he ’d get serious again .
Actually , had Jackson been steering his own career , he probably would n’t have taken the Evans fight at all : a year - plus layoff would mean avoiding any real threats until he got his fight legs back under him .
The UFC ’s business model -- where brand is king and fighters go through the turnstile -- has done an incredible thing : it ’s taken the ego out of fighting .
There is no opportunity to emulate Floyd Mayweather , who enjoys manipulating his business and his fans like marionettes .
If you ’re offered a fight , you take it .
If you do n’t like it , you can sit and spin until you wise up .
It ’s how athletes wind up with 16 - 7 records .
There ’s no padding and every fight is against a killer .
This is the league approach : the AFC champions do n’t sit down to “ renegotiate ” a deal to meet the NFC in the Super Bowl .
They just do it .
Can you imagine a situation in which Brock Lesnar spends nearly two years hammering out a deal to fight Cain Velasquez ?
Or if Velasquez fought Lesnar only if he agreed to Olympic - style drug testing ?
In the context of MMA and the climate the UFC has provided , it would be absurd .
The sport has created an environment where everyone fights anyone , regardless of how protective they feel over their record or reputation .
The inmates do not run the asylum .
Ironically , this was boxing ’s MO sixty years ago : the good fights happened when audiences were ready for them .
Today , careers are n’t made so much as manipulated .
There ’s no organization with any level of authority over fighters , which is why Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao can get bogged down in levels of bureaucracy that smothers interest .
Will fans buy their next respective fights ?
Probably .
Will any of them prefer them over a Mayweather / Pacquiao showdown ?
Hardly .
This degree of control is not necessarily good for athletes , particularly when they feel pressure to fight hurt or take bouts outside their pay grade .
( It ’s safe to say Velasquez wo n’t make nearly as much for the Lesnar bout as Lesnar himself , a far cry from the constant arguing over even purse splits in boxing . )
Fighters have become cattle , their careers steered by forces with a primary interest in making money first and coddling second .
The UFC may not be a managerial entity , but it ’s effectively their role in booking fights : Jon Jones is being brought up slowly ; “ Rampage ” Jackson is thrown to the wolves .
The actual managers are left to negotiate sponsorship deals and fax contracts .
Say “ no ” to the UFC enough times and watch what happens .
It would be nice to champion fighters ’ rights and moan that promotions have too much power -- but the alternative is boxing ’s chaotic mess of a business .
These fighters fight .
Boxers talk .
And fans are n’t listening .
War is always an opportunity for someone , many someones , to make money .
A recently closed ebay auction sold a pair of Converse shoes manufactured and sold during World War II .
If I understand the description right , the shoes were sold to overseas servicemen who wanted to “ stomp ” on the Nazis ; alternatively , they were sold to Nazis ( I think the former ) .

Independent Affiliate Marketing Networks vs Large Affiliate Networks Posted on 06/07/2010
There are few widely - popular affiliate marketing networks you know and probably have accounts with .
Besides that , there are plenty of smaller new ( independent ) affiliate networks you always feel tempted to join and give a try .
So what is preferable ?
The most obvious answer is probably , try both and then stick to what you feel more comfortable with .
However you need to know what to expect before joining and checking out .
First , let 's compile the major differences in a table to compare easily :
Huge affiliate network Independent affiliate network Predictability versus Flexibility
You almost always know what to expect
You enjoy more flexibility and innovation Reliability versus Support ( Scam - free ) Higher - quality selection of programs Various forms of support Variety versus Special offers
You have a huge choice of affiliate programs
You are offered incentives to join Now , let 's discuss each point in detail : Predictability vs Flexibility
With dominant affiliate marketing reviews you almost always rest assured that you know what to expect ( be it a good or a bad thing ) .
If there 's bad ( or non-existent ) customer service or impossible - to - use interface , you know about that even before joining because everyone is criticizing that .
There are no nasty surprises that you discover after months of using ( like some hidden costs or non-working code ) .
In this case , the advantages of sticking to a huge affiliate program include : Years in business ( which means stability ) ;
Wealth of information online ( including affiliate marketing reviews and feedback ) ;
Publicity ( which means any good or bad news becomes public in a matter of hours ) .
However , reliable is often synonymous to stagnant .
Huge networks ( as a rule ) are too slow in terms of innovating therefore by trying new emerging affiliate networks you are able to : Keep up - to - date with new technologies , tracking and payment models , events and products ;
Adjust the system to your own needs ( new networks are usually seeking feedback and are eager to change to win new users ) .
Reliability vs Support
Huge networks usually have high fees for programs to join - which as a rule means that affiliate programs within the network are : More established ;
Higher - quality ;
More reliable .
Relying on an established network , you usually secure yourself from scam and fraud .
With newer affiliate networks you should be more careful .
But the good thing is that these networks are much more approachable ( which means you can test them before trying ) .
Give an independent network a try if :
You see affiliate managers representing it throughout affiliate forums and blogs ;
You see affiliate managers representing it on Twitter ;
You hear back from them once you try contacting them ( using any medium ) or by just Tweeting the question using the network name in the Tweet .
Choice vs Incentives
This is an evil circle : huge networks attract plenty of affiliates and thus any solid network can't afford not to join ; while affiliates agree to any terms and commissions because there 's a huge choice of programs within the network .
This is why it is obvious , with huge networks you enjoy the variety .
While ( in most cases ) the dominant network can give you a huge range of programs to choose from ( allowing to manage all of them from one dashboard ) , a new independent network is eager to win your heart and thus can offer : Incentives to join ( Beware though : do n't forget to always use your common sense :
If something seems to be too good to be true , it most likely is . )
New interesting offers and programs ( that get attracted by lower fees and newer technologies ) ;
Better terms and commissions ( Independent affiliate networks charge smaller fees from affiliate programs which allows the latter to offer better terms to the affiliates ) .
The conclusion is obvious : as an affiliate , you need to constantly watch out for new affiliate networks and check them out once you think they are worth a try .
The only thing to keep in mind is that you can't expect from an independent network what you had with a huge one ; there are other things to enjoy though .
Baboons are nasty , brutish , and short .
They have a long muzzle and sharp fangs designed to inflict deadly injury .
Their bodies are covered in thick , olive - colored fur , except on their buttocks , which are hairless .
The species is defined by its social habits :
The primates live in troops , or groupings of several dozen individuals .
These troops have a strict hierarchy , and each animal is assigned a specific rank .
While female rank is hereditary — a daughter inherits her mother ’s status — males compete for dominance .
These fights can be bloody , but the stakes are immense : A higher rank means more sex .
The losers , in contrast , face a bleak array of options — submission , exile , or death .
In 1978 , Robert Sapolsky was a recent college graduate with a degree in biological anthropology and a job in Kenya .
He had set off for a year of fieldwork by himself among baboons before he returned to the US for grad school and the drudgery of the lab .
At the time , Sapolsky ’s wilderness experience consisted of short backpacking trips in the Catskill Mountains ; he had lit a campfire exactly once .
Most of what he knew about African wildlife he ’d learned from stuffed specimens at the Museum of Natural History .
And yet here he was in Nairobi , speaking the wrong kind of Swahili and getting ripped off by everyone he met .
Eventually he made his way to the bush , a sprawling savanna filled with zebras and wildebeests and elephants .
“ I could n’t believe my eyes , ” Sapolsky remembers .
“ There was an animal behind every tree .
I was inside the diorama . ”
Sapolsky slowly introduced himself to a troop of baboons , letting them adjust to his presence .
After a few weeks , he began recognizing individual animals , giving them nicknames from the Old Testament .
It was a way of rebelling against his childhood Hebrew - school teachers , who rejected the blasphemy of Darwinian evolution .
“ I could n’t wait for the day that I could record in my notebook that Nebuchanezzar and Naomi were off screwing in the bushes , ” Sapolsky wrote in A Primate ’s Memoir .
“ It felt like a pleasing revenge . ”
Before long , Sapolsky ’s romantic vision of fieldwork collided with the dismal reality of living in the African bush .
His feet itched from a fungal infection , his skin was covered in bug bites , the Masai stole his stuff , he had terrible diarrhea , and he was desperately lonely .
Sapolsky ’s subjects gave him no glimpse of good fellowship .
They seemed to devote all of their leisure time — and baboon life is mostly leisure time — to mischief and malevolence .
“ One of the first things I discovered was that I did n’t like baboons very much , ” he says .
“ They ’re quite awful to one another , constantly scheming and backstabbing .
They ’re like chimps but without the self - control . ”
While Sapolsky was disturbed by the behavior of the baboons — this was nature , red in tooth and claw — he realized that their cruelty presented an opportunity to investigate the biological effects of social upheaval .
He noticed , for instance , that the males at the bottom of the hierarchy were thinner and more skittish .
“ They just did n’t look very healthy , ” Sapolsky says .
“ That ’s when I began thinking about how damn stressful it must be to have no status .
You never know when you ’re going to get beat up .
You never get laid .
You have to work a lot harder for food . ”
So Sapolsky set out to test the hypothesis that the stress involved in being at the bottom of the baboon hierarchy led to health problems .
At the time , stress was mostly ignored as a medical subject .
It was seen as an unpleasant mental state with few long - term consequences .
“ A couple of studies had linked stress to ulcers , but that was about it , ” he says .
“ It struck most doctors as extremely unlikely that your feelings could affect your health .
Viruses , sure .
Carcinogens , absolutely .
But stress ?
No way . ”
Sapolsky , however , was determined to get some data .
He was n’t yet thinking lofty thoughts about human beings or public health .
His transformation into one of the leading researchers on the science of stress would come later .
Instead , he was busy learning how to shoot baboons with anesthetic darts and then , while they were plunged into sleep , quickly measure their immune system function and the levels of stress hormones and cholesterol in their blood .
In the decades since , Sapolsky ’s speculation has become scientific fact .
Chronic stress , it turns out , is an extremely dangerous condition .
And not just for baboons :
People are as vulnerable to its effects as those low - ranking male apes .
While stress does n’t cause any single disease — in fact , the causal link between stress and ulcers has been largely disproved — it makes most diseases significantly worse .
The list of ailments connected to stress is staggeringly diverse and includes everything from the common cold and lower - back pain to Alzheimer ’s disease , major depressive disorder , and heart attack .
Stress hollows out our bones and atrophies our muscles .
It triggers adult - onset diabetes and is a leading cause of male impotence .
In fact , numerous studies of human longevity in developed countries have found that psychosocial factors such as stress are the single most important variable in determining the length of a life .
It ’s not that genes and risk factors like smoking do n’t matter .
It ’s that our levels of stress matter more .
Furthermore , the effects of chronic stress directly counteract improvements in medical care and public health .
Antibiotics , for instance , are far less effective when our immune system is suppressed by stress ; that fancy heart surgery will work only if the patient can learn to shed stress .
As Sapolsky notes , “ You can give a guy a drug - coated stent , but if you do n’t fix the stress problem , it wo n’t really matter .
For so many conditions , stress is the major long - term risk factor .
Everything else is a short - term fix . ”
Reduce Stress — With Science !
Make friends Social relationships are a powerful buffer against stress .
In fact , several studies in Europe and the US have found that people with fewer friends and family members they ’re close to have significantly shorter life expectancies .
( The magnitude of the effect is roughly equivalent to smoking cigarettes . )
One likely explanation for this phenomenon is the stress of loneliness .
Studies of monkeys found that more socially isolated animals have higher levels of stress hormones , a reduced immune response , and a higher mortality rate .
Get enough sleep Sleep deprivation is not just about feeling tired .
Recent studies have found that even a single night of insufficient sleep — whether it ’s spent working the night shift or playing World of Warcraft — triggers an automatic spike in stress hormones .
And here ’s where biology gets cruel :
This stress response then makes it harder to fall asleep when you actually want to , since your sympathetic nervous system is revving at a higher rate .
The result is more stress and more insomnia , which helps explain why sleep problems are such an important risk factor for depression .
Do n’t fight
While observing baboons , Stanford biologist Robert Sapolsky found there was a set of personality traits linked reliably with lower levels of stress hormones .
One of these was the ability to walk away from provocations that might send a normal baboon into a snarling hissy fit .
Interestingly , this less aggressive personality turned out to be exceedingly effective :
The nice baboons remained near the top of the troop hierarchy about three times longer than the baboons who were easily provoked into a fight .
They also had a lot more sex , which is a great stress reliever .
Meditate Numerous studies have demonstrated that even a short training session in meditation can dramatically reduce levels of stress and anxiety .
In fact , a recent study led by Sian Beilock , a psychologist at the University of Chicago , demonstrated that a 10 - minute lesson in mindfulness meditation seemed to reduce stress in those taking a high - stakes math exam , leading to a five - point increase on average .
She argues that meditation allows people to do a better job of not fixating on negative and stressful thoughts , thus freeing up brain space to focus on the arithmetic .
Confront your fears
When paratroopers are first learning to parachute , they experience a massive stress response .
In fact , one study of Norwegian airmen found that this response started before the jump and lasted for hours afterward .
But something interesting happened when the soldiers kept jumping out of planes .
Instead of being stressed for hours at a time , they showed elevated levels of stress hormone only while in midair , which is precisely when they needed it .
The chronic stress response that causes long - term harm had all but disappeared .
Drink in moderation Alcohol is an anxiolytic — it melts away anxieties by dampening the response of the sympathetic nervous system and reducing the release of stress hormones .
That ’s why a beer tastes so good after a long day .
But do n’t get carried away :
While the moderate consumption of alcohol might reduce the stress response , blood alcohol levels above 0.1 percent — most states consider 0.08 the legal limit for driving — trigger a large release of stress hormones .
Although you might feel drunkenly relaxed , your body is convinced it ’s in a state of mortal danger .
Do n’t force yourself to exercise
While exercise is remarkably effective at blunting the stress response , at least for a few hours , this effect exists only if you want to exercise in the first place .
After all , a big reason working out relieves stress is that it elevates your mood ; when mice are forced to run in the lab , their levels of stress hormones spike .
So when you force yourself to go to the gym and then suffer through 30 minutes on the treadmill ( lamenting the experience the entire time ) , you do n’t reduce your stress levels .
In fact , you might be making things worse .

The emergence of stress as a major risk factor is largely a testament to scientific progress :
The deadliest diseases of the 21st century are those in which damage accumulates steadily over time .
( Sapolsky refers to this as the “ luxury of slowly falling apart . ” )
Unfortunately , this is precisely the sort of damage that ’s exacerbated by emotional stress .
While modern medicine has made astonishing progress in treating the fleshy machine of the body , it is only beginning to grapple with those misfortunes of the mind that undo our treatments .
The power of this new view of stress — that our physical health is strongly linked to our emotional state — is that it connects a wide range of scientific observations , from the sociological to the molecular .
On one hand , stress can be described as a cultural condition , a byproduct of a society that leaves some people in a permanent state of unease .
But that feeling can also be measured in the blood and urine , quantified in terms of glucocorticoids and norepinephrine and adrenal hormones .
And now we can see , with scary precision , the devastating cascade unleashed by these chemicals .
The end result is that stress is finally being recognized as a critical risk factor , predicting an ever larger percentage of health outcomes .
To Sapolsky , the next step was obvious : Attack the condition head - on .
In 2003 , he proposed a vaccinelike treatment that protects people against stress .
It ’s a hugely ambitious attempt to combat a societal scourge at the level of our DNA .
Although years of work remain , Sapolsky now insists that , given the public health consequences , it ’s time to take the problem seriously , to move our treatments beyond talk therapy and Valium .
“ Sometimes it ’s not enough just to tell people , ‘ Jeez , you should really learn to relax , ' ” Sapolsky says .
“ If stress is half as bad for you as we currently think it is , then it ’s time to stop treating the side effects .
It ’s time to go after stress itself . ”
After that first trip in 1978 , Sapolsky began spending every summer in Kenya .
In the early 1980s , he happened upon a rare event in the baboon troop :
The highest - ranking female and a low - ranking female gave birth to daughters just a few days apart .
Sapolsky realized that these newcomers would allow him to compare the effects of social status on development .
The first thing he noticed was that the high - ranking daughter hit every developmental landmark faster .
She walked first , ate solid food earlier , and had far more interactions with other baboons .
The lesson , Sapolsky says , is that “ status comes with privileges , ” and these privileges are present from the start of life .
Sapolsky describes a poignant scene that took place a few weeks after the births , when the newborns encountered each other for the first time .
“ They can barely get around , but they ’re both so excited to see another baby , ” he says .
“ And so the low - ranking kid goes wobbling over to say hi .
But then , just as she gets near , the low - ranking mom grabs her daughter and drags her back .
The poor kid has no idea what ’s happened , but she ’s just gotten her first lesson in the social hierarchy .
The high - ranking kid is not somebody she can play with . ”
For Sapolsky , the tragedy of such interactions is their lasting legacy .
“ I can come back 25 years later , when these kids are two old matriarchs , and they ’ll be acting out the exact same dynamic .
When they meet , the low - ranking baboon will just stare at the ground .
That ’s what her mom was trying to teach her .
She was being taught how to live with low rank .
She was learning how to cope . ”
That coping comes with a steep cost .
Look , for instance , at a controlled lab experiment led by Jay Kaplan at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in North Carolina .
The study involved macaques , small primates that , like baboons , live in a rigid social hierarchy .
The scientists quickly discovered that macaques of high rank were less likely to develop heart disease , despite the fact that all of the animals were fed a diet high in saturated fat and cholesterol .
But the scientists did n’t stop there .
They also conducted experiments in which monkeys were put into a new enclosure , a move that forced the animals to struggle to maintain their status .
This led to increased heart rate and blood pressure .
( In fact , Kaplan saw a rise in arterial plaque even when the stressed monkeys were fed a low - fat diet . )
The effect was particularly pronounced for females .
Normally , male primates are twice as likely to suffer from heart disease .
This difference between the sexes disappears , however , when females lose their rank .
A similarly destructive process is at work in humans .
While doctors speculated for years that increasing rates of cardiovascular disease in women might be linked to the increasing number of females employed outside the home , that correlation turned out to be nonexistent .
Working women did n’t have more heart attacks .
There were , however , two glaring statistical exceptions to the rule : Women developed significantly more heart disease if they performed menial clerical work or when they had an unsupportive boss .
The work , in other words , was n’t the problem .
It was the subordination .
One of the most tragic aspects of the stress response is the way it gets hardwired at a young age — an early setback can permanently alter the way we deal with future stressors .
The biological logic of this system is impeccable :
If the world is a rough and scary place , then the brain assumes it should invest more in our stress machinery , which will make us extremely wary and alert .
There ’s also a positive feedback loop at work , so that chronic stress actually makes us more sensitive to the effects of stress .
The physiology underlying this response has been elegantly revealed in the laboratory .
When lab rats are stressed repeatedly , the amygdala — an almond - shaped nub in the center of the brain — enlarges dramatically .
( This swelling comes at the expense of the hippocampus , which is crucial for learning and memory and shrinks under severe stress . )
The main job of the amygdala is to perceive danger and help generate the stress response ; it ’s the brain area turned on by dark alleys and Hitchcock movies .
Unfortunately , a swollen amygdala means that we ’re more likely to notice potential threats in the first place , which means we spend more time in a state of anxiety .
( This helps explain why a more active amygdala is closely correlated with atherosclerosis . )
The end result is that we become more vulnerable to the very thing that ’s killing us .
This acute sensitivity , in turn , also makes us more vulnerable to stress - related diseases .
Consider a natural experiment that took place during World War II , when about 70,000 young Finnish children were evacuated to temporary foster homes in Sweden and Denmark .
For the kids who stayed behind in Finland , life was certainly filled with moments of acute stress — there were regular air bombardments .
But for those sent to Sweden , the stress of being separated from their parents was unceasing .
This early shock had lifelong consequences .
A 2009 study found that Finnish adults who had been sent away between 1939 and 1944 were nearly twice as likely to die from cardiovascular illness as those who had stayed at home .
Although more than 60 years had passed since the war , they were also significantly more likely to have high blood pressure , type 2 diabetes , and clinical depression .
Of course , you do n’t have to be shipped off to Sweden to experience stress ; it ’s a simple fact of life for everyone .
But emerging evidence suggests that the effects of chronic stress are worse for some people — especially those at the bottom of any given pecking order .
Just ask Michael Marmot , a professor of epidemiology and public health at University College London .
For the past 25 years , he ’s been running the Whitehall study , an exhaustive longitudinal survey launched in 1967 that has tracked some 28,000 British men and women working in central London .
What makes the Whitehall study so compelling is its uniformity .
Every subject is a British civil servant , a cog in the vast governmental bureaucracy .
They all have access to the same health care system , do n’t have to worry about getting laid off , and spend most of their workdays shuffling papers .
The British civil service comes with one other feature that makes it ideal for studying the health effects of stress :
It ’s hierarchical , with a precise classification scheme for ranking employees ( in other words , it ’s the human equivalent of a baboon troop ) .
At the bottom are messengers , porters , and security guards .
Just above them are the clerical officers , followed by staff scientists and other professionals .
This last group implements the policies dictated by powerful administrators who run the governmental agencies .
Marmot wanted to investigate how differences in status “ in people who are neither very poor nor very rich ” might lead to measurable differences in health .
The differences are dramatic .
After tracking thousands of civil servants for decades , Marmot was able to demonstrate that between the ages of 40 and 64 , workers at the bottom of the hierarchy had a mortality rate four times higher than that of people at the top .
Even after accounting for genetic risks and behaviors like smoking and binge drinking , civil servants at the bottom of the pecking order still had nearly double the mortality rate of those at the top .
What , then , determines our health ?
Why were people in the lower ranks of Whitehall dying at a younger age ?
Marmot was forced to conclude that the significant majority of health variation is caused by psychosocial factors , most notably stress .
People of lower status in the Whitehall study experienced more negative stress , and this stress was deadly .
( To take but one data point : Fully two - thirds of an individual ’s risk of stroke was attributable to the person ’s socioeconomic status . )
In fact , we ’re so sensitive to the effects of status that getting promoted from the lowest level in the British civil service reduced the probability of heart disease by up to 13 percentage points .
Climbing the social ladder makes us live longer .
However , the Whitehall results are n’t a straightforward analysis of stress , at least not as it ’s usually defined .
After all , people in leadership positions often describe their jobs as extremely stressful .
They work longer hours and have more responsibilities than those at the bottom of the bureaucratic hierarchy .
Consider the self - report of Nigel , a high - status administrator : “ There were 2,000 people , and I was responsible for all the personnel aspects , contracts , and all the common services …
It had every sort of challenge that you could ever wish to meet .
A very active job and a lot of stress , but a very enjoyable job , and you got a tremendous amount of satisfaction from doing a good job . ”
Notice the reference to stress ; undoubtedly Nigel thought of himself as a person under lots of pressure .
In contrast , here ’s the self - report of Marjorie , a lowly typist : “ I went to the typing pool and sat there typing documents .
Which was absolutely soul - destroying …
The fact that we could eat sweets and smoke was absolute heaven , but we were not allowed to talk . ”
The recurring theme in the self - reports of people like Marjorie is n’t the sheer amount of stress — it ’s the total absence of control .
Researchers call it the “ demand - control ” model of stress , in which the damage caused by chronic stress depends not just on the demands of the job but on the extent to which we can control our response to those demands .
“ The man or woman with all the emails , the city lawyer who works through the night has high demands , ” Marmot writes .
“ But if he or she has a high degree of control over work , it is less stressful and will have less impact on health . ”
( This helps explain why the women with mean bosses and menial work showed the highest incidence of heart disease . )
The Whitehall data backs up this model of workplace stress :
While a relentlessly intense job like a senior executive position leads to a slightly increased risk of heart disease and death , a job with no control is significantly more dangerous .
The same effect applies even to the rich and famous .
A few years ago , Donald Redelmeier , an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto , led a study of Academy Award - winning actors .
His hypothesis was that having an Oscar gave people more control over their stressful careers .
Instead of being forced to accept bad roles or work on mediocre movies just for the money , these stars could pick and choose their parts .
This creative control , in turn , would lead to improved health outcomes .
Redelmeier compared the award winners to two groups : ( 1 ) actors who had appeared in the same film as a nominated actor and did n’t get a nomination and ( 2 ) actors who had been nominated for an Academy Award but never won .
The results were clear : People with Oscars lived , on average , four years longer than their less - successful peers , which represented a 28 percent reduction in death rate .
As Redelmeier notes , this longevity boost is roughly equal to the effect that would come from “ curing all cancers in all people for all time . ”
The moral is that the most dangerous kinds of stress do n’t feel that stressful .
It ’s not the late night at the office that ’s going to kill us ; it ’s the feeling that nothing can be done .
The person most at risk for heart disease is n’t the high - powered executive anxious about their endless to - do list — it ’s the frustrated janitor stuck with existential despair .
Stress is a chemistry problem .
When people feel stressed , a tiny circuit in the base of their brain triggers the release of glucocorticoids , a family of stress hormones that puts the body in a heightened state of alert .
The molecules are named after their ability to rapidly increase levels of glucose in the blood , thus providing muscles with a burst of energy .
They also shut down all nonessential bodily processes , such as digestion and the immune response .
“ This is just the body being efficient , ” Sapolsky says .
“ When you ’re being chased by a lion , you do n’t want to waste resources on the small intestine .
You ’ll ovulate some other time .
You need every ounce of energy just to get away . ”
But glucocorticoids have a nasty side effect :
When they linger in the bloodstream , as they might due to chronic stress related to low rank , damage accumulates .
It ’s the physiological version of a government devoting too many resources to its defense department , Sapolsky says .
The body is so worried about war that it does n’t fix the roads or invest in schools .
Interestingly , the effects of stress appear particularly toxic to the brain .
Elizabeth Gould , a neuroscientist at Princeton , is best known for demonstrating that the birth of new neurons — a process known as neurogenesis — takes place in the adult brain .
For the past several years , Gould has been studying the relationship between neurogenesis and stress in primates .
She has found that when stress becomes chronic , neurons stop investing in themselves .
Neurogenesis slows .
Dendrites shrink .
Neuronal arbors retreat .
( In fact , the very act of keeping primates in standard lab enclosures — often just bare wire cages — is so stressful that for years scientists had a warped understanding of the primate brain .
Gould has become an ardent advocate of “ enriched enclosures , ” which provide the animals with things to play with and social interaction . )
These cellular alterations help explain why , as researchers noted in a recent review article , a “ large part of the changes in brain structure and function [ induced by chronic stress ] have similar characteristics to those observed in neurodegenerative diseases , most notably Alzheimer ’s . ”
And the higher the level of stress hormone , the greater the level of cognitive decline .
One of the most disturbing aspects of these stress effects is the way they ’re transmitted across generations , from parent to child .
Gould has demonstrated , for instance , that if a pregnant rhesus monkey is forced to endure stressful conditions , like being startled by a blaring horn , her offspring are born with reduced neurogenesis , even if they never actually experience stress after birth .
This prenatal trauma , just like trauma endured in infancy , has lifelong implications .
The offspring of monkeys stressed during pregnancy have smaller hippocampi , suffer from elevated levels of stress hormone and anxiety .
Or look at humans : A recent study found that individuals abused by their parents during early childhood showed epigenetic changes to their DNA , which altered how their genes were read .
The most prominent changes involved genes encoding glucocorticoid receptors , which led to a magnified stress response .
The abuse might be temporary , but the damage is permanent , a wound that never heals .
Not every bout of stress is so devastating .
As the Whitehall data demonstrates , executives in the corner office report high levels of stress and yet seem to survive just fine .
Other experiments show that intense exercise — like running for hours on a treadmill — can lead to the release of glucocorticoids .
And yet physical exercise is reliably associated with all sorts of positive health effects .
These anomalies have led some scientists , including Gould , to search for the additional molecules in the brain that might serve as buffers for the stress response .
Gould ’s short list of candidates focuses on neuromodulators like dopamine and oxytocin that are released when we experience pleasure .
She argues that these feelings of enjoyment — the ability to find meaning in our work , even if it ’s stressful work — may counteract the toxic effects of glucocorticoids .
These molecules might also explain why not every janitor dies of heart disease at a young age and why enjoyable forms of exercise are good for us .
“ There are important individual differences in how people respond to stress , ” Gould says .
“ Soldiers experience lots of stress in war , but most of them wo n’t get posttraumatic stress disorder .
What accounts for those differences ?
And how can we help the people who are most vulnerable ? ”
Robert Sapolsky looks out of place on the Stanford campus .
He ’s surrounded by manicured lawns and preppy students , but his appearance is deliberately untamed .
His long hair is tied back in a loose ponytail , and he ’s constantly tucking the stray tendrils behind his ears .
Sapolsky ’s face is hidden by a bushy beard , which extends below his neck in the style of late Darwin .
( It ’s as if Sapolsky stopped shaving after meeting the baboons and never started again . )
All that remains visible are his pale blue eyes and the sun-worn wrinkles that tell you he ’s smiling .
In recent years , it has gotten harder for him to study primates in the wild .
The main problem is the intrusion of humans .
“ The original beauty of studying stress in baboons was that they did n’t act like people , ” Sapolsky says .
“ The animals do n’t smoke , they do n’t lie on questionnaires , and they all eat the same basic diet . ”
Unfortunately , the increasing sprawl of human settlements means the baboons now supplement their natural menu of fruit , seeds , and small antelopes with human trash .
As a result , it has become all but impossible to disentangle the negative effects of stress from the negative effects of bad diet .
The difficulty of conducting field research has led Sapolsky to focus increasingly on his lab work .
The theme remains the same — he is single - minded about stress — but the tools are different .
Instead of tranquilizing baboons , he oversees a molecular - biology lab , its shelves and counters cluttered with fridges , notebooks , and salt solutions .
“ It kills me that I ca n’t spend more time in Africa , ” he says .
“ But you take what you can get .
And right now , the lab is what I ’ve got . ”
This does n’t mean Sapolsky has stopped thinking big thoughts .
In fact , his main research project is absurdly ambitious :
He wants to create a vaccinelike treatment for chronic stress , a genetic therapy that can prevent the struggles of life from wrecking brain and body .
He first started thinking about the possibility of such a treatment in 1992 , during the early days of gene therapy , when the field was flush with optimism .
At the time , his idea seemed simple :
If the chronic drip of glucocorticoids is so toxic , why ca n’t the chemicals be stopped before it ’s too late ?
That straightforward goal concealed a series of technical challenges .
The first was that Sapolsky could n’t just eliminate glucocorticoids from the bloodstream , because they are involved in all sorts of important functions , like helping you run for your life .
Second , Sapolsky needed to get his treatment past the blood - brain barrier — the specialized capillaries that prevent blood contaminants from entering the brain .
Sapolsky ’s vaccinelike cocktail needed to deliver a potent mixture of genes to the cortex — these genes would counteract the stress response — but the most common mechanisms of delivery , like free - floating strands of DNA called plasmids , were denied entry .
There were a few years of false starts , but Sapolsky and his postdocs continued to play around with the herpes simplex virus , which has been used as a viral vector in gene therapy research for two decades .
Herpes was a good candidate because it ’s able to slip easily into brain cells .
Sapolsky then set about deleting all the dangerous genes in the herpes virus , replacing each of them with an assortment of “ neuroprotective ” ones , which increase the production of growth factors , various antioxidants , and substances that mimic estrogen .
( Estrogen counters many of the deleterious effects of stress on the brain . )
As a result , brain cells infected by Sapolsky ’s version of herpes would be protected in case they were subjected to stress .
The question was how to get the engineered herpes to turn on at key moments , then turn off so the cells could resume normal function .
Fortunately , natural selection had already solved the biologist ’s technical problem .
“ Viruses are n’t dumb , ” he says .
“ They do n’t want to become active until we ’re really vulnerable and our immune response is suppressed . ”
How does the virus know we ’re stressed ?
To Sapolsky ’s pleasant surprise , the virus already had the necessary genetic machinery :
It automatically monitors the flux of glucocorticoids in the bloodstream .
It had evolved to start expressing its genes whenever its host felt overburdened by the world .
After several years of genetic engineering — it ’s not easy to substitute all the dangerous genes with their therapeutic replacements —
Sapolsky began introducing the modified herpes virus into rodent brains .
Then he induced a series of tragedies , such as a massive stroke or an extended seizure , which would trigger the release of glucocorticoids .
( Chronic stress is like a slow - motion stroke . )
Within minutes , the modified herpes virus began pumping out neuroprotective proteins , which limited the extent of cell death .
As a result , the damage was contained .
For instance , rats given the herpes treatment were able to stave off practically all cell loss , while control rats lost nearly 40 percent of neurons in a given region .
In the hippocampus , neuronal death was reduced substantially .
“ To be honest , I ’m still amazed that it works , ” he says .
“ It ’s not going to help anybody soon ” — the research is still years away from clinical trials — “ but we ’ve proved that it ’s possible .
We can reduce the neural damage caused by stress . ”
Sapolsky has now begun applying the same therapies to rodents experiencing chronic stress .
He has shown that by injecting the amygdala with a modified herpes virus , he can dramatically reduce the anxiety the animals suffer when they ’re placed in an open space , where they instinctively fear predators .
Furthermore , this gene therapy was able to prevent the expansion of neurons in the amygdala after repeated stressors .
The positive feedback loop of stress had been stopped .
The power of Sapolsky ’s stress vaccine is that it can rescue us from ourselves , at least in theory .
Like those baboons in the bush , we live in a stratified society that comes with real costs .
There is nothing hypothetical about these costs :
They make us depressed and give us back pain .
They shrink parts of the brain , clog the arteries , and weaken the immune system .
They shorten our already short lives .
The science of stress can illuminate the damage .
It can document the chemistry that unravels us from the inside .
One day , it might even give us options for preventing the damage , silencing the stress response at its source .
But these are mere band - aids , fancy fixes for what remains an inherently societal problem .
We tell our kids that life is n’t fair , but we fail to mention that the unfairness can be crippling , that many of us will die because of where we were born .
This is the cruel trick of stress :
If it were only a feeling , if there were only the despair of having no control or the anxiety of doing without , then stress would be bad enough .
But the feeling is just the trigger .
We are the loaded gun .
In today 's Wall Street Journal op - ed page , Karl Rove offers a " growth agenda " for Republicans .
See if this has a familiar ring :
A GOP growth agenda would keep intact the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts .
...
Laying out a positive agenda also requires GOP candidates to connect the dots between public policies and real - world consequences .
So Republicans must make a compelling case that allowing the tax cuts to expire will result in history 's largest tax increase — killing jobs , punishing hard work and enterprise , damaging growth , wounding small business , and postponing the moment government finally restrains spending .
They need to explain that raising taxes on dividends and on capital gains would lower economic growth for years to come .
Retirements would be less secure , capital more expensive for every enterprise from manufacturing to commercial real estate , and investment in American jobs and companies less attractive .
So the Republican growth agenda is to leave all the Bush administration 's policies in place .
My favorite twist in the argument is where Rove calls this a " positive agenda " and immediately segues to arguing about all the terrible things that will happen if we restore Clinton - era tax rates .
It worked so well under Bush , of course it 's the solution to our problems now !
( Also note that the Bush - era tax rates have not yet expired , so they 've literally been in effect throughout this entire crisis . )
Also in that op - ed , you can watch Rove try to grapple with Keynesian economic theory :
Last Thursday House Speaker Nancy Pelosi joined the president in his bad bet by offering up the economic gem that extension of unemployment benefits " creates jobs faster than almost any other initiative you can name . "
Really ?
Faster than , say , cutting personal income tax cuts or slashing the corporate tax rate ?
That 's Rove 's entire rebuttal : " Really ? "
He thinks it 's self - evidently absurd to claim that extending unemployment benefits would create jobs more quickly than cutting taxes for business or upper - income taxpayers .
In fact , the unemployed have a high propensity to consume marginal dollars -- they 've seen a huge loss of income and are trying desperately to pay their bills and maintain some level of consumption .
Businesses are sitting on enormous piles of cash .
The superiority of unemployment benefits as stimulus is economic conventional wisdom .

I ’ve got to remember to fix the banner to accurately reflect what days I ’m updating and to get my gallery stuff up this week .
I ’m too tired right now to think of anything else to say so I ’ll just say this .
Ricky Gervais does n't actually want to rule the world , or at least not all of it .
He just wants absolute total control over his small corner of it .
Although it 's not that small .
The Office is now a global phenomenon : it 's been sold to more than 80 countries and , after an American , Brazilian , French , German and Russian version , it 's about to be re-incarnated in Israel , complete with " an ultra- orthodox saleswoman " , " an embittered Russian accountant " and , in the main role , a Jewish David Brent , otherwise known as Avi Meshulam .
Then there 's his podcasts – basically the recorded ramblings of him and his long - time collaborator Stephen Merchant and his old producer at Xfm , Karl Pilkington – which have now been downloaded more than 200 m times .
And there 's the HBO animation of them which is currently being broadcast as The Ricky Gervais Show on Channel 4 .
And Gervais 's new TV show , Life 's Too Short , about the trials of a showbiz dwarf , the pilot for which is currently being shot .
And a forthcoming part in Larry David 's Curb Your Enthusiasm .
And the new film he 's writing with an as - yet - un - named collaborator .
" Who 's that ? " I ask .
And he pauses dramatically – I post - Google and discover it 's because this bit is news .
" Ben Stiller ? " he says , although it 's unclear what part of this is a question .
Or maybe he 's just checking I 've heard of him .
It 's not global domination , then , but not far off it .
And his control of it is almost total .
" I joke about it , but it is also true .
I am a bit of a control freak .
But I think in a good way .
I think when you 're doing anything creative , it is n't a democracy really .
There 's no room for democracy . "
It really is n't a joke this , although he does joke about it .
But it 's a serious matter , because it 's a strategy which has , put simply , worked .
Even as completely untried first - timers , he and Stephen Merchant somehow managed to persuade the BBC to let them do The Office entirely their own way , with their own choice of actors , their own script , their direction .
Even now that they are who they are , this still seems like an incredible feat .
" It is rare .
Unheard of , practically .
Certainly for a couple of nobodies off the street .
But I think that 's because we were low risk .
And we did our own pilot for a start , so we showed them we could do it .
And it was one set , unknowns , cost almost nothing , a hundred grand an episode , and we went out in the summer , the 9th of July .
I 'm not a nerd but it was 9 July 2001 , 9.30 pm .
On a Monday night . "
The day that changed your life ?
" It was .
And originally they put it at 9 pm against Big Brother .
I said : ' Do n't put it against Big Brother .
Big Brother is going to be huge .
People who work in offices watch Big Brother . '
So they moved it to 9.30 pm .
See , I was in charge then .
And I 've been bullying people ever since . "
He has .
Before the interview , I spend an afternoon reading the archive of his blog and this particular fact has been brought manifestly to light .
And if there 's one thing I learn above all about Ricky Gervais , it 's that he likes facts .
He 's a stickler for them , a fact nerd , a ferocious enemy of un -facts .
If someone fails to get a fact straight … well , let 's just say it 's not pretty .
Those poor people , I say .
I can't help but feel a pang for them .
" Why ? "
Everybody makes mistakes , I say .
" I think it 's fair enough .
If someone says something about me that 's not true .
I 've got the right to reply . "
And then some .
Gervais 's replies could strip metal .
" But you see I do n't care if someone likes my comedy .
If they think I 'm funny .
Or dislike my decisions .
My career choices .
I do n't care about that .
I do n't care whether people think I 'm smug and arrogant .
I do n't care .
You can have your own opinions .
But you can't have your own facts .
" People can say , ' I do n't find him funny , I 've never found him funny , everything 's he 's done I 've found awful .
I hate his fat face , I wish he would die .
Oh , and I saw him eating squirrel in The Ivy . '
And I 'd go , ' Whoah !
No , no , no .
You did n't .
That 's a fucking lie . ' "
( In fact , he is always in The Ivy , but he 's more of a chicken - and - mash type man . )
On the one hand , this is fair enough .
Who wants to have lies told about them ?
On the other , it seems remarkable that he can be bothered to get that worked up about it .
You would think that after all the Baftas , Emmys and Golden Globes , the fact that The Office has been loved by millions , feted by his comedy heroes , Larry David and Matt Groening , been followed by the equally brilliant Extras , and spawned films such as Ghost Town , The Invention of Lying and Cemetery Junction , having some hapless journalist misquoting what he ate for dinner would n't matter very much .
You would think that .
But you 'd be wrong .
His blog – on his website that receives more than 1 m hits a week – bears witness to years of perceived slights , anguished cries of injustice and apoplectic rants of fury against anyone who have might have dared suggest he ate something he did n't at The Ivy – the Case of the Wrongly Attributed Fruit Salad seems to go on for weeks – or that an audience had the temerity not to laugh at one of his jokes .
" But they did , " he says when I bring this up .
" They can say , ' It was awful and I hated it . '
But they can't say the audience hated it .
They can say , ' Tasteless jokes about rape and paedophilia , dah , dah dah . '
But they can't say , ' And judging by the audience they did n't like it either . '
Because the audience was laughing their heads off and cheering .
One is an opinion and one is a fact . "
In another time and another place , he could be a crusty old colonel who feels impelled to write to the Telegraph every time he finds yet another split infinitive .
He just wo n't let it go .
" Can you see the difference ?
Can you ?
They can say : ' I fucking hated every minute of it . '
What they can't say is : ' and the audience booed ' .
They did n't .
That 's a fact .
Do you see what I mean ?
They 're changing the fact to make it their opinion . "
It 's all very well , this little lesson in grammar and semantics .
But , of course , Gervais did n't politely point the critics to the error of their ways and then quietly step aside .
" Was it proportionate , " I ask , " to say that they are ' jealous lying cunts whose lives have n't turned out like they 'd hoped and they want everyone to be as unhappy as they are ? ' "
" Yeah .
Why would they lie ?
Why would they lie ?
Because they did n't like me .
But , why would they say , ' And no one likes him ? '
That 's not true .
I acknowledge that as many people do n't like me as like me .
But I do n't go round saying , ' No , everyone likes me . '
I know they do n't .
You 're allowed your opinion but I just think that 's unfair .
That 's really unfair .
You ca n't say that . "
Well , yes .
But is it really worth this ?
The ranting , the baroque swearing ?
He claims that his anger is partly " for comic effect " but it 's hard to believe it 's just that .
It really does seem to be about control .
The great joy of the podcasts , he tells me , is not just that they require almost no preparation ( " We just pick a subject really .
That 's about it . " ) but that it cuts out the middle man .
He does n't just own the means of production , he owns the means of distribution .
" There 's a whole new level of control .
Now , I 'm not just the creator and the writer and the producer and the director , I 'm the broadcaster .
And now it 's not got to be sold to America , it 's in America .
And now , I do n't have to do 6 pm till eight , or whatever .
Now I do them when I want and put it out and that 's it and they 've now had 205 m downloads .
That 's ridiculous .
That you can do that and get it out there . "
It 's when he's not in control that he gets twitchy .
When I arrive to interview him , he 's still in his general 's costume , but he 's the exact opposite of a military dictator bent on total warfare .
He 's laughing and joking with the photographer , the art director , the various assistants and make - up artists .
He 's chatty and affable and is gamely pulling whatever expression is required of him , and then a few more .
And then he 's back into his more usual uniform of black T - shirt , black trousers , and we trot off down the corridor to a tiny meeting room , and it 's only then , as I click my recorder on , that he stiffens up .
It 's not that he's not trying , he 's 100 % focused , he answers every question and sends his assistant away when he says the time is up , but it feels a bit like trying to coax a polecat out from under the sofa .
The Office gave him a great feeling of achievement , he says , as well as financial gain , and access to people .
" That all came from The Office .
But the cons are , no disrespect … "
Journalists ?
" Journalists .
Bad journalists .
It 's a noble profession .
There 's Woodward and Bernstein and then there 's people who hide in your bin … and unfortunately the small number of journalists like that have a bigger audience .
It 's strange .
And it 's getting worse .
Even just walking down the street is a… I mean I 've got better at it .
I feared it at first .
I was nearly phobic . "
I saw you once in the street , I say .
You were scurrying .
" Scurrying .
Yeah .
Howard Hughes .
I mean , it 's not bad .
And everyone 's polite .
It 's , ' All right , Ricky ? '
' All right , Ricky ?
Like the show .
Can I have a picture ? '
But there were so many things that came with it .
And I did n't want to be lumped in with all those other people who do nothing and become famous .
" I did not want to share the couch with someone who lives their life like an open wound .
And is on their third autobiography not written by them .
I want to be lumped in with Robert De Niro , who 's famous because of all that good shit he did . "
It 's statements like this that have made Ricky Gervais famous not just for all the " good shit " he did , the genius who dreamt up The Office , the stand - up who fills Wembley , but as the middle - aged comedian who started making over - inflated statements about his own importance .
" As many people hate what I do as love what I do , " he says more than once , and he 's not wrong .
The Ricky Gervais haters are legion and vocal and the petty war he wages against certain critics becomes more understandable when you read through the cuts .
" Has Ricky Gervais Stopped Being Funny ? " asked the Guardian .
His " post - PC shtick seemed tired , the trademark self - regard wearing thin " .
And earlier this year , Charles Spencer in the Daily Telegraph called him " bilious " " obnoxious " and " a braggart " who makes " playground barbs " with " smirking disingenuousness " .
It turns out that Ricky Gervais is not paranoid .
Certain people really are out to get him .
But , his biggest enemy , bigger than Charles Spencer or any of the other haters , is surely himself .
Although his logic on this matter is almost impenetrable .
Why do you think it is that you rub certain people up the wrong way ?
" Because I 'm not playing a popularity game .
If you are trying to be popular you 'll be anodyne .
You 'll try and please other people rather than yourself …
I think [ this perception of me ] probably started at award shows .
When I did n't want to go up there and do the ever - so - humble .
I hate that .
When people go , ' I do n't deserve this . '
That means , you think you do .
If you go up and go , ' Oh my God ! '
It 's like , so you 're taking this seriously ?
You 're taking the award seriously , are n't you ?
I went up there and said , ' Yeah , well done . '
Because I could n't bear to take it that seriously .
It 's just an award . "
One of the most frequent criticisms of Gervais is that he 's closer to the paranoid , megalomaniac , insecure , attention - seeking David Brent than he cares to acknowledge .
But I wonder if he 's more like a character from his film , The Invention of Lying , a world in which everyone must speak their mind all the time , even multinational corporations .
Pepsi is " For when they do n't have Coke . "
Motels are " A Cheap Place to Have Intercourse with a Near Stranger . "
When Gervais said that his comedy award did n't mean much when he 'd already got two Golden Globes and an Emmy , was he just telling the truth ?
" Yeah .
But I am flattered of course that someone 's honoured me .
I do n't want I to look like I think it 's beneath me . "
But it can look exactly like that , I say .
" But I would n't turn up if it was beneath me .
I would n't go .
If someone says , ' We want to honour you ' of course I 'd love to go , and if I can make it I will . "
Do you think you are arrogant ?
" No . I 'm not arrogant at all . "
So why do this act then that makes you come across as arrogant ?
" Because the being ever - so - humble is worse .
It 's just I… I do n't want to win anyone over . "
It 's like something that Andy Millman 's agent , Darren Lamb , might come up with on Extras .
You want to prove to the audience that you 're not desperate to win them over ?
Simple , just act like a big - headed egomaniac who they 'll all hate .
The most bizarre aspect of this , as Ricky Gervais is the very first to point out , is that he really does n't have anything to prove .
It was a long time coming – Gervais was 40 – but The Office proved everything .
Although it 's another Gervais conundrum why it did take him so long .
Born and brought up in Reading in a solidly working - class family – his father , Jerry , was a Canadian labourer and his mother , Eva , a dinner lady – he studied philosophy at UCL where he met his partner Jane Fallon , and then , after a stint on the dole , decided to become a pop star .
Gervais was a New Romantic singer in a band called Seona Dancing , and there 's footage on YouTube to prove it .
When , unaccountably , he failed to make it big , he became entertainment officer at his old student 's union and it was there he first encountered office life .
Meanwhile , his partner , Jane , had become a television producer .
Not just that , she had a huge hit with This Life .
That must have caused a bit of a pang , did n't it ?
" No .
Although , you know , I did n't want to sponge off someone .
I had to feel that I was working .
But I was .
By the time that happened I had a full - time job .
I had a long - term relationship , totally happy , nice job , happy , friends , happy . "
" You do n't think you 'd have hit 60 and gone , ' Oh I 'd wish I 'd done that … ' "
" Maybe .
But I was n't trying .
It 's weird that I just thought it'd all be all right . "
But why were n't you trying ?
Was it fear of failure ?
" Honest answer : I think it was laziness . "
But you 're so unlazy now .
" I'm a workaholic . "
So what happened ?
" I found something I really loved . "
The big turning point in his life was landing a job at Xfm as head of speech and then hiring Stephen Merchant .
Years later , he was offered a slot on The 11 O'Clock Show .
And then came The Office .
" I probably do have those nightmares .
What if I 'd said no to taking that job ?
I do feel privileged .
It 's kicked in more that I can do what I want so I should n't blow it . "
It 's the same impulse that has led him to embark on a recent health kick .
He 's become a slightly fanatical exerciser and has lost weight because , " I do n't want to blow it .
I do n't want to go , ' Oh fuck !
You idiot .
So now , everything 's great .
And you 're going to die at the age of 51 of a heart attack , you fat idiot . ' "
Not blowing it is part of it , perhaps , but he also admits he could only do stand - up after he became successful : he could n't bear the idea of being booed off the stage of a Peckham improv club .
And it 's this , and the faux arrogance , and the justifiable pride in his work , the desire to be in the same celebrity bandwidth as Robert De Niro not Victoria Beckham that makes him seem , well , there 's no other word for it , a bit prickly .
And that 's an opinion , Ricky , before you whip out your laptop and consult your profanisaurus .
Not a fact , just conjecture .
That all of Gervais 's opinions and views on life were formulated in the years of not making it .
And even though he now has the success , the glory , the large townhouse in Hampstead and the apartment in New York , there 's still a them - and - us quality to the way he views the world .
He can quite clearly see how his life might have taken another path .
Nobody who works as hard as he does now – he has n't taken a holiday in five years – is " lazy " .
And one of the themes that runs through so much of his work is the stultifying horror of being trapped in the wrong life .
Like Brent in The Office , or Freddie in Cemetery Junction , or Andy Millman in Extras – even when he has his success .
Especially when he has his success .
It 's why , perhaps , he takes such issue with journalistic inaccuracies , being imprisoned in a lie ; and also his real and unfaked discomfort with fame , that he 's literally trapped within his own body .
Andy Millman 's battles with the BBC comedy department were , he says , " A case of there but for the grace of God go I .
I think everything I do has a touch of that .
I worked in an office for seven years .
And I could still be there .
Brent was a little bit , there but for the grace of God go I .
And there are a lot of Brents out there .
There are loads of people who never get their chance .
Or are compromised or do n't bother or are too shy .
And there 's a load of people out there who 've made it with a lot less talent and a lot more luck .
You just have to make sure that you are firmly in the camp that whatever happens you did what you wanted . "
It 's his Big Thing , this .
After the primacy of facts .
" It 's not that I think that everything I do is definitively right , it 's that everything I do is the way I want it to be .
That 's all .
I 'm not even saying that other people could n't do it better .
But why would I let them ?
I always looked at it like buying an Airfix model and getting someone who 's better than you to make it .
Where 's the fun in that ?
I only want the fun .
" I like the process not the sitting back and watching it .
I have n't even watched The Office since it went out on TV .
It 's the creative process I enjoy .
Nothing gives me an adrenalin rush like the idea .
Nothing at all . "
It 's all part of Ricky Gervais 's world view .
And he 's tenacious about his beliefs : an ardent atheist , a fervent supporter of animal rights .
And , if I 'm still unconvinced about the efficacy of proving your humility by displays of outrageous arrogance then maybe this is my failing , because there 's certainly no doubting Gervais 's talent .
The podcasts might not be to everyone 's taste – they 're a bit like a Steve Wright Radio 1 " zoo " from the mid-80s – but The Office and Extras were truly brilliant , alive to both the absurdity and banality of office life , of celebrity and pseudo - celebrity and wannabe - celebrity .
Of work .
And life .
Our time is up .
As I 'm packing to go , Gervais says , " I hope I 've cleared up a few things . "
" Facts , " I say .
" It 's all in the facts . "
" Read the blog , " he says .
" I have read the blog . "
" No .
Read the blog to see what I think of this . "
Oh , great .
No , really , I can hardly wait .
Not least because he gave me a long explanation as to why it was not only acceptable but also hilarious to refer to Ian Hislop in one of his acts as " an ugly little pug - faced cunt " .
Excellent .
" Only joking , " he says .
Although it feels like the way a cat might " joke " with a mouse .

DETROIT ( Reuters ) - A Pontiac , Michigan , woman was charged with murder on Friday after chasing down and ramming another car in a fight over a man that started on Facebook , police said .
Torrie Lynn Emery , 23 , was charged with second - degree murder , assault and child abuse .
Emery had a dispute with Danielle Booth , 20 , that began with Facebook postings about a jailed man they both know , said Pontiac Police Sergeant Kevin Braddock .
On Thursday , Booth went to Pontiac police to report that Emery had threatened her at her home after the exchange on the Facebook social network , according to Braddock .
A few hours after that report , Emery spotted Booth at a McDonald ’s restaurant in Pontiac .
As they left the restaurant , Emery chased a car carrying Booth being driven by a friend , Ayesha Abernathy , 21 .
Emery , who was riding with her 3 - year - old daughter , rammed the car several times with her vehicle .
Abernathy ran a red light to get away from Emery , and hit a truck .
Abernathy was killed , and Booth was taken to the hospital , where was in critical condition , Braddock said .
Police witnessed the accident and arrested Emery a few blocks away .
Emery was being held without bail .
If convicted , she faces a possible life sentence .
Since man came to this third planet from the Sun , he has spent his existence exploring the frontiers around him .
He first ventured out of the caves onto different continents .
As he evolved , he ventured across the seas to discover new lands .
Now that the land frontiers have been explored , he turns his thirst for adventure to the ocean and to the universe .
There is a frontier that is closer and not so expensive to explore .
That frontier is ourselves .
Many of us cannot venture into space or into the ocean but we can still be discoverers .
Explore the possibilities within yourself .
They are infinite .
One of the arguments for mankind going to the moon is that if we can discover the origin of the moon , then we can better understand the origin of the Earth .
Where you came from and how you got here determines who you have become , but they do not tell you who you are .
So who are you ?
The scientific answer is that we are the human side of the animal kingdom .
Unlike the other members of the animal kingdom , human beings are concerned with the thoughts and actions of others .
Something else humans share is reason .
Reason is the ability to weigh and justify any actions we might take .
Our counterparts in the animal kingdom are motivated by survival not by reason .
I hear some saying that survival of mankind is the reason for our actions .
Animals do not destroy their habitat .
Animals do not waste their food .
They eat only what they need .
They take care and teach what we would call families and they feel a sense of loss .
Mankind justifies destroying its own kind by using survival as the reason .
If one ’s color , race or beliefs are different then what we consider normal , they are a threat to our survival as we are to theirs .
The hope is that when we explore ourselves , we will not limit our thoughts to color , race or belief .
I know it is a long reach .
For JoeBen Bevirt , the future of energy production is up in the clouds .
The inventor is currently putting the final touches to a series of large kites , which he says will be able to harvest the fast crosswinds found at high altitude .
His airborne wind turbines will take off and fly to around 2000 feet ( 600 m ) , where they will float , generating power that can be transferred to the ground via a tether .
" Global wind is a tremendous source of energy - carrying nearly 870 terrawatts in global tropospheric winds , " says Mr Bevirt of Joby Energy , which is developing the wind turbine technology .
" In comparison , the global demand is 17 terawatts .
Harnessing a tiny fraction will transform the way we power our civilization . "
Aiming high
The notion of tapping into high altitude winds was first posed in the 1970s , but was not technically possible .
However , recent advances in materials , computing resources and unmanned aerial vehicles have now made the idea viable .
As a result , a handful of companies are now exploring different designs to generate cheap renewable energy from the skies .
For example , Magenn Power 's Air Rotor System called ( MARS ) uses a helium filled blimp design , Sky WindPower is building flying electric generators and Kitegen is focused on creating power kites .
Joby Energy 's technology resembles a large multi-winged kite .
The autonomous structures are computer - controlled and can take off vertically before navigating to the desired altitude .
Flight is controlled by an advanced computer system and the harnessed electricity is sent down the tether to a substation where it is converted from DC to AC power which can then be routed to a power grid .
The technology 's inventors say the devices are portable and relatively inexpensive to build when compared to conventional wind turbines and can generate twice the amount of power .
" Operating at five times the height of a conventional turbine increases both wind speed and consistency resulting in more power , more often , " said Mr Bevirt .
And going even higher should , in theory , produce even more power .
" Going higher increases the velocity of wind that is available , " says Professor William Moomaw , director at the Center for International Environment and Resource Policy at Tufts University in Massachusetts .
" The higher speeds at the greater altitudes should produce significantly more electricity . "
The technology can potentially navigate to altitudes of 35,000 feet ( 10,600 m ) , but the company has had to restrict their flying altitudes to 2000 feet or less due to concerns expressed by the US Federal Aviation Administration .
Air safety
After testing more than 20 different prototypes , the company has settled on a 30 kW system , which it is using to evaluate the efficiency of the design .
If successful , it intends to pilot test a 100 kW prototype within the next year .
The firm 's goal is to create an initial line of systems with a power capacity of 300 kW which would be capable of generating enough energy to power around 150 homes .
Larger systems of 3MW or more could potentially power 1500 homes .
Image caption Firms such as Magenn are experimenting with other approaches
Eventually wind farms containing several airborne wind energy turbines could be constructed to deliver power consistently , the firm says .
However , there are several issues to be addressed .
" They need to demonstrate that the energy cost is not too great to negate the benefits , " said Professor Moomaw .
In addition , the firm must demonstrate reliable control systems and show that the entire system is safe .
" The tether wire , drooping diagonally to the ground , represents a larger ground area for which there is a hazard than that made by a normal turbine , " says Professor Mick Womersely , director of sustainability at Unity College , Maine .
Mr Bevirt says that the systems are engineered to be strong enough to operate in very strong winds and if the turbines ever encounter gale - force type winds , the system would land itself and be re-deployed when conditions improved .
" We 've also engineered our systems with multiple safety attributes .
If one motor fails , the system can continue operation because of its multiple - motor design , " says Mr Bevirt .
" If the tether is severed , the system can be landed safely , powered by onboard batteries .
" From an electrical hazard perspective , the power also automatically shuts down should the tether be severed leaving it non-energised when it touches ground "
The firm initially plans to deploy the technology in thinly populated areas with strong winds to road - test the technology thoroughly .
If successful , Mr Bevirt hopes to deploy his technology around the world .
" Our goal is to deploy airborne wind turbines globally to produce cheap , consistent , and abundant electricity for a prosperous planet . "
Esther Renee Adams was born on her grandmother ’s birthday , June 2 , and was named for her , though eventually , after “ Mamaw ” started calling her “ Nay Bug ” ( because she was scared of ladybugs ) , everyone else did , too .
No granddaughter loved her grandmother more .
Mamaw could take the smart out of a wasp sting and hold her own in bubble - gum - blowing contests .
She was always game to slice into the Fourth of July watermelon a few days early .
Mamaw died of emphysema in July 1990 , when Nay Bug was 7 .
“ Half of me died , too , ” she says .
Mamaw was laid out in her own home .
In the mountains of eastern Kentucky , such “ country wakes ” could last for days , as mourners emerged from the coal mines or drove out from the factories .
Sometimes so many people showed up , the parlor floor had to be reinforced .
Guests paid their respects to the dead , then went into another room for sandwiches , coffee and a long visit .
Not Nay Bug .
While people talked outside , “ you know where I was ? ” she asks .
“ Right there with my Mamaw .
I stayed up with her all night . ”
And when a man with a camera came and asked to take her picture , she said she wanted to lay a rose across her grandmother ’s chest .
“ He said , ‘ Sure , if it ’s what you want to do , ’ ” Nay Bug recalls .
Then he took the picture .
Home Funeral would become one of Shelby Lee Adams ’ best - known portraits of Appalachian life .
Adams would n’t see Nay Bug again for 18 years .
He found her in the summer of 2008 at the head of Beehive Hollow , up a winding road , living in a house without running water or electricity .
A coal - black teardrop was tattooed by the corner of her eye .
Adams began photographing her again .
For 36 years , Adams has spent his summers in several rural Kentucky counties , watching children grow up , families flourish or fall apart and green mountains crumble after years of coal mining .
Coal dust feels omnipresent in Adams ’ pictures , which he shoots almost exclusively in black - and - white .
His portraits of “ the mountain people , ” as he calls them , are intimate , direct and sometimes bleak .
Some critics — including those featured in The True Meaning of Pictures , a 2002 documentary film about Adams ’ work — say he exploits a region already saddled with stereotypes involving poverty and violence .
Adams says he ’s capturing a fading culture — home wakes , for instance , are now less common in the mountains — and the faces of old friends .
“ When [ critics ] are taken out of their middle - class comfort zone , they are confronted with another person ’s humanity , ” he says .
“ And they blame the photographer . ”
Adams , 59 , has roots in both the mountains and the middle class .
He lives in western Massachusetts but was born in Hazard , Kentucky , not far from where he takes his portraits .
He is distantly related to Hobart Ison , an Appalachian who in 1967 fatally shot a filmmaker on his land , but Adams ’ father was a super­visor for a natural gas company with contracts around the country , and his family often lived in cities , including New York and Miami .
When Adams returned to Kentucky for part of each year , he says , his father taught him to look down on the “ holler dwellers . ”
Then one summer an uncle , a country doctor , introduced him to some of the most isolated mountain families .
When Adams went back later , he says , he was mesmerized by their openness before his lens ; photographing them would become his life ’s work .
Today he knows how accents vary from hollow to hollow , who has a sulfurous well , who ’s expecting a baby .
The darkness he has sometimes seen in Appalachia only makes him want to look closer .
“ Within the shadows lie the depth and beauty of human beings , ” he says .
“ Until we understand our own darkness , we wo n’t understand our beauty . ”
His subjects appreciate his presents of canned hams and clothing at Christmastime and the occasional case of beer ; they are also eager to see his photographs .
“ Country people love pictures , ” Adams says .
Almost every house or trailer has some on display : church and prom portraits , sonograms and sometimes Adams ’ work .
But not everyone likes his images .
“ I guess I do n’t see the point of freezing yourself in time , ” says Christopher Holbrook , the baby in his mother ’s arms in Home Funeral and now a dimpled 20 - year - old in dusty jeans .
“ The past is supposed to be past . ”
Chris is the first person in his family to graduate from high school ; he has also taken courses in diesel mechanics at Hazard Community College .
He recently married and now works as a security guard .
No picture , he says , can tell him what his future holds .
Walter Holbrook , Chris ’ father and Mamaw ’s son , takes a different view .
Home Funeral is “ something I can show my kids and maybe later on they can save to show their kids what kind of family they had , ” he says .
“ Somebody said Shelby takes these pictures to make fun of people , ” Nay Bug says .
“ You know what I think ?
It ’s not to make them look bad .
It ’s the way you look at it .
He does n’t mean to make fun of the poor people .
He ’s showing how hard it is for us to live . ”
She had never seen Home Funeral until Adams visited last summer .
She stared at the photograph for a long time .
“ Now , Jamie , I want you to look at something , ” she told her former husband .
“ Just look right here . ”
A real teardrop slipped past the tattooed one near her eye .
“ That ’s me . ”

Ramadan
Mid-August marks the start of the holy month of Ramadan , when hundreds of millions of Muslims will fast from dawn to dusk ; for the faithful , that also means no daytime arguing , cursing , or sex .
But it ’s not all about pious asceticism .
Ramadan is a world - moving force in its own right — an unpredictable time of rampant consumerism , surprising conflict , and political skulduggery .
1. RAMADAN IS BIG BUSINESS .
Although not quite the global consumer behemoth that is Christmas , Ramadan comes in a respectable second .
Yes , productivity in the Muslim world plummets during the fast , and government business grinds to a halt .
But malls in Istanbul are thronged , and it ’s one of the busiest times of year for luxury - car dealers in Riyadh .
Fast - food chains offer nighttime Ramadan “ meal deals , ” and Egyptians purchase nearly twice as much food as normal .
With captive audiences at home for iftar , the nightly breaking of the fast , TV programmers roll out the year ’s biggest shows : 25 to 30 percent of Arab TV ad revenue comes during Ramadan .
Even Australia feels the economic bounce :
In the lead - up to Ramadan , exports of sheep ( a holiday indulgence ) spike up to 77 percent .
2. AFTER OIL , RAMADAN IS SAUDI ARABIA ’S BIGGEST EXPORT .
Until the 1970s , the strict observance of Ramadan remained a voluntary affair across much of the Muslim world , an expression of cultural solidarity as much as personal piety .
Then came the oil shock of 1973 .
Petrodollars flowed into Persian Gulf coffers , gilding the desert kingdoms , which supported conservative Islamic clerics and built mosques and seminaries around the world .
Guest workers brought home strict attitudes about women , education , and religious practices to the remote mountains of northern Pakistan and the flood plains of Bangladesh .
Today , in Aceh , Indonesia , failure to observe Ramadan is punishable by flogging ; in 2009 , Egypt ’s Interior Ministry began enforcing edicts that made daytime eating during the holy month a misdemeanor offense .
3. RAMADAN IS A TIME OF PEACE , BUT IT’S ALSO MARKED BY WAR .
Religious contemplation has not always been synonymous with pacifism .
The Prophet Mohammed waged the Battle of Badr , the very first Muslim war against Meccan “ infidels , ” during Ramadan in 624 .
The 1973 conflict that Israelis call the Yom Kippur War is known to Egyptians , Jordanians , and Syrians — who launched their surprise attack while fasting — as the Ramadan War .
More recently , in Iraq , the month of Ramadan has seen dramatic upticks in sectarian violence and attacks on U.S. troops , reaching a high of more than 1,400 incidents in 2007 .
But Ramadan has also complicated military maneuvers : During the battle of Tora Bora , some of the Afghan fighters closing in on Osama bin Laden insisted on going home at dusk to break the fast .
4. GLOBALIZATION HAS CHANGED RAMADAN .
For the roughly 45 million Muslims now living in the West , strict religious observance can be a lonely affair .
Work does not slow for Ramadan , and those fasting must go through the day with co-workers eating and drinking all around .
Online guides have sprung up to offer advice on how to manage the resulting feelings of isolation , and influential clerics have made special allowances for Muslims living outside the Middle East .
Rulings dating back to the 1970s , for instance , allow Muslims living above 64 degrees latitude ( where the sun never sets in the summer months ) to start and end the day ’s fast when it occurs in Mecca or the next major city to the south with a regular sunrise and sunset .
5. RAMADAN IS A TYRANT’S BEST FRIEND .
Secular dictators have long used the holiday to shore up their sagging religious legitimacy .
Turkmenbashi , the late neo-Stalinist ruler of Turkmenistan , pardoned 8,145 prisoners during Ramadan in 2005 ; autocrats from Damascus to Algiers have followed the same playbook .
Saddam Hussein , who cynically tried to style himself an Islamist during his regime ’s latter years , twice made Ramadan cease - fire offers to Tehran during the Iran - Iraq War .
And in 2008 , when U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice visited Libya during Ramadan , Muammar al - Qaddafi refused to shake her hand , citing Muslim strictures against touching women while fasting — all the while surrounded by his cohort of amazonian female bodyguards .
It highlighted , once again , how the Islamic holy month has always been a mix of the sacred and the profane .

There are many ways around buying and installing a traditional whiteboard , but even something like whiteboard paint requires a real commitment of time and space .
Whitey Board is a stick - on whiteboard you can apply anywhere you need to write , starting at $ 10 .

Whitey Board was started by startup founder Jason Wilk , after he discovered how much whiteboards cost at an office supply store .
Determined to give small startups an alternative , he came upon the idea of stick - on whiteboards .
You can order them in three sizes , starting at 12 by 18 inches for $ 10 and ranging up to four by six feet for $ 30 , and they can be cut to fit whatever size and shape needs you have .
Helpful stuff for those with great ideas , but not $ 300 and an afternoon to spend buying and installing the sketch space for them .

Users of the microblogging service complain at apparent censorship as discussion grows around deaths on convoy - but it is n't justified ( updated )
The attack by Israel on a flotilla of ships approaching Gaza has , as you 'd expect , generated a huge response on social media - and of course Twitter , with its real - time content , was quick to react .
Many users began the morning by tagging their comments about it with " # flotilla " - a " hashtag " which gives a structure to a discussion or emerging event , as you can filter searches in applications such as Tweetdeck so that you only see those with that tag .
But at around 11 am , as # flotilla began " trending " - rising to the topmost - used hashtags on the service - it seemed to vanish .
Was this censorship by Twitter ?
Quite a few asked the question .
Certainly if you went to the standard URL for such a search - http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23flotilla
- you briefly got a result saying " Twitter error " .
However if you used the advanced search , you get the results as you 'd expect .
What also happened was that people started using a new hashtag : # freedomflotilla .
That rapidly trended .
The error in # flotilla search results quickly fixed itself , though .
Possibly the rapid rise in the hashtag 's visibility tripped an anti-spam filter at Twitter headquarters ( where it was 3 am in the morning , so we might assume that it 's the machines , rather than the people , who are on duty - though then again , knowing the nocturnal habits of programmers , perhaps not ) .
Update : Mike Butcher at Techcrunch points out that this surely was a case of anti-spam filtering : there had already been a " flotilla " story in the past week - the anniversary of Dunkirk ( for non-Britons : a dramatic rescue during the second world war of British and French troops from the Dunkirk beaches by small craft ) .
And Gaza is frequently topical .
( Thanks @vensa in the comments . )
So Twitter 's anti-spam algorithms - that is , the machines - likely decided that this was a spam attack trying to piggyback on old hashtags , and pushed the " #flotilla " hashtag out of the trending topics .
Is it censorship if it 's done by machines that think it 's spam ?
Given that " # freedomflotilla " instead rapidly trended , clearly there 's no human censorship against the story of the attack being made visible to other Twitter users .
That 's why Trendsmap , which is independent of Twitter and from which the screenshot is taken , looks as it does : it reflects what 's on Twitter .
Update 2 : : Sean Garrett , who handles communications for Twitter , tweeted this morning to say that " We are investigating a technical issue that caused search errors for a short period of time this morning .
Twitter facilitates the open exchange of info & opinions -- when that is hampered by a bug , we take it very seriously . "
The bug has now been fixed , Twitter says .
So : shock as Twitter not being used to censor news .
But it does show the enormous sensitivity there now is about Twitter 's impartiality that any suggestion that a world event might be pushed out of its " trending topics " ( displayed on the right - hand column of every Twitter user 's home page ) can create such frustration .
It does n't , of course , help anyone on the convoy that was attacked .
But getting information into public hands is a public good .
Twitter is coming closer and closer to being viewed as a utility - certainly by those who use it .
Perhaps we'd all feel more comfortable if it had a business model that had real , declared profits - because ( to answer @ Strummer ) that would mean you could be confident of unmediated messages from everywhere in the world .

The Fourth of July celebrates the Declaration of Independence of the American colonies of Great Britain , on the grounds that they deserved representative government and popular sovereignty – something denied to them by the British crown .
Iraq was occupied by American troops in 2003 after an illegal invasion , and it is still so occupied .
The viceroy appointed by George W. Bush , Paul Bremer , had no legal charter from the US Congress and represented no one , having never been elected to anything .
He wrote dozens of laws for the Iraqis by fiat .
They are still technically the law of the land in Iraq .
He used Iraq ’s oil revenue , billions of dollars worth , to run his interim government , even though no Iraqi voted to give it to him for that purpose .
In subsequent years the US intervened heavy - handedly in Iraqi political affairs and still does so today .
Few complaints of the Founding Fathers against Britain could not be lodged against the United States by Iraq .
All through spring of 2009 , US officers in Iraq heavily lobbied the new president , Barack Obama , not to honor the Status of Forces Agreement that George W. Bush had negotiated with the Iraqi parliament during his last months in office .
It called for troop reductions .
The officers opposed them .
It called for US forces to cease actively patrolling major Iraqi cities on June 30 , 2009 .
the officers said that step was foolhardy , and would make it impossible to keep up their collection of intelligence on urban guerrillas .
It called for rapid US troop reductions .
The officers argued that Iraq would fall back into instability .
Obama stuck to his guns , and the US soldiers stopped patrolling the cities independently on June 30 , 2009 .
In July of that year , the number of attacks by guerrillas and the number of civilians killed both fell by one third .
It appears that the patrols were causing violence , not stopping it , since the guerrillas attacked the patrols and ended up killing civilians .
The troop withdrawal also proceeded apace throughout the past year .
Although Iraq remains in a low - intensity civil war , the monthly death toll of civilians and security forces averages 300- 400 now , compared to 2500 a month in summer of 2006 .
At the height of the troop escalation or surge there were around 170,000 US troops in Iraq .
Today there are about 88,000 and the number is rapidly falling .
Everything the naysayers in the Pentagon alleged about the effect of implementing the SOFA was wrong .
Now unnamed sources in Iraq are leaking again to the New York Times .
They want to insist that the timetable for troop withdrawal in the SOFA is unrealistic .
They cannot imagine that US troops will really leave by the end of 2011 .
They are sure that the SOFA will be renegotiated by the new Iraqi government whenever it is finally formed .
While the SOFA could be tinkered with , there are powerful forces working against that outcome .
The Sadrists , fundamentalist Shiites who follow cleric Muqtada al - Sadr , may well be kingmakers of the new government , and they are dead set against any change to the SOFA timetables .
The Sadrists are highly politically networked and their relative success in the March 7 parliamentary elections attests to their political strength even today .
They could prove spoilers of any attempt by the US to drag its feet on withdrawal , since they can put thousands of protesters and hundreds of guerrillas in the street .
Nor is the threat only of renewed political unrest among Sadrists if the US stays in force .
Al - Hayat reported on May 24 , “ The local government in Basra announced yesterday its commitment to the security agreement signed by Iraq and the United States for scheduling the US forces ’ withdrawal .
The announcement came in reply to statements by Al - Sadr Trend in the governorate about preparing its armed wing “ Al - Mahdi Army ” to resume the resistance activity against the remaining forces in the governorate and to wait for orders to do this from Trend Leader Muqtada al - Sadr . ”
It is true that the 50,000 or so troops that will be left in Iraq as of September may not all be ‘ non - combat ’ units , since there will be some rebranding .
And it is true that Iraq will need the US air force for years to come , for logistics purposes .
But to say that the timetable will be tinkered with at the request of the Iraqi parliament in any major way is wishful thinking .
The US commanders were expecting to be asked by the Iraqi officers to go on joint patrols in the major cities .
They got few invitations , even though they had trained many of the Iraqi officers who now gave them the cold shoulder .
The new Iraqi military is perfectly capable of patrolling on its own now in cities such as Baghdad , and of facing down any ordinary threat from militias .
The US is not needed for routine security patrols .
While the Iraqi troops have not been able to establish order in Mosul or in Diyala Province , the prospect of the dwindling number of US troops doing so is slim to none .
Iraq is just going to be a little unstable for a few years , and even if US troops stayed in numbers past the deadlines , it is highly unlikely that they could miraculously lend the place stability .
Bush knocked Iraq off balance , and it will likely remain off balance for a good long time .
Bush was not authorized by the Iraqi people to destroy the country .
He was acting more like his namesake , King George III , than like a president who won an election .
Moreover , as the US military has increasingly focused on Afghanistan , many will realize that they just do n’t have the resources to continue in Iraq .
Iraqi factions are finding it hard to form a government in the wake of the March 7 parliamentary elections .
But they have a perfectly good interim government , that of incumbent Nuri al - Maliki , in the meantime .
And it took Lebanon 5 months to form a government recently .
The Lebanon case is instructive because the national unity government that came out of months of wrangling is fairly representative and seems to have forestalled further trouble of the sort we saw in May 2008 .
Vice President Biden may or may not succeed in helping the factions make progress during his visit to Baghdad this weekend , but contrary to what some American politicians say , there is no reason the process of government - formation cannot be protracted .
Consensus is better in Iraqi politics than up - and - down - votes that cause some faction to lose and to lose face .
For the pragmatic reason that the US cannot afford Iraq , and because it is the right thing to do , the Obama administration should withdraw in a systematic and deliberate manner from Iraq .
We owe its people their independence .
It is what we used , at least , to stand for .

Scientology battles with Twitter
Last year , a British local government councilor John Dixon , from Cardiff , Wales , was wandering the streets of London in search of a wedding ring when he happened upon a group of Scientologists .
Surprised , he tweeted the following : “ I did n’t know the Scientologists had a church on Tottenham Court Road .
Just hurried past in case the stupid rubs off . ”
A pretty harmless sentiment you might think , but unfortunately members of an organization that the French and German governments consider to be a cult complained to the public services ombudsman for Wales , claiming that Dixon ’s statement “ impinged on their right to religious freedom . ”
Councilor Dixon now faces a disciplinary hearing in spite of the fact that Scientology is not recognized as a religion by the British government .
This is a group which , in 1984 , a high court judge described as “ corrupt , sinister and dangerous ” .
He said “ It is sinister because it indulges in infamous practices both to its adherents who do not toe the line unquestioningly and to those outside who criticize or oppose it . ”
The attempt to stifle criticism has provoked an outrage which has spread rapidly across the internet , with thousands of Twitter users , led by the likes of prominent Brits Evan Harris , Professor Brian Cox , Tim Minchin and David Mitchell , coming out in strong support of the beleaguered councilor .
Mitchell summed up the feelings of many when he commented : “ The Church of Scientology say calling them stupid impinged on the right to religious freedom .
How ?
Are their convictions so feeble ? ”
The naked truth has to be a resounding yes .
Neither Tom Cruise or John Travolta would return MMAs calls for a comment .
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) -
An Iranian military court sentenced two people to death on Wednesday for the murder of three protesters taken into custody after last June ’s contested presidential election , the official IRNA news agency reported .
IRNA said the jailed protesters had died as a result “ intentional assault and battery , ” but gave no further details of the circumstances of their deaths and did not identify the people convicted of killing them .
The protesters who died in custody have been considered martyrs by the opposition .
Authorities had initially said they died of meningitis , but a coroner said they died as a result of beatings .
If those sentenced for the killings are police or prison guards it would be the first time such officials have been convicted for abusing post-election protesters .
A further nine people were ordered to pay fines and blood money and receive lashes for the abuse of prisoners at the Kahrizak detention centre , south of Tehran .
One person was cleared .
The convictions are subject to appeal .
Thousands of people were arrested after the re-election of hard - line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Most have been freed , though dozens , including former senior officials , have been jailed for up to 16 years and at least two have been hanged .
Scores of people have filed complaints of their mistreatment at Kahrizak and police confirmed in August that serious violations had taken place there .
The government , which faced down widespread street unrest after the election , accused foreign enemies of fomenting “ sedition . ”
It is likely to hold up Wednesday ’s convictions as evidence it does not tolerate human rights abuse .
Amnesty International has said Iran uses torture , politically - motivated executions and the imprisonment of journalists , students , activists and clerics to stifle dissent .
A parliamentary report in January said more than 145 detainees were kept for several days in a room of 70 square metres at Kahrizak , which was closed in July on the orders of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
In a separate case , state TV reported that 33 people had been referred to court in connection with attacks on a Tehran University dormitory and a residential apartment complex during the post-election unrest .
Opposition activists said four students -- three men and one woman -- were killed during the violence which they said was carried out by Islamic militia and police .
The university chancellor denied anyone was killed .
Calibrating your CH4
Methane sensor is pretty easy .
Time to get your multimeter out and sniff some farts .
Your sensor comes in the mail in two pieces ; 1 ) the sensor and 2 ) the Parallax breakout board .
The sensor puts out resistive data so it can be plugged into the breakout board either way .
But if you 're the type who likes to read it for yourself , here 's the data sheet ( read under , " Connecting and Testing , " and , " Calibrating " ) ;
http://www.parallax.com/Portals/0/Downloads/docs/prod/sens/27930-1-2-GasSensor-v2.1.pdf
Work to do on your sketch :
Download my CH4calibration sketch linked below .
Pretty much all it does is make Arduino pin7 your HSW pin , make it an output and set it to low ( which turns on your sensor 's heater ) .
Work to do on your Breadboard :
Plug your Methane sensor into your breadboard :
ALR is your Alarm and will be left alone while we calibrate your sensor
HSW is the heater of your gas sensor , connect it to Arduino pin7
+ 5 v is power in , connect it to Arduino 5V
GND is ground , connect it to Arduino Gnd
Calibrate :
Get yourself to a clean - air environment ( fart free ) , upload the sketch to your Arduino and set an egg timer for 10 minutes .
You need to let the heater warm up and the sensor " settle " before you begin calibrating .
When you come back in ten minutes you should have a warm - to - the - touch sensor .
Set your multimeter up to read DC voltage and hold the test terminals to test points 3 and 4 ( labeled TP3 and TP4 on the left edge of your breakout board ) .
You 're hoping to read 0.80 Volts .
If you 're too low , turn the potentiometer labeled " TRIP LEVEL " counter - clockwise until you get as close to 0.80 Volts as possible .
Once you 've got your TRIP LEVEL calibrated to 0.80 Volts it 's time to read the voltage across test points 1 and 2 .
Again , we 're looking for something around 0.80 Volts .
Adjust the potentiometer labeled " SET POINT " up to about 0.80 Volts until the red LED ( located at the top , left of the breakout board just under the silk screened " CH4 " label ) lights up .
This LED lights up when the voltage from your Set Point is greater than the voltage from your Trip Level .
If this LED is lit then it 's ALR pin will be sending a signal HIGH , which we will later attach to Arduino Pin2 because that 's the input pin we 're using as our trigger .
Now turn your Set Point potentiometer clockwise until the red LED just turns off .
OK , so now you have a calibrated CH4 Methane sensor with the red LED off .
Look over your shoulder to make sure you 're still the only person in the room and ... fart on your Arduino .
Wait for it ...
WAIT FOR IT ... and the red LED turned on !
Hurray , you 've done it , your CH4 Methane sensor is calibrated !
If the LED did n't turn on then we 've got troubleshooting to do .
Troubleshooting :
If your red LED did n't turn on it's because the voltage from your Set Point did n't go higher than the voltage from your Trip Level .
Check the voltage across test points 3 and 4 .
If you 're at 0.80 Volts we 're OK .
Check the voltage across test points 1 and 2 .
You 'll show something less than 0.80 Volts ... there 's your problem .
Get yourself into a clear - air environment and turn the Set Point potentiometer counter - clockwise until you 're just under 0.80 Volts .
Fart on the sensor and you should see the red LED light up .
Still no red LED ?
We 've got one last way to fix that .
If you 're still not getting enough voltage from your Set Point , then we 'll have to lower the voltage from your Trip Level .
I 'd like to take a moment to tell you , that while this will work , it 'll also make your sensor more sensitive so you 'll have to increase the debounce delay at the end of the void_loop in the final sketch .
To decrease the voltage across your Trip Level , turn your Trip Level potentiometer clockwise until your red LED turns on in a clean - air environment .
Then turn it counter - clockwise until the red LED just turns off .
** If you can't muster a fart or two , the data sheet recommends using Propane as a Methane substitute **
SCOTUS lifts partial ban on GM alfalfa in Monsanto v Geertson Seed , Condemns District Court for taking middle course instead of extreme action 
By Rady Ananda
22 June , 2010
Countercurrents.org
On June 21 , the US Supreme Court released its long awaited decision on the first case involving genetically modified crops , allowing the USDA to impose a partial deregulation , should it so choose .
This would permit the sale of Monsanto 's Roundup Ready alfalfa ( RRA ) .
However , i n its 7 - 1 ruling , the court also upheld the lower decision to ban complete deregulation .
SCOTUS found that t he  District Court abused its discretion when banning a partial deregulation and in prohibiting the planting of RRA pending completion of a detailed environmental review ,  known as an Environmental Impact Statement ( EIS ) .
The decision flies in the face of the facts in this case , and subjects us to further contamination of our food supply .
Monsanto expressed glee :
 We have Roundup Ready alfalfa seed ready to deliver and await USDA guidance on its release .
Our goal is to have everything in place for growers to plant in fall 2010 . "
Adversarial party Center for Food Safety also expressed delight in the decision , calling it a  Victory for Center for Food Safety , Farmers .
In its release , CFS asserts :
 The Justices ' decision today means that the selling and planting of Roundup Ready Alfalfa is illegal .
The ban on the crop will remain in place until a full and adequate EIS is prepared by USDA and they officially deregulate the crop .
This is a year or more away according to the agency , and even then , a deregulation move may be subject to further litigation if the agency 's analysis is not adequate . 
CFS is happy because , as the Court pointed out ,  we do know that the vacatur of APHIS 's deregulation decision means that virtually no RRA can be grown or sold until such time as a new deregulation decision is in place , and we also know that any party aggrieved by a hypothetical future deregulation decision will have ample opportunity to challenge it , and to seek appropriate preliminary relief , if and when such a decision is made . 
While CFS may be happy to fight this case again , food freedom suffered a blow by this decision .
An Extremist Court
Dissenting Justice John Paul Stevens clarifies the convoluted decision :
 In this case , the agency [ U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service , known as APHIS ] had attempted to deregulate RRA without an EIS in spite of ample evidence of potential environmental harms .
And when the court made clear that the agency had violated NEPA [ National Environmental Policy Act ] , the agency responded by seeking to  streamline ' the process submitting a deregulation proposal with Monsanto that suffered from some of the same legal and empirical holes as its initial plan to deregulate . 
APHIS had offered the lower court a partial deregulation plan , which was rejected .
That is the portion of the District Court decision that SCOTUS deemed was beyond its authority to impose .
The High Court condemned the lower court for choosing a middle course of action , instead of taking more extreme actions on either end .
It found the lower court 's ban on future plantings inconsistent with its allowance of current planting :
 The order enjoining any partial deregulation was also inconsistent with other aspects of the very same judgment .
In fashioning its remedy for the NEPA violation , the District Court steered a  middle course ' between more extreme options on either end .
On the one hand , the District Court rejected APHIS 's proposal to allow continued planting and harvesting of RRA subject to the agency 's proposed limitations .
On the other hand , the District Court did not bar continued planting of RRA as a regulated article under permit from APHIS and it expressly allowed farmers to harvest and sell RRA planted before March 30 , 2007 .
Justice Stevens , however , applauds the  middle road ' taken by the District Court .
In defending the lower court 's two - part decision , Justice Stevens pointed out that courts must weigh the diverse equities before it :
 At the outset , it is important to observe that when a district court is faced with an unlawful agency action , a set of parties who have relied on that action , and a prayer for relief to avoid irreparable harm , the court is operating under its powers of equity .
In such a case , a court 's function is to do equity and to mould each decree to the necessities of the particular case . '
 Flexibility and practicality are the touchstones of these remedial determinations , as the public interest , private needs , and competing private claims must all be weighed .
 Exercising its equitable discretion to balance the interests of the parties and the public , the District Court would have been well within its rights to find that NEPA requires an EIS yet also to find that a partial stay of the vacatur was appropriate to protect the interests of those farmers who had already acted in good - faith reliance on APHIS .

Geertson Seed Decision Abrogates Food Freedom
No one denies that gene transfer did occur ; that GM crops contaminate natural ones .
Instead , l ike Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan did when defending Monsanto in this case ( as Solicitor General ) , SCOTUS simply ignored this most important fact when deciding to allow partial deregulation .
SCOTUS also ignored that APHIS is unable to monitor for contamination .
GE alfalfa is planted in 48 states , and , while under the purview of APHIS , contamination of natural fields occurred .
The lower court was realistic when determining  that APHIS lacks monitoring capacity . 
Allowing for the spread of GM crops removes the public 's right to not choose GMOs , because the natural supply no longer exists , or becomes nearly impossible to find or afford .
We saw this when Bayer 's GM rice contaminated a third of the US supply .
And already today :
95 % of all US beets are genetically modified ( Greenwire ) ;
91 % of all US soybeans ( USDA ) ;
71 % of US cotton ( USDA ) ;
A nd over two - thirds ( 68 % ) of all US corn ( USDA ) .
Today , GMO derivatives are found in more than 70 % of the foods in the supermarket ,  reports activist and author Jeffrey M. Smith , which includes virtually 100 % of our processed food .
There are a number of other problems with GM crops , which the Supreme Court ignores , even when presented with some of these issues .
First and foremost , GMOs are created to tolerate or produce pesticide .
North America is losing its natural pollinators , specifically bees , butterflies and bats , because of the enormous tonnage of chemicals sprayed in this nation .
If we lose our bees , said Einstein , humans will last about six years .
We need our pollinators .
The entire web of life depends on them .
Those pesticide chemicals have poisoned all of our waters , damaging the biota , or making seafood toxic for humans .
Chemical companies like Monsanto , Dow , Bayer , etc. created GMOs so they could sell chemicals .
Those chemicals are bad for the environment and for humans .
Another side effect of our toxic spraying is we now have super bugs and super weeds .
The overuse of pesticides has allowed those plants that are pesticide resistant to thrive .
Resistant pigweed , for example , is destroying cotton farming in the Southeast US .
These biotech companies ignore the science of evolution when pushing their dangerous product on us .
We are now suffering for their scientific ignorance .
Weed resistance was considered in Geertson Seed , but SCOTUS dismissed that relevancy because  Respondents in this case do not represent a class , so they could not seek to enjoin such an order on the ground that it might cause harm to other parties . 
Second , GM crops contaminate natural crops by cross breeding with them .
Thus , GMOs are destroying biodiversity .
The Irish potato famine happened because every Irish family grew them - monoculture is a disaster waiting to happen .
When the blight hit , there was no natural way to stop it .
Phytophthora infestans spread like wildfire because its food source was everywhere .
When you destroy biodiversity , you invite total destruction from widespread infestation .
This is basic natural science .
GM crops increase the threat to food safety , food security .
SCOTUS ignored the facts , and science , when lifting the ban on partial deregulation .
Third , GM food is dangerous to animals , including humans .
We evolved with the bugs and the natural food that exists on this planet .
We did not evolve with these new GM creations of the past fourteen years .
When studying evolution , the significance of this statement becomes profound .
Evolution takes hundreds or thousands of years ( or longer ) .
Instead , those who eat GM foods might as well be eating food from a different planet .
They did not evolve with that food and the consequences can be generational as well as immediately toxic to the eater ( organ damage , sterility , diabetes and obesity , etc . )
Biotechnology may have its uses , but not in the food supply .
The Supreme Court 's ruling abrogates our right to GM free food by paving the way for further contamination .

Our series on Job suggests that no one can decide for anyone else the question of whether God is good .
This cuts both ways
I would not have thought , when we started this page , that we could run to a 500 comment thread on theodicy ; few British newspapers imagine their readership is that passionate about the Bible .
One thing does seem to me to distinguish this one from other theological arguments .
This is that the answer must always be personal , and may legitimately differ between people .
If we take the particular question , " Can the goodness and justice of God be reconciled with what has happened to me ? " there really is no one who can answer that satisfactorily except the questioner .
This is why we reject Job 's comforters .
" When we are lashed , they kiss the rod , obedient to the will of God " as Swift said .
They have no right to tell anyone else that their suffering is tolerable .
But by the same token , it can't be right to claim to anyone else that their suffering ought to be intolerable .
A friend of mine , a Christian , suffers great anguish because her daughter is a junkie .
Yet it would be a wicked impertinence of me to claim that this ought to make her realise that her faith is an illusion , and God does not exist .
This is n't just because her beliefs are a comfort to her ; as a matter of fact I 'm not sure that they are .
It 's because I can't judge whether they are in fact false .
She is the only person who can know whether her pain is in fact unendurable .
When I was a young man I was very much offended by what seemed to me the immoral stupidity of a relative who lost her faith after giving birth to a handicapped child .
She was n't , she said , going to believe in a God who could allow such things to happen to her .
I was not angry that she had lost her faith , but because it had taken her so long .
Had she not noticed that God allows much worse things to happen to other people ?
What made it different if it happened to her ?
But while my position was logically correct I no longer think that it was true to the way that religious belief actually works .
No attempt to construct a rational calculus of suffering can succeed .
It 's not as if even God can do so : he certainly does n't in the Book of Job .
But that really is n't the point .
The question is n't whether we ought to reconcile ourselves to the horrors of the world , but whether in fact we can .
And the answer only comes in individual sizes .
You may hand back your own ticket , but you can't hand back anyone else's .

Opta agreed to let the UK Guardian Data Blog publish 2010 World Cup Team and Player statistics .
The data is available in a Google Docs spreadsheet .
There are two tabs on this spreadsheet – one is PLAYERS the other is TEAM statistics .
I chose File -> Download
As -> CSV and downloaded the files through a web browser , then moved them to my working R directory .
I named the first World Cup 2010 data.csv ( Player Data ) and the second World Cup 2010 TEAM data.csv ( Team Data ) .
By the way , if anyone knows how individual Google Docs spreadsheets can be downloaded as CSVs via URLs , please let me know by commenting on this post .
I could not figure out how to do this straight from R by reading a URL ( which is my preference ) .
The following are a few charts that can be created with the data .
You might also want to do more sophisticated predictive analysis , by I will leave that to Paul .
The sheet with player data can be read in as a CSV
DF=read.csv(‘ World Cup 2010 data.csv ’)
The following attributes are available for each player .
names ( DF )
Player .
Surname
Team
Position
Time .
Played
Total .
Shots .
Attempted
Total .
Passes
Tackles .
Attempted
Saves .
Made
The base graphics package can be used to produce the following chart of the USA team ’s shots attempted by player .
# Create a smaller data frame that
# contains only USA player names
# and shots attempted .
PS=DF [DF$Team==’USA ’, c(‘ Player .
Surname ’ , ’Total .
Shots .
Attempted ’ ) ]
# Make the player Names the rownames
rownames ( PS ) =PS [ , 1 ]
PS=PS [ - 1 ]
# Flip the X axis labels and provide enough room in the margins to print the names
par( las=2 , mar=c ( 8 , 4 , 1 , 2 ) + 0.1 )
# Pivot the table , print the barplot and add a title
barplot ( t ( PS ) )
title ( ‘ 2010 World Cup USA Total Shots Attempted ’)
Now an example with the Team data .
In this case , the column names are actually the names of the countries .
DF2=read.csv(‘ World Cup 2010 TEAM data.csv ’)
names ( DF2 )
The attributes about each team are available in the first column .
DF2[1 ]
Games Played
Goals
Ave Goals per game
Shots ( excl blocked shots )
% Shots on Target
% Goals to Shots
Overall Pass Completion %
Cross Completion %
Goals Conceded
Ave goals conceded per game
Tackles Won %
Fouls
Yellow Cards
Red Cards
I prefer these attributes as row names – so moved them there using the following :
rownames ( DF2 ) =DF2 [ ,1 ]
DF2=DF2 [ ,-1 ]
This time , we will use qqplot and create a horizontal barchart that includes a gradient that increases to highlight the countries with the most fouls .
I think you will agree – qqplot produces much better results .
The author of the ( Hadley Wickham ) just released a new version of this package .
He also has written a book on it which goes into greater depth about its use and design ( based upon Leland Wilkison ’s Grammar of Graphics ) .
The example that follows uses the simpler qplot call , the team names as the x axis , and the number of fouls as the y axis .
The “ Geometry ” specified indicates that we are using a bar chart , and we specify coord_flip to switch the x and y axis .
library ( qqplot2 )
FOULS=t ( DF2 ) [ , c( ‘ Fouls ’ ) ]
qplot( names ( FOULS ) , as.numeric ( FOULS ) , geom = ” bar ” , stat= ’identity ’ , fill =Fouls ) + xlab ( ‘ Country ’ ) + ylab (‘ Fouls ’ ) + coord_flip( ) + scale_fill_continuous ( low=” black ” , high= ” red ” ) + labs ( fill=’ Fouls ’)
When t was used to pivot the data .
frame , it changed it to a matrix and the type of the numeric values became character .
The as.numeric function was used to cast it back .
The following is the same type of plot for Goals .
This chart also includes a title .
It appears at the top of this post .
GOALS=t ( DF2 ) [ , c( ‘ Goals ’ ) ]
qplot( names ( GOALS ) , as.numeric( GOALS ) , geom = ” bar ” , stat= ’identity ’ , fill=as.numeric( GOALS ) ) + xlab ( ‘ Country ’ ) + ylab ( ‘ Goals ’ ) + coord_flip( ) + scale_fill_continuous( low=” yellow ” , high = ” blue ” ) + labs ( fill=’ Goals ’) + opts ( title = “ 2010 World Cup Goals ( as of 07/10/2010 ) ” )
Hope you enjoyed this little excursion .
After an uproar from conservative bloggers and free - speech activists , the Transportation Security Administration late Tuesday rescinded a new policy that would have prevented employees from accessing websites with “ controversial opinions ” on TSA computers at work .
The ban on “ controversial opinion ” sites , issued late last week , was included as part of a more general TSA Internet - usage policy blocking employee access to gambling and chat sites , as well as sites that dealt with extreme violence or criminal activity .
But the policy itself became controversial as the Drudge Report and a number of conservative bloggers highlighted the possibility that the policy could be used to censor websites critical of the agency or of the Obama administration in general .
The American Civil Liberties Union also questioned the language .
TSA spokeswoman Lauren Gaches said the agency ’s revised “ acceptable use ” policy for Internet access on the agency ’s network was designed to block sites “ that promote destructive behavior to one ’s self or others . ”
“ After further review , TSA determined the ‘ controversial opinion ’ category may contain some sites that do not violate TSA ’s policy and therefore has concluded that the category is no longer being considered for implementation , ” she said in an e-mail to The Washington Times .
Before abandoning the guideline , agency officials said the policy changes were intended to address “ evolving cyberthreats , ” but did not explain exactly what was meant by “ controversial opinions ” and whether Internet sites with conservative or other politically oriented viewpoints would be targeted under the new guidelines .
The changes were first reported over the weekend by CBS News , which obtained an internal memo sent to agency staffers .
The memo was the lead item on the widely read Drudge Report site .
The agency ’s Office of Information Technology informed TSA staffers of the change Friday via e-mail .
The notice listed five categories of sites that were “ inappropriate for government access ” chat / messaging ; criminal activity ; gaming ; extreme violence ; and those that feature controversial opinions .
The inclusion of the “ controversial opinion ” category immediately raised eyebrows .
“ There ’s always a danger that threats are used to justify over - broad restrictions on speech and other freedoms , ” said Jay Stanley , an American Civil Liberties Union privacy expert , before the TSA announced it was dropping the idea .
“ But it ’s disturbing to see the TSA get the balance all wrong on that . ”
A number of conservative bloggers suggested the TSA policy change was an attempt by the Obama administration to target opposing viewpoints or criticism .
“ We have known for years that the government has talked about the possibility of censoring the Internet to thwart opinion , but this is the biggest it has ever gotten , ” said a posting Tuesday on the “ Conservative for Change ” blog site .
“ When will we be able to get back to when people actually had the freedom to make sound decisions for themselves and not have some government tell them how it should be ? ”
The TSA episode was not the first time the Department of Homeland Security , which oversees the agency , has gotten into hot water with conservative critics .
Conservatives objected strongly to an April 2009 directive by the department that warned law enforcement officials about a possible increase in “ rightwing extremist activity . ”
The details of the warning were first reported in The Washington Times .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano later apologized to veterans for the report , which stated the increased risks were posed in part by a few disgruntled veterans who could swell the ranks of racist militia groups .

BEIJING
– Who 's to blame for the current global financial crisis ?
According to a bestselling book in China , which is leading the sales charts in the country , the answer is clear : The Jews .
Worrying Data Survey : 31 % of Europeans blame economic crisis on Jews Ynet Anti-Defamation League poll conducted in seven European countries shows almost half of Europeans believe Jews more loyal to Israel than countries they live in , 40 % say Jews have too much power Survey : 31 % of Europeans blame economic crisis on Jews
Until recently , the notion that Jews and money were inseparable carried no anti-Semitic undertone in the country , but a relatively new book called " Currency Wars " threatens to change all that .
The book 's author , Song Hongbing , claims that behind world - changing events like the battle of Waterloo , Adolf Hitler 's rise to power , President Kennedy 's assassination , and the deep recession in Asia during the 1990s stood an intricate conspiracy aimed at increasing Jews ' wealth and influence .
Song , a Chinese computer engineer and history buff who resides in the United States , writes that almost every defining historical moment has been instigated by Jewish bankers , and mainly the Rothschild family , which Song says dominates the global banking system , including the US Federal Reserve System .
' important publication ' or ' nonsense ' ?
Song 's book was published in China about a year and - a - half ago , and initially sold an insignificant number of copies .
But in recent months the global crisis has turned the book into a hit .
Estimates put sales of " Currency War " well over a million , not including hundreds of thousands of illegal copies that can also be downloaded off the net .
Responses among readers vary ; online discussions about the book reveal that many are convinced this is the most important publication ever written , as it " exposes the truth behind global economy . "
However , others claim that this is " nonsense " and say that Song , who has never studied economics , simply pieced together a theory made up of several delusional conspiracy theories published on the internet .
Song 's publishers , a subsidiary of a state - owned publishing house , boast the fact that the book has been read by all leading financial executives in the country , as well as state leaders .
Song himself has become a local celebrity in China , and is often invited to lecture at financial conventions and is interviewed on TV as a famous financial analyst .
If you ’ve ever watched Jimmy Kimmel Live [ JKL ] , it probably did n’t occur to you that the Brooklyn - born comedian / talk show host would one day become a target of anti-choicers .
But he has .
If you ’ve ever watched Jimmy Kimmel Live [ JKL ] , it probably did n’t occur to you that the Brooklyn - born comedian / talk show host would one day become a target of anti-choicers .
But he has .
Kimmel first aroused anti-choice ire back in January when he created a parody of a Focus on the Family ad that aired during the Super Bowl .
As you ’ll recall , the FotF spot featured football great Tim Tebow and his mother discussing how happy they were that mother Pam “ chose life ” rather than aborting the pregnancy that turned out to be the Heisman trophy - winning athlete .
In Kimmel ’s hilarious Americans for Choice send - up , an unemployed 35 - year - old slacker lives in his parent ’s basement .
The tag line :
They do n’t all turn out like Tim Tebow .
Immediately after the spoof was posted , the antis issued a flurry of anti-Kimmel rants .
Then , like all things Super Bowl , the world moved on and even the most determined anti-choicers seemed to forget about the performer .
That is , until late June when more than 100 protesters — members and supporters of a 12 - year - old group called Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust — turned up in front of Grauman ’s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood , which just happens to be across the street from the JKL studios .
The protest outside Grauman ’s was the culmination of the Survivor ’s annual 12 - day “ boot camp for pro-life training ” [ cost : $ 475 per person ] led by anti-choice heavy weights Troy Newman of Operation Rescue , Rev. Pat Mahoney of the Christian Defense Coalition , Brandi Swindell of Generation Life , and Joe Slovenic , a long - time activist whose involvement in the movement goes back to 1993 ’s Impact Team , described by Time Magazine as “ the nation ’s first formally - trained class of abortion protesters . ”

According to the Survivor ’s website , the group — intended to mobilize Christian teens and young adults “ to rescue the next generation ” — believes in “ education and action ” and opposes not only abortion but also the pill , IUD , Norplant , and “ other abortifacients . ”
The protest outside Grauman ’s took an ugly turn when a freelance camera crew hired by JKL showed up on a highly - trafficked corner adjacent to the anti-choice picket line to film a sketch for the show .
A video posted on YouTube reveals that as the crew set up shop — including several large Klieg lamps — the Survivors sprang into action , objecting to sharing the street with the filmmakers ; within minutes both sides became loud and belligerent .
At one point Survivor ’s co-founder Jeff White — clad in a tee - short reading Intolerance is a Beautiful Thing — began screaming that the crew were “ jerk - wads , ” “ union thugs ” and “ leftist Teamsters . ”
As words flew , the film crew turned on the lights — the same lights actors and performers work under each day without damage to either their skin or psyche .
Not so the Survivors .
To hear them tell it , the crew intentionally set out to burn them .
While they admit that no one was actually hurt , one protester , 18 - year - old Ryan Bueler , charges that his rubber wristband melted from the heat .
The bracelet quickly became Exhibit A in Mahoney , Newman , and White ’s media arsenal and they wasted no time in sending word to anti-choice activists and conservative media outlets , claiming that “ peaceful pro-life demonstrators ” were being hurt by “ sadistic ” Hollywood liberals .
Overnight , protests were organized ; several days later Survivors and others were bellowing outside Kimmel ’s home and studio , demanding an on - air apology from the talk show host .
In addition , several survivors scored free tickets to a Jimmy Kimmel Live taping and stood up in the middle of the filming to state their case .
The four — teens Walter Gazave and Marissa Streett and adults Brandi Swindell and Beth Hockel — were escorted out , handcuffed , and detained but , in the end , JKL staff declined to press charges against them .
Not surprisingly , the story does n’t end here .
Shortly after the disruption , Mahoney and Slovenic met with JKL personnel and got them to promise that they will never use the offending film crew again .
Still unsatisfied , Timmerie Millington , spokesperson for the Survivors , says that the group plans to file a lawsuit against the lighting crew and is being represented by the Life Legal Defense Foundation , a California nonprofit “ composed of attorneys and other concerned citizens committed to giving helpless and innocent human beings of any age , and their advocates , a trained voice in the courtrooms of our nation . ”
While Millington declined further comment on the specifics of the not - yet - filed lawsuit , she did note that this is not the first time Life Legal Defense has aided the Survivors .
LLD sued the city of Birmingham , Alabama in February , 2009 following the arrest of nine Survivors who had organized a “ truth picket ” outside Parker High School .
The nine did not have a permit and told the Court that they did n’t need one .
As they saw it , they were simply exercising their First Amendment rights .
Standing on the sidewalk with graphic pictures of bloody fetuses , handing out patently - false pamphlets about the alleged dangers of abortion , and accosting students as they attempted to enter their school building was within the purview of free speech , they argued .
In early July 2010 , Judge L. Scott Coogler agreed .
The city subsequently issued a statement saying that the Birmingham police will “ not arrest , threaten to arrest , or interfere with the group ’s free speech activities as long as these activities are lawful and do n’t block pedestrians ” when the Survivors return .
And Jimmy Kimmel Live ?
The show , as they say , goes on .

A Fox TV camerawoman told a court hearing Tuesday that the Los Angeles police violently threw reporters and activists to the ground after an immigration rally , offering the most detailed testimony of a bizarre 2007 incident which she described as a “ war zone . ”
“ The police officer threw her around like a rag doll , ” Fox camerawoman Patricia Ballaz told the court .
ADVERTISEMENT
Courthouse News , an insider publication that tracks court cases , adds details : “ Under direct examination from her lawyer , Browne Greene , Ballaz described May 1 , 2007 at MacArthur Park near downtown Los Angeles as an ordinary scene and an ordinary news day .
It was like any other work day , Ballaz said .
People were picknicking and music was playing in the park . ”
But as reporters moved closer to the police , they saw people screaming and running in the other direction .
Ballaz said she then saw a policeman hitting another news reporter .
“ He was just an average man doing nothing , ” Ballaz said .
“ I had no idea why this was happening .
It was like a war zone . ”
She testified that after the beating she took from the LAPD , she had to have multiple surgeries on her hand , elbow and ankle and may still need more surgeries .
Greene showed pictures of Ballaz ’s hands and elbows that were taken after the surgery .
The pictures showed distinct stitch marks on her hand and her arms .
“ How painful is it to have surgery on your hand all the time ? ” Greene asked .
“ It ’s painful all the time … and you ca n’t do much except take pain pills , ” Ballaz said .
“ I can ’t , I ca n’t do much of anything . ”
When Greene asked Ballaz what all these surgeries and physical obstacles mean to her , Ballaz answered , “ It means the life I knew before is gone … I feel like there ’s no light at the end of the tunnel for me . ”
In an earlier Courthouse News report filed Friday by Chie Akiba , an expert witness testified that the police had used excessive force .
“ There was no hindering of the police officers at all , ” the expert , who had been called by the plaintiff ’s lawyer , said .
A police expert testified at the trial over the violent break - up of a May Day rally that the police charge through a group of reporters “ was no legitimate use of force . ”
As a witness called by lawyers for a FOX TV camerawoman , Lou Reiter said one of the fundamental tasks of law enforcement is to protect people ’s civil rights .
Plaintiff ’s lawyer Browne Greene asked Reiter whether , based on his review of the evidence , the use of force by the policemen at the rally was reasonable .
“ No , the force used was unreasonable , ” Reiter said .

The financial meltdown of 2008 raises the question : Who will regulate the regulators ?
THE CONGRESSIONAL post- mortem of the 2008 financial crisis has focused primarily on the handful of rogue banks -- in particular , Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs -- whose actions helped precipitate the meltdown .
This serves the convenient purpose of deflecting attention away from the network of government and government - anointed personnel that could have stopped their misdeeds before they infected the entire global financial system .
Still , the investigations currently underway have provided a rare glimpse of the elite club of cronies who run the financial system from behind closed doors .
All its members are culpable in the financial meltdown of 2008 .
To be sure , the banks conned their clients in a manner befitting a Mafia family .
But the government institutions that were empowered to police them were all too happy to look the other way until the deals went sour - - en masse .
This includes many of the same members of Congress now spewing vitriol at bankers ' shady business practices while TV cameras roll -- but who happily accepted corporate dollars when campaigning for election .
Columnist : Sharon Smith Sharon Smith is the author of Subterranean Fire : A History of Working - Class Radicalism in the United States , a historical account of the American working - class movement , and Women and Socialism , a collection of essays on women ’s oppression and the struggle against it .
She is also on the board of Haymarket Books .
Sen . Carl Levin , chair of the Senate 's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations now raking Goldman managers over the coals , also has had his hands in the corporate till .
According to the Center for Responsive Politics , the top five donors to the Michigan senator 's reelection campaigns between 2005 and 2010 do not include Goldman Sachs -- but do include Ford , General Motors and Cerberus Capital Management , which took control of Chrysler in 2007 and then propelled it into bankruptcy in 2009 .
In hindsight , Levin 's current outrage at Goldman appears disingenuous at best .
Along with most Democrats , Levin voted for the Republican - sponsored Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 , signed into law by Bill Clinton .
This piece of legislation repealed the Glass - Steagall Act of 1933 -- the New Deal legislation requiring the separation of investment and commercial banks -- and single - handedly enabled banks to run the unaccountable " shadow banking system " at the center of the 2008 financial crisis .
Even three decades of deregulation legislation did not entirely remove Wall Street oversight , however .
Between them , the Security and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve surely could have taken action against these bankers ' game of Russian roulette while the good times were still rolling .
After all , as soon as Wall Street entered its downward spiral , these same agencies banded together with lightning speed to save their banking brethren -- swiftly gaining congressional approval for the government bailout on October 3 , 2008 .
Anton R. Valukas , a court - appointed examiner investigating how Lehman Brothers cooked the books to hide its enormous debts , clearly found the SEC negligent in its duties .
" I saw nothing in my investigation to suggest that the SEC asked even the most fundamental questions that might have uncovered this practice early on , before Lehman escalated it to a $ 50 billion issue , " Valukas stated in written testimony released by the House Financial Services Committee .
Yet when questioned about their collective inaction in the events leading up to Lehman 's bankruptcy on September 5 , 2008 , those with the power to have stopped the firm 's escapades engaged in an elaborate game of buck - passing .
The SEC's then - chairman Christopher Cox claimed it lacked the authority to take action .
Cox " told Mr. Valukas that he believed that the agency 's jurisdiction ' was limited to Lehman 's broker - dealer subsidiary and that it was not the regulator of Lehman itself , ' " wrote the New York Times .
Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke admitted to Valukas that in March 2008 , the Federal Reserve assigned two examiners to keep track of Lehman , but claimed they " had no authority to regulate Lehman 's disclosures , capital , risk management or other business activities . "
The Obama administration has been even more sweeping in its defense of regulatory paralysis in the face of widespread wrongdoing , arguing that no one had the authority to take action .
Larry Summers , director of the Obama 's National Economic Council , recently claimed on PBS NewsHour , " Regulators did n't have authority in a comprehensive way to monitor the derivatives market . "
WHEN THE SEC charged Goldman Sachs with fraud last month , no one was more shocked by this sudden change of heart than the accused executives themselves .
Until then , the Goldman brass enjoyed an especially cordial relationship with government regulatory agencies .
Goldman executives transition regularly to employment at the Treasury Department -- as Bill Clinton 's Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin did , and George W. Bush 's Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
The crossover has continued under Obama : Goldman lobbyist Mark Patterson left his high - powered job last year to serve as chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner .
The Treasury Department collaborated with Goldman probably more than any other Wall Street firm during the 2008 financial collapse .
Upon taking office in June 2006 , Paulson had ruled out any official contact with Goldman to avoid a conflict of interest with his former employer , but just over two years later , he requested and received an " ethics waiver " voiding that pledge .
That was on September 17 , 2008 , just one day after the government agreed to come up with $ 85 billion for insurance giant AIG to pay off its substantial debts to Goldman and other big banks .
Goldman was the largest recipient of the payoff .
According to the New York Times , during the week of the AIG bailout , Paulson spoke to Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein " two dozen times , the calendars show , far more frequently than Mr. Paulson did with other Wall Street executives . "
At the end of that tumultuous week , the Federal Reserve rushed through emergency requests by Goldman and Morgan Stanley to change their status from investment banks to traditional bank holding companies -- with the flick of a pen bypassing the legal five - day antitrust waiting period .
The deal was struck over a single weekend , and Goldman and Morgan Stanley emerged on Monday morning as entirely new entities -- a signal from the Fed that it would not allow these two firms to fail .
Interestingly , their new status switched their holding companies from SEC to Federal Reserve oversight .
The SEC was not simply asleep at the wheel while the financial system careened toward disaster .
In 2004 , it had designed a special program , known as the " consolidated supervised entities " program , which enabled the reckless borrowing that later caused the banking crisis .
The special program was created , according to the New York Times , " after heavy lobbying for the plan from all five big investment banks .
At the time , Mr. Paulson was the head of Goldman Sachs .
He left two years later to become the Treasury Secretary . "
The same five investment banks -- Goldman , Morgan Stanley , Bear Stearns , Lehman and Merrill Lynch -- immediately " volunteered " to enroll in the new SEC program that was created at their behest .
Through this special program , the SEC allowed these Wall Street giants to vastly increase their amount of debt .
SEC rules had long required banks to hold roughly $ 1 of equity for every $ 15 of debt , or a 15 - 1 debt - to - net - capital ratio .
The new program lifted these limits .
As Ben Protess reported at ProPublica.org , " Merrill Lynch 's leverage ratio was possibly as high as 40 - to - 1 [ in 2008 ] , and Lehman Brothers faced a ratio of about 30 - to - 1 , according to Bloomberg . "
In return for this cash cow , the banking behemoths agreed to allow the SEC to regulate their holding companies .
But this also was at the banks ' request .
Voluntarily submitting to SEC oversight would allow their overseas operations to avoid European Union regulators .
They preferred the SEC for reasons that later became obvious :
Their backslapping pals at the SEC provided virtually no regulatory oversight .
The SEC failed to shut down this disastrous program even as the system began to convulse in March 2008 , at the time of Bear Sterns ' collapse and subsequent fire sale to JP Morgan Chase -- months before Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch was acquired by Bank of America .
By the time the SEC dissolved the program on September 26 , 2008 , none of the five investment banks remained as such , although their trail of poison was still working its way through the global financial system .
IN THE meantime , the top three credit rating agencies , Moody's , Standard & Poor 's and Fitch , also played a key role in inflating -- and then bursting -- the housing bubble .
One day they were handing out AAA ratings to sub - prime mortgage - backed securities like cocktails at happy hour .
Then suddenly the party was over .
On the eve of the housing crisis in 2007 , all three ratings agencies began simultaneously downgrading AAA - rated mortgage - backed securities to junk .
By the end of 2007 , fully 91 percent of AAA - rated mortgage securities had been downgraded to junk status , as investors realized that their securities were fast becoming worthless .
In theory , " independent " credit rating agencies attach AAA - ratings to only the safest securities , based on objective criteria .
In reality , these top three rating agencies make up an oligopoly , created and sustained by the SEC since 1975 .
In that year , the SEC elevated a small number of credit ratings agencies to the coveted status of Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization ( NRSRO ) that it empowered to assess the safety of securities , even though the NRSRO was made up of a group of corporations that were entirely unregulated .
In this public - private partnership , even the SEC had no authority over their conduct until the crisis was well underway in 2008 .
By the 1990s , a series of mergers had left only three NRSROs : Moody's , Standard & Poor 's and Fitch .
Facing criticism , the SEC granted a handful of other credit agencies NRSRO status beginning in 2003 , but these three top continued to dominate the market .
As the Wall Street Journal complained in April 2009 , " To this day , the Fed will only accept assets as collateral if they carry high ratings from S&P , Moody 's and Fitch . "
In the process , the ratings agencies ' traditional means of compensation switched from investors who paid for their services to the corporations whose securities they were charged with rating .
This created a scenario of cutthroat competition among the three dominant credit rating agencies for market share from the corporations paying them .
As might be expected , they became much less concerned with the integrity of their ratings than the goodwill of their banker clients .
A May 2006 message from a UBS banker to a Standard & Poor 's employee plainly threatened to take its business to competitors : " Heard you guys are revising your residential mbs rating methodology - - getting very punitive ... heard your ratings could be 5 notches back of mo[o ] dys equivalent .
gonoa ( sic ) kill your resi biz .
may force us to do moodyfitch only cdos ! "
If their clients were willing to blackmail and bully their way to AAA ratings , the ratings agencies were well aware of their role in the charade .
As one Standard & Poor 's internal e-mail read , " Ratings agencies continue to create an even bigger monster -- the CDO market .
Let 's hope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of cards falters . "
Rating agency employees who refused to accommodate the wishes of their banker clients were swiftly moved to other accounts .
Richard Michalek , a former managing director in Moody 's structured products derivatives group , testified before the Senate that because he was unwilling to their wishes , managers told him he was " not welcome on deals " involving certain banks -- including Goldman Sachs , UBS AG and Merrill Lynch .
Moody 's managing director Yuri Yoshizawa testified that they quietly moved analysts to other accounts because " we felt that our analysts were being abused . "
WITH MIDTERM elections looming large , the Democratic Party desperately needs to shore up its voting base .
This can only be accomplished if its first year of Congressional inaction is followed by tough talk raising the specter of some action , however meager .
Although congressional Republicans were prepared to play their familiar obstructionist role , bent on preserving every iota of corporate privilege in the name of fighting " big government , " they were forced to abandon their plans .
So great is the public 's support for government action against Wall Street that no politician dares to openly stand in the way .
Unfortunately , the Democrats ' financial regulation bill now being hotly debated in Congress is far from the " sweeping overhaul " described by most mainstream journalists .
In truth , it is aimed at preventing significant reform .
At minimum , a regulatory overhaul would reinstate the provisions of the 1933 Glass - Steagall Act requiring the separation of investment and commercial banks .
In addition , no overhaul can be effective unless it dismantles the system by which rating agencies get paid by the corporations whose securities they are rating , rather than the investors they are ostensibly serving .
Perhaps more importantly , no politician has suggested so far that Corporate America be barred from policing itself .
The line between banks and their overseers has become so blurred because watchdog agencies actively recruit from big banks and vice versa , in a revolving door of golfing partners .
But this practice continues .
As the Wall Street Journal recently reported , " Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement chief Robert Khuzami oversaw a group of lawyers at his old firm , Deutsche Bank AG , that was closely involved in developing collateralized debt obligations , the same product in the agency 's fraud lawsuit against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , according to people familiar with the matter . "
No worries , however , the Journal article continues : " Because of Mr. Khuzami 's old job and his financial interest in the company , he has recused himself from any matters related to Deutsche Bank . "
The 2008 financial crisis exposed the degree to which foxes have been guarding the chicken coop .
And there does n't appear to be any end in sight .
Until there is an independent and accountable agency regulating the regulators , Congress is merely rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic until it hits the next iceberg .
