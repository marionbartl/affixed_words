Since it ’s now featured on the redis homepage , I figure I should tell people about my fork of erldis , an erlang redis client focused on synchronous operations .
Synchronicity
The original client , which still exists as erldis_client.erl , implements asynchronous pipelining .
This means you send a bunch of redis commands , then collect all the results at the end .
This did n’t work for me , as I needed a client that could handle parallel synchronous requests from multiple concurrent processes .
So I copied erldis_client.erl to erldis_sync_client.erl and modified it to send replies back as soon as they are received from redis ( in FIFO order ) .
Many thanks to dialtone_ for writing the original erldis app as I ’m not sure I would ’ve created the synchronous client without it .
And thanks to cstar for patches , such as making erldis_sync_client the default client for all functions in erldis.erl .
Extras
In addition to the synchronous client , I ’ve added some extra functions and modules to make interfacing with redis more erlangy .
Here ’s a brief overview …
erldis_sync_client:transact
erldis_sync_client :transact is analagous to mnesia : transaction in that it does a unit of work against a redis database , like so :
starts erldis_sync_client calls your function with the client PID as the argument stops the client returns the result of your function
The goal being to reduce boilerplate start / stop code .
erldis_dict module
erldis_dict provides similar semantics as the dict module in stdlib , using redis key - value commands .
erldis_list module
erldis_list provides a number of functions operating on redis lists , inspired by the array , lists , and queue modules in stdlib .
You must pass in both the client PID and a redis list key .
erldis_sets module
erldis_sets works like the sets module , but you have to provide both the client PID and a redis set key .
Usage
Despite the low version numbers , I ’ve been successfully using erldis as a component in parallel / distributed information retrieval ( in conjunction with plists ) , and for accessing data shared with python / django apps .
It ’s a fully compliant erlang application that you can include in your target system release structure .
If also you ’re using erldis for your redis needs , I ’d love to hear about it .
A Spokane police sergeant will avoid criminal prosecution for a drunken hit - and - run crash if he stays out of trouble for five years .
Bradley N. Thoma , 44 , was cited for drunken driving when he rear - ended a Mead woman ’s truck in September , then drove away without stopping .
A judge amended the charges Friday to include one count of misdemeanor leaving the scene of an accident , then dismissed that charge after being presented with a letter from the victim that said she ’d been paid for the damage to her vehicle and was “ not interested in ( pursuing ) Mr. Thoma any further . ”
The judge also allowed Thoma to enroll in a five - year deferred prosecution program that will result in the drunken driving charge being dismissed if he complies with the requirements .
By asking for the deferred prosecution , Thoma acknowledged he has a severe alcohol problem , said Brian O’Brien , Spokane County deputy prosecutor .
“ Quite frankly , most people do n’t want to go through deferred prosecution ” because of the stringent requirements , O’Brien said .
“ It is n’t the easy way out . ”
The deal , however , left the victim of the hit - and - run accident feeling duped .
Sherry Prickett , 51 , said she agreed to sign the letter prepared by the law office of Rob Cossey , who represents Thoma , only because she thought it referred to financial issues surrounding the crash .
Thoma already had paid $ 471 to repair her vehicle and Prickett said she thought she was being asked to sign the letter e-mailed to her just hours before Friday ’s court hearing to reflect that she did n’t want to seek more money .
“ I do feel misled , ” Prickett said .
“ If I had known it was releasing him of the hit - and - run charge I would never have signed . ”
After reviewing the letter , Judge Douglas Robinson , a visiting judge from Whitman County , agreed to the deferred prosecution agreement and dropped the hit - and - run charge in Spokane County District Court on Friday morning .
“ I was under the impression that the victim had been compensated and they were OK with that and that was the end of it , ” Robinson said after the hearing .
He said he had “ no idea ” Thoma was a police sergeant .
Cossey did not return a phone call seeking comment about Prickett ’s letter .
Under the deferred prosecution agreement , Thoma – whose blood - alcohol level was 0.171 , more than twice the legal limit for driving – will basically be on probation for five years and be required to complete a rehabilitation program in the first two years .
The DUI arrest wo n’t appear on his record if he completes the program .
Thoma was driving his personal Dodge Ram pickup on Sept. 23 when he struck the back of Prickett ’s Ford Ranger near the intersection of Farwell Road and U.S. Highway 2 , then drove away .
Prickett and another driver followed Thoma to the parking lot of a Yoke ’s Fresh Market , where Thoma told a state trooper he ’d been planning to buy steaks before picking up his daughter from volleyball practice .
Thoma , who troopers said smelled strongly of alcohol , said he ’d just golfed at Wandermere Golf Course and “ knew he had hit someone ’s car and not stopped to give her his information , ” according to a report from the Washington State Patrol .
“ He talked about how he was probably going to lose his job or at least lose his supervisory position , ” according to the report .
“ He also told me he knew I was just doing my job and he was sorry for putting me in the position of arresting a fellow officer . ”
The impact damaged the bumper of Prickett ’s truck .
She replaced it using a $ 471 check from Thoma .
Thoma has been with the department since October 1989 .
He ’s been suspended with pay from his $ 91,141 - a- year job pending an internal investigation .
Court documents show Cossey was the first person Thoma tried to contact when troopers took him to the WSP office .
When Thoma could n’t reach Cossey ’s office , he called police Officer Rob Boothe to get the attorney ’s private number , according to a report .
Cossey had successfully defended Boothe from allegations by two fellow officers that he ’d kicked a handcuffed man in the face .
Cossey also successfully defended former police Officer Jay Olsen against criminal charges stemming from the shooting of a fleeing man , Shonto Pete .
After promising not to drive , Thoma was released to another Spokane police sergeant who drove him home , according to the WSP report .

A fifth of women over 16 say they have been stalked at some point
When it comes to violent crime , in general , the statistics suggest men are the most likely victims .
So why is the government launching a campaign to end violence against women and girls in particular ?
The difference is that women disproportionately become the victims of these crimes .
The figures on domestic violence demonstrate the point .
The latest Home Office figures suggest that in one year , 106 people were killed by a current or former partner .
But the overwhelming majority , 72 of them , were women .
It means that domestic attacks result in the death of at least one woman every week , on average , in England and Wales .
But this is not the only crime or type of attack where women and girls become the usual target because of their gender .
According to the Home Office , around 10,000 women are sexually assaulted and 2,000 women are raped every week .
Revealing clothing
One - fifth of women over 16 say they have been stalked at some point .
Forced marriage , " honour " killings , trafficking for sexual exploitation and female genital mutilation are all crimes exclusively or mainly perpetrated against women .
Arguably , a campaign to end violence against women and girls in particular is also justified by the findings of an opinion poll commissioned by the Home Office in February this year .
Nearly half of those polled thought that a woman should be held fully or partly responsible if she worked as a prostitute and was sexually assaulted or raped .
A third thought a woman should be held fully or partly responsible if she was drunk and was sexually assaulted or raped .
Around one - fifth thought it would be acceptable in certain circumstances for a man to hit or slap his wife or girlfriend in response to her being dressed in sexy or revealing clothing in public .
Although held by a minority of people questioned , these attitudes can create cultures where offenders feel justified - and where women and girls feel they may in some way " deserve " to be attacked or abused .

Syntactic Proofs of Compositional Compiler Correctness
Semantic preservation by compilers for higher - order languages can be veriï¬ed using simple syntactic methods .
At the heart of classic techniques are relations between source - level and target - level values .
Unfortunately , these relations are speciï¬c to particular compilers , leading to correctness theorems that have nothing to say about linking programs with functions compiled by other compilers or written by hand in the target language .
Theorems based on logical relations manage to avoid this problem , but at a cost : standard logical relations do not apply directly to programs with non-termination or impurity , and extensions to handle those features are relatively complicated , compared to the classical compiler veriï¬cation literature .
In this paper , we present a new approach to â€œopenâ€ compiler correctness theorems that is â€œsyntacticâ€ in the sense that the core relations do not refer to semantics .
Though the technique is much more elementary than previous proposals , it scales up nicely to realistic languages .
In particular , untyped and impure programs may be handled simply , while previous work has addressed neither in this context .
Our approach is based on the observation that it is an unnecessary handicap to consider proofs as black boxes .
We identify some theorem - speciï¬c proof skeletons , such that we can deï¬ne an algebra of nondeterministic compilations and their proofs , and we can compose any two compilations to produce a correct - by - construction result .
We have prototyped these ideas with a Coq implementation of multiple CPS translations for an untyped Mini - ML source language with recursive functions , sums , products , mutable references , and exceptions .
Collection of Fantastic Eye Photos
The human eyeball , when viewed up close is one of the most intricately beautiful things in nature .
And while we think that it really lends itself as a subject for macro photographers , a surprisingly few amount of people attempt to photograph eyes .
Hopefully this collection of fantastic eye photos will go some way towards changing that .

The most dispiriting thing about trying to live a more environmentally friendly lifestyle is that it is all about not doing things .
We are told we have to stop flying , stop driving , stop eating meat , stop heating our houses ... the list goes on and on .
So it is a nice change to be told that there is something you can do which will reduce your impact on the environment AND requires that you buy yourself a nice bit of kit to boot .
Bring on the domestic wind turbine !

What could be more environmentally friendly than harvesting electricity from the wind and what better ethical badge of honour than a turbine spinning on my roof ?
That 's certainly what I thought three years ago , when my family and I were challenged by the Newsnight editor to try to make our lifestyle greener .
Unfortunately , I was n't the only wannabe ethical man to want to reap the wind .
As I began exploring the possibility of erecting a turbine on my terraced London home the Tory leader David Cameron announced his ambition to do the same .
The question was , who would get theirs up first ?
Three years on and neither I nor the Tory party leader have a turbine on our roof .
Why ?
The answer is very simple .
In most urban locations in Britain wind turbines simply do not work .
Yes , they spin , but they do not generate significant amounts of power .
Why not ?
Here 's the science bit ... ( do n't worry , you will be able to follow it ) .
A simple equation gives the power of the wind .
Power = 0.5 x collection area x the wind speed cubed .
What it tells us is that the power of a turbine is related to two factors : the size of the turbine and the strength of the wind .
Let 's look at size first .
Cast your mind back to your GCSE maths ( I 'm old enough to have done O - levels ) .
No doubt you dimly remember that the area of the circle is equal to the constant pi ( 3.14 ) times the radius of the circle squared .
What that means is that as you increase the length of a turbine blade , the collection area increases disproportionately .
Take the micro turbine I was planning .
Its blades were 1.75 m long , giving a collection area of just under 10sq m. Tiny .
Compare that to the wind turbines I visited in Texas earlier this year .
Some had turbine blades 45 m long , giving a collection area of 6,358sq m. Huge .
The message is clear from the maths - small turbines have disproportionately smaller collection areas and therefore generate dramatically less power .
And what about wind speed ?
The key here is that cube function on the wind speed .
The power of the wind is related to the cube of the wind speed .
So , at low wind speeds you get virtually nothing .
When it really blows it you get a lot of power .
Here 's why .
Double the wind speed and you get eight times the power .
Quadruple it and you get 64 times as much .
Eight times the speed and we 're talking more than 500 times the power .
The figures given by Windsave , the company that was going to install my wind turbine , confirmed that .
It boasted that its 1.75 m turbine would generate 1 kW of power at speeds of 12.5 m per second .
Pretty good , but 12.5 m per second is a force 6 wind , a decent breeze .
Halve the wind speed to six meters per second ( a moderate breeze ) and - thanks to that cube law - you now get just 120 Watts - that 's two standard incandescent lightblubs ( 10 energy friendly compact fluorescents ) .
Hum , not bad .
My house is on the flanks of the highest hill in London and is relatively exposed but I 'm told that average wind speeds are likely to be between 4 m and 5 m per second .
( You can find out the wind speed in your area here . )
At those speeds I 'd be lucky to get 25 Watts .
That is barely enough for two energy saving light bulbs .
Nowhere near enough to live up to the company 's promise of reducing my electricity bills by " up to 30 % a year " .
The message is clear .
In most UK locations micro wind turbines will never generate significant amounts of electricity .
It makes a nonsense of the claim made by the Energy Saving Trust , when I was planning my turbine , that domestic wind turbines could supply 4 % of all the UK 's electricity needs and cut carbon dioxide emissions by 6 % .
It also suggests the government should think again about offering a generous feed - in tariff for power generated from micro wind turbines .
And , if any more proof of my point was needed , in September this year Windsave went bust .
Of course , not all wind energy is a dead end .
What our calculations tell us is that power increases dramatically as you increase the size of the turbine and the wind speed .
So , a 10 m turbine in a 10 knot breeze generates 100,000 times the power of a 1 m turbine in a 1 knot breeze .
Indeed , if Camden , my local council , gave me planning permission for one of those Texan whoppers it would generate significant power - something like 200 kW - even at 4 m per second .
But even these impressive figures can't disguise the inconvenient truth about wind power : except in storm conditions it is - compared to fossil fuels - a very dilute energy source .
Professor David MacKay , the new chief scientist at the Department for Energy and Climate Change , has done the maths on this .
Instead of kW , he calculates power in kWh , and he estimates that if we put wind turbines across the windiest 10 % of the country , we would generate only 20 kWh per day per person in Britain .
According to MacKay , it takes 40 kWh to drive the average car 50km .
Add in offshore turbines covering a third of the available shallow water locations ( 44,000 turbines ) and installing deep water turbines in a 9 km - wide strip all round the entire British coast and you get an additional 48kWh day per person .
That 's a lot of power , but even on quite conservative estimates the average UK resident uses 125 kWh day .
It leads to a dispiriting conclusion .
Wind is , at best , only a very partial solution to the problem of how to generate low - carbon energy .
Britain seems doomed to be relegated from the " premier league " of international economies over the next few years - with serious implications for its diplomatic status and international " clout " .
Stagnation at home and rapid economic growth in developing economies will push the UK as low as 11th in the global pecking order by 2015 , according to analysis by the Centre for Economics and Business Research ( CEBR ) .
Having clawed up to fourth place by the start of this decade , the recession has already seen Britain overtaken by China , Italy and France , and it seems likely that the slide will get worse .
Being ranked behind Brazil , India and Canada and only just ahead of Australia in the international league table , would add to existing pressure on the UK to relinquish some of its prized diplomatic privileges , such as the permanent seat on the UN Security Council , and its voting rights and power in forums such as the IMF .

In the Commonwealth , the British monarch 's claim to remain head may be undermined if the UK becomes only the gathering 's third or fourth most - important economic power .
Scottish independence , although unlikely for now , would hasten the UK 's slippage and further diminish its global prestige .
Perhaps the greatest shock will be psychological as much as political , as the decline in the UK 's relative economic prowess will be part of a shift of power eastwards .
Doug McWilliams , chief executive of the CEBR , commented : " Many Britons are only now getting used to no longer having an Empire .
Even after the end of Empire , the world 's political agenda continued to be set by people with broadly the same cultural framework as the British .
But some of those who are increasingly setting the world agenda have a degree of post - colonial resentment against the British .
It will be difficult to maintain the UK's high diplomatic profile when we are no longer in the world 's top 10 . "
He added : " We will have to be prepared to put up with economic , political and social decisions made internationally in countries with very different approaches to , for example , human rights .
This could prove traumatic . "
Although the US will retain its place as the largest economy over the next few years , on present trends the Chinese could overtake it by the 2020s .
The only comfort for British diplomats dismayed at their withering influence is that other EU nations seem likely to decline even more rapidly , and demographic changes may raise the UK 's voting power in the Union over decades .
Mr McWilliams said : " Since most other European economies are likely to do nearly as badly , it is probable that our relative position in the EU will not change much .
But can we maintain a permanent seat on the UN Security Council ? "
Creditors of Dubai World are expected to reject a standstill agreement proposed by the company , threatening to drag out negotiations over $ 26bn ( £ 15 bn ) worth of the conglomerate 's debt .
Advisers involved in the talks tonight said that the process could take months as more than 100 accountants , lawyers , bankers and other professionals descended on Dubai from London .
" There wo n't be a standstill agreement , " one said .
By rejecting the company 's proposal to put interest payments on hold , creditors automatically trigger a default , leading to inevitable further wrangling .
Global markets have begun to recover following initial fears that the Dubai crisis would spread but the local battle over who bears the losses has only just begun .
If the standstill is rejected and a default is triggered , all parties would have to compromise to reach a restructuring agreement , sources said .
Creditors – including UK banks such as RBS and Standard Chartered , as well as hedge funds – may be in a weaker position than they would be in the UK , which has a more creditor - friendly legal environment .
Suing Dubai World , in Dubai , over Dubai - based assets " would be legally very expensive and would go very slowly " , one of the sources said .
The Dubai government , which has said it will not cover Dubai World 's debts , " might find itself being the last piece of the jigsaw to make a deal work , " another source said .
But creditors are not taking any government help for granted .
" Creditors hoping that if they shout loud the state would give in to them have now been given enough evidence that this wo n't happen , " another source said .
Creditors are also unlikely to present a united front – some might want to swap some debt for assets , holding on to them in the hope that the market will recover , while others will want cash .
The crisis has attracted distressed debt investors , who usually buy debt at a significant discount with the view that a restructuring will increase the value of their debt , or that they could seize some assets .
Distressed debt players , typically aggressive and used to legal threats and action , may push the company into a better deal for creditors – although too much pressure can make a deal fall apart .
The restructuring is affecting other government related entities ( GREs ) , also seen to have less support from the government than investors thought .
Ratings agency Standard & Poor 's downgraded six Dubai GREs as it " revised its expectation for the likelihood of extraordinary support from the Dubai government to ' low ' " .
The six are DIFC Investments ( which owns the Art Dubai show ) , ports operator DP World , Jebel Ali Free Zone ( where 6,100 companies conduct business ) , commodities market Dubai Multi Commodities Centre Authority , Dubai Holding Commercial Operations Group ( an investment company ) , and property developer Emaar Properties .

Due to falling reserves , a slightly weaker dollar , and belief in the economic recovery , the price of oil has climbed to over $ 78 per barrel , which is its highest price since December 1 , when the price stood at just below $ 78.50 .
In turn , there has been slight pressure on the price of gasoline , which is up two cents for the week and now stands at $ 2.61 per gallon .
There is usually a little bit of a lag between when swings in the price of oil hit the price of gasoline , so there will likely be a slight jump in the price of gasoline over the coming weeks .
Over the past month , the price of gasoline has moved in a very narrow range between $ 2.58 and $ 2.64 per gallon .
While this is certainly welcome news to cash - strapped consumer , the jump in the price of gasoline over the past year certainly is not .
The price of gasoline is now $ 1 â€ “ or 62 % – higher than it was at this time last year .
Currently , only Alaska ( $ 3.77 ) and Hawaii ( $ 3.68 ) are reporting state - wide average gasoline prices above $ 3 per gallon , while 14 states are reporting an average price below $ 2.50 per gallon .
Missouri has the lowest average gasoline price in the United States at $ 2.41 per gallon .
Man Turns Down Billions for His Ancestral Homeland

Though his tribal land is worth an estimated $ 5 billion , an Aboriginal man refuses to sell it , instead keeping it as a legacy for his family .
A stunning vista of jagged brick - red cliffs lies in Australia ’s desolate Northern Territory .
As breathtaking as the scenery is , though , most people are more concerned with what lies beneath Koongarra : A massive deposit of uranium worth $ 5 billion .
Just one man , 36 - year - old Jeffrey Lee , holds the title to this unfathomably valuable piece of real estate – and he says it ’s not for sale .
Lee , an Australian Aborigine , wo n’t condone the destruction of his ancestral land at any cost .
As the sole survivor of the Djok clan , he believes that he has a grave responsibility to protect Koongarra and the rest of his tribe ’s native lands from harm .
“ There are sacred sites , there are burial sites and there are other special places out there which are my responsibility to look after , ” Lee told The Sydney Morning Herald .
So , rather than rubbing elbows with Donald Trump and Richard Branson on the Forbes billionaire list , Lee has rejected all requests to purchase Koongarra .
He is committed to protecting it from uranium mining , which would poison the land and destroy its fragile ecosystem .
It ’s a shocking choice , to be sure – but Lee has no need for a fleet of yachts , his own island , or any other trappings of the decadent life .
His desire is simply to preserve the legacy of his ancestral tribe .
So instead of selling Koongarra to a mining company , Lee plans to incorporate his homeland into Kakadu National Park , where “ it will be protected and safe forever , ” he said .
Lee ’s incredible sacrifice is n’t just about salvaging the past :
It ’s about protecting the future , too .
Even though he has no children yet , he believes that access to the sacred ancestral land is the greatest gift that he can provide for his future offspring .
“ I was taken all through here on the shoulder of my grandmother , ” said Lee .
“ I heard all the stories and learnt everything about this land , and I want to pass it all on to my kids . ”
Update : On 6th of February 2013 , Koongarra was officially incorporated into Kakadu National Park , guaranteeing that it will be permanently protected .

( CNN ) --
The message blaring out of the speakers on the van was stark : " Any black person who is hiding in Rosarno should get out .
If we catch you , we will kill you . "
Abdul Rashid Muhammad Mahmoud Iddris got out .
He 's one of hundreds -- perhaps thousands -- of African migrants taken by bus out of the Italian town over the weekend after violent demonstrations shook southern Italy .
The unrest was among the worst of its kind in recent Italian history , said a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration .
" We have not witnessed such protests in a long time , " said Flavio Di Giacomo .
" There were several thousand , but I do n't know exactly how many people were involved . "
Interior Minister Roberto Maroni got involved Friday , declaring an " immigration emergency " and forming a task force under the authority of regional police to guarantee public order .
It was the shooting of an African migrant that sparked two days of protests , Iddris told CNN by telephone from Italy .
He said the shooting was unprovoked .
Police said they were investigating the circumstances of the shooting .
Iddris lived with other migrants in an abandoned factory outside Rosarno , he said .
On Thursday , a BMW pulled up outside the factory , a man got out , shot one of the Africans living there , 26 - year - old Ayiva Saibou , and drove off .
A passing policeman told Iddris and his friends it was not his job to help the wounded man , so they called the Red Cross to take the man to a hospital for treatment , Iddris said .
Press reports said Saibou -- who is a native of Togo with regular working papers -- was shot with a compressed air gun .
A few hours after the shooting , a group of about 300 immigrants poured into to the street where the incident took place earlier .
" They put on an angry demonstration , hampering the free circulation in the streets , damaging garbage bins , hitting with sticks and rocks numerous passing cars , " according to a police report .
Iddris and his friends then decided to march to Rosarno 's town hall to protest .
" About 2,000 people came -- all of us , " he said .
" It started about 6 or 7 in the evening , a few hours after he was shot . "
But police forced the demonstrators to turn back , threatening them with tear gas , Iddris said .
Six or seven people were arrested , he said .
Police attempted talking with the immigrants , but negotiations did not produce positive results , according to a police statement .
The next morning , Friday , the immigrants tried again , playing drums as they tried to march from the factory to Rosarno 's town hall , he said .
That 's when they heard the warning .
" People took a van , an information van with speakers , saying any black person who is hiding in Rosarno should get out , if they catch anyone they will kill him , " Iddris said .
Iddris -- who is originally from Sudan and has been in Italy for about 18 months , first as an asylum seeker and then without legal documentation , and who picks oranges in season -- said police arrested another 10 to 20 people at Friday 's demonstration .
Italian press reports said the demonstrators had burned cars .
Later on Friday , Iddris said , police arranged for buses to move the Africans away from Rosarno to another village .
But the new location was no safer , he said .
Police had to keep locals and migrants physically separated Saturday .
" They said they would take us to another place .
They said it 's dangerous now for blacks to stay there , " he said .
Hundreds of people were driven north to Bari on Italy 's east coast and Naples on its west coast , Iddris said .
He was on one of six buses , each with 45 to 50 people , taken to Bari .
" Right now we do n't know what is next , " he said Monday .
Pope Benedict XVI spoke out against the violence in his weekly address on Sunday .
" An immigrant is a human being , different by background , culture and tradition , but a person to be respected , " he said .
" Violence must never be a way to resolve difficulties , " he said , urging people " to look at the face of the other and discover that he , too , has a soul , a story and a life .
He is a person and God loves him just as He loves me . "
Di Giacomo , the International Organization for Migration spokesman , said Italy has many migrants , often from Africa , living in conditions bordering on slavery .
The migrants who demonstrated last week " were exploited .
They were just paid 20 euros ( about $ 29 ) per day and they lived in slums , the same as slavery conditions .
A few months ago in ( the southern Italian region of ) Campagna we discovered a similar situation .
It 's unfortunately a reality in many places , especially in southern Italy . "
Italy is one of the top European destinations for migrants , the migration organization 's figures show .
More than 3.6 million legal migrants live in the country -- 6.2 percent of the total population -- and Italy has the European Union 's highest annual growth rate of migrants , along with Spain .
It 's hard to know exactly how many illegal immigrants there are in the country , Di Giacomo said .
" It is not controlled in any way .
They change the area where they work because of the season of the year -- oranges in the winter , tomatoes in the summer , " he said .
" With economic migrants , many of them arrive with tourist visas and overstay seeking work .
They can arrive in so many ways , " including paying traffickers thousands of dollars to smuggle them into the country .
Not all the workers involved in the demonstrations were undocumented , he said -- but the line between legal and illegal can be porous .
" Some have lost their jobs , and in Italy if you lose your job you have six months to find work or you become illegal , " he said .
Italian media have speculated that the Mafia was behind the shooting that triggered the violence .
But Di Giacomo said it was not important whether they were or not .
" We do n't know if the Mafia is involved , but the point is not really the Mafia , " he said .
" The point is that the conditions for these migrants are so inhuman that they can lead to some violent reactions . "
FOR a brief period expectations had been high that trustbusters on both sides of the Atlantic would start playing in tune .
The European Commission 's regulators have customarily taken a far more activist approach to competition policy than their American counterparts .
A few months ago , Barack Obama 's administration let it be known that it would act with more vigilance particularly with regard to antitrust issues related to information technology .
But this apparent meeting of minds has proved illusory .
It emerged on Monday November 9th that the commission has officially objected to the proposed $ 7.4 billion purchase of Sun Microsystems , a troubled maker of computer hardware , by Oracle , the world 's second - biggest software firm .
America 's Department of Justice had given its approval to the tie - up in August .
Not long after the news of the commission 's objections filtered out the justice department backed up its ruling by issuing a statement arguing that the deal does not raise any antitrust concerns .
“ After conducting a careful investigation of the proposed transaction between Oracle and Sun , the department 's antitrust division concluded that the merger is unlikely to be anticompetitive ” , insisted Molly Boast , one of the division 's lawyers .
But she did attempt to limit the damage to the newly warming relations between trustbusters on both sides of the Atlantic .
She added that the department and the commission “ have a strong and positive relationship on competition policy matters …
The antitrust division will continue to work constructively with the [ commission ] and competition authorities in other jurisdictions ” .
Nevertheless , it is unclear how a transatlantic row can be avoided along the lines of the spat in 2001 , when a planned merger between General Electric and Honeywell caused a stink .
The commission worries that a union between Oracle and Sun would reduce competition in the market for corporate databases .
Oracle is the world 's biggest seller of proprietary software to run such databases , with a market share of nearly 50 % .
Sun is the owner of MySQL , the most widely used “ open - source ” database software , which already competes with Oracle 's products and could become more of a threat in the future .
Neelie Kroes , Europe 's competition commissioner , spoke of her “ serious concerns ” that the deal would reduce choice and lead to higher prices .
It does not help that Oracle seems in no mood to compromise .
A meeting in October between Safra Catz , Oracle 's president , and Ms Kroes did not dispel her fears of the American firm 's unwillingness to make concessions .
Ms Kroes let it be known that during the meeting she had expressed “ her disappointment that Oracle had failed to produce , despite repeated requests , either hard evidence that there were no competition problems or a proposal for a remedy to the competition problems identified by the commission ” .
Even though the commission has now made official its objections to the merger , Oracle is unlikely to cave in .
On the contrary , it seems prepared for a fight with regulators in Brussels .
“ The Commission 's Statement of Objections ” , the firm wrote in a statement , “ reveals a profound misunderstanding of both database competition and open source dynamics .
It is well understood by those knowledgeable about open source software that because MySQL is open source , it can not be controlled by anyone .
That is the whole point of open source . ”
It is too early to tell how this stand - off will end .
The fact that the commission has issued a statement of objections does not mean that it will inevitably block the deal .
Similarly , Oracle may agree to spin off MySQL after all — the remedy most likely to satisfy the commission in this case — to resolve the problem speedily .
As long as Sun remains in limbo , it is losing business to rivals such as Dell , HP and IBM .
Last week Sun reported that revenues in the quarter ending in September fell by 25 % .
And if the case drags on for too long , Sun may sink behind the horizon for good .

• LA Galaxy and USA striker to arrive early next month • ' Landon has pace and is a good finisher , ' says Moyes
Everton have signed the Los Angeles Galaxy forward Landon Donovan in a loan deal from January , the manager , David Moyes , has confirmed .
The agreement came on the day that the 27 - year - old player signed a four - year contract with his American club , who had made it known that they are willing for him to leave temporarily in the new year .
Moyes said : " Landon Donovan will join Everton .
It is all agreed and done now and hopefully he will be with us on January 1 or 2 .
" Hopefully he is the first of two or three we want to bring in in January .
We need to strengthen our squad to make sure we are not in a situation like we have at the moment with so many injuries .
" Landon will certainly add pace , he is a good finisher .
He was voted best player , yet again , in the American league and is captain of the USA national team .
" I need players who can hit the ground running , who I think can go into the team quite quickly and make an impact .
With his experience and the goals he has scored , I am hoping he will be able to do that . "
Donovan , who is keen to move to Europe to maintain his match fitness ahead of the World Cup next summer , said this week : " You want to go where you are wanted and Everton have been incredibly professional and expressed their interest and I feel that is a place where I would feel very comfortable . "
The Galaxy 's coach , Bruce Arena , said this week before the deal was finalised : " Everton is a club with a small roster and a congested schedule over the next few weeks and months .
It 's a great fit for Landon and the clubs have an understanding of the agreement . "

OK , this factoid is just San Diego , one of the epicenters of the housing implosion .
But the flip side is conventional wisdom is that the worst hit locales are bottoming first …. right ?
Maybe not .
Again , generalizing based on one data point is not advisable , but this one is so striking that I ca n’t help but think that even a much lesser version of this pattern elsewhere would mean housing has a ways to go on the downside .
That would be consistent with historic norms , since per Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff , in severe financial crises , real estate takes over five years from its peak ( which in our case was 2Q 2006 ) to hit the trough .
And this is the year when Option ARMs hit the wall in a big way too …
From Rich Toscano :
…. there were 19,453 San Diego homes that were in foreclosure but that were not yet listed for sale … .
There are currently 11,976 homes listed for sale in San Diego .
If all the shadow inventory were to hit the market , inventory would increase by 162 percent to 31,429 .
The 11,976 figure in the prior bullet includes active inventory as well as inventory that is marked “ contingent , ” meaning that the property is a short sale or the like that has an accepted offer that is awaiting lender approval ( thus , the property is not really available for sale ) .
Using only the active inventory of 7,964 homes , shadow inventory would swell the number of homes for sale by 244 percent .
Using the average number of sales over the past year , releasing the shadow inventory into the wild would add 7.3 months ’ worth of inventory .
By comparison , in November there were 4.6 months of inventory if you count both active and contingent homes , and only 3.0 months if you count just active listings .
So adding all that shadow inventory would increase the number of homes actively for sale from 3 months ’ worth to 10.3 months ’ worth — more than a three - fold increase .
Yves here .
So it may be that the working of the excesses in the worst hit markets is considerably overstated .

Some Debt - Laden Graduates Wonder Why They Bothered With College Some experts say students might be better off getting a job after high school .
Jan. 16 , 2009  --
It 's the American way to try to make as much money as possible .
And it 's said that the way to earn more is to get the best education you can afford .
But in today 's economy , where so many overqualified people are competing for fewer jobs , the promise of a big payoff from a college diploma can be misleading .
For some students such as Rachele Percell , it has turned out to be a total disappointment .
She 's the first one in her family to go to college and said she 'll probably be the last .
Earlier this month , struggling to make ends meet , Percell moved out of her New Hampshire apartment and is upset about taking a step back .
" I did n't plan to go move back in with my mother , " she said .
" I feel like I have to sponge off my family now . "
Percell never dreamed that this is what would happen after she graduated from college .
She grew up hearing that education pays .
A government study once claimed that a bachelor 's degree was worth $ 1 million over a lifetime .
Even political figures like Hillary Clinton were touting the benefits of a college degree .
So Percell borrowed enough money to pay about $ 24,000 a year to attend Rivier College in Nashua , N.H.
She 's about $ 85,000 in debt .
" I was told just to take out the loans and get the degree , " she said , " because when you graduate , you 're going to be able to get that good job and pay them off , no problem . "
But for three years , Percell has struggled to find a job with her degree in human development .
And the recession has made her search even tougher .
To pay the bills , she took a low - level desk job with an insurance company , doing work she says she could have done straight out of high school .
When asked if going to college was worth it , she replied with an emphatic " No . "
" Because now I have this huge amount of debt , and there 's no way I 'll be able to pay it off , " she said .
Rivier College said via e-mail that Percell 's situation is " unfortunate " and that many of its graduates have launched successful careers .
But many students now say the business about college earning you $ 1 million more is an empty promise .
' I Feel Like a Loser '
Like most students , Kris Alfred was repeatedly told in high school that everyone goes to college .
Alfred said he owes more than $ 125,000 for his degrees in theater when he's not even working in that field .
" I work at a call center , and I make $ 10 an hour , " he said .
" It 's surreal .
I feel like a loser . "
Walter Rowland got a degree in meteorology and now owes $ 77,000 in student loans .
" College was a rip - off and nothing against , you know , my college or my professors , but I was misinformed , " he said .
" You 're led down this path of needing to go to college , " he continued .
" The college diploma is the new high school diploma . "
Personal finance guru Suze Orman says college is a no - brainer for kids who can be lawyers and doctors .
But she says that in this economy , many others should reassess the value of a generic bachelor 's degree .
She believes it ultimately might not be worth it .
Orman said it 's often smarter to acquire specific marketable skills at a community college , a technical school or by working as an apprentice for a business , making yourself more employable without piling up a mountain of debt .
" I would rather see a child go to a community college , knowing that they can go out there , get a job and not be crushed under the burden of a prestigious degree , " she said .
Marty Nemko , an education consultant and career counselor , said he believes the bachelor 's degree is America 's most overrated product .
Nemko is one of many who says there are some ugly statistics the education establishment does n't like to talk about .
" The sticker price of colleges has gone up well over the rate of inflation , for decades , " he said .
Indeed , if the price of gas had grown as much as the cost of a bachelor 's degree since 1980 , drivers would be filling up today for about $ 7.50 per gallon .
Nemko said tuition money gets funneled into fancy facilities to lure students who do n't question the long - term value of what they 're paying for , things like rock - climbing walls , golf courses and maid services in dorms .
" Stop with these enormous country club college campuses , " he said .
" They are robbing people who ca n't afford it . "
But what about that $ 1 million bonus for getting a bachelor 's degree ?
" There could be no more misleading statistic that I could possibly tell you about , " he said .
Misleading , Nemko said , because it includes superearners , billionaire college grads who skew the average .
Additionally , he said , the students who attend college are already more likely to be successful than those who do n't .
Economics professor Sandy Baum , author of " Education Pays , " a College Board study promoting the advantages of higher education , said it is the education that makes the difference .
" On average , people benefit much more from going to college , " Baum said , agreeing that the $ 1 million figure is inaccurate .
Her study estimated that graduates gain half that .
Yet universities still throw around that $ 1 million estimate .
Arizona State University recently used it to justify a tuition hike .
Above Average Pay Without a Degree
Rowland , Alfred and Percell are skeptical about the so - called college premium .
But at least they graduated .
Others are not so fortunate .
" If you 're in the bottom 40 percent of your high school class -- and today , colleges are recruiting lots of those kids -- you have a very small chance of graduating , even if you are given 8 ½ years , " career expert Nemko said .
" And the immoral thing about it is that the colleges do not disclose that . "
Economist Baum said , " We should make that information more available .
But the reality is that even if you have some college and you do n't graduate , it still pays off in the labor market . "
For some kids , that is a gamble they 'd rather not take .
Carl Wunche High School outside Houston lets kids choose among dozens of technical education programs , from emergency medical technician training to training in crime scene investigation .
This training qualifies them for real - world jobs , without the time and money required for a four - year degree .
It 's worth a thought .
Electricians , on average , make about $ 48,000 a year ; plumbers , about $ 47,000 and paralegals , about $ 47,000 .
All these jobs pay above the national average and none require a bachelor 's degree .
Steven Eilers went through the automotive program and then worked as an apprentice in a car repair center .
He is already earning more than the average American , and he does n't have any student loan debt .
" More people need to realize that you do n't have to get a four - year degree to be successful , " he said
At a time when white - collar jobs are vanishing every month , the automotive repair industry actually added jobs last year .
Alfred , the theater graduate , said he was n't surprised .
" The friends I know that have jobs , secure jobs , they never went to college , " he said .
Rivier College recommended that Percell contact its career development office .
But what if she could do it all over again ?
" I probably would have gone to a trade school for hairdressing , " she said .
" It 's about $ 11,000 and I 'd probably be making better money . "
Friday November 27th , over 1,2 million Norwegians watched parts of « Bergensbanen » on NRK2 .
The longest documentary ever ?
At least the longest we have made , almost 7 1/2 hours , showing every minute of the scenic train ride between Bergen on the Norwegian west coast , crossing the mountains to the capital of Oslo .
Bergensbanen is 100 years in 2009 , and the documentary was a wild idea from NRK staff that came through , and was , surprisingly , a big success .
On Twitter , this became the thing to talk about in Norway .
Over 1 000 tweets with # bergensbanen were posted , and even more when we ran the program again two days later .
Norwegian version – see « Bergensbanen – klar for avgang »
Now we want to give the material to our viewers , the whole thing , for download .
The documentary had picture - in - picture clips with videos about Bergensbanen , a reporter interviewing people on the train , music and two cameras pointing to the sides of the train .
Because of rights , we had to remove the music and many videoclips , so we decided to make a clean front camera version for this download .
It ’s recorded on a Sony 700 camera in XDCAM HD 1080 50i .
The camera has a 30 seconds buffer , making it possible to switch disks when needed .
So we have a continuous recording of 7 hours .
Bittorrent
The original file was 165 GB , too much for most people to download .
We coded a 720 50P , 1280 ×720 version , resulting in a 22 GB file .
You need a filesystem on your drive that takes files bigger than 4 GB .
Most external drives have a FAT32 filesystem , which has a limit of 4 GB .
NTFS and HFS + works fine .
Download the torrentfile here .
Update :
The original HD - file is now out
We have published a HUGE 246 GB file .
The article describing it is only in Norwegian , but the basics are :
It ’s an Apple ProRes file , it ’s 246 GB and the adress to the torrentfile is :

What would you recommend to a complete alien to do on Earth , between his birth and his death ?
Suppose you ’re going to meet a tiny little green man , who will naively ask you : “ Hey , mate , what ’s the thing with this Earth ? ” .
What are the 25 things that would create for him an unforgettable , yet totally customized ( as in specific to you , and only you ) experience ?
I know you ’re used to much bigger lists on my blog , but this one is different .
Its ’ not a blogging challenge , nor a method to stretch my writing skills .
It ’s just an honest transcription of the answers to the question : “ what do you want to do in your life ? ” .
It may not be spectacular at all , but it is for real .
It may not be complete , but you are here to give me more hints .
It may not be the only list of things to do in your life on the Internet , but it ’s mine .
And you can grow your own list from it too .
Here ’s what I ’d say it ’s worth doing between birth and death to a complete alien who just arrived here on Earth :
1. Fall in Love
As often as you can .
Experience the abandon of yourself in front of something bigger than you and the object of your love altogether .
Do n’t actively look for it , but merely be prepared to receive it when it finds you .
2. Climb a Mountain
Everest will be fine .
Of course , if you ca n’t do Everest , any mountain will do .
Did it a few times and every time I descended I left a small part of me on that desert plateau .
Now all I want is to get back again and rejoin it .
3. Make a Million Dollars
And spend it all .
Did both and felt good .
For me , this was the best way to get rid of the “ money as a number ” obsession .
After you did this once , things will look very different .
You ’ll never be afraid of having and spending money .
4. Go Round the World by Plane
Did that too .
Bucharest – Rome – Las Vegas – Los Angeles – Auckland – Bangkok – Vienna – Bucharest .
Spent more than 45 hours in planes in less than 2 weeks but although I was tired as hell , it felt incredibly rewarding .
The world is really small .
5. Fish with Your Bare Hands
Did this when I was a child , in a village in the middle of Romania .
My parents used to leave me for the summer at my grand parents house , which was near a creek , 20 cm deep at most .
We used to block one of the creek ’s ways with sand , and while the other one was slowly drying we were picking small fish with our bare hands .
6. Learn a Foreign Language
Or maybe two or three .
Try to depict the world for a few weeks using the new words you learned .
In a magical way the world will be enriched just because you describe it in a different way .
It ’s like you re-create it every time you talk about it using different words in a different language .
7. Sail across the Ocean
Did n’t do it .
Yet .
But I ’d love to be on a boat sailing across the Oceans .
Waking up each day only to see the infinite water stretching in front of my eyes .
Experiencing the bare confrontation with something hugely more powerful than me , yet able to become my ally .
8. Start Your Own Business
Like an outlet for doing more of what you want and creating more of what you love .
I did it out of curiosity 10 years ago and still enjoying the benefits .
It ’s not only about being your own boss ( although it feels incredibly good 🙂 ) but about taking more responsibility .
9. Have Kids
And raise them .
It ’s not what you can teach them , but mostly what you can learn from your kids .
It seems that somehow along the way we lose the ability to enjoy life the way we used to .
Kids are here to remind us that we ’re here to enjoy life .
Together .
10 . Build a House
If it ’s yours , even better .
Building a house is a powerful maturity test .
It ’s far more difficult than it seems and it really changes some of your internal values .
Did n’t do that yet , only witnessing it at some of my friends , but definitely something I want to do in this lifetime .
11 . Take a Year Off from Work
I think they call this sabbatical .
I did this after I sold my business , last year .
Well , it was n’t technically a year without work at all , because I started and maintained this blog .
But since I do n’t really call this work , I think it will do .
Your entire life perspective shifts after one year off the hook .
12 . Get Married
And the moment you do n’t like it anymore , get a divorce .
The way humankind is working nowadays , marriage is still a key type of relationship .
Even if you crave for a much more open type of interaction , you ca n’t really get all its benefits until you experience all the joys and sorrows of marriage .
13 . Write a Book
Any type of book .
Whatever you feel the need to share .
May be an ebook if you do n’t have the time or resources to go for a printed one , but I think everybody should write a book in his lifetime .
If only to let other people that he really lived and how .
14 . Run a Marathon
Did n’t do this yet , but I crave for it .
I do n’t know why , but I feel like this is an important body milestone .
Pushing the limits over what you think you can do , knowing that you did it .
15 . Share a Dream with Somebody
Maybe it ’s a house you want to build with your partner .
Or traveling the world together .
Whatever it is , if it ’s a shared dream is really worth striving for it , even if – or especially if – it ’s for your entire lifetime .
Shared dreams are most of the time at the roots of our physical reality .
16 . Completely Change Your Career
At least once .
I did it twice so far , going from being a radio anchor to being an online entrepreneur and then a full time blogger .
Do n’t spend your precious time in the same boring job until you die , it ’s not worth it .
Yes , there is risk involved .
Which is great !
17 . Help a Completely Unknown Person
Have you ever thought how it is to go to someone you never met and help him ?
Sometimes without even letting him know ?
This is what I call an anonymous random act of kindness and I ’ve done it more than once .
Mostly for how it made me feel , I admit .
18 . Do n’t Talk for a Week
I did n’t do this but I want to do it .
We ’ve been trained to talk so much that we ca n’t rejoice silence anymore .
Somehow , we replaced the unbiased , direct experience of life with second hand experiences through words .
A week of silence should at least make the speaking fun again after you finish it .
19 . Attend a Funeral
When I first attended a funeral I was too little so I did n’t quite understand what was going on .
Only after I grasped some of the concepts of what we generally call death , I was able to fully understand it .
It ’s a celebration , not a mourning .
This is why Zorba dances at funerals .
20 . Live in a Complete Foreign Country for at Least a Week
Did that when I spent 7 days in Japan , without knowing the language and almost without anybody around speaking English .
After all the frustration was gone it proved to be an incredible experience .
We can interact and live in so many ways without spoken language and beyond it .
21 . Plant a Tree
Did it so many times when I was a kid and was spending my summers at my grandparents in the country side .
Did it again when I moved into a new house a few years ago .
It ’s like making a two - ways gift : you allow a life form to exist while receiving all the benefits of its existence .
22 . Write a Poem
It ’s not about literature here , no need to inspire millions with your words ( but if it happens to do that , even better ) .
Just let them flow through your soul and speak your feelings .
When I was in my last year of college I wrote several hundreds poems but never showed them to anyone .
23 . Climb the Highest Point in Your City
I do n’t know why , but I ’m addicted to this one .
Everywhere I travel I look for the highest point and go there : Paris , Auckland , Tokyo , Vienna , Prague , they all have a tower structure .
It gives me a fantastic feeling of freedom and “ everything is possible ” when I look at the cities from above .
24 . Lose a Battle
Let go of something really important for you .
It might be a person you love , or a thing you ’re hanging on .
Just let it flow away and continue to live your life .
It will help you understand that your existence is not confined within the boundaries of a single person or a single thing .
25 . Swim with the Dolphins
Did n’t do it yet , but I ’m obsessed with dolphins .
There is an unspeakable feeling of being free and at the same time shared in another dimension in this image , that I can almost get the shivers only by thinking at it .
I also think it would become some sort of addiction once I ’ll get to it .
What are your 25 things ?
What would you absolutely , unreservedly and unconditionally would want to do in your lifetime ? Â
Why ?
Share those dreams here , in the comments , or on your own blog .
Just link back so I can discover you .
If you dream about something , let it out and dare do make it real .
Canada —yes , Canada — is threatening the world ’s future , according to climate change experts , by emerging as the major obstacle to an agreement at the Copenhagen climate change summit .
Canada removed itself from the Kyoto protocol as its greenhouse - gas emissions rose 26 percent between 1990 and 2007 — it was to have cut them by 6 percent — and its massive tar - sand oil fields in Alberta have been deemed a global - warming disaster .
Is peaceful , liberal Canada really an evil , “ criminally negligent ” polluter ?
( Watch a panel discuss Canada 's reluctance to join climate change efforts )
Canada is downright villainous : I used to believe the U.S. was doing the most to “ sabotage a new climate change agreement , ” says George Monbiot in the London Guardian .
“ I was wrong . ” Canada has turned into a “ thuggish petro- state , ” destroying a “ pristine ” area the size of England to cash in on the “ dirtiest commodity known to man . ”
We ca n't let the corrupt " tar barons of Alberta " scupper Copenhagen .
“ Canada ... is now to climate what Japan is to whaling ”
Canada is n’t evil , just reactionary : Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s “ wait - and - see - what - the - U.S. - does stance ” on climate change , says James McKinnon in Canadian Money Magazine , has helped make Canada a top global “ laggard . ”
But Canada ’s domestic policy is “ reactionary , ” too .
Climate change is already changing Canada , and Harper ’s “ leading from behind ” policies will leave us going nowhere fast on melting permafrost roads .
“ What are Canada ’s intentions at Copenhagen conference on climate change ? ”
Comparatively , Canada is harmless :
Get real — oil sands account for " less than one - tenth of 1 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions , " says Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach in the Toronto Star .
And Alberta ’s oil fields have “ contributed mightily ” to Canada ’s prosperity .
Besides , if we need a carbon villain , 80 percent of emissions from a barrel of oil “ come from the end use — the tailpipe . ”
“ Oil - sands hysteria only confuses climate debate ”

This book provides a broad and applications - oriented introduction to electromagnetic waves and antennas , with MATLAB examples .
Current interest in these areas is driven by the growth in wireless and fiber - optic communications , information technology , and materials science .
Communications , antenna , radar , and microwave engineers must deal with the generation , transmission , and reception of electromagnetic waves .
Device engineers working on ever - smaller integrated circuits and at ever higher frequencies must take into account wave propagation effects at the chip and circuit - board levels .
Communication and computer network engineers routinely use waveguiding systems , such as transmission lines and optical fibers .
Novel recent developments in materials , such as photonic bandgap structures , omnidirectional dielectric mirrors , birefringent multilayer films , surface plasmons , negative - index metamaterials , slow and fast light , promise a revolution in the control and manipulation of light and other applications .
These are just some examples of topics discussed in this book .
The book is organized around three main topic areas :
The propagation , reflection , and transmission of plane waves , and the analysis and design of multilayer films .
Waveguiding systems , including metallic , dielectric , and surface waveguides , transmission lines , impedance matching , and S - parameters .
Linear and aperture antennas , scalar and vector diffraction theory , plane - wave spectrum , Fourier optics , superdirectivity and superresolution concepts , antenna array design , numerical methods in antennas , and coupled antennas .

The book is also available in print - on - demand form .
Because of printer limitations , the book has been evenly split into two volumes , each with its own index , but with the list of references and appendices included only in volume two .
The following versions are available :
The text makes extensive use of MATLAB .
We have developed an " Electromagnetic Waves & Antennas " toolbox containing about 200 MATLAB functions for carrying out all of the computations and simulation examples in the text .
Code segments illustrating the usage of these functions are found throughout the book , and serve as a user manual .
Our MATLAB - based numerical solutions are not meant to replace sophisticated commercial field solvers .
The inclusion of numerical methods was motivated by the desire to provide the reader with some simple tools for self - study and experimentation .
We felt that it would be useful and fun to be able to quickly carry out the computations illustrating various waves and antenna applications , and have included enough MATLAB code in each example ( but skipping all figure annotations ) that would enable the reader to reproduce the results .
The functions may be grouped into the following categories :
Design and analysis of multilayer film structures , including antireflection coatings , polarizers , omnidirectional mirrors , narrow - band transmission filters , birefringent multilayer films and giant birefringent optics .
Design of quarter - wavelength impedance transformers and other impedance matching methods , such as stub matching and L- , Pi- and T - section reactive matching networks .
Design and analysis of dielectric slab guides , plasmonic waveguides , Sommerfeld wires , and Goubau surface wave lines .
Design and analysis of transmission lines and waveguides , such as microstrip lines .
S - parameter functions for gain computations , Smith chart generation , stability , gain , and noise - figure circles , simultaneous conjugate matching , and microwave amplifier design .
Functions for the computation of directivities and gain patterns of linear antennas , such as dipole , vee , rhombic , and traveling - wave antennas , including functions for the input impedance of dipoles .
Aperture antenna functions for open - ended waveguides , and horn antenna design .
Functions for diffraction calculations , such as diffraction integrals , and knife - edge diffraction coefficients , Talbot effect , Bethe - Bouwkamp model .
One - and two - dimensional apodizer design for continuous aperture distributions , optimum prolate spheroidal wavefunction apodizers , Taylor 's one - parameter and n-bar one - dimensional distributions , and their two - dimensional versions .
Antenna array design functions for uniform , binomial , Dolph - Chebyshev , Taylor one - parameter and n-bar distributions , prolate arrays , Villeneuve arrays , sector - beam , multi-beam , Woodward - Lawson , and Butler arrays .
Functions for beamwidth and directivity calculations , and for steering and scanning .
Numerical methods for solving the Hallen and Pocklington integral equations for single and coupled antennas and computing self and mutual impedances .
Several functions for making azimuthal and polar plots of antenna and array gain patterns .
There are also several MATLAB movies showing the propagation of pulses in media with negative or superluminal group velocities , the propagation of step signals and pulses on terminated transmission lines , or propagating on cascaded lines , step signals getting reflected off reactive terminations , fault location by TDR , propagating crosstalk signals on coupled lines , and time - evolution of the field lines radiated by a dipole antenna .

Believe it or not , I love raw kale .
It is complex , savory , and stands up well to a hardcore salad dressing .
It took me a long time to get used to the taste of raw kale , but luckily there are a couple restaurants here in Austin that have amazing raw kale salads .
The trick to raw kale is that you have to make it wilt a little bit .
Something about massaging it with salad dressing really tames the taste and texture .
Why should you even bother with a raw kale salad ?
Well , besides it being tasty , it 's one of the healthiest things you can eat .
Kale is very dense in nutrients and thought to protect you from cancer and heart disease .
Kale Caesar Salad
One small bunch kale ( about six inch long pieces )
1/4 cup cashews
1/4 cup sunflower seeds
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon spicy mustard
one clove garlic
pinch salt
Slice the kale into small ribbons and set aside .
Combine remaining ingredients in the food processor and process until smooth .
Mix the kale and dressing together in a large bowl .
Take a few minutes to massage the dressing into the kale .
Serve immediately or refrigerate .
Variations :
Add any of your favorite vegetables to this salad , or top with whole grain croutons .
Just how dumb do they think we are ?
Since it shocked no one , and I got in plenty of cheap shots yesterday , I was n’t going to write again about Mark McGwire ’s half - assed admission that he used steroids during his playing days in Oakland and St. Louis .
But given the Ari Fleischer - fueled spin machine ( seriously , that ’s who he hired ) that keeps foisting miserable Tony LaRussa on us , I think we need to take a good look at McGwire ’s performance last night on MLB Network with Bob Costas .
There was McGwire blubbering openly on camera like Rod Tidwell talking to Roy Firestone at the end of “ Jerry Maguire . ”
Â
This was clearly a man who regrets something –or at least a man who wants to pretend to really regret something .
The first thing you noticed is that he appears to have added an extra deck of forehead in the last decade .
Â
I mean he always had a big head , but this thing is so long now you expected him to start insisting he was from France , shotgun some dry Tang and a six pack and have Costas lob wreaths at his head .
McGwire kept crying and Costas kept fidgeting with the phone book he was sitting on , and the interview was headed nowhere fast .
Finally , we got some juicy details .
Â
At last it can be said without dispute that Tony LaRussa did n’t know that McGwire had used steroids until yesterday .
Holy shit , just how dumb do these people think we are ?
That was just the beginning of the absurdity .
McGwire claimed his family did n’t know until yesterday , either , and they never asked Mark if he ’d used .
Â
This list apparently includes his parents , his mutant son from his first marriage , his two kids from his current marriage ( and we learned that not only are they pompously named Max and Mason , but that Mark does n’t know which one is which ) , both wives ( including the current one , a central Illinois “ beauty ” ) and his brothers .
Â
Well , not Jay , because he ’d been giving Mark steroids for 20 years .
Â
But other than him , nobody knew .
Â
And nobody asked , even when Jay started trying to sell a book of his tales of sticking needles into his brother ’s ass .
Â
Similarly , my brother is shopping a tell - all book about me based around the time he and my sister convinced me at a restaurant that a lemon wedge was an orange .
Â
I was three , so I ate it .
Â ( Actually I was 33 , but let ’s move on .
Â
I ’m not here to talk about the past . )
McGwire continued his tortured logic from his statement earlier in the day .
Â
He only used steroids to recover quicker from injuries , and he suffered injuries because of the steroids .
Â
So the steroids caused injuries that he then had to take steroids to heal from ? Â
My brain is quivering .
He said he used steroids off and on for a decade , but has no idea what he took .
Â
This is my favorite part .
Â
This idea that a guy who worked out like a fiend was just randomly injecting things –though he said he preferred oral , and who does n’t ?
–into his ass ?
Â George Michael is more discrete than this –not the Sports Machine guy , the other one .
Â
This is the beginning of the Fleischer - LaRussa - McGwire plan that hinges on baseball fans being complete dopes .
McGwire insisted that the only reason he started using steroids was because of the chronic injuries ( which he implies were caused by the steroid use , remember ? ) .
Â
He says that teammates would walk by his locker and mock him by saying , “ He ’s injured again . ” Â Chances are that ’s not the worst of what they were saying .
Â
“ For a guy whose dad is a dentist , you ’d think he ’d have better breath . ” Â “ What does he shave with , a Garden Weasel ? ” Â “ His brother ’s a shitty quarterback ! ”
He said that the “ Man Upstairs ” had given him great hand / eye coordination and the ability to hit a baseball .
Â
It was n’t until later on last night that we found out that he was referring to Balco founder Victor Conte who was watching the broadcast from the second floor living room .
Costas asked him if he could have kept up a home run ratio better than Babe Ruth ’s while hitting 70 homers in 1998 without using steroids .
Â McGwire amazingly and preposterously said he could have .Â
He said it with a straight face .
Â
Well , as straight a face as a man can make when he ’s crying like a three year old and is apparently having a stroke .
McGwire said that there is n’t a pill or an injection that can hit a baseball .
Â
This statement caused Kenny Williams to throw things at his TV , and call Billy Beane to try to call off their recently agreed upon trade of Mark Bueherle for the 60 count bottle of Vicodin that Kenny was going to have DH for the Sox this season .
Throughout the interview McGwire said that he was sorry he made a “ mistake ” by using steroids .
Â
A mistake is going on a date to Chili’s and deciding to have sex with Tyna Robertson in your car instead of just having the brownie sundae .
Â
Taking steroids for a decade is n’t quite the same thing .
So McGwire continued to insist ( amazingly ) that the steroids were not making him a better player .
Â
All they were doing was allowing him to heal his body so he could play , because his gift from the “ Man Upstairs ” was being taken away by these injuries .
Â
Set aside the part that is completely wrong ( people use steroids because they work ) and you ’re left with his absurd and confused claim that he only used steroids because they were so recuperative .
Â
And how would he have thought that ?
Â
Because people use steroids to recover more quickly from their workouts ?
Â ( Ding , ding , ding ! )
McGwire went into an explanation about how he shortened his swing and made himself a better hitter .
Â
It ’s almost like he was freakishly strong that he did n’t need to take a full swing to hit the ball an absurd distance , thereby making it easier to hit .
Â Hmm.Â
I wonder if there are pills or injections that would allow you to boost your strength in such a way ?
This gets to the most important part of the Fleischer - LaRussa - McGwire Plan of Obfuscation .
Â
They will argue over and over and over and over and over again that McGwire ’s great home run accomplishments were the product of him being the “ hardest working man in baseball . ”
Â
They will ignore the fact that the reason guys like McGwire and Sammy Sosa and Barry Bonds and Ken Caminiti and Roger Clemens used steroids was because they would allow them to recover from their workouts so that they could continue working out at a completely unnatural rate , giving them unnatural gains in strength not only in the amount of strength , but in the time it took to achieve that strength .
Â
In short , if McGwire ’s greatest attribute was his ability to workout really hard and take lots of extra batting practice , then that greatest attribute can be directly tied to his use of steroids .
McGwire then decided he ’d use the argument that he did n’t take a “ lot ” of steroids .
Â
“ The steroids I did were on a very , very low dosage .
I did n’t want to take a lot of that .
I did n’t want to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger or Lou Ferrigno . ”
Â
We do n’t believe that , because that ’s exactly what you did look like .
Â
You were ridiculously overblown .
Â
Your enormous growth is what fueled the speculation in the first place , that and a back that looked like a Petri dish .
Let ’s establish the fact that McGwire feels that he would have hit 70 homers in 1998 without steroids .
Â
He ’s still clinging to the life raft made of bullshit about bat speed and genetics and hand - eye coordination that the “ Man Upstairs ” had given him .
Â
So Costas asks him if he has talked to anyone in the Maris family .
Â
You remember the Marises , right ?
Â
Their dad broke Babe Ruth ’s single season home run record in 1961 .Â
He had to deal with his own fans rooting against him that season because they did n’t think he was a “ true ” Yankee , and that if anybody was going to break the Babe ’s record it was the alcoholic , sex addict they had in centerfield .
Â
The stress of the chase and the fan reaction caused Maris to suffer ulcers and his hair started falling out .
Â
After Maris broke the record , he had to deal with the Commissioner of Baseball , Ford Frick ( almost as big of a delusional douchebag as current Interim - Commissioner - For - Life - And - Used - Car- Salesman Bud Selig ) declaring an asterisk ( or “ asterick ” if you are Katie Couric ) be placed on the record because the season was eight games longer in 1961 than it was in 1927 when the Babe set the record .
Â
Frick did n’t bother to put an asterisk next to the Babe ’s noting that he played at a time when blacks and Latin Americans were n’t allowed to play .
Â
You probably also remember that McGwire did all kinds of phony bullshit during the home run record chase , like fondle the bat ( on loan from the Hall of Fame ) that Maris had hit 61 with , and he played nice with the Maris family and told them how much he admired their father .
Â
He was doing all of this while injecting steroids into his body to combat an injury that apparently did n’t exist in 1998 .Â
OK , so now Costas has asked him if he has talked to any of the Marises since he announced he ’d used steroids .
Â McGwire said he had called Roger ’s widow , Pat . Â
“ She was disappointed and she has every right to be .
I could n’t tell her how so sorry I was . ” Â
What the hell are you sorry for ?
Â
You claim that you would have hit those 70 homers anyway .
Â
You claim that steroids do n’t hit baseballs , and that they had nothing to do with any of your homers .
Â
What are you apologizing for ?Â
And on top of that , why are you crying ?
Â
What is the matter with you ?
Â
Were you injecting Winstrol or estrogen ? Â
Suck it up , man . Â
Grow a pair !Â
( Actually , given some of the side effects of prolonged steroid use , you might literally need a pair , because yours might be gone . )
Then , Costas confronts McGwire about the claims in Jose Canseco ’s Pulitzer Prize winning book “ Juiced ” that the “ Bash Brothers ” injected each other with steroids in a bathroom stall at the Oakland Coliseum .
Â McGwire denies it and among his reasons says that two big guys wearing spikes would have made “ too much noise . ” Â
Yeah , because if you ’d made noise , maybe your holier than thou manager , Tony LaRussa would have found out !
Costas asked McGwire when Tony found out and McGwire says he told him that morning .
Â
Does anybody really believe this at all ?
Â
How arrogant are the Fleischer - LaRussa - McGwire cabal , that they think anyone would actually believe that Tony LaRussa has n’t known that guys on his teams have been juicing since the mid 1980s ?
Â
No manager has benefited more from the rampant use of steroids and other performance enhancing drugs ( and continues to ) than Tony LaRussa .
Â Dusty Baker and Joe Torre are certainly in the team picture , but Tony ’s the captain of this ship .
Â LaRussa says that he did n’t know , just that his amateur strength coach / first base coach Dave MacKay , started the guys on weightlifting regimens during the 80s in Oakland and the team benefited from that “ advantage . ”
Â
Oh , there was an advantage , all right .
This makes you wonder exactly when McGwire started using steroids .
Â
He claims he used it “ briefly in 1989 . ” Â
He had n’t suffered any serious injuries to that point .
Â
Since his rookie year of 1987 he had played in 151 , 155 and 143 games .
Â
He was hitting homers for sure , he hit 49 , then 32 , then 33 , but his 1989 season was n’t a particularly good one .
Â
He only had 50 extra base hits total , and he hit a woeful .231. Â
And he was watching Canseco juice and not bother to hide it and go 40 - 40 and hit for average and lots of power .
Â McGwire did n’t start dabbling in steroids in 1989 because he was physically hurt .
Â
No , his pride was hurt .
Â
He was a homer or nothing sideshow on a really good team .
Â
Then he had even worse seasons in 1990 ( .235 average ) and 1991 ( .201 ! ) Â
Now he was just the weird looking redhead with the freckles and the bad complexion .
Â
So he took some steroids , buffed up , moved the zits from his face to his back and started his life of baseball deviance .
Â
It worked !Â
He hit .265 with 42 homers in 1992 and he started to look freakishly big .
Â
Then his body broke down and he played only 74 games combined in 1992 and 1993 .Â
His baseball career looked like it was over .
Â
All of the benefits he ’d gotten in 1991 from ‘ roiding up had caused him to break down in the next two seasons .
Â
He ’d gotten too big , too fast .
Â
His tendons could n’t handle the freakish muscle mass gain .
Â
So that ’s when he lost a lot of weight and got healthy ?
Wrong .Â
He got bigger .
Â
His body finally caught up and could support his freakishness .
Â
He played 104 games in the strike shortened 1995 season and hit 39 homers .
Â
He hit 52 in only 130 games in 1996 .Â
He was a complete freak show now .
Â
And if his body was so ravaged that he had to ‘ roid up just to stay on the field , why did he end up in St. Louis in July of 1997 ?
Â
Should n’t he have been looking to stick to the AL when he could DH and rest his aching body ?
Â
Not only did he accept a trade to St. Louis ( and a reunion with LaRussa and McKay ) but he re-signed there long term .
He hit 58 homers in 1997 including 24 in only 51 games in St. Louis .
Â McKay must have hooked up with the good stuff by then .
Â
Not that McGwire would know what it was called .
Then we got to the best part of the interview .
Â Words that Mark McGwire does n’t understand !
Â
Costas asked him if the implementation of drug testing in 2003 “ hastened ” his retirement .
Â McGwire did n’t understand what the word meant .
Â
For a moment it looked like he was going to ask for Costas to use it in a sentence .
Â
Even though he just did .
Â
Not long after , when talking about his new role as hitting coach , McGwire said he had a “ Rolodex full of ideas to help guys hit . ” Â A Rolodex !Â
What ’s he going to do give the Cardinals ’ hitters the numbers of real hitting coaches who can help them ?
Costas asked McGwire about the Hall of Fame , and if McGwire feels he should be in it and McGwire said he did n’t know . Â
Here ’s your answer , Mark . Â No . Â
You might think that you were so good that you ’d have made it without using steroids , but you did n’t bother to find out .
Â
And you clearly were n’t good enough to get in .Â
If you needed steroids just to get on the field , then without them you ’d have been out of baseball long before you hit 583 homers .
Â
Or 400 for that matter .
Â
One of the steroids guys will get in , but it wo n’t be you and it wo n’t be Sammy .
Â
It ’ll be a guy that writers can pretend had done enough before they think he started using like Barry Bonds , or A - Rod or Roger Clemens . Â
It wo n’t be you .
Â
And you can say you do n’t care if you get in , but the fact that you refuse to acknowledge that you hit even one extra homer because of your steroid use , proves that you are clinging to that home run total as the thing you expect will get you into Cooperstown .
Costas asked McGwire what he ’ll tell Cardinals hitters about steroids .
Â McGwire ’s answer was “ That it ’s the stupidest thing I ever did . ” Â Come on , Mark . Â
Give them the real answer .
Â “ Keep on doing them . ” Â
That ’s the answer you give the Cardinals these days .
To their credit , the MLB Network panel that was on immediately after the interview did n’t let him off the hook .
Â Matt Vasgersian , Tom Verducci , Joe Magrane and Ken Rosenthal , all piled on McGwire for his ridiculous assertion that steroids did n’t make him a better player .
Â
However , over on ESPN Buster Olney and Tim Kurkjian could n’t get the knee pads on quickly enough to start guzzling with approval .
But the best was when ESPNEWS got Rick Sutcliffe on the phone and he said , “ They did a seminar at ESPN and we had experts come in and they talked about all of the advantages you get from steroids .
Â
Your muscles get bigger and stronger and quicker and even your eyesight improves , it ’s like twice as sharp .
Â
So for him to say they did n’t help is ridiculous . ”
Sutcliffe went on to say that he played the game with Ryne Sandberg and Andre Dawson and Cal Ripken and ( Tony LaRussa ’s favorite ) Ozzie Smith , and that it was a shame that baseball decided to ruin the context of those players ’ careers by allowing a 20 year sideshow of steroid use to go unchecked .
Â
( Well , he did n’t say it that succinctly , but he was sober , so there ’s that . )
LaRussa will continue to say that we have to forgive McGwire , but that it did n’t matter because he was such a hard worker and great person that he ’d have been great without steroids .
Even if it ’s all complete horseshit .
Eat it up , St. Louis .
Â
You are the only city in the world where this kind of asinine logic actually works .
What if you could drink endlessly and stay buzzed but never get sloppy ?
And what if you could then pop a pill to let you drive home sober ?
It sounds fantastical , but scientists are actually working on a synthetic alcohol substitute that brings all the happy feelings of being drunk without all the nasty mood swings , headaches , and addiction issues .
The alcohol substitute , which is being researched by a team at Imperial College London , will be made from Valium - like benzodiazepines .
While benzos furnishes drinkers with a feeling of wellbeing , they do n’t affect parts of the brain that control addiction and mood swings , and they ’re easy to flush out of the body ( no more nasty hangover cures ! ) .
Perhaps most intriguingly , the chemicals can be “ switched off ” with an antidote .
Eventually , researchers involved in the project envision a world where alcohol content in beer and wine is replaced with their synthetic substance .
Of course , it will take more than a research experiment to persuade people to give up traditional alcohol .
And who ’s to say that synthetic alcohol will have exactly the same positive effects as a bottle of Jack Daniels ?
If it does n’t , it will be a hard sell .
Thus far , drink companies have n’t shown interest in the product–a bad sign for synthetic alcohol ’s prospects .
Still , we ’re in support of anything that could cut down on the number of drunk drivers and alcohol - related accidents that happen every day .

In the conclusion of the IJBS study , researchers wrote :
.
In a study released by the International Journal of Biological Sciences , analyzing the effects of genetically modified foods on mammalian health , researchers found that agricultural giant Monsanto 's GM corn is linked to organ damage in rats .
According to the study , which was summarized by Adam Shake at Twilight Earth , " Three varieties of Monsanto 's GM corn - Mon 863 , insecticide - producing Mon 810 , and Roundup® herbicide - absorbing NK 603 - were approved for consumption by US , European and several other national food safety authorities . "
Monsanto gathered its own crude statistical data after conducting a 90 - day study , even though chronic problems can rarely be found after 90 days , and concluded that the corn was safe for consumption .
The stamp of approval may have been premature , however . , the two major diet detoxification organs , but in detail differed with each GM type .
In addition , some effects on heart , adrenal , spleen and blood cells were also frequently noted .
As there normally exists sex differences in liver and kidney metabolism , the highly statistically significant disturbances in the function of these organs , seen between male and female rats , cannot be dismissed as biologically insignificant as has been proposed by others .
We therefore conclude that our data strongly suggests that these GM maize varieties induce a state of hepatorenal toxicity .... These substances have never before been an integral part of the human or animal diet and therefore their health consequences for those who consume them , especially over long time periods are currently unknown . "
Monsanto has immediately responded to the study , stating that the research is " based on faulty analytical methods and reasoning and do not call into question the safety findings for these products . "
The IJBS study 's author Gilles - Eric Séralini responded to the Monsanto statement on the blog , Food Freedom , " Our study contradicts Monsanto conclusions because Monsanto systematically neglects significant health effects in mammals that are different in males and females eating GMOs , or not proportional to the dose .
This is a very serious mistake , dramatic for public health .
This is the major conclusion revealed by our work , the only careful reanalysis of Monsanto crude statistical data . " : Katherine Goldstein / Gazelle Emami Source : huffingtonpost.com
The ’ Berlin Wall ’ of the desert
On the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall Stefan Simanowitz reports from Western Sahara on the wall that has separated a nation for 29 years
Whilst the world is commemorating the fall of the Berlin Wall another less well - known wall that separates a nation and its people still stands tall .
At 1553 miles long , the wall that divides Western Sahara , is twelve times longer than the Berlin Wall and , having stood for 29 years , is now a year older than the Berlin Wall was when it was toppled .
Finally , some help with explaining Internet security to my non -geek friends !
The Guide to Scary Internet Stuff video series will hopefully make my life a little easier .
Explaining the intricacies of Internet security is a challenging task .
I often have difficulty explaining to my non-technical friends and relatives why they need to know about risks on the Internet .
On top of that , I sometimes discover that my advice has fallen on deaf ears as I inevitably fix their computers after a click on a spam or phishing link , or after they have not run Windows Update or updated their antivirus software in a while .
Although this is not the normal technical type of material that we post here on the Security Response blog , when Dominic Cook from our UK PR team showed me these , I immediately thought they were worth a post .
The animations are fun , but most of all I think my friends will understand them , remember some of the advice , and hopefully be safer online after watching them — although that remains to be seen . ;)
The videos cover all sorts of topics from botnets to viruses and everything in between .

Morris Davis , a retired Air Force colonel who was chief military prosecutor at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , showed courage and respect for democratic principles when he resigned rather than follow orders to use evidence obtained through torture .
We wish the Congressional Research Service would live up to Mr. Davis ’s example .
The service fired Mr. Davis after he wrote about how detainees should be tried .
On Nov. 11 , The Wall Street Journal published an opinion article in which he argued against the Obama administration ’s decision to try some detainees before military commissions and others in federal court .
The same day , The Washington Post ran a letter to the editor about the ability of federal courts to try detainees .
He wrote as a private citizen and did not mention his employer .
Later in the month , Mr. Davis was fired from his position as assistant director of the foreign affairs , defense and trade division , of the research service .
He was told that his writing violated its policies , showed poor judgment and interfered with the service ’s duty to remain objective and nonpartisan .
The American Civil Liberties Union , which is representing Mr. Davis , has called his firing a First Amendment violation and says it will sue if he is not reinstated .
A team of researchers from the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry , in Germany , led by the Spanish physicist Rubén Fernández - Busnadiego , has managed to obtain 3D images of the vesicles and filaments involved in communication between neurons .
The method is based on a novel technique in electron microscopy , which cools cells so quickly that their biological structures can be frozen while fully active .
" We used electron cryotomography , a new technique in microscopy based on ultra - fast freezing of cells , in order to study and obtain three - dimensional images of synapsis , the cellular structure in which the communication between neurons takes place in the brains of mammals " Rubén Fernández - Busnadiego , lead author of the study which features on the front cover of this month 's Journal of Cell Biology and a physicist at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry , in Germany , said .
During synapsis , a presynaptic cell ( emitter ) releases neurotransmitters to another post - synaptic one ( recipient ) , generating an electric impulse in it , thereby allowing nervous information to be transmitted .
During this study , the researchers focused on the tiny vesicles ( measuring around 40 nanometres in diameter ) , which transport and release the neurotransmitters from the presynaptic terminals .
" Thanks to the use of certain pharmacological treatments and the advanced 3D imaging analysis method we have developed , it is possible to observe the huge range of filamentous structures that are within the presynaptic terminal and interact directly with the synaptic vesicles , as well as to learn about their crucial role in responding to the electrical activity of the brain , " explains Fernández - Busnadiego .
The filaments connect the vesicles and also connect them with the active area , the part of the cellular membrane from which the neurotransmitters are released .
According to the Spanish physicist , these filamentous structures act as barriers that block the free movement of the vesicles , keeping them in their place until the electric impulse arrives , as well as determining the ease with which they will fuse with the membrane .
Sub -zero images
The technique upon which these discoveries are based , electron cryotomography , makes it possible to obtain three - dimensional images of the inside of cells and to minimise any changes to their structure .
This is possible because the cells are not fixed with chemical reagents , but are vitrified -- in other words they are frozen so fast that the water inside them does not have time to crystallise , and remains in solid state .
These samples , which are always maintained at liquid nitrogen temperatures ( below - 140 ºC ) , can be viewed using specially - equipped microscopes .
In addition , this method does not require any kind of additional staining , meaning the density of the biological structures can be observed directly .
Arteriovenous Malformations ( AVMs ) are a rare but potentially deadly tangle of blood vessels that can form in the brain .
Their cause is not completely understood but for some time now , scientists have suspected that there is a link between these formations and a specific protein called Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor–VEGF for short .
Dr. Robert Solomon , head of the Department of Neurological Surgery , Dr. E. Sander Connolly , from the Cerebrovascular Center , and colleagues looked at levels of this protein in the blood of 13 patients treated for AVM and found a surprising trend .
AVMs are unpredictable and usually are n’t found until they become symptomatic .
Unfortunately this is often after they hemorrhage and require emergency brain surgery .
Researchers continue to look for clues that will lead to earlier detection and cure , among these is the possible link to the growth factor VEGF .
VEGF is known to stimulate the formation of new blood vessels ( angiogenesis ) and under normal conditions this can be a good thing :
It helps our wounds heal , increases blood supply to muscles when we exercise , and can bypass a blocked blood vessel .
VEGF can be triggered under abnormal conditions too and this is not so good , most notably when a tumor becomes metastatic .
A number of studies have also shown increased levels of the protein associated with AVMs .
Based on these studies Dr. Solomon , Dr. Connolly , and their team hypothesized that levels of VEGF would be higher in the blood of their patients with AVMs and that those levels would decrease after treatment .
They took samples from thirteen patients treated at Columbia University Medical Center / NewYork - Presbyterian Hospital right before surgery , 24 hours after , and then 30 days later .
They compared these results to a control group of 29 back surgery patients ( without AVMs ) who were treated at the same hospital .
The surprising result was that the patients with the AVM had lower levels of VEGF than the control group to begin with .
After surgery the level dropped even further and then over the course of the next 30 days the level of VEGF rose and became equal to that of the control group .
One hyposthesis for this confounding result is that the AVM itself acts as a VEGF “ sink ” , re-routing the circulating VEGF out of the blood stream and focusing it locally at the site of the AVM .
This is confirmed by a number of other studies that show higher local levels of the protein in AVM tissue .
In any case , the researchers demonstrated that , though complicated , a relationship does exist between circulating levels of VEGF and the presence of AVM .
The exact cause and cure for AVM remains unsolved but this certainly offers an important clue .

N.B. The Nigel Slater bread recipe at the bottom of the column calls for 2 teaspoons table salt and NOT 1 1/2 tablespoons salt as mentioned .
HAPPY INDEPENDENCE BARBADOS !
One of my best friends loves bread .
Yes she is one of my tasters and enjoys the taste excursions I try to take her on , but when it comes right down to it , when I ask her what her favourite food is she will answer “ bread . ”
I decided to sit down with my friend ( I call her the Breadologist ) and find out more about this deep love she has for bread .
In other words , it was time for some Breadology 101 .
Click here to read more in this week 's column Personally , I am not a big fan of eating bread but I LOVE , LOVE , LOVE to bake all kinds of bread and share it with my friends .
When I make bread , I just have one or two slices ; with roti - just one and I am good .
Are you like that with certain foods too , where you love to make some things but do n't particularly enjoy having it regularly or none at all ?
You should see the long list of links I have bookmarked of breads to make :)
Call me crazy .
For me , I think it is about the skill and knowledge .
I like learning about new breads ( all kinds ) and I enjoy the challenge and thrill of making bread , watching them turn out well beyond my expectation and perfecting my skill .
I saw this yeasted flat bread , Saj Bread over at Cheesecakeforall last week and knew immediately that I had to make it .
OMG !
This bread ( which I think of more like a roti ) is very easy to make and the results thrill , for the Saj Bread is soft , tender , delicate and flexible .
As Maryam suggests , you can even use it as a wrap .
I made mine and had it with shrimp curry .
Try , this recipe , it will not disappoint .
Jim Lahey ( of No- Knead Bread fame ) has his book out , aptly titled : .
I 've ordered it and cannot wait to bake from it .
I saw his ( Potato Pizza ) recipe in the final edition of Gourmet and made it .
It 's a winner !
The crust , the topping , the flavour , the texture , all will have you going back for more .
Again , I am not a fan of pizza but this cheese - less , tomato sauce - less pizza is the kind that I can go for .
Hmmm , I 'm thinking smoked salmon ... You can find the recipe as published in the magazine here .
Do not cheat on the time for the potatoes to brine and follow the instructions of putting the topping right to the edge and even a little over , as the crust shrinks from the pan as it bakes .
I 'm definitely making this pizza again .
This weekend has been and continues to be quite a busy one , holiday - wise : Thanksgiving last Thursday , Eid-ul - Adha on Friday and then on Monday is Barbados 's Independence
Remorseless German boffins have come up with a solution to long recharge times for electric vehicles .
They propose the use of liquid - electrolyte batteries , so that a 'leccy car could have discharged electrolyte pumped out and replaced with fully - charged liquid at filling stations .
The proposals come from the Fraunhofer Institute for Chemical Technology ( ICT ) near Karlsruhe .
The engineers there suggest the use of a well - known technology known as a ' redox ' battery , in which two fluid electrolytes containing metal ions flow through porous graphite felt electrodes , separated by a membrane which allows protons to pass through it .
The Fraunhofer battery - boffins say that redox batteries have until now suffered from rubbish capacity compared to the li-ion units now being deployed in advanced electrocars , preventing their use .
But they say this has now been cracked .
" We can now increase the mileage four or fivefold , to approximately that of lithium - ion batteries , " said Jens Noack of the ICT .
" These batteries can be recharged at the gas station in a few minutes . "
Most electric vehicles now in service are actually powered by lead - acid batteries , but there are a few - for instance the Tesla Roadster - which use li-ion .
It 's generally thought that li-ion performance or something like it is the minimum that mainstream motorists of the future might accept , but as Noack says the crippling defect of this tech is the long recharge time .
Redox batteries could , by the sound of it , solve this problem - and solve it a bit more easily , perhaps , than alternative schemes where garages would have loads of massive , ready - charged - up , standardised li-ion batteries on hand waiting to be craned into vehicles in place of dead ones .
On the other hand there 's the promise of li-titanate batteries , with similar performance to ordinary li-ion but able to charge up in less than ten minutes from an industrial power outlet .
This would be more convenient still , and it 's apparently further down the road to commercialisation .
Noack 's kit may well be better , but there are dozens of examples from the history of technology to show that better does n't always win : and even the electric car itself has rivals in the race for the future of road transport . ®
Watching some liberal members of the House explain why they wo n’t do what ’s necessary , and pass the Senate bill , I was wondering what they imagine will happen .
Then the answer came to me : it ’s the Underpants Gnomes business plan .
In its original form this was :
1. Collect underpants .
2. ?????
3. Profit !
The current version is :
1. Reject the only bill that can be enacted any time soon .
2. ?????
3. Universal coverage !
Sigh .
Update : Some people have pointed out that Matt Yglesias used the gnomes in a recent post .
I did n’t see that ; I was stealing from Brad DeLong , who has been using the analogy for years .
Get fitted for bras .
No , seriously .
The Crab left a comment on GFE about how the underwires in her running bras leave welts , which caused me to have a dropped - jaw moment and immediately email her with the words " Dude : Your bras do n't fit .
Underwires should never leave welts . "
* And I 'm right .
Know how I know ?
Because I went to the local Dillard 's and asked for the ancient woman who 's worked in lingerie sales for eight hundred and fifty of her nine - hundred - plus years , and I got fitted for a variety of bras .
After that , I wandered through the Title Nine catalog and bought several different styles of bra in varying sizes .
When they arrived , I tried them on and sent back the ones that did n't feel good .
No chafe , no welts , no red marks -- even after an hour - and - a - half marathon with Attila .
Two years later , I had to do the same thing , because I 'd lost fifteen pounds .
My chest measurement has increased , but my cup size has decreased .
Again , I went to find Methusalette and get re-fitted , and again , I ordered various bras from T9 and tried them on , sending back the ones that were n't pitch - perfect .
Why go to all this trouble , you ask ?
Why not just wear the same 36 B you wore in high school ?
Because bras are just as important as good running or cross- training shoes .
They are pieces of equipment , especially the sports bras .
You 'd never tolerate downhill mountain biking or rollerblading without the proper safety equipment ; why not give your rack the same sort of treatment as your head and wrists ?
So what makes a good sports bra , and why are they so dadratted important ?
Let me answer the first question second and the second question first .
For those of us who are blessed ( ha ) with ample boobage , the reason for a good sports bra is obvious : running or hopping about with little to no support is painful .
There are ligaments in each of your girls called " Cooper 's ligaments " which can actually stretch or tear if you bounce around too much .
Never mind that that movement is distracting , both to you and to any onlookers .
A good sports bra can even enhance your workouts -- like if you 're doing heavy weightlifting and do n't have to worry about smashing your own breasts with a barbell .
For those of you who are lucky enough not to have to worry about knocking your eye out while running , there are other issues , like nipple chafing ( owie owie owie ) and even mastitis ( an inflammation of the tissue in the breast ) if you 're not properly supported .
Trust Auntie
Jo on this one : back in the day , when I was little more than an A cup , I ended up with a jolly case of mastitis because my running bra was too big and chafed like crazy .
Okay , so I 've convinced you to wear a good sports bra .
Define a " good sports bra " , then , you cry .
Okay !
I will !
For smaller - breasted women , a " good sports bra " is usually a compression - type , cotton - blend thing that has hooks in the back or pulls on over the head .
It spreads the breast tissue out over the chest wall , thus preventing movement , pain , and embarassment .
Some women of medium boobage swear by bras like Champion's , which have integrated underwires .
Bras for the small - chested are usually not the works of engineering that bras for the larger - chested are .
For women like me , who enter a room in stages , " engineering " is not too strong a word to use .
Underwires are pretty much mandatory for women with a C cup and up , with or without compression .
I wear bras that are " encapsulating " bras , which means that they hold each breast in a nonelastic cup , thus preventing both bounce and the figure - eight wiggle that comes from running .
Usually , sports bras for C cups and up have nonelastic straps over the shoulders and minimal stretch , if any , around the bottom of the cup .
There are bras out there , like T9's " Last Resort Bra " , that combine both a non-stretch fabric and rows of medieval - looking hooks to compress really big boobs , but I find those awfully restrictive .
No matter what size you wear , wicking and coolth are important .
Fit , though , is the thing that will make or break your experience .
For fit advice , you can go to places like Nordstrom's , Neiman's , or even Intimacy , which is a solely - bra - based chain store with branches in most large cities .
I would advise against going to Victoria 's Secret - - not because they 're bad at bra fitting , but because they size their bras so differently that their sizing only works with their bras .
( I do love their cotton bras for everyday wear , though .
Cheap and they wear like iron . )
Or you can do it yourself , or with the help of a friend , following instructions like these Whatever you do , when you go to buy your next workout underpinnings , try on several different styles in sizes that are a little bigger and a little smaller than what you 're sized as .
Bras vary as much as jeans do in sizing , if not more , and cut and style can make a huge difference .

Hackers calling themselves the " Iranian Cyber Army " paralysed China 's biggest search engine this morning , sparking a bizarre online battle as Chinese hackers apparently retaliated by targeting Iranian sites .
Last month the group attacked Twitter , which has been used by Iranian opposition supporters .
But Beijing and Tehran are allies and it was not immediately obvious why hackers targeted Baidu , which commands over 60 % of the search market in China .
Some Chinese internet users speculated that it might be in retaliation against Chinese Twitter users who have used a # CN4 Iran hashtag to express their support for reformists .
Although Twitter is blocked in China , it is used by several thousand people there through proxies or virtual private networks ( VPN ) .
" It 's the same warning showed to twitter.com … but I 'm not very sure how you would connect this to # CN4Iran .
Baidu is a very weird choice , " said Michael Anti , an influential Chinese blogger .
The search engine is widely regarded as having good relations with the Beijing government and has never been associated with sensitive content .
That led other internet users to speculate that foreign hackers were attempting to discredit Iran .
China 's state - run People 's Daily website reported that Baidu 's website began redirecting to a site attributed to the Iranian Cyber Army at around 8 am ( midnight GMT ) .
The People 's Daily site published a screen grab showing a message reading " This site has been hacked by the Iranian Cyber Army " , alongside a picture of the Iranian flag .
Other users said they could not open the Baidu site , but it was back up and running by around 11.30 am .
In a statement , the company said : " Services on Baidu 's main website www.baidu.com were interrupted today due to external manipulation of its DNS ( Domain Name Server ) in the US .
Baidu has been resolving this issue and the majority of services have been restored . "
As news of the attack spread , other hackers targeted Iranian websites .
On the room98.ir website , beneath a large Chinese flag , a message from the " Chinese Honker Team " read : " This morning your Iranian Cyber Army intrusion [ sic ] our baidu.com …
Please tell your so - called Iranian Cyber Army …
Do n't intrusion Chinese website about the United States authorities to intervene the internal affairs of Iran 's response …
This is a warning ! "
A message on the iribu.ir website read : " The People 's Republic of China long live … Oppose splitting Safeguarding unity . "
Other targets reportedly included the website of a national wrestling team .
" They seem to be choosing them randomly – the content is in Farsi , so they do n't necessarily know what they are , " said Anti .
Although the message left on Twitter by the Iranian Cyber Army suggested it was sympathetic to the government , experts told Reuters last month that it was unlikely Tehran was involved .

One market segment that will not catch fire from anything being done is the mid- to - high end ( MTH ) .
This is where the next crisis is building right now .
Only significant house price depreciation and sustained low rates can spur sustained sales in this market segment .
Many are counting in large part on the MTH homeowner carrying the housing market , consumer spending , and the broader economy straight into a full - blown economic recovery .
That is a lofty premise if they are talking about the same MTH borrower with whom I worked for years as a West Coast mortgage banker ; who are my neighbors , friends , and family , as an MTH CA resident ; and whose loan performance I track daily across all originators and servicers through our proprietary data .
Contrary to a growing recent popular opinion that the MTH homeowner is feeling great , it remains my strong opinion that the negative wealth - effect across the MTH homeowners remains powerful , increasing especially over the past few months as end - of - season price dumping and increased short sale activity continued to push prices lower .
The reason why the MTH has not tumbled in the same fashion as the lower price bands is simply because this group of Jumbo Prime , Pay Option and Interest Only borrowers have a ) much more leverage - in - finance with loans such as the Pay Option ARM making up a large percentage of the total b ) loans that were structured with interest only or neg - am teasers that typically last a minimum of 5 - years vs 2 - years on a Subprime loan c ) more options available to them such as cashing in retirement to keep kicking the can d ) more stable employment e ) a better chance of qualifying for a mortgage mod .
Bottom Line – the MTH is a slower moving train wreck , which in the macro may be worse than the way Subprime imploded .
Subprime borrowers who got wiped out a couple of years after getting their 2/28 are way down the de-levering road — renting a property and living within their means , which is when spending can begin again if they chose .
At the end of the day , defaults and foreclosures across the MTH will be in the double digits with a respectable number in front , but stretched out over a longer period of time pressuring this housing and borrower segment for the duration .
The Mid - to - high end collapse will keep its borrowers financially strung out for years , as conscientious home owners sell other assets or cash in retirement to keep making payments while others opt for a pro-bank mortgage mod in which most of their disposable income each month goes to repay their massively underwater monument to stupidity .
Some that simply bought at the wrong time with larger down payments , perhaps most of their savings — and who have seen all of their equity evaporate — will opt to earn their way out of it , which is a long process during which spending is restrained .
Still , many will choose the route of default and foreclosure because with negative - equity so extreme in the MTH , they are renters anyway , unable to refi , sell or re-buy , and foreclosure is the fastest road to household balance sheet recovery .
Price Dumping & Short Sales Destroy Values Just Like Foreclosures
Make no doubt about it … peak - to - trough the MTH has been devastated in the past year .
Millions who purchased , refied , or took out HELOCs on the way up , at the top , or moving back down the other side are in such a serious negative - equity state there is no traditional way out .
The hot period for MTH Real Estate was 2003 - 2007 .
During this time 75 % - 80 % of all houses either a ) changed hands b ) were refinanced ( including cash - out , which increasing the loan balance c ) were built and purchased for the first time d ) or leveraged further through the addition of a second or third mortgage .
Yes , the potential at - risk population is the vast majority of MTH owners .
Later in the 2009 season we finally saw more MTH houses turn - over but at sharp discounts or on short sale .
Unlike the low end of the market the increased activity was not spurred by a surge in buyer demand , rather due to end - of - season seller panic and increased short sale activity .
That being said , there is pent - up demand for this sector at the right price .
The problem is that the right price on one sale destroys the net - worth of scores more .
This type of increased activity in the earlier innings of the MTH collapse is not a positive market factor because it sets comps and locks - in values for everybody .
Bottom Line – price dumping and short sales destroy neighborhoods just like foreclosures .
In fact , they are a leading indicator to house price deflation , defaults and foreclosures .
Remember , for every person who gets a ‘ great deal ’ , scores more are thrown into a negative - equity or greater negative equity position exponentially increasing their likelihood of loan default .
This sector is a negative - equity time - bomb across all loan types , even 30 - year fixed .
A $ 1 Million House is now the House of a Millionaire
A $ 1 million house is now the home of a millionaire … someone who can put down $ 270 k and show proof of over $ 200 k per year income for the past few years .
Oh , and a 740 credit score is paramount .
Unlike the bubble years when a $ 1 million house could be purchased by a moderate income household — one working as a checker at Safeway and one a mailman ( both great jobs with a combined gross income of over $ 100 k ) — now the buyers must be rich .
There are far more MTH houses on the MLS — and coming at the market in the foreclosure pipeline — than there are rich buyers who a ) do not already own b ) who are liquid enough to be able to buy a new house and rent their present house c ) or that are in the enviable equity position to be able to sell , pay a Realtor and put a large down payment on their new house .
Mid -to - High End Reminiscent of 2007 Broad Market Conditions
In the mid - to - upper end price bands , the same market dynamics are in play right now as were in the broader housing market in 2007 .
This market segment has absolutely gone over the top of the mountain and has begun its steep descent down the other side .
In fact , there are more Notice - of - Defaults each on Jumbo loans each month in CA then houses sold in the Jumbo price range .
The house price compression over the next year or two will be so severe it will undermine any stability found in the low - to - low mid bands especially if stimuli are removed .
In the MTH the foreclosure pipeline has never been as full .
But just like with the lower end , the foreclosures have been held back as banks try to retrofit every borrower with a mortgage mod .
To date , most MTH foreclosures have only been from a ) vacant houses b) those that absolutely do not qualify for a mod c ) those that turn down a mod realizing they are better off walking away or in foreclosure .
This is changing fast .
The Bottom Line is that MTH foreclosures and foreclosure starts have been held down artificially , no doubt .
This is because of the national foreclosure prevention programs but also because more Jumbo whole loans are owned by financial insti’s as portfolio loans .
This allows the bank the flexibility to do what they want unlike Agency or Subprime loans for example serviced for others , such as an MBS investor .
They always fight harder when it ’s their own money on the line — think of Jumbo sort of in the same fashion as commercial but to a lesser extent with respect to tampering by the lien holders .
The negative - equity across the MTH is extreme and high - LTV HELOCs are also common with this crowd .
In fact , HELOCs behind Jumbo loans attached to MTH properties can be $ 250 k – $ 1 million , which is even greater motivation for the banks to kick the can as far down the road as possible .
Because of incurable negative - equity , tumbling rents , and overall harsh reality that they have become a renter in a 5000 square foot house , premeditated defaults are a favorite among mid- to - high end homeowners .
For those in a serious negative equity position , a pre-mediated loan default , short sale or deed - in - lieu is usually much better than any alternative because a ) they can rent the same house down the street for much less than the cost to own b ) leaving the house begins the savings , de- leveraging and credit repair clock c ) earning their way out of a $ 500 k negative equity hole is simply out of the question for most .
Mid-to - High End Isolated – HOGWASH
Extreme Leverage in this Sector
Most think the MTH homeowner is somehow isolated from the broader housing market collapse – hogwash .
They are more impacted because unlike the low - end hand - to - mouthers , these borrowers may have assets to attach or protect and perhaps something called a budget .
Right now in cities across America there are married , working couples in MTH houses sitting around the dinner table saying “ honey , we make $ 150 k a year .
Why ca n’t we save any money ?
Where does it all go each month ? ”
Jumbo Prime , Pay Options , Interest
Only etc loans routinely allowed up to a 50 % debt - to - income ratio , even on a 30 - year fixed .
When purchasing a house or pulling cash out through a refi or HELOC , most borrowed what their banker told them they could qualify for , therefore , a large percentage of mid–to - high end owners with a mortgage are highly levered coming out of the gate .
Of the 50 % DTI , most goes to the mortgage , taxes , insurance and maintenance .
And of course , about half got a HELOC after the purchase taking the DTI to 60 % .
That does not leave a lot for taxes , food , insurance and every other expense not listed on their credit report let alone robust consumer spending .
But in reality the majority of MTH homeowners purchased or refied with a stated income or no doc feature making it impossible to know the true extent of the leverage across the sector .
One thing is for sure … it is higher than if it were full - doc or there would have been no reason so many used limited doc loans .
To think the MTH earner will somehow pull through this unscathed , lead high end retail sales this holiday season , etc is verging on laughable .
Yes , stocks pulling off the bottom have likely benefited sentiment .
But not to the degree that house prices plunging , their HELOC being shut down from further draws and credit card limits being slashed have hurt it .
You ca n’t easily spend and IRA or 401k at the Good Guys for a home theater system .
Just like most everyone else , a large percentage of MTH homeowners live virtually paycheck to paycheck — they just had more stuff and more debt .
Without easy and available credit , this group of homeowners and spenders by and large is as hamstrung as the rest .
What happens to the economy when you knee - cap the MTH earner the same way the low - to - low mid was knee - capped in 2007 when housing first fell off of a cliff ?
Stay tuned .
THE Top Gear lads zoomed into Lillie 's Bordello last night to continue the show after their RDS performance .
The Herald can reveal how TV petrol - heads Jeremy Clarkson and James May hit the town with a vengeance as they headed to the celeb haunt for an invite - only party .
The presenters booked out the entire library area of the VIP club , normally used by Bono , for their private jamming session to unwind after thrilling audiences at the southside venue .
Motormouth Jeremy wasted no time in taking to the drums alongside the house band and spent more than an hour helping them revving up punters .
One of his party pieces was Mustang Sally .
He told punters : " I 'm going to have to go soon but this is one of my favourite songs from my favourite Irish films , because of all the f**king swearing . "
However , there was no sign of Richard ' The Hamster ' Hammond after a source revealed how he was " too wrecked " to head out for some after party fun .
His TV colleague James May was still eager for action though and was more than happy to press the flesh .
And although declining to join Jeremy and the band , he opted for the outside smoking area to hang out with pals .
When asked if he was going to sing , James told the Herald : " No , I 'm not going to sing tonight -- I 'm not an attention seeker . "
But the big surprise for Top Gear fans came when Clarkson refused to pose for photos with them .
When asked for a quick snap with one fan , he replied : " No , the cameras have been going all night .
You might say it 's going to take just a minute but then it takes an hour .
I just want to have a cigarette and relax . "
No expense was spared by organisers as they pulled out all the stops to impress the lads for their visit back to the club .
Champagne corks were popping the whole time as they laid on complimentary booze .
Earlier in the night , the Top Gear team regaled fans with their mad-cap antics .
Among the celebrities enjoying the fuel - filled fun were Ireland rugby captain Brian O'Driscoll and new rugby sensation Jonathan Sexton .
Also spotted was RTE star Laura Woods , Rosanna Davison and Lillie 's co-owner Oliver Hughes .

AECL speaks about its experience using thorium fuel , which spans 50 years , and its plans for the future .
By Ian Hastings , Keith Bradley , Jerry Hopwood , Peter Boczar , Sermet Kuran and Steven Livingstone
As early as the 1950s , the use of thorium was identified as a promising fuel cycle in Atomic Energy of Canada Limited ’s ( AECL’s ) CANDU development programme .
This was due to its anticipated improved fuel performance [ 1 - 4 ] ( e.g. , reduced fission gas release , due to thorium ’s enhanced thermal and chemical properties ) and the relative abundance of thorium .
The “ Valubreeder ” proposed by W.B. Lewis [ 5 ] in 1968 was an early theoretical concept of a CANDU reactor as a near - breeder using thorium - uranium fuel .
Thorium is a fundamental part AECL ’s fuel cycle vision for CANDU , and represents a low - uranium - consumption fuel cycle option .
A thorium - fuelled CANDU reactor is particularly attractive to countries with thorium reserves but no uranium – addressing their need for energy self - reliance .
The current expansion in nuclear plant new build and planning – the nuclear renaissance – puts increasing pressure on nuclear fuel reserves .
This has heightened active interest in advanced fuel cycles .
In Canada , and around the world , both “ open ” ( i.e. , not involving reprocessing ) and “ closed ” ( i.e. , involving reprocessing ) fuel cycles have and are being evaluated as ways of extending nuclear fuel resources , reducing waste and enhancing proliferation - resistance .
AECL is proposing thorium fuel cycles as options for its CANDU 6 / Enhanced CANDU 6 ( EC6 ) reactors [ 6 ] , and the Generation III + ACR - 1000 [ 7 ] , which would start with a first - pass , open cycle , that would generate potential fuel material as a fissile material resource for initiating later closed fuel cycles .
AECL is also developing other fuel options [ 8 , 9 ] for CANDU – including low - enriched uranium development ( LEU ) , recovered uranium from conventional reprocessing , variations of MOX , and actinide waste .
The CANFLEX [ 10 ] fuel bundle is the optimal carrier for these different fuels .
CANFLEX has a nominal 43 elements , with varying element sizes dependent on fuel type .
Fuel cycle vision
[ 11 - 16 ]
The most attractive CANDU thorium fuel cycles would be closed , with reprocessing of the used fuel and recycling of the separated uranium - 233 and unconverted thorium .
Small quantities of fissile material ( driver fuel ) must be added to the thorium to initiate and sustain the chain reaction and to breed U - 233 through neutron capture and subsequent beta decay .
With successive recycle campaigns , the initiating driver fuel would be progressively displaced by recycled U - 233 .
AECL estimates that a thorium - capable version of the present CANDU 6 could , upon reaching equilibrium fuel cycle conditions , generate up to 80 % of its energy output from thorium .
Later designs , optimized from the ground up for enhanced neutron economy , could be expected to improve on this figure .
Fissile driver fuel material can be provided by low enriched uranium ( LEU ) or by plutonium ( Pu ) or recovered uranium extracted from spent light water reactor fuel .
In the long term , plutonium or U - 233 produced in fast breeder reactors ( FBRs ) could provide the driver fuel .
Short - term strategy
Thorium - rich countries could elect to first deploy a first - pass fuel in the near term in CANDU reactors , to acquire experience in thorium fuel - cycle technology and to build a strategic resource of U - 233 safeguarded in the used fuel , without committing to its future recovery .
In a CANDU reactor , the single - pass , Th- LEU fuel cycle increases uranium utilization by up to 30 % relative to natural uranium fuel , and would provide a low - cost insurance policy against future shortages of uranium as well as provide a bridge to the closed thorium cycles of the future .
AECL is considering several thorium fuel configurations :
• Heterogeneous Th- LEU bundle
• Homogeneous Pu/ Th mixture
• Mixed - bundle thorium ( some fuel pins containing ThO 2 , others UO 2 fuel )
Long - term strategy
For the long term , AECL is proposing the use of CANDU reactors with the near - Self - Sufficient Equilibrium Thorium ( SSET ) fuel cycle , which breeds enough U - 233 that – through recycling – can keep the fuel cycle running indefinitely , with minimal need for additional fissile material .
This closed cycle approach , which includes reprocessing , is the approach that will provide real future economic benefits .
In the future , the CANDU - FBR synergism will allow a few fuel - generating , though expensive , FBRs to supply the fissile requirements of less - expensive , high - conversion - ratio CANDU reactors operating on the thorium cycle .
Past experience
[ 16 - 22 ]
Supporting its fuel cycle vision , AECL has more than 50 years of experience with thorium based fuel irradiations , with burnups to 47 MWd / kgHE , and powers ranging up to 77 kW / m .
Twenty five thorium - based irradiation tests have been performed in the Nuclear Power Demonstration reactor ( NPD ) , and AECL ’s experimental reactors : National Research Experimental ( NRX ) , National Research Universal ( NRU ) and Whiteshell Reactor 1 ( WR1 ) .
The composition of the fuels ranged from natural ThO 2 to ThO 2 + 30 wt % UO 2 , although the majority of experiments were in the range ThO 2 + ( 1 - 3 wt % ) enriched UO 2 , where the UO 2 is enriched to 70 – 93 wt % U - 235 in total U. Some experiments used Pu as the fissile material .
Pellet geometries were generally standard ( l/d ˜ 1.3 ) , but several experiments examined short pellets ( l/d ˜ 0.5 ) , and a variety of pellet dish designs , including inter - pellet graphite discs .
Figure 1 shows a post- irradiation section featuring the novel graphite disc design : plenum , 2 mm disc and pellet .
Burnup was 43 MWd / kgHE , with a maximum linear power of 75 kW /m .
Early experiments showed great promise for ThO 2 based fuels , with fuel performance parameters generally superior to UO 2 under similar operating conditions .
These results created incentive for numerous experiments in the late 1970s and early 1980s .
While most of the thorium test irradiations were performed in experimental reactors , of particular note is the NPD 51 irradiation , which was performed in a pre-commercial CANDU power reactor ( NPD ) from 1977 to 1987 , and demonstrated the technical feasibility of using ThO2 fuels , and provided technical experience with these fuels .
The experiment irradiated four standard NPD 19 element bundles ( two containing 2.6 wt % UO 2 , and two with 1.45 wt % UO 2 ; the UO 2 was enriched to 93 wt % U - 235 in total U ) at low powers (< 30 kW / m ) to a maximum outer element burnup of 47 MWd / kgHE .
The bundles operated successfully , and demonstrated features typical of high - burnup , low - power fuel .
In this wide variety of test irradiations , AECL successfully operated thorium - based fuels at high powers to extended burnups , with good fuel performance .
This demonstration supports the requirements for economic recycling of U - 233 .
Higher thermal conductivity resulted in low fission gas releases through reduced operating temperatures .
Grain growth was also reduced ( compared with UO 2 ) , with rare evidence of columnar grain growth .
Reduced fission gas release and lower grain growth , have allowed thorium to perform without increasing sheath strain .
Sheath strains generally were bounded by - 0.6 to +0.6 % , despite high burnups and powers , varying pellet geometries and different fuel compositions .
Figure 2 shows a post- irradiation cross section from a fuel element from an experiment with ( Th , U ) O 2 ( 1.5 % U - 235 ) .
Burnup was 41 MWd / kgHE at a maximum linear power of 48 kW /m .
Sheath hydriding / deuteriding show no significant difference between thorium and uranium oxide fuels .
CANLUB ( AECL ’s patented fuel sheath internal lubricant ) retention in thorium based fuel is consistent with that observed in UO 2 fuels .
Power ramp experience with thorium based fuel is limited , but suggests improved defect thresholds over UO 2 , provided CANLUB coatings are used .
Internal and external sheath oxidation is comparable to that observed in UO 2 fuels .
Defected thorium fuel elements released significantly less fuel and fission products into the coolant system , as expected from the more stable , cooler ThO 2 matrix .
Additionally , AECL has initiated R&D programs on the management of thorium wastes [ 23 ] .
Overall , AECL experience with thorium fuel is extensive , covering a wide range of fuel compositions , pellet geometries and operating conditions .
Thorium fuel has always shown either comparable or superior performance relative to UO 2 .
One outcome of AECL ’s comprehensive test programme has been the establishment of an optimum thorium pellet fabrication route , ensuring reproducible irradiation performance superior to that of UO 2 fuels .

The Department of Justice announced today that Theresa Russell , a former staff sergeant , pleaded guilty money laundering while stationed in Iraq .
It was n't all that much of a surprise , since two years ago the guy who gave her the bribes pleaded guilty to doing so .
Russell , 40 , was at Camp Anaconda in Iraq while she took more than $ 30,000 in cash from a former Army major now working for a contractor .
He told her to make small deposits in banks so the cash could n't be traced .
" Russell admitted that she knew the money she received from Rivard was the proceeds of bribery , " the DOJ announcement said .
Russell did n't deposit all the cash :
She " admitted that she subsequently used the criminal proceeds to purchase , among other things , a car , cosmetic surgery , and household furnishings and goods , " the statement said .

Our Recent Case Victories That Shaped The Law to Protect New York Construction Workers
Haynes v. Boricua Village Housing Development Fund Company , Inc. , et al. , 2009 WL 1178782 ( 1st Dept. 2019 ) - Won summary judgment for a carpenter who suffered an electric shock when attempting to install pins in a drop ceiling using a Hilti gun .
The Court found that , even though the owner of the company Haynes worked for testified that he came to the scene after the accident and there was no exposed wiring or anything unusual , Haynes still wins .
The Court made this decision that Plaintiff still wins summary judgment based on violations of Industrial Code 12 NYCRR §§ 23 - 1.13 ( b ) ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) because the owner of the company did n’t arrive at the site until 20 to 30 minutes after the accident and Haynes ’ testimony and an affidavit from Haynes ’ supervisor indicated that exposed uncapped electrical wiring was seen hanging from the ceiling in the area Haynes was working , and Haynes ’ coworker stated that after the accident he observed electricians arriving at the accident site and capping exposed wiring .
Hoyos v. NY - 1095
Avenue of the Americas , LLC , et al. , 156 A.D.3d 491 ( 1st Dept. 2017 ) - Reversed the ruling of the trial court below and won summary judgment for a union - affiliated painter who slipped or fell off an elevated loading dock when attempting to enter the building to perform his work at a construction / renovation project only taking place on certain floors higher up in the building .
In a split decision , the Court ruled in favor of Hoyos , taking into account “ the reality of what construction workers employed on projects in high rise buildings face . ”
The Court found that Hoyos was working at the time , even though he was still trying to enter the building , and that the loading dock was considered part of the construction / renovation site because Hoyos was required to “ line up with other construction personnel and use the crowded , elevated loading dock to gain access to the building at the start of each work day ” and Hoyos was “ not provided with a safer or different means of gaining access to any other part of the building . ”
Furthermore , the Court found that the loading dock was high enough off the ground to trigger the safety protections of the law and that it “ was several feet off the floor [ and ] it had no railing , chain , demarcation or other protective safety device to prevent someone on the crowded platform from falling off its edge . . . ”
Gonzalez v. Paramount Group , Inc. et al. , 157 A.D.3d 427 ( 1st Dept. 2018 ) ( internal citations omitted ) –
Won summary judgment for a union laborer who had a cinderblock fall on his knee while he was making an opening in a concrete wall for HVAC ductwork to be installed .
The Court found that “ the cinderblocks above the opening that fell were “ falling objects ” under Labor Law § 240 ( 1 ) required to be secured for the purposes of the undertaking . ”
The Court said that O’Brien v. Port Authority of New York & New Jersey , 29 N.Y.3d 27 ( 2017 ) , another case from The Perecman Firm , was inapplicable here because the defendants did not provide any safety device to secure the cinderblocks , as opposed to in O’Brien , where there was a question of whether the safety device provided was adequate .
This case resulted in a settlement of $ 1,200,000 .
Cardona v. New York City Housing Authority et al. , 153 A.D.3d 1179 ( 1st Dept. 2017 ) – Won summary judgment for a laborer who fell to the ground and suffered knee injuries when climbing the cross braces of a sidewalk bridge , as he was instructed to do .
The court ruled in favor of Mr. Cardona because he was not provided with a ladder or other safety device to access the sidewalk bridge in violation of Labor Law 240 ( 1 ) .
Defendants did not present sufficient evidence that Cardona was instructed not to go up on the sidewalk bridge .
The Employer ’s Injury and Illness Report was not accepted as evidence for the Defendants as their own witness denied preparing it and there was no proof that it was “ prepared by anyone with personal knowledge of the relevant events . ”
Defendants tried to argue that Cardona fell because of his “ carelessness , ” “ bad decisions , ” and his size , but these arguments were not accepted as comparative negligence is not a defense to a Labor Law 240 ( 1 ) claim .
This case was later settled for $ 4,200,000 .
Pacheco v. Halsted Communications , Ltd. et al. , 114 A.D.3d 768 ( 2nd Dept. 2016 ) – Won summary judgment for a worker who fell and suffered brain injuries when climbing down a 28 - foot ladder after installing satellite cable equipment on the roof of a home .
The Court ruled in favor of Pacheco because the ladder was unsecured , and he was not provided with a safety device to prevent him from falling .
The defendants tried to argue that Pacheco should lose because he used a 28 - foot ladder instead of a 40 - foot ladder , but they failed because they did not show that there were 40 - foot ladders available for him to use .
The case was settled for a confidential sum .
Jerdonek v. 41 West 72 LLC , et al. , 143 A.D.3d 43 ( 1st Dept. 2016 ) – Won summary judgment for a union worker who fell from a scaffold that was not properly secured and lacked guard rails .
Even though witness from the general contractor testified to a different version of the accident , Jerdonek still won because Labor Law 240 ( 1 ) “ was violated under either version of the accident . ”
This was especially because the general contractor testified that that first level of the scaffolding did not have middle or top guard rails .
The Court held that Jerdonek was entitled to summary judgment on his Labor Law 240 ( 1 ) claim against the owner of the building , the board of managers of the condominium building .
This case was settled after trial for $ 1,140,890.800 .
Golubowski v. City of New York , 131 A.D.3d 900 ( 1st Dept. 2015 ) – Won liability under Labor Law § 240 ( 1 ) for our client , a plumber , who was injured when he fell from a ladder that had become wet and slippery from water leaking from an overhead sprinkler system that was being dismantled .
This case was settled for $ 600,000 .
Czajkowski v. City of New York , 126 A.D.3d 543 ( 1st Dept. 2015 ) – Won liability under Scaffold Law for our client , who was using a sawzall to remove 10 - foot high , 8 to 10 - foot wide window frames , when the top half of the window fell out of the wall and crushed his hand .
The Court said that Mr. Czakowski was entitled to summary judgment on his Labor Law 240 ( 1 ) claim because he “ was not provided any safety device to brace or otherwise support the window while it was being removed in the manner he was instructed . ”
This case was settled for $ 700,000 .
Jerez v. Tishman Const . Corp of New York , 118 A.D.3d 617 ( 1st Dept. 2014 ) .
Our client , a union carpenter working on a form wall at the World Trade Center construction site , was awarded liability under the Scaffold Law when a brace that he had secured his lanyard to gave way , causing him to fall 14 feet to the floor below .
The Port Authority 's witness also admitted that our client had not been given double lanyards , as had been required .
This case was settled for $ 4,750,000 .
Alameda - Cabrera v. Noble Electrical Contracting Co. , Inc. , 117 A.D.3d 484 ( 1st Dept. 2014 ) –
We won liability for our client under Labor Law 241( 6 ) who was severely injured when using a miter saw that did not have a protective guard and a vise clamp in violation of Industrial Code 12 NYCRR 23 - 1.12 ( c ) ( 2 ) and 23 - 9.2 ( a ) .
This case was settled for $ 1,000,000 .
Grant v. City of New York , 109 A.D.3d 961 ( 2d Dept. 2013 ) – Court awarded liability under Scaffold Law to our client , who fell approximately 15 feet from an unsecured straight ladder that shifted to the side while he was doing electrical work in a New York City school auditorium .
The Court said that Mr. Grant still wins even though the City of New York argued that he should have had a coworker hold the bottom of the ladder or use a nylon rope to secure the bottom of the ladder to a stationary object
This case was settled for $ 1,850,000 .
Stallone v. Plaza Construction Corp. , 95 A.D.3d 633 ( 1st Dept. 2012 ) – Court awarded liability under Scaffold Law to our client , a union crane operator , [ 2 ] who fell 13 feet from a vertical fixed ladder while climbing down from the cab of the crane , because the ladder " proved inadequate to shield [ him ] from harm directly flowing [ 2 ] from the application of the force of gravity to an object or person . "
The Court ruled in favor of our client because that ladder was the only means by which he could reach his elevated work site and his injuries were “ at least partially attributable to defendants ’ failure to take mandated safety measures to protect him from elevation - relation risks . ”
This case was settled for $ 6,000,000 .
Nechifor v. RH Atlantic - Pacific LLC , 92 A.D.3d 514 ( 1st Dept. 2012 ) – Court ruled in favor of our client , a union carpenter , under the Scaffold Law , who fell 12 feet as he attempted to climb down from the top of a scaffold by climbing down the frame because the ladder that was supposed to be attached to the scaffold was not provided .
This case was settled for $ 9,900,000 and was the top New York Construction Accident Settlement in 2014 in as per the VerdictSearch Top Settlements list .
Kempisty v. 246 Spring Street , LLC , 92 A.D.3d 474 ( 1st Dept. 2012 ) .
This is a very significant case where the court applied the Scaffold Law to rule in favor of our client , who had his foot crushed by an 8,000 pound block that was moving slightly from side to side while it was [ 2 ] being hoisted for a load test .
Although the client did not fall from a ladder or scaffold , the more typical case under the Scaffold Law , the court held that “ the elevation differential [ between the block and our client ’s foot ] cannot be considered de minimis when the weight of the object being hoisted is capable of generating an extreme amount of force , even though it only traveled a short distance . ”
This case went to trial and was settled after trial for $ 7,250,000 .
Olszewski v. Park Terrace Gardens , Inc. , 306 A.D.2d 128 ( 1st Dept. 2003 ) .
First Department affirmed the trial court ’s award of summary judgment in favor of our client under Labor Law 240 ( 1 ) , known as New York ’s “ Scaffold Law , ” in a case where our client , who was working on a suspension scaffold removing paint from the outside of a building , fell seven stories when the ropes holding one side of the suspension scaffold broke .
The court rejected the defense argument that the client was solely to blame for not securing his harness , because the scaffold failed and there was “ no evidence that plaintiff was given an immediate instruction to use the harness . ”
We think this case is particularly applicable here , because there was a failure to provide a full height railing / parapet , which courts have repeatedly held is a violation of the Labor Law , just as does the failure to provide a scaffold with full railings .

Another important case where the court ruled in favor of our client , who was injured while attempting to realign a side panel of a sidewalk bridge he and his coworkers were constructing .
The court stated that “ the failure to provide [ our client ] with any safety device to protect him against the risk of a fall created by his need to lean over the side of [ 2 ] the bridge to nail in the side panels leads to liability ” under the Scaffold Law , and further specifically ruled that a co-worker is not a safety device under the Scaffold Law .

Our client was a sheet metal worker who was injured when he fell from an unsecured ladder .
The court ruled our client was entitled to a liability finding in his favor because “ the failure to supply [ him ] with a properly secured ladder or any safety devices was a proximate cause of his fall . ”
Curte v. City of New York , 21 A.D.3d 1050 ( 2d Dept. 2005 ) .
The plaintiff was " chipping concrete " as part of a repair of a train trestle located at the Huguenot station in Staten Island .
A gust of wind caused by the passing of a nearby train caused a tarp to [ 2 ] exert pressure against the plaintiff 's ladder , the ladder moved away from the wall on which it had been propped , and this movement prompted the plaintiff to release his grasp and fall .

Science and technology reporter , BBC News
A promising push toward a novel , biologically - inspired " chemical computer " has begun as part of an international collaboration .
The " wet computer " incorporates several recently discovered properties of chemical systems that can be hijacked to engineer computing power .
The team 's approach mimics some of the actions of neurons in the brain .
The 1.8 m - euro ( £ 1.6 m ) project will run for three years , funded by an EU emerging technologies programme .
The programme has identified biologically - inspired computing as particularly important , having recently funded several such projects .
What distinguishes the current project is that it will make use of stable " cells " featuring a coating that forms spontaneously , similar to the walls of our own cells , and uses chemistry to accomplish the signal processing similar to that of our own neurons .
The goal is not to make a better computer than conventional ones , said project collaborator Klaus - Peter Zauner of the University of Southampton , but rather to be able to compute in new environments .
If one day we want to construct computers of similar power and complexity to the human brain , my bet would be on some form of chemical or molecular computing
Frantisek Stepanek , Institute of Chemical Technology , Prague " The type of wet information technology we are working towards will not find its near - term application in running business software , " Dr Zauner told BBC News .
" But it will open up application domains where current IT does not offer any solutions - controlling molecular robots , fine - grained control of chemical assembly , and intelligent drugs that process the chemical signals of the human body and act according to the local biochemical state of the cell . "
Lipids and liquids
The group 's approach hinges on two critical ideas .
First , individual " cells " are surrounded by a wall made up of so - called lipids that spontaneously encapsulate the liquid innards of the cell .
Recent work has shown that when two such lipid layers encounter each other as the cells come into contact , a protein can form a passage between them , allowing chemical signalling molecules to pass .
Second , the cells ' interiors will play host to what is known as a Belousov - Zhabotinsky or B - Z chemical reaction .
Simply put , reactions of this type can be initiated by changing the concentration of the element bromine by a certain threshold amount .
The reactions are unusual for a number of reasons .
But for the computing application , what is important is that after the arrival of a chemical signal to start it , the cell enters a " refractory period " during which further chemical signals do not influence the reaction .
That keeps a signal from propagating unchecked through any connected cells .
Such self - contained systems that react under their own chemical power to a stimulus above a threshold have an analogue in nature : neurons .
Each neuron in our brains can be viewed as a chemical computer " Every neuron is like a molecular computer ; ours is a very crude abstraction of what neurons do , " said Dr Zauner .
" But the essence of neurons is the capability to get ' excited ' ; it can re-form an input signal and has its own energy supply so it can fire out a new signal . "
This propagation of a chemical signal - along with the " refractory period " that keeps it contained within a given cell - means the cells can form networks that function like the brain .
' Real chance ' Frantisek Stepanek , a chemical computing researcher at the Institute of Chemical Technology Prague in the Czech Republic , said the pairing of the two ideas was promising .
" If one day we want to construct computers of similar power and complexity to the human brain , my bet would be on some form of chemical or molecular computing , " he told BBC News .
" I think this project stands a real chance of bringing chemical computing from the concept stage to a practical demonstration of a functional prototype . "
For its part , the team is already hard at work proving the idea will work .
" Officially the project does n't start until the first of February , " said Dr Zauner , " but we were so curious about it we already sent some lipids to our collaborators in Poland - they 've already shown the lipid layers are stable . "

The Green Newtown Pippin —a “ chance ” apple that sprouted from a random apple seed , or “ pip ” , ( hence the surname “ pippin ” ) was first harvested in 1730 on the farm of Gershom Moore in Newtown , Queens County ( now the Elmhurst section of the present - day Borough of Queens , part of New York City ) .
From there it spread to Albemarle County , Virginia where it came to be known as the Albemarle Pippin due to the regional economic jingoism occurring at the time .
It was a favorite of several founding fathers including George Washington , Benjamin Franklin , and Thomas Jefferson who grew them at Monticello .
During the 19th century , the Newtown Pippin experienced significant commercial success .
It was part of the “ Select List of Apples ” kept by the Horticultural Society of London in 1807 and commanded the highest prices at Covent Garden .
Queen Victoria so favored them that the British Parliament lifted the import duty on Newtown Pippins until World War I at which time Parliament renewed the import duty on the Newtown Pippin , and its commercial presence declined .
I love New York city .
There 's a certain energy there that I find exhilarating , and every time I go , I feel it .
As I know it , New York city is all city .
It 's not a place that I would think as where a heirloom variety of apple originated .
Thanks to SlowFoods USA and its US Ark of Taste program , I will now remember that the Big Apple is among other things , the origin of the Newton Pippin Apple .
Now there is a group of partners , Green Apple Cleaners GreenThumb ( NYC department of Parks and Recreation ) , SlowFoodNYC Cummins Nursery , Earth Day New York and Sage General Store that are working to get the Newton Pippin into the urban landscape and a symbol of the city 's ecological future .
From Newtonpippin.org ;
In 2009 we ’ve promoted awareness of this wonderful legacy , and provided over 100 FREE saplings to community gardens , environmental groups , schools , and other public spaces .
We hope you join us in 2010 and beyond !
The Newton Pipin has the support of of a NYC Councilman ;
Also , please check out the Resolution 2009 - 2009 introduced by NYC City Council Member Gennaro , chair of the environmental protection committee , to declare the Newtown Pippin the official apple of the Big Apple !

The T House by Marc Topilsky
The T House is located in Israel in a suburb of Tel Aviv .
The lot is 750 Meters Sq .
On it are two single family house sharing a central courtyard and pool .
The houses are shared by two sisters and their families .
Structure : All vertical structure ( columns ) are steel except the west wall which is sheer concrete – 12 meters high – to resist earthquakes .
The house , having no walls on the east side works structurally as a bridge – hung from the west wall .
The roof is a steel structure assembled in a work shop and transported to the site in two parts , each 2.5 tons of steel .
It is 100 meters square and is supported by 4 main – S shaped – steel beams constructed of 2 parts each , one concave and one convex , in the same diameter .
This roof is supported to the west by the concrete wall , and to the east ( the main courtyard side ) by 4 “ Mies Barcelona pavilion ” style cross columns .
The roof cover is dark zinc sheet .
All interiors are column free , ( except for the red central column ) and all devisions are plaster walls .
The house has 3 levels :
Basement : Surrounded by a sunken garden to allow Natural light and ventilation , and is used as an Office by the owner .
Ground floor :
This floor is the main public area , the floor plan is L shape with the entry in the angle .
Both faces of the L face the central inner courtyard , by an all glass floor to ceiling sliding door system .
The arrangement is such that plenty of light is let through but minimal direct sunlight .
An imperative condition in hot climate locations as this .
One side of the L is the formal living room , 5X5 meters and 3.4 meters high .
This space has a low window on the pool edge , a large floor to celling opening towards the main courtyard , ad a 5X1 meter , north facing skylight to allow diffused light for the painting on the wall ( the red flower , artist Yoav Ben Dov ) .
The other side of the L is the family room opening on one side to the main courtyard and to the south to an outdoor sitting area and kids playground .
The connection between the two sides is the kitchen and main entrance .
First Floor ; Reserved for bedrooms , 2 children bedrooms , one communal area and a double height master bedroom , opening to reveal the roof structure .
Above the kids bedrooms is an attic with one bedroom suite .
Total area of the house : 350 Sq. meters .
The pool , 14 X 3 meters divides the main courtyard between the two houses .

The IRS has been targeting people for audits simply because they do n’t make enough money .
When people report incomes below the poverty line , the IRS has been using that as an excuse to conduct audits because the government claims that those people “ ca n’t get by ” with such low incomes .
Further , the IRS is refusing to allow some of these people with low incomes to claim children as dependents after the auditing process because , the IRS reasons , if they do n’t make enough money to “ get by ” in a given city then there is no way they could be providing for a dependent child .
These policies are so insensitive to the reality of poverty in the United States .
Millions of people with low incomes live in cities alongside much wealthier residents and provide for dependent children .
It is outrageous that the IRS would specifically target people simply for not making enough money .
Send a letter to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner today and tell him to stop targeting people for tax audits simply because they do n’t make enough money .
So Nicolas Sarkozy , responding to the minaret ban in Switzerland , admonishes us to practise our faiths with " humble discretion " .
To be recommended humble discretion by President Sarkozy is like being counselled modesty in dress by Lady Gaga , or self - denial by a banker .
But France 's mercurial president does have a point when he says , in his recent article in Le Monde , that it is not enough simply to condemn the Swiss referendum vote ; we should try to understand what motivated so many Swiss , and what this tells us about Europe today .
How is it possible that , in a country with just four minarets , 57 % of those who voted , on a turnout of 53 % – in other words , more than a quarter of the Swiss electorate – could vote for the constitution to be changed to include a blanket ban on the building of minarets ?
Were they responding to inflammatory posters showing minarets that looked like missiles all over the Swiss flag , together with the threatening figure of a woman in a niqab ?
Or to ludicrous arguments like that of the Swiss People 's party representative Oskar Freysinger , who said " the minute you have minarets in Europe it means Islam will have taken over " ?
By which logic , Spain and Britain are already Islamic countries .
Was this an expression of rampant " Islamophobia " , finding different targets from country to country but basically the same poison under the skin ?
Or was it merely anxious people crying " this change in our societies has come so fast – tell us where it is all going to end " ?
Sarkozy writes blithely that the vote has nothing to do with putting in question the freedom of religion , but then almost contradicts himself by saying " one does not respect people when one obliges them to practise their religion in caves or in hangars " .
Let us be clear : this vote was wrong both in principle and politically .
The European court of human rights would almost certainly find that it does violate the principle of religious freedom , as we interpret it in 21st - century Europe .
Religious freedom cannot consist of saying : " We , Christians and Jews , have our churches and synagogues , but you , Muslims , cannot have your mosques .
Your religion is tolerable so long as it is practised only by consenting adults in private . "
That is to put the clock of religious toleration back 300 years , to a time when even protestants in Catholic France could not worship in public .
Of course , planning regulations and the local townscape must be respected .
Architectural tact and syncretic innovation are desirable , as brilliantly exemplified in the new buildings of the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies or Boston 's Islamic Cultural Centre .
But this vote was not about urban planning .
Some retort that many Islamic countries do n't allow Christians to build churches , so why should European countries allow Muslims to erect minarets ?
This argument is completely back to front .
It is like saying : well , the US has the death sentence so why should n't Italy put Amanda Knox to death in an electric chair ?
Or : well , Saudi Arabia has women stoned for adultery so why should n't we torture Arab men ?
In many majority Muslim countries , there is pervasive religious intolerance towards Christians , Jews , other religious groups ( Bahai , Ahmadiyya ) and , not least , atheists , but we can only be credible in criticising that intolerance if we practise at home the universal principles that we preach abroad .
As someone once said : do as you would be done by .
The vote to ban minarets is not a mistake because there are no problems in relation to Muslims in Europe ; it is a mistake because there are so many problems in relation to Muslims in Europe .
We have to decide which of them really matter , and which are secondary .
On the Muslim side there is the problem of radical extremism and the rather different one of reactionary illiberalism ( for example , the treatment of women in some conservative Muslim communities ) .
On the non-Muslim side there is the problem of people lumping together worries about terrorists , immigrants , asylum seekers , job losses and crime , putting a big wrapper around them all and marking the package " Islam " .
The worst thing that could happen is a polarisation around purely symbolic issues , with one side , consisting almost entirely of non-Muslims , shouting " Islam ! " and the other , consisting almost entirely of Muslims , shouting back " Islamophobia ! "
Switzerland shows us the danger of sliding into a culture war , a Kulturkampf , which does not even go to the heart of the matter .
At the heart of the matter is not Islam or anti-Islam , minarets or headscarves , but the things essential to maintain a free society : free speech ; human rights ; personal security against terrorism , crime and arbitrary state power ; the equality before the law of men and women , rich and poor , believers in all faiths and none ; schools in which the rules and values of a free country are learned and internalised by children of all backgrounds , whatever they are taught or not taught at home .
In Britain , too , we must beware the Swiss danger of slipping into a Kulturkampf about secondary , symbolic issues .
Whether a mosque gets a minaret should be a subject for local planning .
What an adult woman wears should be her free choice .
( The obvious exceptions , in some workplaces , for instance , do not falsify the basic rule . )
Whether this or that preacher or organisation is banned should not become the test case for the whole position of Muslims in Britain .
David Cameron 's Conservatives will have to watch out that a security - led agenda does not impair the larger cause of integration in freedom .
To this , schools are vital .
Cameron was left with egg on his face a couple of weeks ago , because he got the facts wrong about government funding for an Islamic faith school .
But the debate revolved around too narrow a question : was this school promoting extremism while receiving government money aimed at preventing it ?
The larger question to ask , of that and all other schools , is : are they teaching the language , history , civics and values that will equip their pupils to be full , participating citizens of a free country ?
An unintended consequence of the Tory emphasis on localism , and on giving more autonomy to schools , may be to make that more difficult .
For the purposes of civic integration , we need more nationwide curriculum , standards and inspection , not less .
Not all Muslims , all of the time , will be able to support all these minimum essentials of a modern free society .
There is a real tension between some of the essentials ( for instance , the equal rights and dignity of homosexuals ) and what is habitually taught even in mainstream , conservative Muslim communities .
But most British Muslims , most of the time , will support most of them .
In my view , the absolute star of the BBC Question Time confrontation with BNP leader Nick Griffin was the Conservative Muslim politician Sayeeda Warsi .
She gave him hell , while speaking up for British traditions of openness , fair play and tolerance .
I felt she spoke for me , for Britain , and for freedom .
We must not let totemic dust - ups about minarets or headscarves obscure the battles that really count .
After 350 years , cheques to be consigned to the history books
Bounced out :
The chequebook could be abolished by 2018 after the number issued every day has fallen drastically
Cheques are to be abolished under controversial plans being drawn up by bankers .
They are widely expected to vote next month for the chequebook to be consigned to history .
Yesterday , the move was criticised by consumer groups , business lobbyists and charities representing the elderly .
They raised fears that vulnerable people , who have relied on their chequebook all their lives , will be left confused .
Many others simply prefer to pay by cheque , instead of by direct debit or bank transfer .
The Payments Council said its research shows the number of cheques being written every day has fallen dramatically in recent years .
At their peak in 1990 , around 11 million cheques were written every day .
Latest figures show the number has dropped to around 3.8 million .
Cheques , which were first used in Britain 350 years ago , are also an expensive form of payment for banks .
They cost around £ 1 each to process , which is four times as much as electronic payments .
The council 's 15 - strong board - made up of 11 banking representatives and four independents - will take a decision on December 16 .
The most likely date for cheques to be phased out in the UK is 2018 .
A growing number of stores including John Lewis and Tesco have stopped accepting cheques .
Stores claim they are the most insecure form of payment and that abolishing them cuts queues at checkouts .
But cheques are still widely used for making payments to tradesmen and for utility bills .
Poll Should cheques be abolished ?
Yes No Should cheques be abolished ?
Yes 3683 votes
No 20130 votes
Now share your opinion
Government departments , such as HM Revenue & Customs and the Department for Work and Pensions , rely on cheques to make millions of payments each year .
Andrew Harrop , head of public policy at Age Concern and Help the Aged , said : ' Many older people use cheques and cash for all their transactions and are uncomfortable with alternative payment methods , such as credit or debit cards with PIN numbers .
' To prevent older people becoming financially excluded , any plans to end the use of cheques must ensure there are alternative ways of paying which they are happy using .'
Vera Cottrell , of the consumer lobby group Which ? , said : ' There are still no cheap , safe alternatives to cheques .
Until that time , cheques should not be withdrawn . '
The Federation of Small Businesses said it will ' strongly oppose ' any move to get rid of cheques .
Sandra Quinn , a director of the Payments Council , said : ' We are completely aware that elderly , disabled and disadvantaged people need alternatives to be in place .
' If the decision is made [ to end the cheque ] , there will be a long time before it comes into effect . '
Count down to 2018 ?
The ancient Romans are believed to have used an early form of cheque known as praescriptiones in the first century BC
The English word cheque comes from the Arabic ṣakk , which refers to a written note of credit used by Muslim merchants
, which refers to a written note of credit used by Muslim merchants
The first cheque in the UK was written in 1659
Cheques are likely to be abolished in Britain in 2018
Cheques are likely to be abolished in Britain in Cheque volumes in the UK peaked in 1990 when 4 billion were written

The predicted number of cheques written per day in the UK in 2018 is 1.6 m
The number of cheques received each year by the average adult is five
The average value of a personal cheque payment is £ 227
The amount of retail spending still paid for by cheque is 3.9 per cent
per cent Oversized cheques are often used during charity events and , regardless of size , can still be redeemed for their cash value as long as they have the same parts as a normal cheque
cheques are often used during charity events and , regardless of size , can still be redeemed for their cash value as long as they have the same parts as a normal cheque According to the Guinness Book of World Records , the largest ever oversized cheque was 12 m by 25 m ( 39 ft × 82 ft )

So at least this whole privacy scandal has n't been for naught .
As a result of it , Mark Zuckerberg has gone from sharing very little of his personal Facebook content with the public to sharing a whole lot , True / Slant 's Kashmir Hill has noticed .
Where the public could see just one photo of the Facebook co-founder in October , strangers now have access to a cache of 290 shots , including snaps uploaded by Zuckerberg and those uploaded by people who have tagged him in their pics .
This opening may be a result of Facebook 's new default settings ; or could be a result of Zuckerberg trying to reverse the PR debacle of the new privacy system by opening up the content himself ; or could be a combination of both .
In any case , it springs one way or another from the privacy controversy .
And as dogged but often frustrated chroniclers of Zuckerberg 's personal side , we 're thrilled .
We just knew this new system would be a boon to gossips like ourselves .
We 've looked at all 290 pics of Zuckerberg , here are our favorites >
US - Aufklärungsdrohne vom Typ " MQ - 1 Predator " ( Bild : Air Force )
Der verstärkte Einsatz von UAVs ( Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ) in Krisengebieten wie dem Irak und Afghanistan hat für das US - Militär nicht nur Vorteile : Wie das Wall Street Journal ( WSJ ) am Donnerstag unter Berufung auf hochrangige Geheimdienstmitarbeiter im Verteidigungsministerium berichtet , ist dem Pentagon schon seit geraumer Zeit bekannt , dass feindliche Kräfte den Datenverkehr zwischen Aufklärungsdrohnen und Bodenstationen abfangen .
Den Angaben zufolge wurden bereits mehrere Laptops sichergestellt , auf denen sich Videomaterial befand , das von US - Drohnen des Typs Predator aufgezeichnet wurde .
In einem Fall sollen Beweise gefunden worden sein , dass Aufständische " Stunden um Stunden , Tage um Tage " das zur Erde gefunkte Videomaterial mitgeschnitten und an andere " extremistische Gruppierungen " weitergegeben hätten .
Ein namentlich nicht genannter Geheimdienstmitarbeiter des Verteidigungsministerium erklärte , das Abfangen von Videodaten gehöre im Irak inzwischen zum Standardrepertoire militanter Gruppen , die vom Iran ausgebildet und finanziell unterstützt würden .
Ausgenutzt werde dabei , dass die zu den Bodenstationen gefunkten Live - Videodaten nicht verschlüsselt seien .
Gefunden wurde auf den sichergestellten Laptops unter anderem das Programm SkyGrabber , das vom russischen Unternehmen SkySoftware für rund 26 US - Dollar vertrieben wird .
Mit SkyGrabber lassen sich Daten abfangen , die Nutzer von Internetverbindungen via Satellit downloaden .
Dass das Programm auch für das Abfangen von Drohnen - Daten genutzt werden könne , sei nicht gewollt und auch nicht bekannt gewesen , teilte ein SkySoftware - Entwickler dem Wall Street Journal auf Anfrage mit .
Das US - Militär versicherte unterdessen , dass bislang weder Soldaten noch Einsätze als Folge der Sicherheitslücke gefährdet gewesen seien .
Auch lägen keine Hinweise vor , dass militante Gruppen jemals die Kontrolle über eine US - Drohne erlangt hätten .
Kritiker weisen jedoch darauf hin , dass der Gegner sich auf Grundlage des abgefangenen Datenmaterials darauf einstellen könne , welche Gebiete , Brücken oder Gebäude im Interesse der US - Streitkräfte stünden und dass dadurch der Überraschungseffekt bei Operationen wegfalle .
Der für die UAV - Strategie der Air Force zuständige Generalleutnant David Deptula sagte , das Militär arbeite an der Beseitigung des Problems .
Deptula fügte aber auch hinzu , dass die Übertragung von Daten per Funk immer Gegenstand von gegnerischen Abhör - und Auswertungsmaßnahmen sei . ( dab ) / ( pmz )
Tuscaloosa Criminal Defense
Lawyer
Your Advocate in Court and in Negotiation Since 1974
For many people , the first time they need to hire a lawyer is the first time they have been either charged with a crime or injured in an accident .
It is an emotional time .
It can be a frightening time .
My name is Joel L. Sogol and I have been a litigator since 1974 .
That means I do n’t just threaten the prosecution with going to court — it means I actually go to court to defend my clients ’ rights .
My extensive trial experience includes both civil and criminal litigation and appeals in the Alabama and federal appellate courts .
When an attorney spends a lot of time in court , the opposing side can be more willing to negotiate .
It ’s a win -win situation .
My clients range from business executives charged with sexual assault , to University of Alabama students arrested for drug trafficking , to a retiree injured in a car accident .
The thing these people all have in common is that they need a good trial lawyer .
Last April , we followed the story of a grassroots coalition in Albuquerque , NM who paid to have 10 billboards criticizing US aid to Israel displayed around the city only to have them taken down under pressure .
Today , the Coalition to Stop $ 30 Billion to Israel , which represents 14 groups from the Catholic , Protestant , Jewish , and Muslim communities of New Mexico , contacted us to let us know that at least one billboard is back up ( pictured above ) .
Noted anti-war protester Cindy Sheehan has endorsed the effort :
" The Albuquerque based Coalition to Stop $ 30 Billion to Israel had ten billboards taken down back in the Spring due to pressure from people who refuse to hold Israel accountable for its human rights record .
This little group of volunteers was knocked down but they ’ve obviously gotten back up again – the proof is that they managed to get their message back up on a billboard again .
Their message is crucial –that a better use of our taxpayer dollars is to provide for our people back home , here in the USA rather than provide military aid to a country that has consistently violated international law and oppresses the Palestinian people .
Kudos to the Coalition for continuing to advocate for a justice - based peace in the Middle East .
I congratulate them on their achievement and hope New Mexicans flood their members of Congress with phone calls asking for an end to military aid to Israel . "
The Coalition says that efforts are underway to have similar billboards erected in San Francisco and Seattle .
" Thighing " is an Islamic practice still followed today even in Muslim communities in the U.S. and Britain :
Regarding the practice of " thighing " , the masterbating between the legs of a female infant or actually sodomizing her , Islamic clerics have this to say :
Pedophilia decrees from www.islamic-fatwa.net
Question 1809
After the permanent committee for the scientific research and fatwahs ( religious decrees ) reviewed the question forwarded by the grand scholar of the committee with reference number 1809 issued on 3/5/1453 and 7/5/1421 ( Islamic calendar )
Question :
‘ It has become widespread these days , and especially during weddings , the habit of mufa ’khathat of the children .
( mufa ’khathat - literally translated , it means “ placing between the thighs ” which means placing the male member between the thighs of a child ) .
What is the opinion of scholars , knowing full well that the prophet , the peace of Allah be upon him , also practiced the “ thighing ” of Aisha - the mother of believers - may Allah be pleased with her ?
Answer :
After studying the issue , the committee has answered as follows :
As for the prophet , his thighing his fiancée Aisha when she was six years of age and not able to consummate the relationship was due to her small age .
That is why the Prophet used to place his male member between her thighs and massage it , as the prophet had control of his male member not like other men .
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , The Supreme Leader of Iran , the Shia Grand Ayatollah , 1979 - 89 said in his official statements :
" A man can quench his sexual lusts with a child as young as a baby .
However , he should not penetrate .
Sodomizing the baby is halal ( allowed by sharia ) .
If the man penetrates and damages the child , then he should be responsible for her subsistence all her life .
This girl , however , does not count as one of his four permanent wives .
The man will not be eligible to marry the girl ’s sister .
It is better for a girl to marry when her menstruation starts , and at her husband 's house rather than her father 's home .
Any father marrying his daughter so young will have a permanent place in heaven . "
Khomeini , " Tahrirolvasyleh " fourth volume , Darol Elm , Gom , Iran , 1990
“ It is not illegal for an adult male to ' thigh ' or enjoy a young girl who is still in the age of weaning ; meaning to place his penis between her thighs , and to kiss her . ”
Ayatu Allah Al Khumaini's " Tahrir Al wasila " p. 241 , issue number 12
" Young boys or girls in full sexual effervescence are kept from getting married before they reach the legal age of majority .
This is against the intention of divine laws .
Why should the marriage of pubescent girls and boys be forbidden because they are still minors , when they are allowed to listen to the radio and to sexually arousing music ? "

MUHAMMAD , THE PROPHET OF ISLAM
PART 1 MECCA
An Arab is regarded as an old man , a sheik , when he is fifty .
Muhammad married Aisha when she was six years old in Mecca and she joined him in Medina three years later when he was 53 .
He began having sex with Aisha when she was nine years old and still playing with dolls .
This is the original story told by the ONLY valid biographers of Muhammad and Islam , Ibn Ishaq and Tabari , and the hadiths of Bukhari and Muslim .
Refer also to the works of the Qur’an commentators Ibn Kathir and Ibn Qayyim .
( Ibn Kathir , The Life of the Prophet Muhammad ( Al - Sira al - Nabawiyya ) , Volume II , translated by professor Trevor Le Gassick , Garnet Publishing Limited , UK .

Muhammad said that he had dreamed of Aisha before demanding her from her father , and his own brother in Islam , Abu Bakr , claiming special ‘ prophets rights ’ when Abu Bakr was reluctant to give her to him .
Bukhari , Volume 5 , Book 58 , Number 235 : Narrated ' Aisha :
That the Prophet said to her , " You have been shown to me twice in my dreams .
I saw you pictured on a piece of silk and someone said to me , ' This is your wife . '
When I uncovered the picture , I saw that it was yours .
I said , ' If this is from Allah , it will be done . "
Bukhari , Volume 7 , Book 62 , Number 18 : Narrated ' Ursa : The Prophet asked Abu Bakr for ' Aisha 's hand in marriage .
Abu Bakr said " But I am your brother ! "
The Prophet said , " You are my brother in Allah 's religion and His Book , but she ( Aisha ) is lawful for me to marry . "
Marriage to a female already offered to another was illegal in Arab law .
Abu Bakr had already arranged for Aisha to marry Djubayr Mutim .
Muhammad married ‘ A’isha in Mecca when she was a child of six and lived with her in Medina when she was nine or ten .
She was the only virgin that he married .
Her father , Abu Bakr , married her to him and the apostle gave her four hundred dirhams .
( Ibn Ishaq , Sirat Rasulullah ( The Life of Muhammad ) translated by Alfred Guillaume [ Oxford University Press , p. 792 )
Tabari VII :7 “ The Prophet married Aisha in Mecca three years before the Hijrah , after the death of Khadija .
At the time she was six . ”
Tabari IX :128
“ When the Prophet married Aisha , she was very young and not yet ready for consummation . ”

Food Poisoning Blamed In Second Northwest Flight 253 Bomb Scare Nigerian passenger became " unruly " after crew forced him out of bathroom .
Dec. 27 , 2009  --
A second scare of a possible bomb on Northwest Airlines flight 253 Sunday was the result of a passenger who refused to come out of the bathroom because he was sick with food poisoning , law enforcement officials told ABCNews.com .
FBI agents and local police swarmed the plane as it landed in Detroit just after 12:30 local time after the pilot reported an " belligerent and uncooperative " passenger who had spent more than an hour in the bathroom as the flight neared Detroit .
Authorities said the passenger was a 36 - year old Nigerian petroleum engineer who became unhappy when he was ordered to his seat one hour before landing , as required under new in - flight rules following the attempted Christmas day bombing of the same flight by another Nigerian citizen .
The passenger supervises 90 employees at the multinational petroleum company he works for in Yemen .
One official said he appeared to be traveling with his wife .
Authorities took passengers and all baggage of the Northwest flight in a remote location at the Detroit airport .
There were 256 passengers on the Amsterdam to Detroit flight .
Officials gave an " all clear " message a short time later after interviewing the Nigerian passenger and determining he was , indeed , ill .
Abdulmutallab Moved to ' Secure Location '
Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Sara Kuban said in a statement that the flight was directed to taxi to a remote area of the airport on landing due after the airline had notified TSA of the passenger 's " unusual behavior . "
Kuban said the passenger was removed from the flight and interviewed by the FBI .
" Indications at this time are that the individual 's behavior is due to legitimate illness , " said Kuban , " and no other suspicious behavior or materials have been found . "
A NORAD spokesman said fighter jets were not scrambled : " We were aware of the situation , but military assistance was not requested . "
The Nigerian accused of attempting to blow up Northwest flight 253 on Christmas Day , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , told investigators he was part of a " larger plot " and that he believed there were other potential bombers set on similar missions on American aircraft , according to law enforcement officials .
READ THE CRIMINAL COMPLAINT AGAINST ABDULMUTALLAB HERE
Abdulmutallab , who suffered burns in the incident , was moved from the burn unit of a Michigan hospital to " a secure location , " according to a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney 's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan .
According to Abdulmutallab's attorney , Miriam Siefer , he has been moved to the federal correctional facility in Milan , Michigan .
One of the main reasons Federal Reserve policy makers have been able to keep monetary policy so stimulative in the face of an economic recovery is their steadfast confidence that inflation is , and will remain , quiescent .
But two new papers from the central bank challenge that outlook .
One , published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis , warns price pressures may rise more quickly than thought in coming years .
Another , from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , notes the uncertainty of the Fed ’s framework for divining the nation ’s inflationary potential .
What happens with inflation is always a key matter for the Fed .
But in the current environment , tame price pressures and the expectation they ’ll stay that way are even more important .
Low inflation gives the Fed considerable breathing room to keep interest rates low and provide other forms of support in an environment in which economic growth is tepid and halting .
If price pressures were to accelerate , the central bank would likely have to respond with a tightening in policy , even if economy was ill - prepared to deal with that action–a choice it would rather not have to make .
The St. Louis Fed paper , written by bank economist Kevin Kliesen , sees inflation risks coming from several sources .
One problem spot could be that the Fed misjudges the economy ’s ability to create price pressures .
It ’s possible policy makers will misgauge the so - called output gap , which is the difference between the economy ’s potential–its ability to growth without fueling inflation–and actual rates of growth .
The wider the gap , the lower the economy ’s likely level of inflation .
“ The size of the output gap might be smaller than conventional wisdom might believe , ” Kliesen wrote .
“ If so , those who foresee little risk to the near - term inflation outlook because of a large , persistent output gap may be too optimistic . ”
He also warns the Fed ’s current policy stance –interest rates are effectively set at zero percent , mortgage asset purchases continue until the end of the first quarter–may distort financial markets .
“ Although low interest rates are a key part of the FOMC ’s strategy to boost economic growth and cement the health of the economic recovery , there might still be a danger of inflating asset prices by encouraging investors and speculators to shift out of low - yield assets like Treasury securities into higher - yielding assets like commodity contracts or other tangible financial assets , ” Kliesen noted .
And while it ’s not part of the Fed ’s portfolio , huge government budget deficits also pose a risk to a stable inflation environment , he wrote .
The St. Louis
Fed economist ’s anxiety over the output - gap issue is backed up by Thomas Lubik , an economist at the Richmond Fed .
In his paper , Lubik warns “ uncertainty ” over the correct way to measure the gap makes this concept , as central bankers now understand it , “ a potentially faulty gauge ” for assessing the economic situation and guiding monetary policy .
That increases the chance of policy leading to a bad outcome .
Some of the worries shown by the Fed economists extend to the policy - making level .
In a speech Thursday , Kansas City Fed chief Thomas Hoenig reclaimed his role as the most aggressive advocate for undoing the current state of policy .
He said he ’d like to see policy tightened “ sooner rather than later ” lest the central bank let inflation bloom and allow overly - easy policy to distort financial markets .
For now , however , most of the central bank ’s weight rests behind maintaining the status quo of low interest rates .
While the economy appears to be recovering , there is even a reappraisal of Fed ’s mortgage - buying program now .
The program is scheduled to conclude at the end of the first quarter but some officials are now leaning toward keeping the effort alive longer , fearing the critical mortgage market may not yet be able to function properly without Fed support .

Rachel Maddow ’s Response to Obama ’s Afghanistan Escalation Speech ( video )
Watch Rachel Maddow ’s post - speech comment on whether Obama is keeping the Bush Doctrine alive in Afghanistan .
Visit msnbc.com for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy
In case you missed it , here ’s the full video of President Barack Obama ’s speech Tuesday night on the Afghanistan war .

Jon Stewart ripped into Fox News for posting a graphic in response to the hacked emails of climate change scientists about their use of statistics in support of global warming .
Stewart seized on the idea that Fox News and Friends co-host Gretchen Carlson might not be as stupid as she seems on the air .
The graphic , reporting misleadingly the figures about public opinion from a Rasmussen poll , showed responses to the question :
“ Did scientists falsify research to support their own theories on Global Warming ? ”
Advertisements
The question results posted were :
59 % Somewhat Likely
35 % Very Likely
26 % Not Very Likely
Here is the video :
If you are able to do the math , as Stewart is , that adds up to 120 % , which implies that there was some cherry picking of figures going on here to create an intended impression .
I have no idea how many viewers typically check the math on news , or pseudo - news , programming ; but I would suspect that most viewers are focused on the commentary more than on fact checking what is in front of them on screen .
Now while the statistics are not over a line with that 120 % listed as the total underneath – and yes , this becomes important later on !
– the voice over wording does add the numbers together .
“ About 60 % of you say Somewhat Likely , 35 % say Very Likely .
So you got 90 , you got a lot of people right there thinking it is likely , although 26 % say Not Very Likely . ”
Apparently
Fox talking heads have to read their graphics to their viewers , and it would seem that where you have that talking head in this case doing the math , he stops himself when he realizes how the figures in the graphic add up .
He does n’t point out that if 94 % disbelieve scientists falsify global warming , then you ca n’t have another 26 % believing they have n’t .
Instead , he switches in mid-sentence to “ you got a lot of people right there thinking it is likely ( falsified research ) .
Now apart from the condescension inherent in the graphic which assumes no one watching will catch the math discrepancy ( to use a nice word for it ) , and apart from the implied misrepresentation of the information that is in the Rasmussen poll – they do better math than this – is the unintended irony pointed out by Stewart that this is Fox news “ massaging ” the data in a story that is about scientists possibly misrepresenting their data .
Pot. Kettle .
Black and blacker .
Wearing his usual dyspeptic expression of dismay as he contemplates the graphic and then looks into the camera , Stewart wryly observes , “ So in attacking scientists for falsifying data to support their theories on global warming , you ’ve cited a poll that adds up to 120 % .
This is , ah … …. what ’s known in the business …. what ’s known in the business as perfection . ”
But Stewart does n’t stop there , because Fox did n’t stop there with the realization of it ’s first talking head that there was a problem .
Fox wanted to push their skewed view , damn the data .
Stewart went on to note in sarcastic understatement , “ The only way you could , perhaps , top this Sundae , is with a couple of nuts completely ignoring the mathematical impossibility in front of them to further solidify their talking points du jour . ”
He refers to the comment that “ In the spirit of fairness , I believe that question was asked before these emails were revealed , so that poll number may actually be different now . ”
As one of the other talking heads elaborates , “ Substantially higher ? ” , and is answered “ It might be , yes . ” .
This is followed with “ Close to100 % now ? ” and derisive laughter on the Fox news set in the clip .
Or maybe it was nervous laughter from talking heads who realized they were lying through their teeth and might get caught at it if someone did the math .
Yeah , now it might be up to 130 % , or maybe even 150 % , or 200 % , depending on who at Fox News is doing the graphics and cherry - picking data .
Stewart continues in his observations on Fox News with “ Yeah , actually , actually , in the spirit of fairness , we should mention that this , this Rasmussen poll had a margin of error of monkey - bleeped - ridiculous . ”
Ah , but ya gotta love Stewart , he does n’t stop here either .
He goes on to rip
Fox , calling them out on their badly slanted so - called news coverage , so opposite from their espoused motto of “ fair and balanced ” news .
He rightly ( pun intended ) labels their approach “ passive - aggressive wonderment ” , providing a sarcastic exaggeration of their reasoning .
Speaking as if he were a Fox News commenter , he said “ Is n’t it interesting that Obama gave a speech in Berlin ?
You know , Hitler used to speak in Berlin . ”
He then segues with the comment “ We begin to believe that the organization may be a tad disingenuous .
Now I believe that Gretchen Carlson may be another example of this . ”
Stewart focuses his attention specifically on talking head Gretchen Carlson , whom I have followed since her early days , before her career in the media .
Carlson is yet another right wing beauty pageant queen , this one from the Minnesota .
Stewart pans Carlson for her persona on Fox and Friends as “ a troubled mom , who is just trying to make sense of this crazy , modern country we ’ve got .
Like when Hugo Chavez referred to Obama as an ignoramus . ”
In a clip of Carlson , she states “ I just wanted to see how much of an insult it was to be called an ignoramus .
Since I did n’t know what it meant , I just googled it . ”
Let me interject here that Minnesota , where Carlson grew up , has a pretty decent and competitive educational system in the public schools .
As a product of that same educational system , I can assure readers we were taught a respectable vocabulary , including words like ignoramus .
And when we genuinely do n’t know the meaning of a word – as contrasted with Carlson ’s statement here – we were taught how to use a dictionary , not just reliance on search engines like Google .
I found the notion that Carlson is n’t familiar with this word to be even more improbable than Stewart found it .
The clip of Carlson continues with her stating “ For all of you out there who do n’t know what ignoramus is , like me … ”
This is a blatant case of Carlson dumbing down her real intellect and education .
I do n’t know what is more offensive here , her deception , or the assumption that she has a stupid audience to whom she has to pander .
Now , without looking it up , I knew – as I assume readers here would know – that ignoramus is more usually used to mean ANY ignorant person .
Carlson however defines it more specifically , on Fox News , as “ It ’s an ignorant lawyer .
We all know Barak Obama IS a lawyer ” .
Carlson is not actually wrong either .
If you research the word , it derives from the latin , ignorare , which translates “ to be ignorant ” .
There was a play titled “ Ignoramus ” waaaay back in 1615 , by the English playwright G. Ruggle who used the word as a name for a character .
That usage also derives from the legal terminology , “ a grand jury ’s endorsement upon a bill of indictment when evidence is deemed insufficient to send the case to a trial jury ” according to the American Heritage Dictionary .
Carlson is , to borrow a phrase from my grandmother , “ dumb like a fox ” ( pun intended ) .
Stewart picks up on this playing dumb by Carlson , when he goes on to mimic her , speaking in falsetto , “ I mean I ’m no fan of Chavez , but Obama IS a lawyer . ”
In his own voice , Stewart continues “ and of course all that talk about money and business just confuses the heck out of the old girl ” , going on to mock Carlson ’s pretense that she did n’t understand the economic term “ double dip recession ’ .
Continuing in the falsetto as if he were Carlson , Stewart says “ So it turns out that double dip means that Obama is not taking us all out for ice cream , but leading the country to an economic disaster . ”
He similarly excoriates Carlson over pretending to be unfamiliar with the word Czar when Stewart says “ How do you get a job on television if you appear to be one of those people who need to pin their address to their coat so a stranger can help them find their way home ?
Unless , unless …unless …unless you are just dumbing yourself down to connect with an audience that you think sees intellect as an eletist flaw . ”
Noting “ But that would be easy to check ” , Stewart gives the results of googling Gretchen Carlson , he notes that she was valedictorian of her high school , and went to college at Stanford , graduating with honors , then spending time abroad studying at Oxford , “ not the Mississippi one , the Europe one . ”
Stewart then continues on about Carlson ’s talent competition performance as an accomplished classical violinist , when she won the 1989 Miss America pageant .
He sarcastically observed “ Of course , if she entered today , she ’d probably just dress up like Raggedy Ann and sing “ My Funny Valentine ” . ”
Stewart ends his segment on Carlson and Fox News with “ Gretchen , Baby , come back !
You do n’t have to stash your IQ in an off shore account .
Just ’ cause you ’re on the couch with Jack Tripper and Janet does n’t mean you have to pretend to be Chrissy .
So I do n’t want to have to turn you on tomorrow and see you are actually surprised that the Interior Secretary is in charge of the outside stuff .
From now on , I want to see you give it 120 % . ”
Ya gotta love Jon Stewart .

After doing The Man from Another Place I would sometimes see people in public , and they 'd start trembling .
You know , like , " This REALLY is n't going well ... "
Over on the DotPhysics blog , Rhett Allain confronts the technical impossibility presented by the flying R2D2 as depicted in the prequel trilogy .
This is what physics degrees are for :
If I assume that R2 is flying horizontally at a constant velocity , and the the " thrust " is at an angle theta from the vertical then :
I guess I should say I am using g as the local gravitational field for whatever planet he ( R2 ) is on .
Is R2 even a he ?
Maybe R2 is a she .
I do n't know .
The point is that the vertical component of the thrust must equal the vertical component of the gravitational force .

' Messiah ' : Goel Ratzon denies any sexual crimes have been committed
Israeli police have arrested a 60 - year - old self - styled Jewish sage with a reported harem of up to 30 wives and 60 children on suspicion of incest and sexual abuse .
Goel Ratzon , who has been dubbed by the local media as ‘ Israel ’s Josef Fritzl ’ is alleged to have kept the women and children as ‘ slaves ’ in squalid apartments around Tel Aviv .
Ratzon was remanded in custody on Tuesday , a police spokesman said after a gagging order was lifted on Thursday .
An undercover investigation was started in June last year after one woman came forward to complain of abuse .
' The evidence shows the suspect controlled his women with a firm hand , including their possessions and their money , ' said a police statement , which added that Ratzon had written a ' rule book ' for women he kept in ' conditions of slavery ' .
' He would dictate what they could and could not do , limit their movements and impose sanctions and various punishments , including the use of violence if they refused to obey . '
Among the more serious allegations , police said Ratzon was suspected of fathering children with some of his own daughters .
Police said 17 women and about 40 children were involved .
Several women who identified themselves as Ratzon 's wives appeared in an Israeli television documentary aired last year .
They were filmed feeding him and combing his hair .
' He is the messiah everyone is talking about , ' one said .
' He is already here and he has n't been revealed yet .
The day he decides to reveal himself , the land will shake . '
The women wore the heavy dress of Orthodox Jews and bore tattoos of the bearded , bespectacled Ratzon 's face .
He was also interviewed , introducing several of his children , all of whom had names with variations on Goel - Hebrew for ' redeemer ' .
' I'm perfect , ' Ratzon said in the documentary .
' I have all the qualities a woman wants . '
Ratzon 's lawyer , Shlomtzion Gabai , said about 30 women and 60 children were linked to her client : ' As far as he is concerned , no sexual crimes have been committed , ' she told Israel Radio .
' The women consented willingly to relations . '
The children have been taken into care and some of the women have been let free .
Ratzon is on remand in a Tel Aviv jail , awaiting a court appearance .
Ratzon 's rule book
1 No women shall marry nor shall any woman attack another , either verbally or physically .
Fine : 2,000 shekels ( £ 330 ) into the family kitty
2 No woman shall question another about her whereabouts .
Fine : 100 shekels

5 Any two women caught fighting will be punished equally .
Fine : 2,000 shekels
6 It is absolutely forbidden to question Ratzon on his whereabouts or intention .
Fine : 400 shekels
7 It is permissible to ask to accompany him ; but refusal is to be accepted without appeal .
Fine : 300 shekels
8 No woman shall interrupt Ratzon or intervene in matters not concerning her .

An investigative report published on TomDispatch.com about U.S. forces ’ operations in Afghanistan paints a gruesome picture of surprise night raids , indiscriminate killing and random detention of civilians during those raids , as well as what appears to be widespread use of torture of Afghan detainees .
The story by Anand Gopal , dated Jan. 28 and to be published in the Nation magazine as well , cites gross human rights violations just as officials from 70 nations and organizations are in London for a conference to help Afghanistan emerge from conflict .
The report shows that the violations continued well after U.S. President Barack Obama took office last year , despite U.S. and NATO emphasis on winning the hearts and minds of local Afghans as counterinsurgency operations are stepped up .
The chief U.S. military commander in Afghanistan , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , had promised to wage a cleaner war in which there would be fewer home raids and civilian casualties .
" If you talk to a lot of rural Pashtuns , they say they want to be protected , but they want to be protected from both the U.S. military and the Taliban , " Gopal told IPS , referring to members of Afghanistan ’s largest ethnic group .
" And if that ’s the case , then I think the counterinsurgency approach has n’t been implemented in the way that they are hoping to implement it . "
Gopal cited a number of instances , reported in his story , where U.S. troops randomly and frenziedly shot civilians in their homes during night raids on villages , generating outrage and indignation among terrified locals .
The villages were raided either because of ambushes by Taliban fighters in the area or because of the alleged presence of wanted suspects , based on intelligence which often turned out to be false .
In one case , in November 2009 , a team of U.S. soldiers attacked the house of Majidullah Qarar , the spokesman for the Afghan minister of agriculture , in search of his cousin , Habib - ur - Rahman , a computer programmer and government employee .
In the process , they killed two of Qarar ’s other cousins , who were unarmed .
One was shot when he ran towards the door , the other as he tried to help his bleeding cousin .
The soldiers finally found Rahman in the house .
Rehmatullah Muhammad , an Afghan villager from the central - eastern Wardak Province , said he and nine other villagers were rounded up in a night raid last year and were taken to a detention facility on Rish Khor , an Afghan military base .
The detention center inside the base turned out to be run by plain - clothed Americans , although it is not clear whether they were members of the military , the Central Intelligence Agency or private contractors .
From the secret facility at Rish Khor , Muhammad and his fellow villagers were sent to the U.S. - run prison at Bagram Air Base , where they did not have access to lawyers and were made to appear before a review panel .
" I was only allowed to answer yes or no and not explain anything at my hearing , " Muhammad told Gopal .
Now , in Zaiwalat , Muhammad ’s small village of 300 people , the villagers are " afraid of the dark " because of what they have undergone during night raids .
During the last two years , 16 people have been killed in 10 night raids just in that village .
According to Gopal ’s sources , there is another secret prison on Bagram Air Base that has got a " notorious reputation for abusive behavior . "
IPS queried the Pentagon on the night raids and secret prisons , but military officials declined to comment , and referred IPS to the State Department , which in turn failed to return telephone calls .
Gopal reports that of the 24 people he interviewed for the story , 17 claimed they had been abused at or on route to U.S. - run prisons , in ways reminiscent of the widely - publicized abuses at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq .
Doctors , members of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission and government officials corroborated 12 of these claims .
Torture practices included deprivation of sleep for hours or even days in some cases , suspending prisoners upside - down from the ceiling , holding them in " stress positions " , and using dogs to frighten and in some cases bite the prisoners .
Gopal ’s story is the first to probe night raids in Afghanistan in detail , and one of the very few to investigate the existence of U.S. - run secret prisons in the country .
Human rights groups have repeatedly voiced concerns over the deteriorating conditions in Afghanistan , in particular in the southern and eastern parts of the country where the Taliban insurgency is strongest .
" The U.S. military has made some important concessions but we currently do not have access to either detainees or the full range of sites , " said an Amnesty International staff member on the condition of anonymity .
" We do n’t have any means of assessing what the actual conditions are because we do n’t have anyone on the ground , and we do n’t have a mechanism where Afghan partners or international partners can go and find out . "
In its annual assessment of human rights conditions in Afghanistan during 2009 , the New - York based Human Rights Watch criticized the U.S. for " rarely " discussing " the importance of human rights protections for Afghans " and continuing to detain hundreds of Afghans " without adequate legal process . "
With a Taliban insurgency raging in parts of Afghanistan and U.S. - led NATO forces expanding their operations , fears appear to be growing among Afghan officials regarding the likely civilian casualties .
Despite the myriad problems facing his country , from rampant corruption to lack of security and the illegal narcotics trade , Afghan President Hamid Karzai chose to echo deep public resentments over attacks on civilians as his main demand from international forces in his country .
" We ’re not going to ask for more cash .
We ’re going to ask the international community to end nighttime raids on Afghan homes , to stop arresting Afghans , to reduce and eliminate civilian casualties , " Karzai told Al Jazeera television earlier this month ahead of the London conference .
" We ’re going to ask them not to have Afghan prisoners taken . "
According to the United Nations , of the 2,021 Afghan civilians killed in the first 10 months of 2009 , 23 percent of the deaths were attributed to international military forces and 69 percent to " anti-government elements . "
That is less than the figure for the same period of 2008 , when the international forces were responsible for more than one - third of civilian casualties .

Michael Schumacher signs up for F1 return with Mercedes
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement Seven - times Formula 1 world champion Michael Schumacher has come out of retirement and signed for Mercedes .
The German , who will be 41 on 3 January , was unveiled at the Mercedes factory in Brackley , Northamptonshire .
Schumacher will partner compatriot Nico Rosberg in the team that won the drivers ' and constructors ' titles in 2009 in its former guise as Brawn .
" After three years I have the energy back and I 'm ready for some serious stuff , " said Schumacher .
In an exclusive interview with the BBC he added : " I 'm very motivated , thrilled and excited .
" I want to have fun out there and I feel as fresh as ever .
I 've recharged myself after a three - year break .
" The challenge is what I look for - I want to know it . "
ANDREW BENSON BLOG
As good as ever , or not quite as good as that , probably still amounts to a man capable of winning the championship
Schumacher retired at the end of 2006 but will now return to the sport he dominated after signing a three - year deal with Mercedes .
He will reportedly earn £ 6.2 m after reuniting with Mercedes team principal Ross Brawn , who masterminded all seven of his titles , the first two with Benetton in 1994 - 5 and the subsequent five with Ferrari from 2000 - 4 .
Schumacher was forced to call off a planned temporary comeback as a stand - in for injured Ferrari driver Felipe Massa in the summer because of a neck injury sustained in a motorcycle accident last February .
But Schumacher recently underwent medical checks and is confident he is back to full fitness .
" I would n't have entered all of this if I was n't confident , " Schumacher explained .
" That confidence comes from some serious training with my neck to make sure it can withstand what it could n't in the summer .
" There is no further issue with the neck - 100 % . "
SCHUMACHER STATS & FACTS Team : Mercedes Team- mate : Nico Rosberg Previous teams : Jordan , Benetton , Ferrari Nationality : German Born : 03/01/1969 , Hürth - Hermülheim Grand Prix debut : Belgium , 1991 World championships : 7 ( 1994 , '95 , 2000 , '01 , 02 , '03 , ' 04 ) All - time records : 7 drivers ' championships ; 248 grand prix starts ; 91 race wins ; 68 pole positions ; 154 podium finishes
This summer Schumacher signed a revised contract as a consultant for Ferrari , but the Italian team have had to release him from his contract to enable him to race for the " Silver Arrows " .
Schumacher revealed that it was Ferrari 's request for him to fill in for Massa that sparked a desire to make a permanent return to the cockpit .
" It initiated something that I did n't know was there before , " he conceded .
" I really did n't feel like it was what I wanted when Ferrari asked me but when I felt the responsibility I thought I ought to do it .
" What Ferrari initiated has triggered what you see right now .

" I have to say it 's been a tough to leave the Ferrari family , which has been a big part of my career . "
Schumacher revealed he had spoken to Brawn in November about a potential return to F1 and that the return of the Mercedes name to F1 proved the final persuasion .
" I got a call from Ross asking me to race again , telling me Mercedes were going to be involved , " added Schumacher .
" The only reason I came back was because of old friends at Mercedes .
I spent years trying to get into F1 with Mercedes but it was n't possible before .
" I hope I 'll be judged by what I 've done before but Mercedes is a strong partner and I 'm thrilled to be back . "
Schumacher and Brawn 's partnership is set to be revived in 2010 Mercedes have completely changed their driver line - up following world champion Jenson Button 's departure to McLaren and Rubens Barrichello 's move to Williams .
The team are known to want German rising star Sebastian Vettel in the long term , but the 22 - year - old is contracted to Red Bull until the end of 2012 .
Rosberg signed for Mercedes shortly after the season and , after weeks of speculation , Schumacher arrives as his high - profile team - mate .
" We are incredibly excited by Michael Schumacher , " said Brawn .
" He is the best judge of what he can do .
He told me he can do it so I 'm very confident .
" I have absolute trust in him .
He 'll do the job . "
Brawn added that Button 's decision to leave the team led to his pursuit of Schumacher .
" Jenson was not pushed , " stated Brawn .
" We have loyalty to Jenson but when that became difficult we started talking to Michael . "
Schumacher 's comeback is the most high profile in F1 since Austrian Niki Lauda came out of a two - year retirement for the 1982 season to race for McLaren .
Lauda , who was 33 at the time , went on to win a third world title in 1984 .
He told me he can do it so I 'm very confident
Mercedes team principal Ross Brawn Juan Manuel Fangio is Formula 1's oldest world champion , the Argentine won a fifth world championship at the age of 46 before retiring .
Nigel Mansell won the 1994 Australian Grand Prix at the age of 41 , having stepped in as a substitute for Williams for four races following the death of Ayrton Senna .
Now , Schumacher has said that he intends to make a glorious comeback by challenging for the 2010 world championship .
" I have won the title seven times and the team won both titles last year , so what do you expect , " said Schumacher , who has broken almost every major record in the sport .
Schumacher flew into the UK to visit the Mercedes factory " Now Mercedes are team owners you cannot expect anything else other than the world title .
" That is what we aim for but we have to deliver and that is our job .
" Honestly I can't wait until the 1 February when we will officially run the car . "
Schumacher 's decision brings his career to a neat conclusion - Mercedes , for whom he was racing in sportscars at the time , paid for his F1 debut with Jordan in 1991 but he has never raced for them in F1 .
Mercedes pulled out of F1 in 1955 after winning back - to - back titles with Juan Manuel Fangio .

THE world 's fastest train hit its first speed bump in the form of a disobedient smoker less than a week after it began running in southern China .
A cigarette triggered an alarm that forced a two - and - a - half hour stoppage , nearly as long as the train takes to cover the 1100 km distance between Guangzhou , capital of Guangdong province , and the central city of Wuhan .
Managers of the bullet train , which debuted on Saturday , were unable to catch the smoker who fled the scene before the alarm sounded , the official Xinhua news agency reported .
" Smoking is strictly forbidden on the Wuhan - Guangzhou high - speed train , even in the toilet , " a spokesman with the Guangzhou Railway Group Corporation said .
" It could trigger the alarm and even cause equipment failures . "
The train was in the Guangzhou rail station when it was delayed and had not yet begun its 350 km / h journey , Xinhua added .

The most common reasons for medical evacuation of military personnel from war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan in recent years have been fractures , tendonitis and other musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders , not combat injuries , according to results of a Johns Hopkins study published January 22 in The Lancet .
" Most people think that in a war , getting shot is the leading cause of medical evacuation , but it almost never is , " says study leader Steven P. Cohen , M.D. , associate professor of anesthesiology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and a colonel in the U.S. Army Reserves .
" As in the past , disease and non -battle - related injuries continue to be the major sources of service - member attrition and that 's not likely to change .
It 's likely to get worse . "
The Johns Hopkins researchers looked at the records of more than 34,000 members of the military who were sent to the military 's medical center in Landstuhl , Germany from 2004 through 2007 .
The top three grounds for medical evacuation were musculoskeletal or connective tissue disorders ( 24 percent ) , combat injuries ( 14 percent ) and neurological disorders ( 10 percent ) .
There was n't much change in those percentages over the course of the four years analyzed , but the percentage of personnel leaving with psychiatric diagnoses continued to rise each year , an increase seen despite the introduction of mental health teams devoted to treating combat stress on site .
Cohen and his colleagues believe these increases may partly be the result of the cumulative psychological effects of repeated deployments and the increasing manpower burden borne by reserve and National Guard units .
Those factors are unlikely to change as the wars continue , they say .
Most of those evacuated from Iraq and Afghanistan for medical and psychiatric reasons do n't return , the data show .
In 2007 , only one in five military personnel returned to duty in the country from which they were evacuated .
Previous studies have shown that the farther away from the deployment area soldiers are treated , the less likely they are to return to duty in that war zone .
A previous study by Cohen showed that when military personnel with back pain were taken to a pain clinic in Iraq , all patients returned to their units .
When they were sent to pain clinics in Germany or in Washington , fewer than 2 percent did .
" The planes go from East to West , not from West to East , " he says .
The new study also found that patients who were senior officers were more likely to return to duty after evacuation , likely because they have chosen careers in the military , Cohen says .
Service members of all ranks with combat injuries , psychiatric disorders , musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders , and spinal pain were less likely to return .
One reason for so many non-battle - related injuries , Cohen says , is the changing nature of warfare .
" We have a lot of people in Afghanistan and Iraq and their main job is n't fighting , " he said .
Cohen says it is important for the military to understand the reasons why its personnel are being evacuated and to work to better prevent injuries and illness .
Wherever possible , he says , medical staff in Iraq and Afghanistan should be trained to aggressively treat problems early before they snowball .
" For some of the musculoskeletal problems , you may not be able to prevent them , " he says .
" Most people doing their jobs in heavy gear , like Kevlar , are going to get overuse injuries like knee pain , hip pain and bursitis .
But you need to recognize and treat problems before they become severe . "
Other Johns Hopkins researchers involved in the study include Charlie Brown , M.D. , Connie Kurihara , R.N. , and Anthony Plunkett , M.D .
The research was funded by the John P. Murtha Neuroscience and Pain Institute in Johnstown , Penn. ; the U.S. Army ; and the Army Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine Initiative .
Level three means a full eruption is likely in the very near future .
The scale runs from one to five , with five meaning an eruption is occurring .
WASHINGTON 
In the great health care debate of 2009 , President Obama has cast himself as a cold - eyed pragmatist , willing to compromise in exchange for votes .
Now ideology  an uprising on the Democratic left  is smacking the pragmatic president in the face .
Stung by the intense White House effort to court the votes of moderate holdouts like Senator Joseph I. Lieberman , independent of Connecticut , and Senator Ben Nelson , Democrat of Nebraska , liberals are signaling that they have compromised enough .
Grass - roots groups are balking , liberal commentators are becoming more critical of the president , some unions are threatening to withhold support and Howard Dean , the former Democratic Party chief , is urging the Senate to kill its health bill .
The White House scrambled Thursday to tamp down the revolt , which has been simmering for weeks but boiled over when the Senate Democratic leadership , bowing to Mr. Lieberman , scrapped language allowing people as young as 55 to buy into Medicare .
David Axelrod , Mr. Obama ’s senior adviser , began the day by calling in to MSNBC to urge the party to hold together , warning of a “ tragic outcome ” if Democrats failed to pass a bill that the White House says would expand health coverage while reining in costs .
Google moved quickly to announce that it would stop censoring its Chinese service after realising dissidents were at risk from attempts to use the company 's technology for political surveillance , according to a source with direct knowledge of the internet giant 's most senior management .
China this morning issued a statement saying it resolutely opposed hacking and was itself a victim of cyber attacks , in its first response to Google 's hacking claims .
In a statement posted on the state council information office website , cabinet spokesman Wang Chen reminded companies of their need to abide by internet controls , citing their " social responsibilities " .
The remarks did not mention Google directly .
The source told the Guardian the company 's decision was largely influenced by the experiences of Sergey Brin 's Russian refugee background .
The Google co-founder " felt this very personally " , the source said .
" The notion that somebody would try to turn Google 's tools into tools of political surveillance was something he found deeply offensive . "
When it became clear that the cyber attacks were about political surveillance , people at the very top of the company " decided they no longer wanted to participate in this kind of behaviour , " said the source .
" It was felt that whether it 's censorship or whether it 's surveillance or threats to people who speak out this is all about suppression of free speech and was something the company no longer felt in conscience they could stand by that . "
The US government intervened in the confrontation yesterday , urging Beijing to answer Google 's claim of a massive hacking attack .
Chinese authorities initially responded cautiously to Google 's announcement .
In the government 's first public remarks , an official said it was " seeking more information " .
The unnamed official from China 's state council information office – the cabinet spokesman 's office – added : " It is still hard to say whether Google will quit China or not .
Nobody knows . "
It is thought that as many as 20 other companies including internet and mobile phone businesses were also being attacked in order to carry out political surveillance , or industrial espionage , according to the source .
Google acknowledged that it might have to withdraw from China .
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , said : " We have been briefed by Google on these allegations , which raise very serious concerns and questions .
We look to the Chinese government for an explanation .
The ability to operate with confidence in cyberspace is critical in a modern society and economy . "
Google is understood to want to try to work with Beijing , according to the senior company source , who added it was " hopeful that they can accept that this is a new century , it 's a new time .
I do n't think it 's the Chinese government as a whole … but I think there are some left over elements of totalitarianism in China , be it in government or be it in hackers or what not .
But those elements – it 's time for them to go .
It 's time the Chinese people had unfettered access to information . "
In a CNBC interview , David Drummond , senior vice - president of corporate development , chief legal officer , and author of the Google announcement , said : " We are not saying one way or the other whether the attacks are state - sponsored or done with any approval of the state .
" We do know that it was very organised and the attack came from China and political dissidents and people interested in human rights in China were clearly targeted . "
Google spoke to the Chinese government yesterday but has not disclosed what form the contact took or who was involved .
" We have talked to the Chinese authorities and we will be talking to them more in the coming days , " it said .
The Google source said the company decided to move quickly once it realised what was happening because they felt " a moral obligation to the dissidents to let them know they might be at risk " .
" Unfortunately we could see the dark side of technology , when they tried to subvert the things we 're building into tools of political suppression , which is the ultimate inverse of everything we stand for .
So that was also troubling , but the connection , once we saw and understood – that 's when it really hit home . "
News portals in China were reportedly told to downgrade coverage of the issue , but articles on several sites including the English language Xinhua site carried accounts of Google 's decision , including references to censorship , but not hacking .
While campaign groups such as Human Rights Watch praised the firm 's decision , it received a mixed reception in Beijing , even among admirers .
Several people left flowers at the entrance to its headquarters , along with a sign reading : " Google – a real man . "
But prominent liberal blogger , Ran Yunfei , wrote : " Google leaving China is definitely not good news . "
Comparing the company to dissidents who emigrate , he added : " Those who would remain are obedient citizens and [ that is ] satisfactory to the authorities . "
Isaac Mao , a Chinese blogger who in 2007 published a widely circulated open letter to the firm criticising it for self - censorship , said : " I think Google has eventually made the right decision to fight back based on their principles . "
When it launched google .cn in 2006 , the company said it believed the benefits of increased access to information for people in China outweighed the negative impact of self - censorship .
But it was widely criticised for the decision .
Google has around a third of the Chinese search market , lagging far behind the domestic firm Baidu .
Kaiser Kuo , a Beijing - based expert on the internet , said : " There are two schools of thought on this .
One says that this is a mere smokescreen of sanctimony meant to hide a retreat from a market Google was unable to conquer for business reasons ...
The other is that this is a true act of moral bravery . "
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Google had briefed the Obama administration before its China announcement .
He said the president believed in the " freedom of the internet " .
A businessman who fought off knife - wielding burglars who were threatening to kill his family was jailed for 30 months in a case that has reignited the debate on how far householders can go to protect themselves and their property .
Munir Hussain , 53 , discovered three masked men in his house when his family returned from their local mosque during Ramadan in September last year .
The burglars tied up and threatened to kill Hussain and his family but a teenage son managed to escape and alert Hussain 's brother , Tokeer .
The intruders fled when help arrived at the house in High Wycombe , Buckinghamshire , but the brothers chased and caught one , Walid Salem , a criminal with more than 50 previous convictions .
He was then subjected to what Judge John Reddihough described as a " dreadful , violent attack " by the Hussain brothers .
Salem was left with a permanent brain injury after he was struck with a cricket bat so hard that it broke into three pieces .
The revenge attack was self - defence that went too far , Reading crown court was told .
The judge said Hussain 's family had been subject to a " serious and wicked offence " and praised the bravery of his teenage son who escaped .
" This case is a tragedy for you and your families , " the judge told Munir Hussain .
" Sadly , I have no doubt that my public duty requires me to impose immediate prison sentences of some length upon you .
This is in order to reflect the serious consequences of your violent acts and intent and to make it absolutely clear that , whatever the circumstances , persons cannot take the law into their own hands , or carry out revenge attacks upon a person who has offended them . "
The brothers , described as family men at the heart of the local community , were found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent after a trial earlier this year .
Munir Hussain was given a 30 - month sentence while his brother was jailed for 39 months after the judge decided he had not been subject to as much provocation as his brother .
Although Salem was the only intruder caught after the incident , his injuries meant he was not fit to plead after being charged with false imprisonment .
He was given a two - year supervision order at a court hearing in September .
The court heard that the case had similarities to that of farmer Tony Martin , who shot a teenage intruder , and there was public support in both cases .
The law allows for people to use reasonable force to protect themselves or others , or to carry out an arrest or to prevent crime .
However , attacks motivated by malice or out of revenge and intended to cause injury are unlikely to constitute reasonable force , according to advice published by the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Crown Prosecution Service .
" It may be that some members of the public , or media commentators , will assert that Salem deserved what happened to him at the hands of you and the two others involved , and that you should not have been prosecuted and need not be punished , " the judge added .
" However , if persons were permitted to … inflict their own instant and violent punishment on an apprehended offender rather than letting justice take its course , then the rule of law and our system of criminal justice , which are the hallmarks of a civilised society , would collapse . "
The court heard that Hussain and his wife and children feared for their lives as their hands were tied behind their backs .
Michael Wolkind , defending , said Hussain was the " real victim " in the case .
" The public surely do not want Munir Hussain to receive imprisonment .
I do n't seek a medal , I seek justice for him . "
Hussain , usually a controlled man , had acted in the heat of the moment in " extreme circumstances of stress " , he said .
The prosecution said the Hussains were not being convicted for apprehending Salem , but for the " excessive force " they used on him .
Hilary Neville , prosecuting , said : " What started as reasonable self defence by Munir Hussain then turned into excessive force by virtue of a sustained attack by Munir , Tokeer and at least two others . "
The court heard sentencing would have an impact on the local economy , with 10 members of staff losing their jobs at Soundsorba , the company run by Munir Hussain , who employs his brother as a technical director .
The firm , which produces sound - absorbing material , has an annual turnover of £ 2.5 m .
Munir Hussain is a former winner of the Asian businessman of the year award and is head of the Race Equality Council for High Wycombe .
Speaking outside the court , Wolkind said : " The criminal justice system has failed twice .
The court was unable to sentence Walid Salem with sufficient harshness , or Munir and Tokeer Hussain with sufficient compassion .
" It 's difficult to believe that this outcome reflects the thinking of the public , or the interests of justice . "
He said he intended to appeal against the sentence .
A document jointly published by the CPS and Acpo says people are not expected to make fine judgments about what might be reasonable force in the heat of the moment , so long as they only do what they honestly and instinctively believe is necessary .
However , force used after chasing someone who runs off may not be considered to be reasonable .
Acting out of malice and revenge with the intent of inflicting punishment through injury or death would not be reasonable , it adds .
Reasonable force and fatal consequences
Tony Martin
Norfolk farmer who killed a teenage burglar in his home with an illegally held pump-action shotgun in 1999 .
Martin pleaded self - defence , but was initially convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment .
In October 2001 three appeal court judges accepted fresh evidence that he had been suffering from a paranoid personality disorder .
The conviction was quashed and his sentence was reduced to five years for the manslaughter of 16 - year - old Fred Barras and wounding his accomplice , Brendon Fearon , 30 .
Niklos Baungartner
Hungarian businessman who tackled and killed an intruder at his Derbyshire home in 1995 .
The crown prosecution service ruled out action against him .
Baungartner had confronted Robert Ingham , 22 , in the kitchen and the fight moved into the front garden , where Ingham suffered a neck injury from which he died .
Derbyshire police concluded that Ingham 's injuries were entirely consistent with Baungartner 's version of events .
Norman Waller
Sentenced to 18 months for affray after killing a gang member he believed to be damaging a neighbour 's car in 1992 .
Waller , 34 , of Gateshead , was cleared of murder and two wounding charges , but was found guilty of causing an affray .
Terry Malone , 24 , died in hospital five days after being stabbed in the chest with a chisel by Waller as the gang surrounded him and his neighbour 's son .
Joe Horn
In 2007 Horn alerted emergency services that he could see two men burgling his neighbour 's home in Pasadena , Texas .
Despite being told by the dispatcher to stay inside , Horn went outside , and subsequently shot and killed both burglars .
Last year a grand jury cleared Horn .
Johns Hopkins University researchers have created biodegradable nanosized particles that can easily slip through the body 's sticky and viscous mucus secretions to deliver a sustained - release medication cargo .
The researchers say these nanoparticles , which degrade over time into harmless components , could one day carry life - saving drugs to patients suffering from dozens of health conditions , including diseases of the eye , lung , gut or female reproductive tract .
The mucus - penetrating biodegradable nanoparticles were developed by an interdisciplinary team led by Justin Hanes , a professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering in the Whiting School of Engineering at Johns Hopkins .
The team 's work was reported recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Hanes ' collaborators included cystic fibrosis expert Pamela Zeitlin , a professor of pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and director of pediatric pulmonary medicine at the Johns Hopkins Children 's Center .
These nanoparticles , Zeitlin said , could be an ideal means of delivering drugs to people with cystic fibrosis , a disease that kills children and adults by altering the mucus barriers in the lung and gut .
" Cystic fibrosis mucus is notoriously thick and sticky and represents a huge barrier to aerosolized drug delivery , " she said .
" In our study , the nanoparticles were engineered to travel through cystic fibrosis mucus at a much greater velocity than ever before , thereby improving drug delivery .
This work is critically important to moving forward with the next generation of small molecule and gene - based therapies . "
Beyond their potential applications for cystic fibrosis patients , the nanoparticles also could be used to help treat disorders such as lung and cervical cancer , and inflammation of the sinuses , eyes , lungs and gastrointestinal tract , said Benjamin C. Tang , lead author of the recent journal article and a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering .
" Chemotherapy is typically given to the whole body and has many undesired side effects , " he said .
" If drugs are encapsulated in these nanoparticles and inhaled directly into the lungs of lung cancer patients , drugs may reach lung tumors more effectively , and improved outcomes may be achieved , especially for patients diagnosed with early stage non-small cell lung cancer . "
In the lungs , eyes , gastrointestinal tract and other areas , the human body produces layers of mucus to protect sensitive tissue .
But an undesirable side effect is that these mucus barriers can also keep helpful medications away .
In proof - of - concept experiments , previous research teams led by Hanes earlier demonstrated that latex particles coated with polyethylene glycol could slip past mucus coatings .
But latex particles are not a practical material for delivering medication to human patients because they are not broken down by the body .
In the new study , the researchers described how they took an important step forward in making new particles that biodegrade into harmless components while delivering their drug payload over time .
" The major advance here is that we were able make biodegradable nanoparticles that can rapidly penetrate thick and sticky mucus secretions , and that these particles can transport a wide range of therapeutic molecules , from small molecules such as chemotherapeutics and steroids to macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids , " Hanes said .
" Previously , we could not get these kinds of sustained - release treatments through the body 's sticky mucus layers effectively . "
The new biodegradable particles comprise two parts made of molecules routinely used in existing medications .
An inner core , composed largely of polysebacic acid ( PSA ) , traps therapeutic agents inside .
A particularly dense outer coating of polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) molecules , which are linked to PSA , allows a particle to move through mucus nearly as easily as if it were moving through water and also permits the drug to remain in contact with affected tissues for an extended period of time .
In Hanes ' previous studies with mucus - penetrating particles , latex particles could be effectively coated with PEG but could not release drugs or biodegrade .
Unlike latex , however , PSA can degrade into naturally occurring molecules that are broken down and flushed away by the body through the kidney , for example .
As the particles break down , the drugs loaded inside are released .
This property of PSA enables the sustained release of drugs , said Samuel Lai , assistant research professor in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering , while designing them for mucus penetration allows them to more readily reach inaccessible tissues .
Jie Fu , an assistant research professor , also from the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering , said , " As it degrades , the PSA comes off along with the drug over a controlled amount of time that can reach days to weeks . "
Polyethylene glycol acts as a shield to protect the particles from interacting with proteins in mucus that would cause them to be cleared before releasing their contents .
In a related research report , the group showed that the particles can efficiently encapsulate several chemotherapeutics , and that a single dose of drug - loaded particles was able to limit tumor growth in a mouse model of lung cancer for up to 20 days .

Roberta Mason , 63 , of Turner , Me. , is one of millions of people who are finding themselves in a special kind of health insurance bind  or will soon .
This week ’s column is for people like them .
Laid off from her job as a supervisor in a shoe factory last January , Ms. Mason was able to keep her health insurance under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act , known as Cobra , largely because of a federal subsidy that helped make her payments relatively affordable , at $ 199 a month .
But the subsidy , which was part of President Obama ’s stimulus package passed by Congress in February , lasts only nine months .
And Ms. Mason ’s time is up .
In January , her Cobra payment will increase to $ 550 , which is more than half of her $ 908 monthly unemployment check .
Her husband , Douglas , 66 , is retired and receives about $ 1,900 a month in Social Security .
His health care is covered by Medicare .
But if Ms. Mason has to pay the full price on Cobra , she and her husband will have little left over from their two checks for living expenses .
Mr Perminov said Roscosmos ' science council would hold a ' closed meeting '
The head of Russia 's federal space agency has said it will work to divert an asteroid which will make several passes near the Earth from 2029 .
Anatoly Perminov told the Voice of Russia radio service that the agency 's science council would hold a closed meeting to discuss the issue .
Any eventual plan is likely to be an international collaboration , he said .
The US space agency said in October that there is a one - in - 250,000 chance of Apophis hitting Earth in 2036 .
That announcement was a significant reduction in the probability of an impact , based on previous calculations that put the chances at about one - in - 45,000 .
The asteroid is estimated to pass within about 30,000 km of the Earth in 2029 .
Mr Perminov , who is the chief of Roscosmos , gave little detail of any plans that the agency has , but was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying that the solution would not entail the use of nuclear weapons .
Other schemes that have been put forth in the past for diverting asteroids from collision courses include spacecraft that nudge the space rocks out of their trajectory through force , or diverting them with " solar sails " that use the wind of particles ejected from the Sun .
" People 's lives are at stake , " Mr Perminov reportedly told the radio service Golos Rossii ( Voice of Russia ) .
" We should pay several hundred million dollars and build a system that would allow us to prevent a collision , rather than sit and wait for it to happen and kill hundreds of thousands of people . "

For long - time peace activists , for those concerned with national funding for jobs , health care , environmental needs and education , the plan to maintain 100,000 troops in Afghanistan is a tragedy about to unfold .
The U.S. and allied soldiers killed or physically or psychologically wounded , the Afghan and Pakistan civilians killed , the denial of resources for the everyday living needs of millions of Americans and others , and the spur to recruiting al - Qaeda and Taliban fanatics – these are the promises of this misbegotten plan .
It should have been clear eight years ago – after 9/11 – that our nation ’s unprincipled foreign policy had produced and nurtured an international criminal conspiracy .
This conspiracy was misusing Islam , training martyrs for murder .
An oil - hungry U.S. administration launched what was designed to be unending war against Arab and Muslim people .
What was needed then – and what is still needed – even after much death and destruction – is an international law enforcement effort to apprehend and prosecute the criminals .
The 9/11 attacks were planned in Hamburg , Germany , and 15 of the 19 terrorists were Saudis .
It was never suggested that we attack Germany or Saudi Arabia , of course , but Bush - Cheney - Rumsfield went to war against Afghanistan and Iraq , concocting one false justification after another .
The numbers of killed and physically or psychologically wounded keep rising .
Our military is stretched to the breaking point .
Our nation ’s wealth has been pillaged or mortgaged for generations .
The ranks of our people without jobs , homes and health care have swelled .
Recruiting for al - Qaeda has grown and its international reach has spread .
Our own military estimates that there are no more than a hundred or so al - Qaeda operatives in Afghanistan , and their presence is greater in Pakistan , Yemen , Somalia and Indonesia , for example .
The recent incident on a Detroit - bound airliner demonstrates dramatically the need for more intelligent and coordinated intelligence .
The planned escalation to 100,000 on the other hand will cost a hundred billion dollars a year , without improving our security .
And it will exacerbate every other existing problem .
Why is our nation facing this disaster when the majority of voters opted for change in 2008 ?
Intelligent people in this administration must be aware of the history of Afghanistan .
And they must be aware of the disaster that befell President Johnson ’s Great Society in the jungles of Vietnam .
Is it because the six - decade rule of the military - industrial complex in our national security state is too strong for any president to buck ?
Or is it because the first African American president is fearful of the racist and “ weak on defense ” charges that would flow from the ever - dangerous right if he proposed a realistic policy ?
Speculation , however , is pointless .
Whining or despair is useless .
Attacks on the president that deliver our nation into the hands of the irrational , racist right are unconscionable .
What is needed is a new level of unity and effective action centered on the economic consequences of the president ’s plan .

Can we use technology to halt climate change ?
( Image : Gaetan Charbonneau / Workbook Stock / Getty )
The effects of geoengineering could be worse than climate change , so we need to do our homework rather than assume it can stave off disaster .
OUR profligate greenhouse emissions are creating problems of planetary proportions for our descendants .
Even in the best - case scenario , if we make drastic cuts in emissions soon , sea levels will rise by anything from 10 metres to 25 metres over the next few thousand years .
Faced by the loss of so much precious coastal land , it seems quite plausible that our descendants will resort to some kind of mega - project to cool the planet and stop the ice sheets melting .
If so , why not do it sooner rather than later ?
It might save countless lives , not to mention the myriad species otherwise doomed to extinction .
There is no shortage of grand ideas for geoengineering .
We could pump cooling sulphur into the atmosphere to disperse incoming sunlight , or generate reflective clouds by spraying seawater heavenwards from special ships .
We might even launch an almighty flotilla of parasols into space to shade our planet from the sun .
The problem with all of these schemes is that we have little clue whether they would work .
Some of the best evidence so far comes from the cataclysmic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 , which obligingly conducted a large - scale experiment for us on the effect of injecting sulphur into the upper atmosphere .
From a global cooling perspective , the results were encouraging : temperatures sank temporarily by up to 0.5 °C .
It remains unclear , however , whether the …

In its efforts to influence health care reform and oppose same - sex marriage , the Catholic Church is wading more deeply into politics than it has in recent memory , observers say .
The church ’s role in politics came into sharp relief this week when the Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the Washington , D.C. , diocese threatened to cease its charitable activities if the D.C. city council went ahead with a plan to allow same - sex marriages .

The church ’s social services arm provides support to 68,000 people in the District of Columbia , among them the homeless and those in need of health care .
It has received $ 8.2 million in funding from the D.C. government in the past three years , according to the city council .
Peter Rosenstein of the Campaign for All D.C. Families described the church ’s move as an attempt to “ blackmail the city .
“ The issue here is they are using public funds , and to allow people to discriminate with public money is unacceptable , ” Rosenstein told the Post .
But church officials argue that D.C. city council ’s decision to reject an amendment that would have allowed people to refuse services to same - sex couples on religious grounds amounts to ignoring freedom of religion .
In this case , the church ’s pressure appears to be having a limited effect .
The Associated Press reports that “ most council members are refusing ” to heed the church ’s pleas .

“ Allowing individual exemptions opens the door for anyone to discriminate based on assertions of religious principle , ” Councilman Phil Mendelson told the AP .
“ Let ’s not forget that during the civil rights era , many claimed separation of the races was ordained by God . ”
Even other religious leaders have questioned the D.C. diocese ’s move .
“ Yesterday , the leadership of the Catholic Church made clear that they are choosing a cynical political ploy over their call to serve the neediest among the community , ” said Rev. Dennis Wiley of the Covenant Baptist Church , as quoted by the Perez Hilton blog .

But the church may have had more success in influencing the shape of health care reform .
In early October , the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops sent a letter to Congress warning politicians that it would not support health care reform if that reform allowed taxpayers ’ money to fund abortions .
A month later , the U.S. House of Representatives passed a health care reform bill that included the Stupak amendment , which bans health insurance plans that offer abortion services from participating in a public exchange .
Critics of the amendment say it could actually reduce access to abortions , if health insurers decide to reduce abortion coverage so that they can participate in the public health plan .

The church ’s involvement in the health care debate “ represents an uncharacteristic foray into outright lobbying , ” writes lobbying affairs reporter Timothy P. Carney at the Washington Examiner .
“ Similarly , the church has been consistent in voicing its opposition to gay marriage , but this week ’s direct confrontation with D.C. ’s city council over the issue is out of the ordinary . ”
The church ’s involvement in health reform has now become personal for Rep. Patrick Kennedy ( D - RI ) , nephew of President John F. Kennedy , who is embroiled in a political battle with Thomas Tobin , the bishop of Providence , Rhode Island .
After Kennedy criticized the church ’s stance on health care reform , Tobin stated that Kennedy , a member of America ’s most prominent Catholic political family , should be refused communion .

As the Associated Press notes , Kennedy is one of numerous politicians and government officials who have become targets of the Catholic Church .
Joseph Naumann , archbishop of Kansas City , has said that Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius should be refused communion for supporting abortion rights .
Raymond Burke , the former archbishop of St. Louis , made a similar statement with respect to former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , who is divorced .
But the Examiner ’s Carney argues that , from the church ’s point of view , the church may have no choice but to fight these battles as America shifts towards more liberal attitudes on issues like gay marriage .
The battles in which the church finds itself embroiled today are not simply about the underlying moral issues — abortion and gay marriage — but about more aggressive policies that might restrict the ability of the church and of individual Catholics to act according to Catholic teachings .
Because the health care bill in Congress would create new subsidies for private health insurance , it would have subsidized abortions if not for the Stupak amendment preventing subsidies for insurance plans that cover abortion . …
In other words , it would force opponents of legal abortion to act against their conscience simply by paying taxes .
Yet not all the church ’s battles can be described as wars of necessity .
Last month , Timothy Dolan , the new archbishop of New York , wrote a scathing criticism of The New York Times for what he perceived as the newspaper ’s “ anti-Catholicism . ”
Among other things , Dolan argued that the Catholic Church makes it into the news consistently over child sex abuse scandals , while similar problems plaguing other religious communities are ignored .

Clark Hoyt , the Times ‘ public editor , rejected that criticism .
“ Could the newspaper sometimes choose a better word in a story or pay more attention to transgressions in other parts of society ?
Yes .
Has it been guilty of anti-Catholicism ?
I do n’t buy it . ”
What do the Bush Administration and the Red Planet have in common ?
Hostility between US and British military leaders in Iraq ran deep , with one describing his US counterparts as “ group of Martians , ” the Daily Telegraph reported Monday , citing leaked government documents .
( On Sunday , a raft of documents showed that Prime Minister Tony Blair was engaged in a cover - up about military planning prior to the Iraq war ) .

The top British commander in the country , Major General Andrew Stewart , said “ our ability to influence US policy in Iraq seemed to be minimal ” in the first year of the conflict , according to documents published by the newspaper .
Britain ’s chief of staff in Iraq described as difficult attempts to communicate with senior US military commanders , “ a group of Martians ” for whom “ dialogue is alien , ” the newspaper said .
“ Despite our so - called “ special relationship , ” I reckon we were treated no differently to the Portuguese , ” the chief of staff , Colonel JK Tanner , said .
The statements were made in official interviews conducted by the Ministry of Defence with army commanders who had just returned from Iraq during the first year of peacekeeping from May 2003 to May 2004 .
Transcripts of the interviews , leaked to the newspaper , were revealed one day before an independent inquiry into the country ’s role in Iraq begins public hearings on Tuesday , with the aim of learning the lessons from the conflict .

British troops ended their mission in Iraq in July .
The probe will reopen debate over what remains a highly controversial campaign , in which 179 British troops lost their lives .
An army analysis published by the newspaper on Sunday showed Britain had no effective plan for what to do after coalition forces overthrew leader Saddam Hussein following the 2003 invasion .

According to Monday ’s report , General Stewart bluntly said that “ incredibly , ” there was not even a secure communication link between his headquarters in southern Basra and the US commander in Baghdad .
A US decision to try to capture a key lieutenant of radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr in a British - run area “ was not co-ordinated with us and no - one ( was ) told that it was going to happen , ” a commander said .

Colonel Tanner said : “ The whole system was appalling .
We experienced real difficulty in dealing with American military and civilian organisations who , partly through arrogance and partly through bureaucracy , dictate that there is only one way : the American way . ”
She got through 27 secretaries in TWO years and reduced staff to tears every day .
Meet Labour 's ambassador for women at work
Just how many not - up - to - the - job PAs can there be in London ?
One has to wonder if Dr Glenda Stone ever asked herself that question .
The high flying businesswoman got through 27 personal assistants in two years , to the point that when anyone visited her office she would roll her eyes , point to the desk nearest hers and say - with a peculiar pride , by all accounts - ' we call this desk the revolving door ' .
Now you could argue , as she doubtless would , that Dr Stone 's standards were simply higher than most .
OK , so she presented each new PA with a terrifyingly detailed daily schedule which started ' 8.55 am - turn lights on ' , but few entrepreneurs have made it to the top without a bit of control freakery .
Demanding : Glenda
Stone regularly reduced staff to tears at Aurora
And Dr Stone had definitely made it to the top .
The Porsche 911 she drove said so .
So did the Gucci shoe habit and the six - figure salary she paid herself .
So successful was she deemed in her specialist area of business - ironically , a ' female friendly ' recruitment company - that the Prime Minister himself had asked her to head his task force promoting women in business .
You can see why .
Dr Stone was sassy , and media - savvy .
She once wrote an article about equality in the work place , looking forward to a day when women returned to work immediately after having babies , and men stayed at home .
She said it would herald ' landmark herstory ' then added , ' oops - should that still be history ? '
One can shudder at her taste for puns , but her dedication to the sisterhood seemed clear .
Well , unless that ' sister ' worked for her , it now seems .
Poor Janette King did .
Despite having held down a previous job as an office manager in busy car mechanics factory for 16 years , she lasted all of two - and - a - half months before developing a nervous twitch .
She went to see her GP , who immediately diagnosed a stress disorder brought on by bullying .
When Mrs King emailed Dr Stone to tell her what had happened , she was promptly told that she had failed her probationary period and would not be required to return to work .
Former employee of Dr Glenda Stone , David Collier , said : ' I saw her bully the men , but I saw her absolutely pulverise the women '
This week Glenda Stone 's own ' herstory ' was rewritten in quite dramatic form when she was exposed as a boss from hell in an employment tribunal .
She was depicted as a harridan of a CEO , whose expectations of her own staff were less likely to empower them than leave them blubbering wrecks in the staff toilets or , worse , the doctor 's surgery .
The tribunal found that Dr Stone had well and truly crossed the line between demanding boss and tyrant , behaving in a way that was not just mean - spirited and unfair , but illegal .
She was ordered to pay £ 28,000 compensation to an employee after firing him following a heated row about his workload .
The Central London tribunal found that she tried to force him to resign by threatening to reduce his salary by £ 15,000 .
When he refused , she spent 15 minutes on the internet finding out how to sack someone - then wrote him a letter saying he was to be made redundant .
What is truly shocking , though , is the picture that was painted by her staff about how Glenda Stone - this great adviser on equality - ' micromanaged ' and controlled her underlings from day to day .
And it seems that what was heard in court was only the start of it .
' Glenda 's not a role model .
She 's a disgrace '
Of course , all successful business bosses have high standards - and rightly so .
But the Mail has spoken to many of Dr Stone 's ex-employees , who have spoken of a ' climate of fear ' in which they were repeatedly shouted at , undermined and bullied .
Some say they were questioned for spending too long in the toilet ; others for simply talking to their colleagues .
Many talked of having to communicate with each other via Post - It notes because they believed their emails were being monitored .
The stress of operating to Stone 's exacting - some might say eccentric - standards drove some ' to the point of madness ' .
Janette King is n't the one who blew the whistle , but her account of working for Stone encapsulates exactly what the problem was .
' Her level of micro- management was amazing , ' she says .
' I had a daily schedule and every minute of the day was accounted for .
There would be six minutes to open the post , another three minutes for another task .
' If I finished something early , I liked to get on with the next thing , but she would see what I was doing and emailed me once saying : ' Why are you doing this task at this time ' ?
' Nothing was ever good enough for her , and she would shout and call me unprofessional routinely .
' When I had to draft a letter for her , she would go back and change it .
I would take it back to her , and she would put more red pen on it .
It was like being back at school and you could never get it right .
No one could .
' When she went for meetings she would always have a map printed out , with where the meeting was circled on it , so she could see how to get there from the tube station .
' Once she called me from Euston Station asking why I had n't given her a map .
I said I had , and it was in the same place it always was , but she said she meant a map of the station so she could see how to get to the taxi rank . '
Not exactly ' female - friendly ' then ?
' She 's not a role model , ' Mrs King concludes .
' She 's a disgrace . '
Another ex-employee - who declined to be named - pointed out the irony of Dr Stone receiving a honorary doctorate ( from Leeds Metropolitan University ) and other accolades for promoting the cause of women , ' when the bottom line is that I do n't think she likes women very much at all ' .
' She is very bright , but I 've seen her crush people '
In the end , it was actually a man who finally forced Mrs Stone to be held to account .
David Collier , 44 , who was one of seven full - time staff in the office , brought the action after working for Dr Stone for two - and - a - half years .
A successful businessman , he had worked in the Middle East for some years , but on return to the UK , with a wife and young child to support , was urgently in need of a job .
He accepted a job as a PA to Stone , on a salary of £ 25,000 , but quickly worked his way up the ladder at her company Aurora , to become project co-ordinator , earning £ 40,000 .
He too was subjected to the hectoring and bullying Mrs King talks of .
' It was every day .
I saw her bully the men , but I saw her absolutely pulverise the women , ' he says .
' To people outside , she was a successful women who carried herself well , but what she did to her own staff was mental abuse .
' The website Aurora runs is called wheretowork.com , but we used to call it wherenottowork.com .
We would be talking to HR directors of the biggest companies in the world about how people should treat their employees , but at the same time were working in this shadow of fear .
There was an atmosphere of tension at all times .
' There was not one employee that I did not see cry when I was there .
Every day there would be at least one person dabbing their eyes .
There was no joy , no banter .
I think I was praised just twice when I was there .
' We did n't dare talk to each other , or communicate via email , because she would monitor everything .
' There was solidarity between us - we were all going through the same thing with her - but it could n't be overt .
If I was going to the toilet I would drop a Post - It note with a smiley face on it on a desk as I went past . '
It was an environment from which people were simply desperate to escape .
' Of the 11 people who passed through when I was there , ten left under a cloud and with no job to go to , ' Mr Collier says .
Even those who would have classed themselves as friends ( and fans ) of Glenda Stone have told us of the terror with which she ran her empire .
Ruth Minhall , 35 , from Canterbury , Kent , was a salesperson at Aurora for almost three years , leaving after the birth of her first son .
She describes her time working for Dr Stone as ' a character - defining experience which I would not repeat ' .
' I would never put myself through it again .
Now , I would walk out on the first day .
The irony is that I took the job because I was so impressed with her at the interview .
You can't argue with her work ethic .
' Although she is a pain in the neck and her management style is lacking , she is determined and hard - working .
I have a lot of respect for her business ability and her drive , but I have seen her crush people .
Glenda is an incredibly bright woman , but lacking in empathy and impossible to please .
' I was told I was n't professional , I was n't doing my job .
After the first five months it did n't faze me , but it destroyed a lot of people .
I saw people being made to feel mad .
The average member of staff lasted five months .
It 's over : Witnesses Marianna Karas and Janette King leaving Kingsway employment tribunal that saw their former boss Glenda Stone pay £ 28,000 compensation for unfair dismissal
One PA 's best friend died , and she asked on the Tuesday to have the following Monday off to go to the funeral .
On the Friday , Glenda still had n't got back to her letting her know if it was OK .
In the end , she just walked out . '
So who is Dr Stone , and how on earth did she convince the Government that she was qualified to advise others on management issues ?
A gregarious blonde , she was born in Australia and worked as a teacher before embarking on a government career in Queensland Education Department , the Cabinet Office , and HM Treasury .
' I grew up living in suburbia and much of my drive comes from wanting never to go back .
It was so dull , ' she once explained .
' My father ran an estate agency where my mother worked , and although we were comfortably off , they did not believe in flashing their money about . '
She was very different - money obsessed and proud of it .
She has given interviews about her love of Gucci clothes and shoes and once said : ' What I love about being successful is the fact that you can treat yourself - our next goal is to own our own boat .
' People may say they 're not in it for the money , but to become a millionaire you have to be money driven or you 'd stay running a small business from your bedroom for ever .
It 's highly addictive .
' I had to resign to preserve my sanity '
' I pay myself a six - figure salary and I 'm personally worth more than the business .
Being successful gives you power and choice : having my own business means no one can tell me what to do . '
She met her husband - and business partner - Leigh in Greece , marrying him after a whirlwind romance .
Their son Conrad was born in 2007 .
The couple settled in London , setting up their business Busygirl .
It was later renamed Aurora Gender Capital Management Limited , and eventually shortened to Aurora GCM Ltd .
Aurora , of course , was the Roman goddess of the dawn - a symbol of powerful and successful women and seemingly ideal for Glenda 's ' female - friendly ' vision .
While Leigh provided the finance expertise , Stone provided the vision .
The company 's website boasts that it ' provides femalefocused corporate HR software and marketing services to over 100 bluechip clients ' , and its boss was a skilled self - promoter .
Some particularly gushing biographical notes seemed to suggest she had actually invented the idea of women in the workplace .
' Glenda Stone is pure inspiration for anyone who wants to break into the corporate world .
She created a whole new market for women in business , a sector that never existed until she made it happen , ' it read .
Still , she was convincing .
Even her own staff were , at first , persuaded .
One former account manager , who did not want to be named , tells us : ' Glenda hit a nerve by getting on the pro-women bandwagon , which was a big thing at that time .
' I joined Aurora because I was passionate about women in history and admire female entrepreneurs . '
This woman managed nine months on the Aurora payroll , even missing her first wedding anniversary out of loyalty to Stone , before it all ended in recrimination .
' You could never do anything right .
Once , I went to the loo because I had a stomach upset .
When I got back , Glenda was asking where I 'd been for a long time .
It made me feel so worried that I 'd spent too long there .
I missed my first wedding anniversary because I had to go to a conference at the last minute and was told it would be good for my career if I did so .
' But by the end of my time with her I was suffering from depression and my doctor said : " This is not good for you " .
Glenda questioned my performance and said that she was going to have to reduce my salary .
In the end , I told her I would have to seek legal advice over some comments she made to me and she just said : " Clear your desk , and get out " . '
An astonishing aspect of this case was that even being related to Dr Stone did not prevent some employees being bullied .
Candy Dibley , 36 , is actually her sister - in - law , but she too was made redundant .
Mrs Dibley did not choose to give evidence at the tribunal , but was forced to by a court order .
She wept as she told the tribunal there had been a ' disagreement ' on February 10 this year , and she had walked out of the office , telling Dr Stone that the way she was being asked to do her job was ' not right ' .
Two days later , she was made redundant , she said , by which time she felt ' relieved ' about it .
Pressed on Stone 's management style , she described it as ' different to anything else I had ever experienced .
Quite closely managed .
Micro-management would be the correct terminology .'
Those who witnessed the pressure Stone piled on her sister - in - law are less reticent about what Mrs Dibley had to deal with on a daily basis .
' Candy had the worst of it , ' recalls Mr Collier .
' Glenda and Leigh would have arguments where they would tell Candy she was useless .
There was nothing constructive about it .
It was full - on abuse .
' Candy would be in pieces , crying a lot .
She absolutely hated it .'
Another former employee , Marianna Karas , 35 , told the tribunal that the fact the two bosses were married to each other made a bad situation ten times worse .
' Glenda and Leigh are husband and wife .
This was not an issue to begin with , until it became clear that both brought their personal matters into the office , arguing abusively and openly in front of others . '
She , too , could only put up with so much .
' In the end , I just decided to cut my losses , keep my sanity , and resign . '
And so it might have continued , had Mr Collier not decided that enough was enough .
He claims that Stone 's fearsome reputation was common knowledge even outside the office , and that at least one temping agency refused to place staff with her , so frequently did it all end in tears .
He claims 15 former colleagues got in touch to support him in the legal action against Dr Stone .
It 's all a far cry from the accolade she was awarded last year - the inaugural Australia Woman of the Year in the UK .
Back home in Australia , Dr Stone was understandably feted .
' This Brisbane woman has risen high , ' crowed her local newspaper .
Only now has anyone thought to ask how many other women , and men , were trampled underfoot in that giddying ascent .
Many people in racing spend quite a bit of time looking back these days and it's remarkable how many say that for a short period of time from the late eighties through the nineties CART 's PPG Indy Car World Series was the world 's best racing series .
It enjoyed plenty of great drivers and teams as well as three or four competing chassis builders and four engine manufacturers in Mercedes - Benz , Ford / Cosworth , Honda and Toyota , and was closely - fought and unpredictable , everything a big - time racing series should be .
Many of us enjoyed watching CART 's growth and we hoped and believed it would get better , rather than worse .
In recent years fans and participants from across North America and around the world from F1 to NASCAR have remarked that we lived through a great epoch in the sport 's history without really appreciating it .
" We lived through a golden age , " Mario Andretti said recently .
" We never realized how good it was at the time . "
Tony Cicale is one of America 's most respected development and race engineers .
Cicale was Andretti's race engineer at Newman / Haas from 1983 - '85 and again in 1988 , '90 and ' 91 .
Cicale won the 1984 CART championship with Andretti , the 1995 CART title and Indy 500 with Jacques Villeneuve , and the 2003 Champ Car title with Paul Tracy .
For both Villeneuve and Tracy , Cicale was much more than an engineer .
He was also a tutor and mentor .
These days Cicale is a reluctant retiree who enjoys wind - surfing off Long Island , NY , and Florida 's Gulf coast .

Indeed , whether by design or happenstance , CART brought together the disparate and often argumentative worlds of American oval and road racing to create a series with great appeal to many people .
It had its own clear identity and was also , in some minds at least , an alternative to Formula One .
Indeed , for a few years in the mid-nineties Bernie Ecclestone grew more and more worried about CART 's growing worldwide TV audience .
" When you 're involved in something you always think it 's better than what it ultimately is , " Cicale adds .
" But I thought it was so unique going to all those different types of circuits .
You had the superspeedways -- Indianapolis , Michigan , Pocono and later Fontana -- and you had the street circuits like Long Beach , Vancouver and Toronto , and road circuits like Elkhart Lake , Laguna Seca and Mid-Ohio , plus the different variety of short ovals from Milwaukee to Sanair .
It was really unique and an incredibly strong period in American racing . "
Cicale spent more than thirty years in the sport , first as a driver and Can - Am car builder , then as an Indy car engineer with Newman / Haas , Patrick Racing , Porsche 's short - lived Indy car team , Galles / Kraco , Players / Forsythe , Team Kool Green and Andretti-Green .
Cicale is a rigorous engineering disciplinarian and a student of the much more nebulous art of race engineering .
He also has a quiet , dry sense of humor and occasionally lets his sardonic wit fly .
" It does n't even come close today , " Cicale remarks .
" I try to watch the IRL races and I can't .
They 're just so terrible .
I watched the races this year , but I can't think of one that stood out as an even acceptable race .
It has very little meaning to me , which is sad .
From the start I thought the whole IRL business was ridiculous and it's very sad to see the results of all that power squabbling and politics .
It was a dreadful period for racing . "
History is filled with stories about things evolving or dying .
So too is human history rich in epic stories of family squabbles as the wealth - earning generation passes on the family fortune to following generations .
Sometimes an even more powerful generation takes the family and its fortune to even greater heights .
But almost inevitably a generation or two arrives riven by a preening kind of fecklessness and in their hands the fortune and power base dwindles , taken over in the end by lawyers and managers .
So too , did Tony George 's attempt to change the course of history stumble and fail .
The sad result is very different from the vision originally foisted on the public and swallowed by some in the media .
After fifteen years of bitter squabbling Tony George 's failed revolution , aimed at taking control of Indy car racing from CART 's team owners , has been a calamitous failure , ending with a barely audible whimper last June when George was slapped on the wrist and dethroned by his mother and three sisters .
American open - wheel racing 's sad decline has reduced and diluted not just CART 's quarter - century but the entire hundred - year history of Indy car racing .
Today , as we all know , NASCAR defines automobile racing in America while Formula One dominates the international stage .
Few contemporary race fans know anything about the great Indy car heroes of the past like Jimmy Murphy , Frank Lockhart , Wilbur Shaw , Rex Mays , Bill Vukovich , Jimmy Bryan , A.J. Foyt , Parnelli Jones , Johnny Rutherford or the Unser brothers .
Thanks to Tony George 's bumbling the legacies of these legends and CART 's greatest drivers have been greatly diminished across America and around the world and Indy car racing has devolved into a highly restricted spec car category equipped with a foreign chassis and engine and little or no aesthetic or emotional appeal .

" It 's sad for the people who 've been through it , " Cicale observes .
" It 's sad for me because you look back and you always think there is some importance in what you do .
There probably is n't anywhere near as much importance as you would like there to be .
But ultimately , you would like to say , I was part of that and it was important at the time .
Had it grown to something that was good and sustainable then you would have felt that the time and effort that you put in was of importance and had value , that you were n't just wasting your time for ten , fifteen or twenty years doing this thing that just benefitted you and nobody else .
" If it had continued on and grown and been important to a large number of people and become a big part of the economy , what you did ten and fifteen and twenty years ago would hold a little more reverance .
But because it turned out the way it has , I almost feel it was a waste of time to get involved in it . "
Cicale says it 's more a matter of self - respect than public recognition .
" It 's not so much the respect from other people , " he remarks .
" It 's more of a personal respect .
I spent twenty years of my life and committed myself to Indy car racing in the hopes that it would become something important for a lot of people and a lot of fans , that people would get excited about it and feel emotional or passionate about it .
As you 're involved in the sport and go through it , those are the positive things .
You hope it leads to something that ultimately becomes important for more than one or two people .
And when it turns out not to , you say to yourself , ' Gosh , maybe I should n't have been involved in motor racing at all . '
" I enjoyed it for more than twenty years and thought I contributed something important to the business side of it and to the history of it .
But all that seems to have disappeared with the IRL .
The whole memory of what CART and Champ Car was all about has been diluted into this IRL thing , which has nothing to do with it .
I look at the IRL and I feel really bad that Champ Car dissolved the way it did because it makes the contributions that you thought were important seem meaningless or irrelevant . "
Cicale is referring specifically to the considerable improvements in safety and car construction made by CART during the late eighties and early nineties .
These things came about because Mario Andretti was an activist driver 's representative on the CART board for a number of years and also because of an equally activist committee of engineers who vetted rule changes and made a steady series of improvements in the cars ' footboxes and crash or crush structures .
Cicale was part of an engineering consulting group that included John Ward , Lee Dykstra and Ian Reed , although CART 's increasing internal political squabbles eventually resulted in Andretti and the engineers walking away from any more attempts to talk sense to the owners and their administrators .

" I quite honestly feel that we made so many important strides from the safety side well before any other group even thought about it , " Cicale says .
" Yet all the safety stuff we did has been totally obliterated .
One of the things I 'm most happy that I was involved with in Champ car racing is I thought I really contributed a lot to the safety side . "
In the late seventies and early eighties many drivers , including Pancho Carter , Danny Ongais , Rick Mears and Derek Daly suffered serious leg , feet or pelvic injuries .
" When I first got involved in CART somebody was getting maimed or killed every weekend , or close to it , " Cicale goes on .
" There were some rules that a group of us developed that were really important .
They were truly cutting edge and were timely and really about safety .
They were n't pretending to be about safety .
They were genuinely about safety and made a significant difference in a pretty short period of time .
" It 's really sad that has disappeared from anybody 's memory .
I think those were some pretty important historical developments in racing .
I think we saved a lot of people .
Those accidents that Rick Mears and Derek Daly had in 1984 made me feel just sick to my stomach .
We wanted something done to make it safer .
It was n't just a political or public relations move .
" I think we made a very big difference in a very short period of time .
There were five or six drivers , including Derek Daly and Rick Mears , who came up after the fact and said they were really happy that you guys are doing this .
' It 's really important , ' they said , ' because we do n't want other drivers to go through what we went through . '
They said the cars were infinitely safer than they had been just a few years before .
" Ten years later , all these other organizations started developing or adopting things that Champ Car people did ten years previous to that .
I think that 's probably one of the saddest things because to me that was one of the most important things I contributed to .
But because of CART 's demise it has totally disappeared from the annals of history .

It 's also important to realize that America has suffered from a series of sanctioning body suicides precipitated by complete failures at managing the technical rules or believing in technological development as an essential element of the sport .
The SCCA was the first and perhaps most spectacular of these failures with the original Can - Am and Trans - Am series followed by Formula 5000 and ' new era ' Can - Am .
Then came IMSA 's briefly booming GTP category which was also consigned to history 's trashcan around the same time CART began to implode .
As the owner of one of the country 's more successful road racing tracks said to me last summer : " It 's the worst - run sport in America . "
Against the odds , Cicale 's old friend Mario Andretti hopes for a miracle .
" I hope the IRL series sponsorship really works for Izod and they get ten times what they 're hoping to get out of it , " Mario says .
" But the thing that is so disheartening is they made the Izod announcement and nobody knew about it .
It made Speed TV and Speed - Sport News , of course .
But there was no CNN story , no AP story , nothing written about the announcement in our local papers here in Nazareth .
The media just does n't seem to care anymore .
Nobody seems to know that Dario won the championship or that he 's a great driver and a really good guy , too .
And it 's the same with Scott Dixon .
Nobody seems to know , or care , who Scott Dixon is .
It 's sad . "
In closing , I must emphasize that Andretti and Cicale are incurably forward - thinking , optimistic people .
Their careers were driven by these principles and they took great pleasure in working together to solve problems .
" Tony was a very articulate individual who would go back after we had our debriefs and reason things out so that we had a plan for the following day , " Mario says .
" He had patience and total focus .
He did n't worry about going to dinner .
He did n't worry about what time it was .
He worried about doing his homework and doing the job , and I loved that .
He was a guy with a fresh approach to things and that gave me confidence and an even keel to push forward . "
I 'm sure Tony is enjoying himself this Christmas season with some wind - surfing in Florida 's warm Gulf waters , a far more satisfying endeavor than watching IRL races .
Meanwhile , the Indy car teams have formed a company , Delta Wing , to design and build a prototype of the new Indy car for 2012 .
Former Lola designer and current Ganassi employee Ben Bowlby is designing the new car for Delta Wing and there 's no doubt that for Indy racing to rediscover its lost luster it needs a healthy shot of Cicale 's spirit of pushing boundaries through rigorous scientific experimentation , unrelenting hard work and love of racing as a cauldron of new thinking .
In that spirit , I wish Bowlby and Delta Wing the best of luck and I wish all of you a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year .
I 'll be back on January 11th .
And I just received the latest 2009 / 2010 edition of Autocourse , now available from Motor Books and good bookstores everywhere like Paul Zimmermanns Motorsport Collector in Chicago .
The latest Autocourse is as superbly - presented as ever and continues to set the standard as the most complete review of the years worldwide motor sport season .
For any racing enthusiast theres no better Christmas gift .
Many people in racing spend quite a bit of time looking back these days and it's remarkable how many say that for a short period of time from the late eighties through the nineties CART 's PPG Indy Car World Series was the world 's best racing series .
It enjoyed plenty of great drivers and teams as well as three or four competing chassis builders and four engine manufacturers in Mercedes - Benz , Ford / Cosworth , Honda and Toyota , and was closely - fought and unpredictable , everything a big - time racing series should be .
Many of us enjoyed watching CART 's growth and we hoped and believed it would get better , rather than worse .
In recent years fans and participants from across North America and around the world from F1 to NASCAR have remarked that we lived through a great epoch in the sport 's history without really appreciating it .
" We lived through a golden age , " Mario Andretti said recently .
" We never realized how good it was at the time .
" Tony Cicale is one of America 's most respected development and race engineers .
Cicale was Andretti's race engineer at Newman / Haas from 1983 - '85 and again in 1988 , '90 and ' 91 .
Cicale won the 1984 CART championship with Andretti , the 1995 CART title and Indy 500 with Jacques Villeneuve , and the 2003 Champ Car title with Paul Tracy .
For both Villeneuve and Tracy , Cicale was much more than an engineer .
He was also a tutor and mentor .
These days Cicale is a reluctant retiree who enjoys wind - surfing off Long Island , NY , and Florida 's Gulf coast .
" I think through a five to seven - year time frame CART was the best series in the world , " Cicale says .
" I do n't think there was a better period of time for open - wheel racing in this country than existed from the mid-eighties to the mid-nineties .
It was really a pretty exciting spell through that time .
I thought CART racing had a lot of potential .
" Indeed , whether by design or happenstance , CART brought together the disparate and often argumentative worlds of American oval and road racing to create a series with great appeal to many people .
It had its own clear identity and was also , in some minds at least , an alternative to Formula One .
Indeed , for a few years in the mid-nineties Bernie Ecclestone grew more and more worried about CART 's growing worldwide TV audience .
" When you 're involved in something you always think it 's better than what it ultimately is , " Cicale adds .
" But I thought it was so unique going to all those different types of circuits .
You had the superspeedways -- Indianapolis , Michigan , Pocono and later Fontana -- and you had the street circuits like Long Beach , Vancouver and Toronto , and road circuits like Elkhart Lake , Laguna Seca and Mid-Ohio , plus the different variety of short ovals from Milwaukee to Sanair .
It was really unique and an incredibly strong period in American racing .
" Cicale spent more than thirty years in the sport , first as a driver and Can - Am car builder , then as an Indy car engineer with Newman / Haas , Patrick Racing , Porsche 's short - lived Indy car team , Galles / Kraco , Players / Forsythe , Team Kool Green and Andretti-Green .
Cicale is a rigorous engineering disciplinarian and a student of the much more nebulous art of race engineering .
He also has a quiet , dry sense of humor and occasionally lets his sardonic wit fly .
" It does n't even come close today , " Cicale remarks .
" I try to watch the IRL races and I can't .
They 're just so terrible .
I watched the races this year , but I can't think of one that stood out as an even acceptable race .
It has very little meaning to me , which is sad .
From the start I thought the whole IRL business was ridiculous and it's very sad to see the results of all that power squabbling and politics .
It was a dreadful period for racing .
" History is filled with stories about things evolving or dying .
So too is human history rich in epic stories of family squabbles as the wealth - earning generation passes on the family fortune to following generations .
Sometimes an even more powerful generation takes the family and its fortune to even greater heights .
But almost inevitably a generation or two arrives riven by a preening kind of fecklessness and in their hands the fortune and power base dwindles , taken over in the end by lawyers and managers .
So too , did Tony George 's attempt to change the course of history stumble and fail .
The sad result is very different from the vision originally foisted on the public and swallowed by some in the media .
After fifteen years of bitter squabbling Tony George 's failed revolution , aimed at taking control of Indy car racing from CART 's team owners , has been a calamitous failure , ending with a barely audible whimper last June when George was slapped on the wrist and dethroned by his mother and three sisters .
American open - wheel racing 's sad decline has reduced and diluted not just CART 's quarter - century but the entire hundred - year history of Indy car racing .
Today , as we all know , NASCAR defines automobile racing in America while Formula One dominates the international stage .
Few contemporary race fans know anything about the great Indy car heroes of the past like Jimmy Murphy , Frank Lockhart , Wilbur Shaw , Rex Mays , Bill Vukovich , Jimmy Bryan , A.J. Foyt , Parnelli Jones , Johnny Rutherford or the Unser brothers .
Thanks to Tony George 's bumbling the legacies of these legends and CART 's greatest drivers have been greatly diminished across America and around the world and Indy car racing has devolved into a highly restricted spec car category equipped with a foreign chassis and engine and little or no aesthetic or emotional appeal .
George 's failures were brought into sharp focus in 2009 as only five Americans raced Indy cars on a regular basis this past year -- Graham Rahal , Danica Patrick , Marco Andretti , Ryan Hunter - Reay and Ed Carpenter .
And for the first time in the sport 's hundred - year history not a single American driver won an Indy car race !
" It 's sad for the people who 've been through it , " Cicale observes .
" It 's sad for me because you look back and you always think there is some importance in what you do .
There probably is n't anywhere near as much importance as you would like there to be .
But ultimately , you would like to say , I was part of that and it was important at the time .
Had it grown to something that was good and sustainable then you would have felt that the time and effort that you put in was of importance and had value , that you were n't just wasting your time for ten , fifteen or twenty years doing this thing that just benefitted you and nobody else .
"
If it had continued on and grown and been important to a large number of people and become a big part of the economy , what you did ten and fifteen and twenty years ago would hold a little more reverance .
But because it turned out the way it has , I almost feel it was a waste of time to get involved in it .
" Cicale says it 's more a matter of self - respect than public recognition .
"
It 's not so much the respect from other people , " he remarks .
" It 's more of a personal respect .
I spent twenty years of my life and committed myself to Indy car racing in the hopes that it would become something important for a lot of people and a lot of fans , that people would get excited about it and feel emotional or passionate about it .
As you 're involved in the sport and go through it , those are the positive things .
You hope it leads to something that ultimately becomes important for more than one or two people .
And when it turns out not to , you say to yourself , ' Gosh , maybe I should n't have been involved in motor racing at all .
'" I enjoyed it for more than twenty years and thought I contributed something important to the business side of it and to the history of it .
But all that seems to have disappeared with the IRL .
The whole memory of what CART and Champ Car was all about has been diluted into this IRL thing , which has nothing to do with it .
I look at the IRL and I feel really bad that Champ Car dissolved the way it did because it makes the contributions that you thought were important seem meaningless or irrelevant .
" Cicale is referring specifically to the considerable improvements in safety and car construction made by CART during the late eighties and early nineties .
These things came about because Mario Andretti was an activist driver 's representative on the CART board for a number of years and also because of an equally activist committee of engineers who vetted rule changes and made a steady series of improvements in the cars ' footboxes and crash or crush structures .
Cicale was part of an engineering consulting group that included John Ward , Lee Dykstra and Ian Reed , although CART 's increasing internal political squabbles eventually resulted in Andretti and the engineers walking away from any more attempts to talk sense to the owners and their administrators .
During this time Cicale and the engineering committee worked closely with Doctors Steve Olvey and Terry Trammell but most of the work they did has been elided from motor racing history .
According to today 's revisionist histories the fight for everything from crushable and deformable structures to the HANS device was led by Max Mosley in F1 following Ayrton Senna 's death at Imola in 1994 and by NASCAR in the wake of Dale Earnhardt Sr. 's fatal crash at Daytona in 2001 .
CART and Indy car racing 's many contributions do n't exist .
" I quite honestly feel that we made so many important strides from the safety side well before any other group even thought about it , " Cicale says .
" Yet all the safety stuff we did has been totally obliterated .
One of the things I 'm most happy that I was involved with in Champ car racing is I thought I really contributed a lot to the safety side .
"
In the late seventies and early eighties many drivers , including Pancho Carter , Danny Ongais , Rick Mears and Derek Daly suffered serious leg , feet or pelvic injuries .
" When I first got involved in CART somebody was getting maimed or killed every weekend , or close to it , " Cicale goes on .
" There were some rules that a group of us developed that were really important .
They were truly cutting edge and were timely and really about safety .
They were n't pretending to be about safety .
They were genuinely about safety and made a significant difference in a pretty short period of time .
"
It 's really sad that has disappeared from anybody 's memory .
I think those were some pretty important historical developments in racing .
I think we saved a lot of people .
Those accidents that Rick Mears and Derek Daly had in 1984 made me feel just sick to my stomach .
We wanted something done to make it safer .
It was n't just a political or public relations move .
" I think we made a very big difference in a very short period of time .
There were five or six drivers , including Derek Daly and Rick Mears , who came up after the fact and said they were really happy that you guys are doing this .
' It 's really important , ' they said , ' because we do n't want other drivers to go through what we went through . '
They said the cars were infinitely safer than they had been just a few years before .
" Ten years later , all these other organizations started developing or adopting things that Champ Car people did ten years previous to that .
I think that 's probably one of the saddest things because to me that was one of the most important things I contributed to .
But because of CART 's demise it has totally disappeared from the annals of history .
" At the time , that was very unique to CART , " Cicale adds .
" I do n't think Formula 1 had any decent safety rules or regulations for years after CART developed a lot of these things .
That 's the part that really saddens me about the demise of CART .
What we worked on and developed has been swallowed up into the IRL glob of nothingness .
I call this NASCAR car the ' Car of Yesteryear ' .
It 's just like the IRL car .
Nobody likes driving it and the fans do n't like watching it .
It 's total crap .
But the people who run racing are n't interested in making any changes .
Oh , for another day !
" It 's also important to realize that America has suffered from a series of sanctioning body suicides precipitated by complete failures at managing the technical rules or believing in technological development as an essential element of the sport .
The SCCA was the first and perhaps most spectacular of these failures with the original Can - Am and Trans - Am series followed by Formula 5000 and ' new era ' Can - Am .
Then came IMSA 's briefly booming GTP category which was also consigned to history 's trashcan around the same time CART began to implode .
As the owner of one of the country 's more successful road racing tracks said to me last summer : " It 's the worst - run sport in America . "
Against the odds , Cicale 's old friend Mario Andretti hopes for a miracle .
" I hope the IRL series sponsorship really works for Izod and they get ten times what they 're hoping to get out of it , " Mario says .
" But the thing that is so disheartening is they made the Izod announcement and nobody knew about it .
It made Speed TV and Speed - Sport News , of course .
But there was no CNN story , no AP story , nothing written about the announcement in our local papers here in Nazareth .
The media just does n't seem to care anymore .
Nobody seems to know that Dario won the championship or that he 's a great driver and a really good guy , too .
And it 's the same with Scott Dixon .
Nobody seems to know , or care , who Scott Dixon is .
It 's sad .
" In closing , I must emphasize that Andretti and Cicale are incurably forward - thinking , optimistic people .
Their careers were driven by these principles and they took great pleasure in working together to solve problems .
" Tony was a very articulate individual who would go back after we had our debriefs and reason things out so that we had a plan for the following day , " Mario says .
" He had patience and total focus .
He did n't worry about going to dinner .
He did n't worry about what time it was .
He worried about doing his homework and doing the job , and I loved that .
He was a guy with a fresh approach to things and that gave me confidence and an even keel to push forward .
" I 'm sure Tony is enjoying himself this Christmas season with some wind - surfing in Florida 's warm Gulf waters , a far more satisfying endeavor than watching IRL races .
Meanwhile , the Indy car teams have formed a company , Delta Wing , to design and build a prototype of the new Indy car for 2012 .
Former Lola designer and current Ganassi employee Ben Bowlby is designing the new car for Delta Wing and there 's no doubt that for Indy racing to rediscover its lost luster it needs a healthy shot of Cicale 's spirit of pushing boundaries through rigorous scientific experimentation , unrelenting hard work and love of racing as a cauldron of new thinking .
In that spirit , I wish Bowlby and Delta Wing the best of luck and I wish all of you a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year .

CARACAS ( Reuters ) - Venezuela ’s Hugo Chavez ordered soldiers to seek out businesses that raise prices after a sharp devaluation of the bolivar currency last week , saying he will expropriate firms that engage in price gouging .

Chavez also created a $ 1 billion fund to jump - start the recession - hit , oil - reliant economy before elections in September when the opposition hopes to strip him of a parliamentary majority .
“ Right now , there is absolutely no reason for anybody to be raising prices of absolutely anything , ” Chavez said on his weekly TV show , two days after announcing a dual exchange system for the weakened currency , which had been on a fixed exchange rate .
“ I want the National Guard on the streets with the people to fight against speculation , ” Chavez said .
“ Publicly denounce the speculator and we will intervene in any business of any size . ”
The socialist Chavez has given the state a hefty role in managing the economy .
During his 11 years in office he has nationalized most heavy industries and expropriated large farms .
Business and finance are tightly regulated .
He says the devaluation will help make Venezuelan companies more competitive but warned that the government will take over shops and give them to workers if price rises are uncovered .
Chavez gave out phone numbers during the broadcast to report price gouging and asked his defense minister to prepare an “ offensive ” against the practice .
After browbeating firms that might raise prices , he announced $ 1 billion of credits and subsidies to try to diversify the economy and get industry back on its feet .
He also invited businessmen to talks with the government .
Venezuela ’s economy is largely dependent on oil revenue and slipped into recession last year as crude prices fell and manufacturing and industry output crashed .
PROTECT THE POOR
South America ’s leading oil exporter , Venezuela imports most consumer products .
Under the new system , food and medicines will be imported at an exchange rate of 2.6 bolivars to the U.S. dollar while nonessential goods will be bought at a rate of 4.3 per dollar .
Since 2005 the bolivar had been fixed at 2.15 to the dollar .
Venezuelans packed electrical goods stores on Sunday , fearing prices will double as the cost of imports rise .
Venezuelans are already struggling with electrical power and water shortages caused by drought , a high murder rate , inflation and recession .
But many still support the government because of its focus on easing the economic plight of the poor .
Some analysts say the price impact of the devaluation will not be severe , pointing out that much of Venezuela ’s imports are already paid for with dollars bought on a semi-legal black market , where the bolivar is worth about a third of its official rate .
The currency closed at 6.15 to the dollar on Friday .
Others have predicted that Venezuela ’s inflation , already the highest in the Americas at 25 percent last year , will be pushed up by the devaluation .
However , the measures would give Chavez more cash to spend this year before the September elections .
He said subsidies introduced by his government , along with the stronger exchange rate for food and medicine , would protect the poor from a jump in inflation .
“ This government protects and will continue to protect the weakest with investment and with special attention , ” he said .
The devaluation is a relief for the state oil company , PDVSA , which has struggled to pay service providers and meet social spending requirements since crude prices dropped last year .
Foreign debt - holders will also be pleased , since the devaluation improves Venezuela ’s finances .
Last month , BMO Capital Markets cut ratings on Colgate - Palmolive Co , Avon Products Inc and Kimberly - Clark Corp to “ market perform ” saying a possible currency devaluation in Venezuela could hurt the U.S. consumer goods makers ’ profits .
Sir Tim Berners - Lee was hired to work on the project last June Web founder Sir Tim Berners - Lee has unveiled his latest venture for the UK government , which offers the public better access to official data .
A new website , data.gov.uk , will offer reams of public sector data , ranging from traffic statistics to crime figures , for private or commercial use .
The target is to kickstart a new wave of services that find novel ways to make use of the information .
Sir Tim was hired by PM Gordon Brown in June 2009 to oversee the project .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Developers have already built a site that displays the location of schools according to the rating assigned to them by education watchdog Ofsted .
" It 's such an untapped resource , " Sir Tim told BBC News .
" Government data is something we have already spent the money on ... and when it is sitting there on a disk in somebody 's office it is wasted . "
Road hazards A beta , or test , version of the site has been running since September , with more than 2,400 developers registering to test the site and provide feedback .
The site also shows the possible uses of the data , such as PlanningAlerts , a free service that combs local authority planning websites looking for planning applications .
It then automatically e-mails details of applications in the local area to anyone who has signed up for the service .
Another site , FillThatHole , allows people to report potholes and other road hazards across the UK .
It uses location data from the Office for National Statistics .
Prepare for a blizzard of new ways of manipulating public data

" If [ the data ] can be published under an FOI ( Freedom of Information ) request why not publish it online ? "
The site currently contains 2,500 data sets but the pair hope it will continue to grow .
" It is a job that is never going to be entirely finished , " said Prof Shadbolt .
" Government is always collecting data . "
One of the key data sets they are trying to include is geographical location from the Ordnance Survey ( OS ) .
" That will make a real difference to the way that people make sense of the information , " Prof Shadbolt said .
He said they were " currently in discussion " with the OS and were hopeful that the data would be available on 1 April .
In November , the government announced that most Ordnance Survey map data would be freely available online in 2010 .
Currently , it is only available free of charge to small - scale developers .
' Grow the economy ' Prof Shadbolt is also trying to extend the project to cover local government information .
The site is part of a growing trend amongst governments to be more transparent with their data .
In the US , the Obama administration launched data.gov , which offers feeds from various departments including the US defence department and Nasa .
London Mayor Boris Johnson has also announced the city 's authorities will open an online data warehouse on 29 January with more than 200 data sets relevant to life in the capital .
" This is a tremendous opportunity for UK firms to secure better value for money in service delivery and to develop innovative services which will help to grow the economy , " said Stephen Timms , Minister for Digital Britain .

Was Betriebsräte , Gewerkschafter und Politiker auf die Palme brachte , war der Schlecker - Dreh , sich selber ein Zeitarbeitsunternehmen zu halten , bei dem alte und neue Mitarbeiter anheuern mussten , um zu niedrigeren Konditionen die bisher besser bezahlten alten Jobs auszuüben .

With the critical consensus for Avatar swinging dramatically into the positive , an Armond White takedown review was inevitable .
And now , it ’s here !
The Up–hating , Norbit–loving NY Press critic tears Avatar apart , calling it “ the corniest movie ever made about the white man ’s need to lose his identity and assuage racial , political , sexual and historical guilt . ”
He grants that it ’s “ technically impressive ” ( Pandora is “ undeniably pretty ” ) , and Sam Worthington is “ great , ” but claims Cameron “ bungles the good part : the meaning . ”
Here we go :
Cameron ’s superficial B - movie tropes pretend philosophical significance .
His story ’s rampant imperialism and manifest destiny recalls Vietnam - era revisionist westerns like Soldier Blue , but it ’s essentially a sentimental cartoon with a pacifist , naturalist message .
Avatar condemns mankind ’s plundering and ruin of a metaphorical planet ’s ecology and the aboriginals ’ way of life .
Cameron fashionably denounces the same economic and military system that make his technological extravaganza possible .
It ’s like condemning NASA — yet joyriding on the Mars Exploration Rover .
Also , it ’s not as good as Gamer .
Man , now we ca n’t wait to see it !

Passengers were trying to find out information at Glasgow Airport
Anger at airline staff treatment Passengers ' experiences Douglas Fraser blogs on Globespan Help for passengers
An operation is under way to fly back to the UK thousands of people left stranded after Flyglobespan , Scotland 's biggest airline , collapsed .
All flights were cancelled after its parent company , Globespan , entered administration on Wednesday .
About 800 jobs are under threat and unions have expressed anger at the plight of employees .
About 4,500 passengers were stranded by the airline 's collapse , mostly in Spain , Portugal , Cyprus and Egypt .
The Civil Aviation Authority will be repatriating about 1,100 of those stuck overseas .
Administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers ( PWC ) said Edinburgh - based Globespan was contacting all the passengers booked with or travelling with the airline .
The Unite union said staff faced a Christmas of misery and uncertainty .
Fiona Farmer , regional officer responsible for Flyglobespan , said : " Many crew are stranded overseas in Europe and beyond , extremely worried about how they will get home and how they will support their families without a wage at Christmas .
" This is truly horrendous for them and their loved ones , which is why we are in urgent discussion with the receivers on this issue . "
One senior cabin crew member for Flyglobespan told the BBC he had not yet been contacted by the company .
Please turn on JavaScript .

Tom Maguire from Prestwick added : " I 'm completely devastated by this news the week before Christmas .
I feel totally let down .
" There is nothing on the staff website , we 're just hearing things through Facebook .
No one has told me that I do n't have a job . "
Passenger Audrey Duncan from Edinburgh had been due to fly with the airline later .
She said : " I have had no contact from the airline as yet which I find disappointing .
I 'm sure there are staff who would be able to send an e-mail to customers like me in a very short space of time . "
Flyglobespan went into administration after attempts to conclude a financing deal for the airline with Jersey - based Halcyon Investments broke down .
Not protected
In a statement , the administrators said the Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) would be responsible for the repatriation of about 1,100 people who were on holidays booked as part of a Globespan package holiday .
However , a further 3,400 people are overseas and are not protected after booking directly through flyglobespan.com .
Customers who booked Flyglobespan flights directly via the Flyglobespan website or the call centre will not get a refund on the cost of their flight but the Department of Transport said they may qualify for a reduced rate repatriation fare .
Please turn on JavaScript .

Travellers booked on cancelled flights have been advised not to go to the airport and contact the Globespan helpline , or check its website , for information .
Meanwhile , easyJet and Ryanair have offered those passengers affected special " rescue " fares to allow them to return home where their routes overlap with those of Flyglobespan .
And Thomas Cook said it had arranged additional capacity for its flights out of Glasgow Airport .
There are also 27,000 people who have future flights booked through the Air Travel Organisers ' Licensing ( Atol ) insurance scheme , and about 90,000 people who have forward bookings but have no Atol protection .
They may be protected under their own personal travel insurance or through their credit card transaction .
Administrators said they planned to investigate why a " significant " amount of cash from credit card bookings did not reach Flyglobespan .
FLYGLOBESPAN FACTS 11 operational aircraft - two on order 1.5 m passengers carried in 2008 12,000 flights each year 4,500 passengers currently abroad More than 100,000 have travel plans booked Bruce Cartwright , of PWC , said this was not to do with the credit card companies , but the way money reached the airline when online transactions were processed by a company called E - Clear .
He said : " That money goes into a booking site and is then passed to the airline .
" There does in this case seem to have been a significant build - up of cash that has not reached the company . "
It is understood Flyglobespan also has a contract with the Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) to transport troops to and from destinations such as the Falklands .
But the MoD said families in the Falklands would not be affected by the collapse as it has organised another airline to bring them back home for Christmas .
Earlier this year , Flyglobespan , which was set up in 2002 , announced it had made an operating profit of £ 1.2 m following a loss of £ 19 m the previous year .
However , earlier this year , it pulled its services out of the Durham Tees Valley airport , blaming the worsening economic climate .

Appfrica has a great infographic that looks at the number of Earth 's dead humans and the causes of their deaths , and creates comparisons between the population of the dead and that of the living .
" How many people have ever lived ? "
The numbers in this piece are highly speculative but are as accurate as modern science allows .
It 's widely accepted that prior to 2002 there had been somewhere between 106 and 140 billion homo sapiens born to the world .
One interesting fact he digs up :
There are more people currently alive in Asia , Africa and Latin America than the total number of people who died — anywhere , and for any reason — during the entire 20th century .

NASA Caught in Climate Data Manipulation ; New Revelations Headlined on KUSI - TV Climate Special
Press Release From : KUSI-TV
Posted : Thursday , January 14 , 2010
Climate researchers have discovered that NASA researchers improperly manipulated data in order to claim 2005 as " THE WARMEST YEAR ON RECORD . "
KUSI - TV meteorologist , Weather Channel founder , and iconic weatherman John Coleman will present these findings in a one - hour special airing on KUSI - TV on Jan.14 at 9 p.m .
A related report will be made available on the Internet at 6 p.m. EST on January 14th at www.kusi.com.
In a new report , computer expert E. Michael Smith and Certified Consulting Meteorologist Joseph D'Aleo discovered extensive manipulation of the temperature data by the U.S. Government 's two primary climate centers : the National Climate Data Center ( NCDC ) in Ashville , North Carolina and the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) at Columbia University in New York City .
Smith and D'Aleo accuse these centers of manipulating temperature data to give the appearance of warmer temperatures than actually occurred by trimming the number and location of weather observation stations .
The report is available online at http://icecap.us/images/uploads/NOAAroleinclimategate.pdf.
The report reveals that there were no actual temperatures left in the computer database when NASA / NCDC proclaimed 2005 as " THE WARMEST YEAR ON RECORD . "
The NCDC deleted actual temperatures at thousands of locations throughout the world as it changed to a system of global grid points , each of which is determined by averaging the temperatures of two or more adjacent weather observation stations .
So the NCDC grid map contains only averaged , not real temperatures , giving rise to significant doubt that the result is a valid representation of Earth temperatures .
The number of actual weather observation points used as a starting point for world average temperatures was reduced from about 6,000 in the 1970s to about 1,000 now .
" That leaves much of the world unaccounted for , " says D'Aleo .
The NCDC data are regularly used by the National Weather Service to declare a given month or year as setting a record for warmth .
Such pronouncements are typically made in support of the global warming alarmism agenda .
Researchers who support the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) also regularly use the NASA / NCDC data , including researchers associated with the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia that is now at the center of the " Climategate " controversy .
This problem is only the tip of the iceberg with NCDC data .
" For one thing , it is clear that comparing data from previous years , when the final figure was produced by averaging a large number of temperatures , with those of later years , produced from a small temperature base and the grid method , is like comparing apples and oranges , " says Smith .
" When the differences between the warmest year in history and the tenth warmest year is less than three quarters of a degree , it becomes silly to rely on such comparisons , " added D'Aleo who asserts that the data manipulation is " scientific travesty " that was committed by activist scientists to advance the global warming agenda .
Smith and D'Aleo are both interviewed as part of a report on this study on the television special , " Global Warming : The Other Side " seen at 9 PM on January 14th on KUSI - TV , channel 9/51 , San Diego , California .

That was said by my college football coach at WPI , Ed Zaloom , on my first day of football camp – and it really stands up there as some of the best advice I ’ve ever received .
He was speaking to the entire freshman football class in the stands overlooking the field .
Coach Zaloom – aka Zoomer – was trying to tell us that although we were members of the team from day one , we were not one of the boys .
It was my first day .
I could not bust anyone ’s chops .
I could not mouth off to seniors .
I should not expect to be in on any inside jokes .
As of the first minute of the first practice I was a member of the WPI football team , but I was not one of the boys .
Now , anyone from that team will probably be chuckling right now .
At the time I did n’t exactly get it .
I was the antithesis of this sentiment .
Not only was I on the football team , I had been lifting there all summer .
With seniors !.
I had a leg up .
I already had a nickname .
I was one of the boys .
Wrong .
The coach made us part of the team , but I was not one of the boys .
Only the team could make me one of the boys .
And within a couple days they let me know it – but that ’s for another post .
Becoming ‘ one of the boys ’ takes some time .
But starting out as not one of the boys did not in any way take away from how I was expected to perform and contribute on the team , and I ’ve been really amazed at how valuable this lesson has been in other areas of life – especially working in startups .
It ’s easy to get cozy real fast in a startup .
Everyone is nice and cool and making jokes and fooling around .
People might stroll in at 10 am , take off at 4:30 pm , drop F - bombs all over the place , run out for an hour at lunch to run a couple errands , and so on .
It ’s a culture that on the outside can appear quite lackadaisical compared to most corporate environments .
So if you ’re new to it , you might walk in and think “ HOLY SHIT !
This rocks ! ”
But what you do n’t immediately see is that those people are up at 1 am Sunday nights , at the office until 9 pm on random Wednesdays , pulling all - nighters to hit deadlines , getting up at 4 am to make sure some automated thing is doing its job properly , pulling out the iPhone on dates to make sure the system is up and running , getting a bit anxious when they walk into a movie theater because they do n’t have cell service in case something goes wrong , and on some nights even losing sleep over the stress of of the job .
The list of stuff like this is so long that as I write it I realize it deserves it ’s own post .
Being in a startup is hard fucking work .
Do n’t forget that when you ’re new to the game .
Do n’t get enamored with being cool , fitting it , making jokes .
Go to work .
Do your job .
Kick ass .
Do whatever is asked of you to the best of your ability .
And slowly , over time , you ’ll become one of the boys .

This year , Pirate Parties have emerged all around the world , putting copyright , censorship and privacy issues on the political agenda .
Down under the Australian Pirate Party is eager to join in .
They are currently seeking 500 founding members in order to become registered as an official political party .
2009 has been a disastrous year for several well - established torrent sites , with The Pirate Bay and Mininova losing in court against the entertainment industries .
Not completely unrelated , this year has been a very successful one for the political Pirate Party movement .
The Pirate Party currently holds two seats in the European Parliament thanks to the massive support from Swedish voters .
In the aftermath of this accomplishment several new parties were founded worldwide .
In the UK the Pirate Party was officially registered at the Electoral Commission in August and Canada has been pursuing the same goal for a while , now followed by Australia .
The Pirate Party Australia just announced that it is now accepting founding members in their attempt to get the party officially registered with the Australian Electoral Commission .
In order to get registered the party needs 500 members who sign and send in their application form , plus a $ 20.00 founders fee .
“ With this small but significant step , we will be one step closer to providing Australian electors with the option of voting ‘ Pirate ’ at the next Federal election , to fight for a fairer and more balanced copyright , greater innovation and access to culture , information and knowledge , greater government transparency and the protection of our civil liberties , ” the Party announced .
David Crafti , President of Pirate Party Australia , stresses the importance of a political party that defends citizens rights against the ever - growing power of pro-copyright lobbyists .
“ With the current government attempting to implement an Internet censorship regime , continuing secretive ACTA negotiations and an increasingly belligerent war on sharing , here and across the globe – it is now more important than ever that we work to protect our civil liberties , and our democracy , ” Crafti said .
The Aussie Pirate Party hopes to have the 500 required membership applications in before the end of the year .
They encourage prospective members to send in their application forms ( pdf ) as soon as is possible , so the party can become officially registered and get to work .
A Note I wrote for my santa with the awesome new pen !
This is the black ink that came with the pen .
Ca n't wait to test it out with the ink samples I got too !
The second day of Camp KDE was filled with many more interesting talks .
This day 's talks were of the more technical nature versus the first day , and the KDE team took notes .
As usual , the talks were recorded and videos will be available soon .
A detailed rundown of the second day of talks are behind the link .
The second day started with a keynote by Frank Karlitschek about KDE vs. The Cloud ( TM ) , looking ahead a couple of years into the future .
Frank pointed to the trend to use cloud based applications instead of desktop applications .
The question this raised was : can KDE could provide a superior experience if we properly combine the advantages of cloud based technology with the freedom of open source and the power of desktop applications ?
He began by defining " The Cloud " .
Chrome OS and Google 's huge variety of cloud based services in general are the most pervasive examples , though it has also become more common in multimedia thanks to services like Flickr , Pandora or Last.fm .
Frank went on to present the results of a survey he did on the advantages of the cloud .
The most important advantages of cloud apps are the social features , the easy access to apps and the ability to access your data from everywhere and share stuff with others .
Is the growing reliance on web applications and online services a good trend from the FOSS perspective ?
And where will KDE software be in 10 years if it continues like this ?
Frank points to the things Google has been doing with and on the web , and the dangers such a successful monoculture presents .
Google is definitely behaving itself right now , but things might be very different in 5 or 10 years .
And we had a visit from another dragon !
And we had a visit from another dragon !
Frank then presented the results of a survey on disadvantages on the cloud .
The biggest problems for users are possible privacy and data protection problems and the dependency on third party infrastructure .
The big question of course is :
What can be done about it ?
How can we take back the web ?
As the KDE community is a technical bunch , we are naturally focused on technology .
We cannot and will not fight Google by sending lawyers at them or starting a political movement - we must create something cooler and better .
So how can we get the best of both worlds and create a compelling alternative ?
He outlined the following requirements to compete :
provide a rich desktop with rich applications instead of web apps
be social
ease deployments
ensure data you own accessible everywhere
facilitate mashups
So for this we need 3 building block :
social services
online data sharing
easy deployment of applications .
Frank now introduces the first part of a solution , the Social Desktop and libattica .
Libattica is an easy to use Qt - only library which provides social and transparent data access for any application with build - in authentication , error handling and support for different data providers .
Libattica is currently used in the KDE SC 4.4 desktop by a variety of applications like the social desktop widgets .
This makes adding of social features to apps really easy .
Frank also released a reference server implementation so that other online services can easily integrate with the KDE Social Desktop .
The goal for this is to not only support the OpenDesktop provider as social network but also other unrelated networks like Facebook .
The social desktop can then combine all the networks in a single experience , and in time even help in getting our data back .
A second technology is GetHotNewStuff which has recently been heavily reworked and updated .
In time , the GHNS framework can also help in the deployment - both for data but , with the integration with the openSUSE Build Service which is in the works , also for applications .
The future even holds integration with Qt Creator , where a developer writes an application , does a few mouse clicks to upload it with GHNS where the openSUSE BuildService ( or some local install of the Build Service software ) takes over and creates packages which then anyone can easily install .
The third needed building block is a technology to make storage , access , revision control and sharing of documents really easy .
Frank announced the ownCloud project which is a personal cloud storage solution to manage all you personal data .
ownCloud will use the AGPL license so everybody can install his / her own cloud storage on a server , desktop and anywhere else .
Everybody has control over his / her own data but is still able to access it from all devices , have revision control , automated backups , sharing with others and data encryption .
So let 's make this happen - there is a wiki page set up and a gitorious repository if you want to help .
They are still in an embryonic stage but the future of the social desktop integration into the KDE projects is bright .
Ian talking about Telepathy Ian talking about Telepathy
Once Frank was done , Kris Moore took over to talk about KDE on PC - BSD , a desktop distribution of FreeBSD .
Kris goes through some recent developments in PC - BSD , including the development of a software management tool and a variety of small tools building upon KDE technology .
He explains the PBI package management , which works based on self - contained binary installation packages which still integrate with KDE .
He explains why PC - BSD makes use of KDE applications and technology .
The short answer is they love it - the long answer would involve the professional look and feel , the great technology and the continuous innovation coming from the KDE community .
Of course there are issues the developers bump into - something Kris does not skip on .
The many new dependencies , in part introduced due to the cross - desktop cooperation , make the work of packagers harder .
So do the ' Linux - isms ' developers introduce while working on KDE software .
The questions revolved around the different and unique way the PC - BSD team works , including : how they keep applications in their own folder at all times ; and how each package can be so self - contained that pretty much the whole OS can be upgraded , yet the apps keep on working as they were .
This has side effects such as increased RAM and harddrive storage usage .
The team is looking for solutions for this and are really creative in their efforts to find a solution .
An interesting point which came up is that due to the similarity between Mac and BSD , the people working on Mac benefit from the PC - BSD work and vice versa .
All in all , the PC - BSD team and their work is something to keep an eye upon .
Kris was followed up by Ian , who talked about Telepathy .
He explained why Telepathy ( an Open Source real time communication framework ) is needed , what it aims to do and how it works .
Based on D - BUS it can easily be used from within KDE , and Ian gave a quite detailed description of how Telepathy works .
Romain on Windows Romain on Windows
After lunch , Romain Pokrzywka told what he referred to as " the horror story of KDE on Windows . "
According to him it is alive and well - and yes , he runs Windows 7 with KDE Applications on it .
He demoed a few of the applications , including a few crashes and error messages .
The mixing of Windows and Plasma widgets was pretty impressive as most of the things do indeed work pretty well .
After the demo Romain spoke about the history of the KDE - on - Windows efforts to give us some background on where it came from before talking about where it is going .
We were introduced to the heroes of KDE - on - Windows and Romain explained how the development work currently goes .
A few of the things Romain demoed are pretty new and impressive - Nepomuk and Akonadi , for example .
The KDE PIM demonstration results in input from Till Adam who makes everyone anxious for KDE SC 4.5 - while 4.4 is n't even released .
After the second demonstration Romain moves to what the team is currently working on .
Solid is heavily under development , and Strigi development still has to be started .
Furthermore , a few things are not planned at all .
Among those are KWin and the Plasma taskbar and systemtray .
KWin is n't even a technical possible , and the taskbar and systemtray would be possible but are very difficult and are simply low priority .
Windows has a desktop shell , and while Plasma is very nice , it 's not crucial for a good experience for KDE applications on Windows .
Romain himself does like to use Plasma , purely as a desktop replacement .
Several of the widgets really offer interesting functionality , especially folderview .
Romain then lifted the lid on a few future plans like support for more platforms ( 64 - bit and WinCE ) , more applications , better integration and per-application installation packages .
On the integration front , it was concluded that applying a random style to each application when it starts would make KDE applications feel more at home in Windows , fitting in with the huge variety of styles on the platform .
One day , the KDE - on - Windows team would hope to play a role in the world - domination plans of the wider KDE community .
Marcus Hanwell was next with a talk about CMake and improving the development process .
After a short introduction of Kitware , the developers behind CMake and their other technologies , he showed lots of colorful and pretty pictures of the scientific work he has been involved in .
After this Marcus went into the details of the development process Kitware has set up using CMake , CDash , CTest and the other tools they use .
By using extensive automated testing , the development process can become faster and leaner , thus allowing developers to focus on writing features instead of fixing bugs .
CMake makes it possible to work much easier with cross-platform C++.
The adoption by KDE has made a huge difference to the spread of CMake , and these days it is really pervasively used .
Marcus detailed some technical features of CMake and then moved on to giving tips , tricks and examples for how to use CMake .
After the extensive CMake introduction Marcus continued with in - depth CTest information , revealing the brand - new and still experimental git support .
Finally , there is a call for interested developers : Kitware is hiring , looking for Qt knowledge !
Leo Franchi then gave a talk about Amarok .
He started by showing a variety of media players , showing how all the applications seem to focus on sexy and good looks , copying iTunes - like functionality , showing big covers etc .
He points out how all these applications try to be intelligent but often fail at it .
And of course the applications almost all try to push as much paid content to you as possible .
While Web 2.0 can be can be cool , somewhere money has to be made .
Having all your music streamed to you for free - that 's not gonna happen in the long term .
Integration of offline content and online is key here , as you can see with the business models of pretty much all other music services out there .
So what is the problem a good media player should solve ?
First of all , there is a lot of music in the world .
So what does the user want to hear ?
There are services out there which have been working on this , like Last.fm , and there are a lot of ways to visualize and calculate similarity , and some of these smarts should be put into the apps .
The dynamic playlists in Amarok are a way to let the user take care of most of their music tastes themselves , but the team is working to introduce a variety of ' intelligent ' biases using data from Last.fm and other services .
The information is out there - the challenge is to find and integrate it .
Other desktop players fail at this and it is something the Amarok team wants to get right .
Leo introduces Playdar , a server tool which runs on the background and can get you the music you want - finding it from wherever it can .
It will play the song from your collection if you have it ; play it from a friend which has shared his or her files if they have it ; or find it on the world wide web , say from the streaming service you 're subscribed to .
Work is being put in integrating this technology as well .
Leo 's topic solicited a lot of responses and discussion , which kept the team busy for a while longer .
After the snack break Caio Marcelo , a developer from INdT gave an introduction to QML , a new language to write user interfaces for Qt. QML is simply a way to describe trees of objects and properties which together describe the user interface .
QML allows you to embed ECMAscript ( javascript in Qt ) as well to perform simple transformations .
QML is heavily inspired by Qedje , the user interface language developed by the Enlightenment developers .
QML allows you to use animations and effects and describe regions around objects which respond to mouse input .
Caio demonstrated a variety of examples based on QML and shows how easy it is to create dynamic interfaces using this declarative language .
To explain the concept of the declarative UI , Caio gave a few analogies :
EFL : " QML is a kind of Edje for Qt "
Web : " QML is a kind of HTML + CSS "
Qt : " QML is a kind of .ui file from QtDesigner "
You can use QML in canvas - based applications like Plasma and mobile interfaces .
You can even write small applications like Plasma widgets entirely in QML .
It would also be a great candidate for a new UI for KDM as it can give themes a lot of flexibility .
The power of QML is to allow a sort of advanced themability - themes can change the interface entirely so you can have a single application with several QML ' themes ' for different devices from large screens to mobile devices .
Graphics , usability and interaction designers can work much more closely with developers , changing interfaces directly .
Declarative UIs can bring a variety of new features like easier network transparency to UIs , and the whole range of possibilities is still unclear .
Marco Martin proceeded with a talk about the Plasma Netbook interface .
He listed ' the competition ' , explaining how they work and what advantages and disadvantages their approaches had .
Introducing a number of insights , Marco showed how deeply the netbook team has thought about their user interface .
The requirements basically boil down to creating an interface with as few elements as possible to get the task the user wants to do done as easily and quickly as possible .
However the team had more in mind than just creating this interface - it was also important to make as few assumptions as possible about the form factor , creating a very flexible solution .
The goal was to push as much functionality as possible in the underlying infrastructure , to assure future interfaces like for mobile or multimedia devices would be even easier and faster to develop .
Marco started to present the various parts of the netbook interface like the Search and Launch interface and the Newspaper Activity , describing how they work and what assumptions the are based upon .
While going through these items he shows how they look and work .
Looking at the future , it is clear that what KDE SC 4.4 brings is just step one .
The look and behavior can still change , and there are many new widgets needed to complete the experience we want to offer : email is coming but appointments and other web services are still needed .
Furthermore it is a challenge to scale up and down for widgets , and this is something which still needs investigation .
But more and more tiny devices are coming on the market , and the work on this will prepare the KDE technology and community to provide an innovative and creative alternative UI for them .
Chani on stage Chani on stage
Chani Armitage took the stage with the last presentation of the day , with the work of the Plasma team on Activities as main topic .
She started out by demoing a few of the Activities she uses - which is a lot .
So what is an Activity ?
An Activity is what you are actually doing .
If you work on a math task for university , you have a bunch of windows like a PDF file with the assignment , a calculator and some other things .
These things belong together but there is currently no organization : we have to manage them ourselves .
Chani wants to organize this in a better way .
We now have implemented the Desktop Activities , but she is trying to associate windows to a desktop as well .
You should be able to save activities and open them on demand .
And this not only to make them easy to manage but it also saves resources .
More importantly , applications should be able to react to your activities - KMail should show email folders relevant to your math course , the file open dialogs should have relevant shortcuts etc .
This is going to be a challenge .
The current infrastructure does not support these things - changes will be needed in many places , including the KDE Applications .
For example saving sessions and opening them will be hard to get working in all situations - say an application is running in two Activities ?
Hopefully a new cross - desktop standard can emerge from this .
It is not all grim , however .
Nepomuk already has experimental functionality to tell applications what activity is currently running so they can customize their content .
Chani has already implemented what she refers to as ' a horribly ugly hack ' which allows closing and re-opening activities in Plasma but this is just a very first step .
The third day will have more talks but those will be even more technical .
All in all , the author is enjoying the conference .
As usual it is good to meet old friends and catch up with them , meet new friends and learn what cool stuff those are involved with and to generally hang out and have good conversations .
Last winter , as the federal Finance Department was preparing to spend billions of dollars to stimulate the economy in the face of a global economic meltdown , the David Suzuki Foundation offered its ideas on how to spend the money .
We recommended increased and sustained funding for public transit , subsidies for renewable energy , and cash for research and development to green Canada ’s auto sector .
We also suggested that the government should take a closer look at the economic benefits of protecting our terrestrial , freshwater , and marine ecosystems .
We argued that protecting nature results in cost savings for governments , because natural areas provide many direct ecological benefits that sustain the health and wellbeing of our communities at little or no cost .
These include services like clean air , clean water , wildlife habitat , and flood control .
All of these are costly to replace if they are degraded or lost due to mismanagement , assuming they can be replaced at all .
The financial benefits of protecting nature have long been understood .
Many ambitious policy solutions have come about not because government leaders were motivated to protect wildlife habitat but rather because they were looking for ways to save a buck .
For example , in the early 1990s , New York City chose to protect its watershed through land purchase , pollution control , and conservation easements , rather than build new infrastructure to filter its water .
In doing so , the city has saved billions of dollars in engineering costs .
Providing clean water at an affordable cost is a challenge in many Canadian cities because few draw their drinking water from protected watersheds .
Cities like Toronto and Montreal must rely on expensive treatment systems , because the ecosystems from which the water is drawn are already degraded or are tainted by pollution from industrial and agricultural activities and urban runoff .
In comparison , Vancouver ’s drinking water comes from protected watersheds in the North Shore Mountains .
These mature forests filter , store , and regulate Vancouver ’s drinking water at no cost to the taxpayer , thereby providing beneficial natural services that complement engineered solutions like water filtration .
Studies suggest that a strong fiscal incentive exists to protect and grow the urban forest cover in cities like Vancouver in the face of development pressures .
A recent joint study by municipal , provincial , and federal agencies in B.C. estimated that Vancouver and surrounding communities could save about $ 1.1 million annually in storm - water infrastructure costs if they significantly increase urban forest cover .
The economic benefits of nature conservation were also recently profiled in a groundbreaking United Nations report .
It found that protecting natural ecosystems and biodiversity is worth trillions of dollars in annual economic benefits globally .
The lead author of the report , Pavan Sukhdev , told the media that investments to protect ecosystems can return 25 to 100 times more in benefits from the natural services they provide .
This sort of research is important , because policy - makers often ignore the full economic costs of degrading land and the ecological services it provides when making development decisions .
For example , in 1973 , British Columbia designated good quality farmland in the province as “ agricultural land reserve ” where non-agricultural land use would be strictly controlled .
Today this critical bank of farms , fields , forests , and other ecosystems represents more than 60,000 hectares in and around Vancouver alone .
But the ALR has consistently been degraded by development , under the watch of government , despite the fact that its rich agricultural lands offer so much more to society than just blueberries and broccoli .
The ALR ’s planted crops and agricultural soils sequester and store millions of tonnes of atmospheric carbon , thereby acting as a “ hedge ” or offset against carbon pollution .
The ALR also offers outdoor recreational opportunities .
And these working farmlands provide important habitat for wildlife , especially migratory birds .
Yet , successive governments have allowed more than 6,000 hectares of land to be removed for development from the ALR in and around the Vancouver region .
A paltry 277 hectares have been added as compensation .
A David Suzuki Foundation report found that a lot of ALR land has also been removed in other prime agricultural regions of B.C .
It ’s time we started looking at the true value of our forests , fields , farmlands , and other natural and managed ecosystems beyond just the resources that we take from them .

COPENHAGEN 
The decade of 2000 to 2009 appears to be the warmest one in the modern record , the World Meteorological Organization reported in a new analysis on Tuesday .
The announcement is likely to be viewed as a rejoinder to a renewed challenge from skeptics to the scientific evidence for global warming , as international negotiators here seek to devise a global response to climate change .
The period from 2000 through 2009 has been “ warmer than the 1990s , which were warmer than the 1980s , and so on , ” Michel Jarraud , the secretary general of the international weather agency , said at a news conference here .
The unauthorized release last month of e-mail messages between climate scientists in Britain and the United States has provided new ammunition to global warming skeptics .
Some of the messages seemed to suggest that some data be withheld from the public .
Mr. Jarraud said the release of the climate analysis was moved up from year ’s end to coincide with the international conference on climate change .
We hope the download was of something worth the £ 8,000 fine
In a UK case that highlights the mess the law is currently in when it comes to illegal downloads of copyright material , a pub owner has been hit with an £ 8,000 fine for the actions of a user on the pub 's Wi -Fi hotspot .
The unnamed pub was , apparently , operating a Wi-Fi network provided by The Cloud , a firm specialising in public internet access in bars , coffee shops and other retail outlets .
Who 's responsible ?
According to ZDNet , the civil case brought by a copyright holder is " the first of its kind in the UK " , although there are question marks over the pub 's liability in the light of pending legislation .
The Digital Economy Bill announced last week appears to class such public internet access providers as ' public communications services ' which would leave them exempt from prosecution for the actions of their users .
As the ZDNet report correctly states , " Wi - Fi hotspots ... providing access to the internet to members of the public , free or paid , are public communications services . "
And who dunnit ?
Further still , unless specifically told to do so , there 's no requirement for such access providers to keep records of who logged on and when , meaning it would be impossible to identify anyone responsible for illegal activity .
For now , it appears that the hefty fine stands , although we would n't be surprised to hear a lot more about the case .
Stay tuned for updates .
Again proving that you can't cage a tiger - the comfiest , adorablest tiger slippers ever !
The came from the UK so no wonder it took weeks and weeks to get here .
Thank you secret santa !
I 'm wearing them right now .
Undoubtedly the time management will not succeed if we desperate us more and we have that thorn anywhere in pay not enough .
Desperate people blame many things or people over their alleged lack of time .
We named some of them ? : jams , children , boss , some leisure activities , neighbors , the couple ! , children ! , our friends ! , etc. ; up close to us ( as ) beings can be or are direct responsible that our days are missed or not .
Then :
Yes it is healthy , just , that we always have an explanation to justify our confusion ?
The answer is No ; and some ( s ) ( s ) readers of this article might this reply out of boxes or ( I ) bothers them .
You have the right to continue reading , or reject what we want to say in regard to one of more vigorous plans of our lives .
For more specific information , check out Jeff Bewkes .
We say vigorous because it is something that will never leave complete or improve .
Time is a valuable gift .
Really , I think that it is more
It is important that any amount of money , without saying that this is not an important part of our lives , believes a psychologist specialized in handling personal conflicts related to work .
There are many decisions taken throughout our lives that give us the feeling that the time is not reached , or that simply seems to be more an enemy than an ally .
People employing more with others the phrase I have no time , are generally disorganized or undecided , says this professional medical .
Many writers such as Randall Mays offer more in - depth analysis .
Another says a process analyst labour who is hired to measure productivity in high level corporate companies .
My job is to try to implement a plan according to all segments of a company , so that they can pay more and its purposes are met .
Among the interesting things that I found , after the collaboration of all the employees of an organization who answered some of my questions in the most honest way possible , I realized that time is poorly exploited .
When recommended them certain changes in the way that should put some plans in the first place and abandon others , this company ’s situation improved .
And that is what we want for those who attend this text : personal situations to improve and the time that we use almost never wasted .
Just thought I would share some of the geeky Christmas ornaments that adorn our tree .

Unfortunately , my three year old daughter has pilfered the thermos that went with it .
Below is an interesting Batman and Robin pairing .
Robin is clearly the Tim Drake Robin , but Batman is n’t wearing blue trunks .
That suggests this is the Batman from shortly after the Troika storyline in 1995 . …
Wow , it ’s scary I know things like that .
Here is a genuine E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial ornament from 1982 .
Somehow I ’ve managed to hang on to it all this time .
Here is another E.T. ornament from 1982 I ’ve somehow managed not to lose .
This one is handmade .
I believe my mother bought it at a craft show in 1982 .
Below is another miniaturized replica metal lunchbox .
This time it ’s from the Super Friends , including images of Flash , Batgirl , Green Arrow , Superman , Wonder Woman , Batman , Robin , Hawkman , and Green Lantern .
The thermos features Catwoman , the Joker , and the Riddler .
Oddly enough I do n’t believe Batgirl or Green Arrow ever appeared on the Super Friends show , and yet they made the lunch box .
Weird .

“ Vexel ” is a combination of the words vector and pixel , and it is used to describe a style of digital art which is entirely pixel - based , but looks like vector art .
Vector uses mathematical equations to create lines and shapes in image whereas vexels are raster works in pixels .
Vexels can be created using any graphic programme like Photoshop , Gimp , Flash , Freehand , Illustrator etc. or the combination of one or more .
Vexels are quite flexible to create and there are various methods of creating vexel art but the overall process is to stack shapes of a certain shape and color to create a whole image using multiple layers , one can also use gradients , paintbrushes , airbrushes or any freehand tool like pencil to give it a desired and unique appearance .
What makes vexel arts so amazing is that each piece takes hours to complete which requires patience , hard work and talent .
Below you will find some amazing vexel arts for your inspiration and some excellent tutorials to get you started vexel art .
Happy Birthday Manda

Photographs of Japan from the Meiji and Taisho Periods ( 1868 -1926 ) have captivated viewers around the world since they were first circulated .
One photographer in particular captured Japanese life so beautifully that his work has been seen by countless people all across the globe .
Until very recently , though , his name was virtually unknown .
Now we know that the prolific photographer ’s name was T. Enami – or rather , that was his trade name .
He was born Enami Nobukuni , and his work made a deep and far - reaching impact on photography .
Some of T. Enami ’s most popular and memorable works were his stereograms : two nearly - identical 2D images taken from slightly different angles that , when viewed together through a stereograph , appear three - dimensional .
Here they are animated to give the 3D effect , but all of the originals can be seen on Okinawa Soba ’s Flickr collection .
Enami started his career as a traditional photographer , but later embraced the more “ modern ” stereoviews and lantern slides .
Judging from his carefully staged stereograms , he approached his work with a great deal of attention to detail .
The colors on these stereograms were all hand - painted , and the resulting product was sold around the world .
Today , collectors treasure these exquisitely detailed antique images .
T. Enami ran a photography studio in Yokohama until his death in 1926 .
His work spanned a multitude of areas , including postcards , large - format prints , private portraits , glass transparencies , photo processing and print - making , and numerous commercial photography projects .
His photographs have appeared several times in the pages of National Geographic , a true honor for any photographer .
One of his half - stereoview images was even used on the cover of their 100th - anniversary book Odyssey : The Art of Photography at National Geographic .
Despite his monumental contributions to early Japanese photography , T. Enami ’s identity was not widely known outside of Japan until around 2006 , when his descendants shared information about him with biographers and collectors .
He was the only photographer of his era known to work in all contemporary commercial and artistic formats , and it can be said that his work has been seen by more people than that of the more established “ masters ” of his time .
The appropriate credit is now being given to thousands of Enami photographs that were previously unattributed or simply attributed to the wrong photographer .
Enami is now , finally , in his rightful place amongst the most influential early Japanese photographers .
A detailed biography of T. Enami can be found at T - Enami.org , and even more of his animated stereograms can be found at Pink Tentacle .
At the same time , Chinese banks are stepping up consumer lending .
The proportion of car sales financed with loans has doubled this year , to nearly 25 percent , although most Chinese still head for dealerships with bricks of 100 - renminbi notes , each note worth about $ 14.62 .
Credit card spending rose 40 percent in the first nine months of the year compared with the same period last year , yet China still has just one credit card for every eight people , compared to two credit cards for each American man , woman and child .
While it is spreading creature comforts , China ’s lending - based prosperity may also be sowing the seeds of future economic problems .
China ’s Banking Regulatory Commission recently told banks to show restraint in lending for the rest of the year , fearful that some of this year ’s loans could become bad debts in the next several years , as happened with the mortgage lending spree in the United States .
The regulator threatened to block banks ’ overseas investments and branch openings unless they can demonstrate adequate capital to cover risks .
The size of China ’s consumer market , notwithstanding its growth , will make it hard for China to rescue the world economy by itself .
Total consumer spending in China is still less than a sixth of American consumer spending at current prices and exchange rates .
That is mainly because China has relatively few restaurants , hotels and other service businesses , even as sales of manufactured goods have risen .
Image
The average price tags on most Chinese products are much lower than in Western markets .
For many products , including some in which China leads in the sheer number of goods , the total dollar value of sales in China is still smaller than in the United States .
The average new car sells for $ 17,000 in China compared with almost $ 30,000 in the United States , according to J.D. Power .
This is because Chinese consumers buy more subcompacts and fewer sport utility vehicles .
While the Chinese market is one - quarter larger in the number of cars sold , the American market is still about two - thirds larger in dollar terms .
Romancing the Atom
Uranium Prospecting , Once and Again
Robert R. Johnson
The development of the first atomic bomb was an astonishingly well - kept secret .
A dead hush was maintained even as the American project grew to an enormous scale — eventually including more than a hundred thousand people and a cumulative budget of $ 2 billion .
By 1943 the Oak Ridge , Tennessee processing facility — containing what was then the largest building in the world — was fully operational ; the Hanford , Washington complex — employing as many people as the nation ’s automobile industry — was also running ; and the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico was assembling one of the greatest concentrations of scientific genius ever to meet in one physical space .
But very few outside these facilities knew what was going on inside , even at the highest levels of government .
It was n’t until April 12 , 1945 , the day President Franklin Roosevelt died of a massive stroke , that newly sworn - in Harry Truman learned of the Manhattan Project and the intention to develop an atomic bomb .
Less than four months later , he made the final decision to drop Little Boy and Fat Man on Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
In an instant , the atomic bomb went from the biggest , best - kept secret in U.S. military history to the subject of intense public fascination , of countless articles , essays , and news reports .
The potential for peaceful uses of atomic power — the idea that atoms could power cars , electric plants , and submarines — absorbed the attention of creative writers , filmmakers , and artists as well as engineers and scientists , although no scientific methods for such uses had been developed by the war ’s end .
In 1946 , President Truman established the Atomic Energy Commission ( AEC ) , the civilian successor to the Manhattan Project , to pursue their development .
But while the fact of nuclear fission had become common knowledge , the logistics were still fiercely guarded as the country entered the Cold War nuclear arms race .
The 1946 law that established the AEC also banned , in a highly unusual restriction on the freedom of speech , the dissemination of any technical information about atomic weapons , even to allies ; violation of the ban could be “ punished by death or imprisonment for life . ”
For civilian atomic energy to grow , however , the government needed the public ’s assistance .
The first atomic bombs had all but depleted the country ’s stockpile of enriched uranium .
It takes enormous amounts of raw uranium to make the fissionable materials necessary for bombs the size of the ones used in the war , and it would take even greater amounts to develop the new , more powerful bombs being planned .
There were few known places in the world where significant quantities of uranium could be mined .
The United States had drawn nearly all of its WWII uranium from the Belgian Congo , which was still a fruitful source for the richest uranium ore ( known as pitchblende ) , and the Eastern European mines that Hitler had captured were temporarily available ; but even with these reserves more uranium was needed .
To this end , the federal government openly encouraged freelance uranium exploration .
Prospecting for precious metals has been a part of human endeavor since prehistoric times , including in North America .
Ancient peoples traveled the vast distance from Asia to the Great Lakes and the Colorado Plateau five thousand years ago in search of copper .
The region has historically yielded copper , iron , selenium , vanadium , and other metals necessary for industrial development , and minor rushes for these elements form a large part of the local history .
However , the uranium rush of the mid-twentieth century surged beyond the merely regional to sweep the nation .
In 1948 , the AEC assigned a set price for uranium well beyond its market value and guaranteed to maintain that price for ten years .
In addition , the commission began offering bonuses of $ 10,000 ( raised to $ 35,000 for a time in the early 1950s ) to individuals who found significant deposits of uranium on public or private lands .
The AEC published a small pocket - sized manual titled Prospecting for Uranium that cost thirty cents and sold more than 16,000 copies within a year of its release .
As the booklet explains , prospectors could stake claims on private land with no restrictions , and on public land they merely paid one dollar for the claim and then took their uranium for assay to AEC - run government offices .
In some cases public lands were expanded to include national parks and monuments , such as Mount McKinley National Park , Glacier Bay National Monument , and Death Valley National Monument .
Thousands of hopeful prospectors , both amateur and professional , came to the American West , predominantly to the vast Colorado Plateau .
Some certainly struck it rich , and their stories are often told in popular literature and histories written by regional authors .
The best known story , one fit for Hollywood , is that of Charlie Steen .
In 1948 , he quit his job as an oil worker in Texas , took his wife and two sons with a small travel trailer into the back parts of the Plateau , and searched in vain for over three years .
After nearly running out of money — his family was living on dried beans —
Charlie found uranium at last : a strike not just of the ordinary yellowcake ore , but of the much richer pitchblende containing upwards of 70 percent pure uranium .
He became fabulously wealthy and , by one account , became the richest man in Utah , garnering a fortune of about $ 130 million by 1955 .
Charlie would go on to squander his riches over the next decade through lavish living and poor investing , but his tale was an avaricious inspiration .
There were several other mother - lode stories like Charlie’s .
A few prospectors made millions ; some made tens of thousands ; most were not so lucky — but their efforts fueled the hype .
Several New Yorker “ Talk of the Town ” articles published between 1948 and 1953 offer a human angle on the frenzy .
In the August 27 , 1949 issue , Brendan Gill tells of a sale at Abercrombie & Fitch for “ Sniffer ” Geiger counters “ for the benefit of sportsmen who want to take up uranium prospecting as a sideline . ”
Investigating the uranium fever in Manhattan , Gill discovered that prospectors were not only going to Colorado in search of uranium , but they were “ currently clambering up schist and down shale within a hundred miles ” of New York .
He visited the local AEC office and there encountered a Mrs. Muriel Mathez , the chief mineralogist of the Raw Materials Operations Laboratory .
She said that her office had received “ twenty - five hundred samples of rock ... since the government uranium - hunting program began last year . ”
The government ’s assaying offices were “ swamped , ” she said , adding that “ ninety percent of the samples never get past our first Geiger - counter test , for the simple reason that they ’re not radioactive .
Heaven knows why people send them in to us . ”
In the January 19 , 1952 issue , Rex Lardner told of “ The Radiac Company , ” a wholesale supplier that had seen such demand for its Geiger counters that it decided to go into the retail business and opened up shop on Fifth Avenue .
The market , it seemed , was not confined to prospectors : the store ’s sales manager explained that teachers , for example , would n’t want to neglect “ the fourth R ” — ranking radioactivity as an essential component of education right alongside reading , writing , and ’rithmetic .
Teachers should let their students know that radioactivity “ is n’t dangerous , necessarily , and has always been with us .
The hands on some people ’s watches are radioactive , ” the sales manager offered .
“ For centuries , glassmakers in Europe used uranium salt to give color to stained - glass windows .
The windows of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine are radioactive .
But harmless . ”
“ Harmless ” is hardly the right word .
While uranium is not nearly as powerfully radioactive as , say , radium — exposure to which infamously killed the “ Radium Girls , ” factory workers who painted watch dials with the glow - in - the - dark substance — it can still pose a health risk .
However , the danger from exposure to radioactive substances was downplayed during the uranium rush .
This was partly because the full extent of that danger was yet unknown .
But the embargo on atomic information , though it did not extend to health risks , had the effect of hushing the discussion of what was already known .
The government ’s interest in acquiring uranium and prospectors ’ interest in discovering it worked in this direction as well ; and to prospectors , what danger they did know of — mining , after all , is always dangerous — simply paled before what they stood to gain .
Meanwhile , the same spirit of innocence and optimism that animated the Radiac sales manager helped bring the fourth R into the realm of games , toys , and science kits .
Board games like the highly popular “ Careers , ” first introduced in 1955 by Parker Brothers , had players compare eight career paths in terms of the fame , fortune , and happiness they could provide .
One of the careers in the original version was uranium prospecting .
“ Uranium Rush , ” an award - winning game of the same era , was modeled after the uranium bonuses and government - prescribed procedures for staking a claim .
Players spun a dial that designated where to go on the board to explore for possible uranium ; once you landed on one of the geographic points represented on the board , a battery - run “ Geiger counter ” was placed on the point of the claim and , if it lit up and buzzed , then you won $ 50,000 from the government bank .
The winner of the game was the prospector with the most money — “ just as in real life , ” as the promotional materials for the game proclaimed .
Touted as fun and educational , these and other board games were joined by the even - more - educational uranium - prospecting science kits .
These included actual Geiger counters , cloud chambers for running experiments , and samples of uranium and radium to be used by the budding young scientists .
Possibly the most elaborate of these kits was the Gilbert U - 238 Atomic Energy Lab circa 1950 - 51 .
It was an expensive toy , costing about $ 50 , and in addition to the Geiger counter and cloud chamber it included an electroscope , four types of uranium ore , the AEC ’s Prospecting for Uranium handbook , a sophisticated instruction manual with readings on the nature of atomic physics , and a reprint of a 1947 full - color comic book titled Dagwood Splits the Atom .
The thirty - seven - page comic is prefaced by a statement from General Leslie Groves of the Manhattan Project .
It employs Mandrake the Magician as primary narrator and uses Dagwood , Blondie , Popeye , Wimpy , and other characters to explain the history and nature of atomic fission .
The comic book concludes with a textbook - like set of questions and answers , and it overviews the potential for future scientists to develop miraculous , peaceful products for industry , medicine , and agriculture through the atom .
The kit had a clear pedagogical intent : if Dagwood can split the atom , then anyone can , and more aspiring scientists would be encouraged to make the dream come true .
Dagwood Splits the Atom was also handed out free at expositions promoting the peaceful uses of atomic energy , such as the Man and the Atom exhibit of 1948 in Central Park sponsored by General Electric and Westinghouse .
“ Over 250,000 copies were distributed , leading GE to order a further printing of several million , ” as Paul Boyer recounts in his 1985 book By the Bomb ’s Early Light .
Within ten years of Dagwood ’s amazing feat , the great uranium rush was nearly over : uranium stockpiles increased , new ore deposits were discovered around the world , and the price plummeted .
Uranium prices dropped again in the 1980s — but primarily because of changes on the demand side of the equation , rather than the supply side .
The rise of the international anti-nuclear movement in the 1970s , and the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 , increased Americans ’ unease with civilian nuclear energy .
Construction of new nuclear power plants came to a virtual standstill .
But today , the uranium rush is making a comeback , as concerns about global warming have heightened the appeal of nuclear power as a promising source of “ green ” energy .
To what extent nuclear power is actually “ green ” remains a matter for debate .
Nevertheless , as the talk of new nuclear plants has grown louder , the price of uranium has risen ; it was selling for about $ 10 per pound in 2002 , and now goes for around $ 45 per pound .
And as the price has risen , more people have been drawn to prospecting .
At the beginning of 2003 , there were only ten open uranium mining claims within five miles of the Grand Canyon .
In May 2008 , there were reportedly 1,100 claims in that radius and a similar number in the five miles beyond that .
In April 2009 , the federal Bureau of Land Management authorized still more uranium permits for the same area .
( At this point , no mining has yet begun there . )
In case you feel left out of the uranium rush , you still can experience a little of the thrill Charlie Steen and those other rough - and - tumble prospectors felt in the 1950s ; all you have to do is contact United Nuclear of Albuquerque , New Mexico and arrange for a day - long prospecting trip .
For only $ 100 per person , the company will take you out into the hinterlands with a guarantee that you will go home with some actual uranium ore — even pitchblende if you are lucky .
The website advertises that “ several customers have sold the ore they found and paid for their trip many times over . ”
The whole family can go , including the dog .
Americans are witnessing a new uranium boom , the latest chapter in the complicated nuclear - energy saga .
It is to be expected that the nation that first developed the atomic bomb — the only nation to unleash its hellish fury in warfare — would have a fraught and intense relationship with atomic power .
For a time in the late 1940s and early 1950s , America was childishly infatuated with the atom ’s peaceful potential ; not long after , atomic energy was on the outs .
Now it is making a return .
Will this time be different ?
How will the atom be unleashed for peaceful purposes — and might we find ourselves leashed to its tremendous powers ?
It seems , for good or ill , that we are drawn irresistibly to the atom , that object of enchantment and horror , of curiosity and awe .
Two weeks ago , during the Liberal Democrats ' conference , David Cameron wrote a sweet - scented address to Lib Dem voters on these pages .
He suggested that we should all unite – under a Conservative banner – to reject the Labour party .
It was the political equivalent of a big group hug – let 's all be friends , and all will be well .
So today , on the eve of the Conservative conference , here 's my reply .
I agree that creating rigid dividing lines between parties where they do n't exist is silly .
Beyond all the ya- boo of Prime Minister 's Questions , consensus between parties can still occur .
I was pleased when Alistair Darling finally agreed with Vince Cable that Northern Rock should be nationalised , despite the objections from George Osborne .
I was pleased when David Cameron belatedly joined the campaign to give justice to the Gurkhas .
So parties do manage to agree with each other from time to time .
But does that mean that political differences do n't matter any more ?
Of course not .
As people search for alternatives to Labour , those differences are more , not less , important .
The key question facing the British people is not whether they want change from Labour , but what kind of change ?
And Cameron and I propose radically different visions of the Britain we want to live in .
The Conservatives have learnt to parrot the language of change , but they wo n't come clean on their real intentions .
They talk about a broken society , but want to spend billions on a tax cut for millionaires while doing nothing for people on ordinary incomes .
Forty per cent of children in poverty live in one - parent households , yet the Conservatives want to provide tax breaks for married couples only .
They talk the green talk , but stand shoulder - to - shoulder with climate - change deniers in Europe .
For all the rhetoric on cleaning up politics , they wo n't even come clean on whether their most important donor pays full taxes in this country .
Cameron 's strategy is simple and , from his point of view , entirely rational : he hopes to breeze into Number Ten on the back of popular despair about Gordon Brown .
But I do n't think politicians should inherit power .
I believe we should earn it .
Rocketing unemployment .
The fiscal deficit .
Climate change .
International terrorism .
Our rotten politics .
The scandal that one in four 11 - year - olds cannot properly read and write .
None of that will be solved by airbrushing out political differences .
The only way we are going to solve these challenges is if we have a serious debate now about the choices we face .
The Liberal Democrats are doing just that .
When Gordon Brown let house prices rocket and personal borrowing get out of control , when he let the bankers gorge themselves on bonuses , David Cameron 's Conservatives said yes and only the Liberal Democrats said no .
We are the only ones with radical plans to transform our tax system so that people at the very top make a fair contribution reducing the burden for everyone else .
Alone in British politics we want to take big money out of party funding altogether , abolish the arrogance of MPs in safe seats by introducing fair votes .
And I will never stop arguing for Britain to stand tall in Europe , rather than whingeing from the sidelines .
Differences matter .
To pretend they do n't is a cynical sleight of hand to deny people the choice they deserve at the next election .
A choice between a Conservative party that will say whatever it thinks people want to hear , and the Liberal Democrats who stand for a Britain that is fairer , greener and stronger in the world .
A choice between fake change and change for good .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Google Inc has introduced a new feature that will allow consumers to use its Google Voice service without switching to a special phone number , potentially broadening the appeal of the nascent , and controversial , service .

Google has introduced a new feature that will allow consumers to use its Google Voice service without switching to a special phone number , potentially broadening the appeal of the nascent , and controversial , service .

Google said late Monday that new users of its service will be able to have the calls that they do n’t answer forwarded to a special Google Voice electronic mailbox , essentially bypassing the voicemail provided by their phone carriers .
Google Voice offers a variety of voicemail management features , including unlimited storage and text transcription of voicemail messages .
The service also allows consumers to make low - priced international calls by routing portions of the call over Google ’s infrastructure and the Internet .
Until now , using Google Voice required adopting a special Google phone number .
The new feature allows people to retain their existing phone numbers .
Craig Walker , a group product manager for real time communications at Google , said the company will provide users with a special code to enter into their phone which forwards unanswered calls to a Google - maintained voicemailbox .
Walker said the call - forwarding feature did not require striking special deals with the phone carriers .
“ Virtually all the carriers already allow this , ” said Walker .
He noted that cell phone operators generally approve of call - forwarding since the carriers charge airtime minutes even after a call has been forwarded to another phone number .
“ It allows them to continue running the meter , they charge per minute while I ’m on that diverted call , ” said Walker .
Google Voice , which was launched in March , is available to a limited number of people who have received invitations from Google or from other Google Voice users .
Walker said the company hopes to make the service open to the general public relatively soon , though he would not specify when .
He also declined to say how many people use Google Voice , but said the company has been pleased with the numbers .
The product has earned positive reviews in the technology press as well as some degree of controversy .
Google has said that Apple Inc rejected the Google Voice application for the iPhone , while Apple has maintained that it is still studying the software .
The dispute has drawn the attention of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission .
And earlier this month , lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives called on the FCC to investigate reports , cited by AT&T Inc , that Google Voice was blocking costly calls to phone numbers in certain rural areas in order to cut down on expenses .
Dr. Bandar al -‘ Iban
Chairman
Human Rights Commission
King Fahd Road , Building no . 373
Riyadh , Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
Dear Dr. al - ‘ Iban ,
I am writing to urgently request your assistance in helping Ms. Nazia Quazi , an unmarried 24 - year - old dual Canadian and Indian national , to leave Saudi Arabia and return to her home in Canada .
The following account comes from an interview with Ms. Quazi conducted by Human Rights Watch on November 25 , 2009 .
Ms. Quazi arrived in Saudi Arabia on November 23 , 2007 for a brief visit with her father , Mr. Quazi Malik Abdul Gaffar , an Indian national who currently lives and works in Saudi Arabia .
Mr. Abdul Gaffar has since forced his daughter to remain in Saudi Arabia against her will by confiscating her Canadian and her Indian passports , and other identification documents such as her driver 's license and her credit cards .
On December 9 , 2009 Nazia Quazi approached the Human Rights Commission for help and according to her , she was told " your father is doing all this for your own security , just respect that . "
Ms. Quazi entered the Kingdom on her Indian passport with a visit visa valid for three months .
Her father took her to get a medical exam whose purpose she did not understand until it became clear that this was necessary for sponsorship purposes .
Mr. Abdul Gaffar is Nazia Quazi's sponsor and he renewed her sponsorship until November 2010 .
On 8 November 2009 , Ms. Quazi applied for a limited validity passport at the Canadian Embassy in Riyadh , where consular officials informed her that because her only proof of identity is a photocopy of her Canadian passport , the embassy may not be able to issue her a new passport .
Even if she were to obtain a new Canadian passport , she says that representatives at the Canadian Embassy , the Indian Embassy , and the Passport Office all told her that she would still require her father 's authorization to obtain an exit visa to leave the country .
On October 28 , 2009 , Ms. Quazi received an emergency certificate from the Indian Embassy which is only valid until January 2010 , but was told that she must arrange for her own exit visa which is arranged at the Passport Office by the person 's sponsor , in this case by Ms. Quazi 's father .
Ms. Quazi informed Human Rights
Watch of a history of abuse by her parents .
According to her , she says that her mother has emotionally abused her and that her father has been physically violent towards her , before and after her arrival in Saudi Arabia .
She says that in July 2008 he held a knife up to her neck and threatened to kill her if she tried to leave the country .
According to Ms. Quazi , her father in June 2009 tried to force her to marry someone she does not know .
She refused to marry and ran away from her father 's home .
Nazia 's mother still lives in Canada with her two sons , 21 and 25 years old .
Ms. Quazi says that her mother supports her husband 's decision to keep their only daughter in Riyadh indefinitely .
During its Universal Periodic Review in June 2009 by the UN Human Rights Council , the government of Saudi Arabia acknowledged that " the concept of guardianship [ can turn ] into domination and coercion . "
Ms. Quazi's case is a clear demonstration of such domination and coercion that men exercise over adult women , restricting their freedom to travel .
Saudi Arabia has accepted the UN 's recommendation to take measures to end the system of male guardianship and to prohibit gender discrimination .
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ( CEDAW ) in 2001 .
Under CEDAW , the kingdom is obliged to end discriminatory practices against women , such as the system of male guardianship .
The government also has obligations to take measures to combat violence against women including forced marriages , and other forms of physical and mental abuse .
In April 2009 , the Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women , its Causes and Consequences , Yakin Erturk , recommended in her report on her February 2009 mission to Saudi Arabia that the kingdom :
Incorporate in law the principle of equality between women and men , and a definition of discrimination based on sex .
Take measures , including through awareness - raising campaign , to end the practice of guardianship and abolish existing legal provisions that require a guardian 's authorization , such as those pertaining to women 's travel or access to services or employment .
Adopt guidelines for government agencies and religious leaders aimed at preventing and ending child and forced marriage .
On November 11 , 2009 , Human Rights Watch also wrote to your organization on behalf of H.B. , a Saudi woman living in Riyadh whose name we are withholding in this public letter for her protection and privacy .
H.B. was raped as a young girl by a family member .
The same family member continues to harass , threaten and beat her .
She approached your organization but her case has only been partially solved .
H.B. was given separate living quarters in her family home , but this has not deterred this family member from entering H.B. 's home and harassing her .
We asked for your urgent intervention with the concerned authorities to protect this woman and her child who lives with her from further abuse and exploitation .
Human Rights Watch has contacted the Saudi Human Rights Commission , but has not yet received a response on this particular case .
Erturk in her report also recommended that to stop violence against women and girls Saudi Arabia should :
Adopt a penal code that defines criminal offenses including rape and sets attendant penalties .
Adopt guidelines for the police and the judiciary on how to investigate , prosecute , and judge cases of rape and sexual violence .
Establish women 's units within the police and the general prosecutor 's office .
Systemize the gathering of data on violence against women , disaggregated by the type of violence and relationship with the aggressor .
Enhance the protection and services offered to victims of abuse by social protection committees , including through legal aid and empowerment programmes .
Conduct awareness - raising campaigns and training for law enforcement officials , the judiciary , health - care providers , social workers , community leaders , and the general public , to increase understanding that all forms of violence against women are grave violations of fundamental rights and incompatible with Islamic values .
The charter of the Saudi Human Rights Commission says that one of the Commission 's tasks is to " receive human rights related complaints , investigate them for certainty , and take regulatory procedures . "
We urge you to fulfil the commission 's mandate by quickly intervening with the responsible authorities to protect the rights of Nazia Quazi and the Saudi woman mentioned above .
Ms. Quazi should promptly receive from her father her Indian and her Canadian passports and all her belongings .
Officials should speedily arrange for all necessary documentation in order for her to be able to leave Saudi Arabia .
Saudi authorities in the meantime should protect Ms. Quazi from any threats by her father , and take legal action against her father in case he is suspected of committing a crime .
In the case of H.B. , we ask you to urgently intervene with the relevant law enforcement and judicial authorities to ensure that she and her child receive protection against sexual violence , harassment , or exploitation by family members .
Such protection should include preventing the family members in question from contacting her or physically approaching her .
Allegations of the past rape should be fully investigated , and prosecutions brought where there is evidence to do so .
We look forward to hearing from you about your actions and further developments in these two cases .
Sincerely ,
Liesl Gerntholtz
Director , Women 's Rights Division

Politicians are not waiting for the science when it comes to the possible dangers of cell phones and legislating based on slim to nonexistent evidence .

Ok , probably not since the jury is still out as to what risks cell phone use could have , but little things like doing studies and coming to a consensus based on empirical evidence wo n’t slow down the efforts of Maine State Representative Andrea Boland to propose a bill which would require that every cell phone sold in the state carries a cancer warning .
If you ’re picturing big boxes alerting you to all kinds of awful health hazards , much like the warning boxes on cigarettes , then you ’re on the right track .
Looks like ’tis the season for technophobia in New England and the old urban rumor of cell phone induced cancer may be back in the media spotlight .
There are plenty of cancer studies involving the radiation emitted by wireless devices , however , a big problem with these studies is the delay between the technological advancement of the devices and finding tumors .
It could take up to a decade for tumors to grow and over this time , the subjects change five or six generations of cell phones and wireless devices .
Which ones are responsible ?
How did their emissions cause tumors ?
Are the tumors really cancerous or benign ?
Is there an identifiable , statistically significant trend in specific cancer types among the heaviest cell phone users ?
These questions are difficult to answer since there are so many kinds of cancers and tumors , and since cancers are a degenerative condition more likely to appear with age , as we ’re living longer and longer lives , it means that more and more people are living to develop cancers and a simple correlation is n’t enough to make the case for cell phones being a major health hazard .
There ’s also the important issue of how radiation from headsets would even cause tumors .
Still , that has n’t stopped both doctors and journalists from claiming that our wireless devices are slowly killing us , or at the very least , harming our kids in unpredictable ways .
For example , last year , The Independent ran an article which linked cell phone use of pregnant women to behavioral problems in children .
Oddly , most of the cited problems sound an awful lot like borderline autism spectrum disorders , so much so , that it ’s kind of surprising that anti-vax groups have n’t been going after cell phone makers .
The study itself monitored over 13,000 kids born in Denmark during the early 1990s and concluded that mothers using handsets more than twice a day had a 54 % chance of seeing their children develop emotional and behavioral problems .
And even stranger , when the kids started using cell phones they were 80 % less likely to develop certain social skills .
It seems , however , that the reporter forgot to look at the study ’s abstract , which states that the results may be completely unrelated and could be due to a wide variety of other factors not tracked by the researchers .
But while the article above and others like it seem to follow the Science News Cycle , sometimes , alarms are being sent out by medical professionals .
As noted in the AP story about the proposed bill , preliminary results of a study on cell phone use prompted the director of University of Pennsylvania ’s cancer center to send out a warning which asked to keep children away from headsets for the safety of their developing brains .
Since the study was n’t named , it ’s hard to track down its actual results , however the fact that doctors are jumping on one of the oldest technophobic urban legends of the last few decades is disconcerting .
This is a situation in which you need skeptics to look over the available information and decide if there really is any evidence for the a cell phone induced spectrum of cancers .
So far , studies seem to show either a slight risk of benign tumor growth or absolutely no notable effects of cell phone use .
Research projects that find any risk of malignancy tended to suffer from poor controls or had a sample too small to be meaningful .
This is why it ’s been so hard to reach a consensus on the issue and the researchers tend to stay away from making definitive claims .
So with all due respect to Rep .
Boland , but her gesture to protect the citizens of her state is based on over - the - top media reports rather than sound science and would more likely scare people and propagate urban myths than help avoid cancers or other health hazards .
What this example shows us , is just how easily bad science in the press can become pointless laws and why we need responsible , skeptical science reporting instead of scary stories about cell phones frying people ’s brains extra crispy with deadly radiation , based on skimming a study which makes no claims to this effect .
It might not move as many papers or generate that many hits , but it would cut down on senseless panic and potentially , needless and confusing laws .

Did you know that of the thirty senators that voted against Franken 's Amendment , only eight were going it alone in their state delegation ?
That 's right – twenty two senators from eleven states voted nay !
That 's what I 'm talking about , fuck yeah !
This is the real America that we were all talking about in 2008 .
In honor of this fact , I 've modified the Our Legislators page to highlight the Senators from these great American states .

Sylvia Banda started Sylva Professional Catering Services Limited in 1986 , even though just 30 years ago women were n’t allowed to own businesses — or even eligible for loans — in Zambia .
She began her business by serving people food she cooked and brought from home on what she calls , a " standing buffet , " because she did n’t have enough money for tables and chairs .
Not having furniture did n’t stop Sylvia ’s business from taking off ; she made almost a hundred dollars after a few days .
And with her husband listed as the proprietor of her business because land rights are limited if not inaccessible to women in Zambia , Sylvia was able to grow her small " standing buffet " into three subsidiary businesses .
Sylva Professional Catering Services
Limited is dedicated to creating , selling and serving nutritious foods , made from indigenous and traditional products that are purchased from local farmers and merchants .
Sylvia provides work for 73 people and has developed partnerships with local development organizations , using her financial and popular success to become a proponent of farmer and employee training .
She calls it " economic emancipation . "
Sylvia ’s success has benefited not just her own family , but the wider community as well .
And Winrock International , an organization that collects examples of projects focused on sustainable food , improving livelihoods and preserving local food traditions , hopes to extend her positive impact even further still by making her case study available as a resource and model for potential entrepreneurs — and for policy makers and NGOs who support potential entrepreneurs — around the world .

Device can track people without sensors
by Staff Writers
Orlando , Fla. ( UPI ) Nov 30 , 2009
The world 's first device capable of tracking multiple people without attached sensors is here , and scientists see in the invention opportunities for more efficient military training and warfare readiness .
Orlando - based Organic Motion computer vision company unveiled the tracking platform at the Interservice Industry Training , Simulation and Education Conference , the world 's largest of its kind that opened Monday at Orlando 's Orange County Convention Center .
Tracking devices have different uses , none more challenging than in a modern warfare scenario where soldiers can end up in dangerous , unpredictable situations and lose contact with their commanders , often with disastrous results .
The new motion tracking platform , OpenSTAGE , does not require participants to wear any attached devices , tags or sensors .
The technology enhances the operations of a wide range of simulated training environments and is apparently effective in tracking multiple people at the same time , without special backgrounds or controlled environments .
Analysts said the OpenSTAGE multi- track platform would improve the way armed forces prepare personnel for military operations .
Organic Motion said the device would work for dismounted soldier training programs , military operations on urban terrain , better known in the industry as MOUT , and " Close Combat Tactical Training Dismounted Soldier " simulations .
The tracking platform eliminates the need for any additional attire , enabling multiple fighters to step into a virtual world with no prep time and be instantly tracked .
As a result of the new platform being in place , multiple teams can now participate in simulated maneuvers , including live interaction with friends or foes , continued tracking of soldiers after they dismount in Combat Vehicle Simulators , or tracking of shooters in a shoot house .
Organic Motion CEO Andrew Tschesnok said OpenSTAGE " is a major leap for simulated training and the applications are immense . "
He said the company had developed OpenSTAGE to meet the rigorous demands of the defense industry .
" By eliminating sensors , an entire squad can now achieve instant entry into a far more realistic training environment and have their movements tracked and displayed in real - time , all at a lower operating cost and with maximum throughput . "
To deliver a training - ready system , Organic Motion has integrated MAK's VR - Link networking toolkit and VR - Vantage 3D visualization solution into the product .
VT MAK , a company of VT Systems Inc. , develops software to link , simulate and visualize the virtual world .
The integration of MAK 's products means trainees can actively participate in the most realistic simulations , with minimal negative training , all in real time .
Organic Motion 's image - processing software will analyze the video feeds to capture position , orientation , posture and motion of subjects in the scanning space .
OpenSTAGE will then communicate the resulting information in real time to VR - Vantage , where an animated 3 - D model mimics the motions of the live person within a simulated scene .
VT MAK CEO Warren Katz said the new technology would " usher in a new era of immersive training " for dismounted infantry and their units .
He said it will also greatly reduce the cost of operating such systems .
OpenSTAGE supports integration with existing military equipment and increases the speed and efficiency of training readiness for a wide range of simulations .
LAHORE : A Pakistani court today dismissed a petition seeking asylum in the name of ' holy war ' for five American Muslim youths recently arrested in the country for allegedly planning terror attacks , saying that it was not the duty of the judiciary to define ' jihad ' .
The Lahore High Court dismissed the petition filed by Khalid Khwaja , a former Inter - Services Intelligence official now associated with a rights organisation .
In his petition , Khwaja had contended that the youths came to Pakistan for ' jihad ' ( holy war ) and since this was not a crime , their detention is illegal .
Lahore High Court Chief Justice Khwaja Mohammad Sharif , who heard the petition , observed that it was not the duty of the court to define ' jihad ' .
The judge did not comment further and dismissed the petition .
Khwaja also asked the court to direct authorities to grant the youths asylum in Pakistan as the US administration might " not spare them " .
He claimed the accused are innocent of any wrongdoing , either through their actions or intentions .
" They are being suspected of a crime they never committed nor ever intended to commit .
In such a case , the US constitution protects all its citizens of wrongful accusations and wrongful imprisonment .
We must have faith in our system of laws that they will seek out truth and deliver justice , " Khwaja said in his petition .
Update : As of Friday , May 29 , 2020 , we are open , but with new restrictions : Everyone must wear a face mask , and there may be only one person * in each area or room .
Sign - up sheets are published on Slack to help avoid conflicts .

Hyundai Motor America is providing new sales support program for the American buyers .
The American Automakers including Hyundai , have suffered most during the recession period .
Now they are coming up with the new strategies to increase sales .
Hyundai initiated in January 2009 , a unique consumer protection initiative .
This bold initiative envisages the buyers of Hyundai can return their vehicles to the company if hit by economic uncertainties .
This complimentary service is termed Hyundai Assurance and is all cost free .
Hyundai is extending this program through 2010 .
They advocate that costly purchase causes tremendous stress on customers who lose their income unexpectedly due to recession or any other reason link to it .
So they can return the new vehicle and feel free .
This new strategy prompted confidence among the Americans and Hyundai sales increased over 6 % in 2009 and improved their market share .
Hyundai Motors America has extended the Hyundai Assurance to include America ’s Best Warranty and 24 - hour Roadside Assistance for 5 years of vehicle purchase .
The CEO of the Auto Company claims that this assurance plan was different which is showing positive results in their favor .
He further states that you can expect more facilities with the launch of all - new Tucson and Sonata .
We may mention here that Hyundai program was assimilated by many others including Airlines , retailers and other Auto Makers to improve their sales .

Conservationists call for action at the " highest level " to halt poaching Rhino poaching around the world is on the rise despite efforts to protect the animals , a report warns .
The global surge in the illegal trade has been driven by demands from Asian medicinal markets , the study by conservationists concluded .
It suggests that a decline in law enforcement is the main reason for the rise in poaching in Africa .
The report found that 95 % of rhino poaching in Africa since 2006 had occurred in Zimbabwe and South Africa .
The data was compiled by Traffic , the global wildlife trade monitoring network , and the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , with funding from WWF International .
The findings have been submitted to the secretariat of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) , ahead of a key gathering in March .
The authors added that poachers were now adopting much more sophisticated techniques such as veterinary drugs to kill their prey .
' Unrelenting poaching ' " Concerted action at the highest level is needed to stop this global crisis of rampant rhino poaching , " said Amanda Nickson , director of WWF International 's species programme .
The authors call Zimbabwe and South Africa the " epicentre " of poaching " We call on the countries of concern to come ... in March with specific actions they have undertaken to show their commitment to stopping this poaching and protecting rhinos in the wild . "
The report documented a " decline in law enforcement effectiveness and an increase in poaching intensity in Africa " .
It said that the " most serious " situation was in Zimbabwe , where rhino numbers were " declining , and the conviction rate for rhino crimes is only 3 % " .
Until recently , the nation 's rhino population had enjoyed a recovery and had been stable for a number of years .
But they also found that poaching and illegal trading in rhino horn were on the increase in South Africa , despite the introduction of a number of new anti-poaching measures .
Between 2006 and 2009 , the report listed 210 rhinos as being illegally killed in South Africa , with a further 235 being poached in Zimbabwe .
" These two nations collectively form the epicentre of an unrelenting poaching crisis in southern Africa , " stated Tom Milliken , a Traffic researcher .
It 's not all bad news for the world 's rhino population
In pictures : Nepal 's rhino comeback Traffic and IUCN added that Asian species , including Sumatran and Javan rhinos - found in Malaysia , Indonesia and Vietnam - were also a cause for concern .
" Sumatran and Javan rhino range countries need to increase efforts to better assess the current status of many of their rhino populations , " observed Dr Bibhab Kumar Talukdar , chairman of the IUCN Asian rhino specialist group .
He called for enhanced protective measures , such as preventing the loss of rhino habitat and better " biological management " , in order to ensure that the remaining rhinos had the best possible chance of survival in the future .
However , the report concluded that some nations had taken considerable steps to improve protection measures .
" Nepal , in particular , seems to have successfully addressed a serious poaching crisis , " it observed .
But it warned that the growing market for rhino horns in Asia , primarily for medicinal use , meant that all nations had improve their efforts to protect the threatened species .
The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species places the African black rhino ( Diceros bicornis ) in the critically endangered category .

The Iranian state broadcaster , Irib , has been accused of faking dramatic footage of an anti-government protester setting fire to a portrait of Ayatollah Khomeini , Iran 's revered revolutionary leader .
The images caused shock and incredulity when broadcast and have now provoked a row among the country 's Islamic leadership , with opposition leaders , senior clerics and the institution charged with preserving Khomeini 's works accusing Irib of desecrating the late ayatollah 's memory .
Hundreds of theological students staged a rally in Tehran yesterday in protest at the " insult " .
The alleged incident was screened repeatedly last Monday after a day of clashes between security forces and opposition demonstrators in Tehran and other cities .
Protesters used the occasion of students ' day to renew opposition to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , whose disputed re-election in June continues to send shock waves through Iran 's political system .
Film of them setting alight Khomeini 's portrait was calculated to convey the message that they were bent on reversing the 1979 Islamic revolution .
The footage also showed pictures of Ahmadinejad and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader , being burned .
But sceptics pointed out that the face of the supposed protester was not shown and there appeared to be no witnesses in the shot .
Portraits of Ahmadinejad and Khamenei have been defaced , but there had been no known previous instances of attacks on pictures of Khomeini .
Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , the two defeated reformist candidates in the presidential election , claimed the images had been doctored .
" I am sure the students have never gone over such boundaries , because we all know they love the imam [ Khomeini ] and are prepared to sacrifice their lives for his goals , " Mousavi told the newspaper Jomhouri Eslami .
Karroubi said in a statement on his website , Tagheer , that Irib was meant to be above politics , but " some in this organisation believe they can justify cracking down by using the name and reputation of the imam " .
Even more damagingly , the Institution for Publishing Khomeini's Works said it knew of no instances of demonstrators desecrating his image .
" Even if we assume that an ill - intentioned and anonymous person did this , expanding ( the footage ) to make it look as if the overwhelming atmosphere was in line with this incident is a clear lie , " the institution 's vice - president , Hamid Ansari , wrote in an open letter .
Irib insists its report was genuine .
The broadcaster 's vice - president , Ali Darabi , claimed that foreign broadcasters had aired the incident in even greater detail .

Under UV light , the worms turned blue and were paralysed Scientists have shown off an effect not unlike that of the " phasers " in the show Star Trek - but it only works on tiny worms called nematodes .
They used a special molecule that , when exposed to ultraviolet ( UV ) light , changes its shape .
When the worms were fed this molecule and then exposed to UV light , they exhibited paralysis .
But when the worms were again exposed to visible light , they regained their ability to move .
The work is published in Journal of the American Chemical Society .
The authors claim the research could have therapeutic applications .
The phaser is a fictional invention in the Star Trek TV shows and films , a gun- like device that can stun or kill adversaries .
The effect in this study is down to the molecule dithienylethene .
This belongs in a family of compounds known as " photoswitches " , which reversibly change their shape in response to light .
While some so - called photodynamic therapies already make use of light to release chemicals or make them more reactive , only photoswitches can be returned to their starting shape , on exposure to light of a different colour .
They are routinely used in chemistry experiments to investigate fundamental processes , but the researchers from Simon Fraser University in Canada say their work is the first time the photoswitching effect has been demonstrated in a living animal .
Stop light
The team started with tiny , transparent Caenorhabditis elegans nematode worms , an animal frequently employed in scientific research .
Therapy using light could benefit from the control of photoswitches
After feeding them a solution containing dithienylethene and exposing them to ultraviolet light , they turned blue - because the " switched " form of the molecule is blue .
The worms remained paralysed until exposed to normal light , which returned the dithienylethene molecules to their starting condition and the worms to theirs .
Neil Branda , lead author of the research , said that a likely reason for the paralysis is that the " blue " form is much better at attracting electrons , which would interrupt metabolic pathways in the worms and starve them of energy .
" I 'm not convinced there 's a legitimate use of turning organisms on and off in terms of paralysis , but until somebody tells me otherwise , I 'm not going to say that there is n't an application , " Professor Branda told BBC News .
The researchers are more interested in the demonstrating the potential use of photoswitches in " photodynamic therapies " within the body .
Doctors use light - sensitive materials and photo - reactions in medicine to treat certain forms of cancer .
" Right now , [ photodynamic therapy ] tends not to have as much control as the clinicians would like , so we have the potential opportunity to be able to turn the therapy off and on , " Professor Branda said .

Women tend to have a more emotional response
Men and women may respond differently to danger , a brain scan study suggests .
A team from Krakow , in Poland , used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to assess brain activity when 40 volunteers were shown various images .
Men showed activity in areas which dealt with what action they should take to avoid or confront danger .
But the study , presented to the Radiological Society of North America , found more activity in the emotional centres of women 's brains .
The researchers , from Jagiellonian University Hospital in Krakow , carried out scans on 21 men and 19 women .
Brain activity was monitored while the volunteers were shown images of objects and images from ordinary life designed to evoke different emotional states .
Fight or flight response
The images were displayed in two runs .
For the first run , only negative pictures were shown .
For the second run , only positive pictures were shown .
While viewing the negative images , women showed stronger and more extensive activity in the left thalamus .
This is an area which relays sensory information to the pain and pleasure centres of the brain .
Men showed more activity in an area of the brain called the left insula , which plays a key role in controlling involuntary functions , including respiration , heart rate and digestion .
In essence , activity in this area primes the body to either run from danger , or confront it head on - the so - called " fight or flight response " .
Researcher Dr Andrzej Urbanik said : " This might signal that when confronted with dangerous situations , men are more likely than women to take action . "
Positive images
While viewing positive images , women showed stronger activity in an area of the brain associated with memory .
With men , the stronger activity was recorded in an area associated with visual processing .
Dr Urbanik believes these differences suggest women may analyse positive stimuli in a broader social context and associate positive images with a particular memory .
For instance , viewing a picture of a smiling toddler might evoke memories of a woman 's own child at this age .
Conversely , male responses tend to be less emotional .

Library of CongressThe problem with relying on World War II as the historical parallel for an energetic , last - minute drive by the U.S. to save the world from climate cataclysm , is that it depends on domestic climate impacts equivalent to Pearl Harbor to kick the whole thing off .
I have argued that only such conditions–say , two Category 5 hurricanes passing over Florida in a single season –will be powerful enough to knock business - as - usual - thinking off kilter , and that U.S. environmentalists ought to prepare for rapid , non-linear action within chaotic social circumstances .
The problem with that analysis is that it will probably come too late to change the outcome , and it ’s too grim to sustain hope .
Copenhagen has altered the political terrain here in the U.S. , providing us an opportunity to aim for rapid political change , more dynamic and more hopeful than waiting for a climate Pearl Harbor .
COP15 failed by almost any standard , yet the drive by leaders from island and African nations and 350.org to wrench the world ’s understanding of climate from a challenge resolvable by incremental steps within present markets and governmental frameworks to the central moral imperative confronting humanity may well have succeeded .
There are many parallels between our present condition and the decades 1830 - 50 , when the then - moribund drive to end slavery became the dominant question before the nation and flash point for the Civil War .
Slavery moved from peripheral concern to central matter of national self - definition through singular actions taken by a handful of remarkable individuals .
Negotiation with slaveholders .
The monolithic , inextricable nature of slavery stumped every leader from Thomas Jefferson to Abraham Lincoln , and mainstream anti-slavery advocates , none of whom could envision any exit other than gradual , cooperative measures acceptable to slaveholders , such as voluntary manumission , resettlement of former slaves in Africa or South America , and federal buy - out .
Because anti-slavery efforts were deferential to slaveholding states ’ interests , they were necessarily long term and in -urgent .
Accommodation peaked with the Missouri Compromise of 1820 , hailed as the first act by the United States to limit extension of slavery , and embraced by slaveholders because it guaranteed the extension of slavery in new territories below the Mason - Dixon line–a compromise derided by Thomas Jefferson , who observed that “ a geographical line , coinciding with a marked principle , moral and political , once conceived and held up to the angry passions of men , will never be obliterated . ”
William Lloyd Garrison & abolition .
An out of work printer and editor named William Lloyd Garrison stood before an audience of Boston Unitarians and Universalists ( the only congregations willing to hear him ) on October 15 , 1830 , and issued the first public call for “ immediate , unconditional emancipation , without expatriation , ” which , he said , “ was the right of every slave and could not be withheld by his master for one hour without sin . ”
Furthermore , Garrison said , “ by holding fellowship with slaveholders , ” in their churches , mercantile enterprises , and political parties , New Englanders gave moral sanction to slavery .
Garrison ’s words divided anti-slavery forces into two camps : those who , through personal prejudice or pragmatic politics , continued to advocate small steps that might past muster in Congress , and those who rallied to his immoderate call for immediate abolition .
John Brown & Harpers Ferry .
Garrison polarized the moral ground , but slavery remained a second - tier concern until John Brown ’s raid on Harpers Ferry , in October , 1859 , ignited the national furor that led directly to secession , election of Abraham Lincoln , and the Civil War .
On May 30 , 1880 , Frederick Douglass delivered a memorial address , in which he said , “ If John Brown did not end the war that ended slavery , he did at least begin the war that ended slavery …
Until this blow was struck [ at Harpers Ferry ] , the prospect for freedom was dim , shadowy , and uncertain .
The irrepressible conflict was one of words , votes , and compromises . ”
Prolific burning of fossil fuels is no less monolithic , globally , than slavery in the Antebellum South .
So too , our organizations and politicians aiming to ameliorate climate change , like anti-slavery advocates , see no alternative but to negotiate with coal and oil interests .
Cap and trade is as disingenuous and fruitless as gradual emancipation , and the Markey / Kerry bill is the moral equivalent of the Missouri Compromise , ostensibly aimed at righting a great wrong , while in substance guaranteeing maintenance of the institution that perpetuates that wrong .
The purpose of Markey / Kerry is to ease the minds of those desperate for climate action , even as the extension of coal burning is written into federal law .
Its premise is that emancipation from fossil fuels must , perforce , be a gradual undertaking of small steps acceded to by our enemies , with a final accounting made the responsibility of some other generation .
The target of returning below 350 ppm is the critical benchmark defining the problem ( with accumulating evidence that “ below ” is closer to 300 ppm and may require rapid return below pre-industrial 275 ppm ) , but having already blasted past this mark , 350 ppm alone is ambiguous .
How much higher can we safely go ?
Is 450 ppm an acceptable peak ?
550 ?
For how long ?
Lacking scientific certainty , we are forced to make judgment calls that amount to playing dice for survival .
We stand on no true ground , have no moral compass , and are unable to apply any standard other than ascertaining what we think may be palatable to our enemies .
But Copenhagen clarifies .
As environmentalists , we must , and have , acted on behalf of species facing extinction and ecosystems on the road to destruction , but as practical players within a society largely unmoved by such concerns , our central argument must be anthropocentric .
We no longer confront speculative injuries remote in time and place ; huge populations are on the very brink of catastrophe , with loss of water perhaps the most immediate threat .
Therefore , any act that countenances the extension of fossil fuel burning is wrong .
Anything short of immediate and total shutdown of extractions is immoral .
That we are all complicit is no justification for acquiescing to evil .
That the violence commences with extractions recognizes the injustice done to local peoples , whether they be in Appalachia or Nigeria ; but more profoundly , we must accept that every investment in fossil fuel exploration and each decision to mine or drill is a deliberate , premeditated , and ruthless act .
To say this is to state the obvious .
Yet if this is so , and if we continue our rush toward self - induced cataclysm , then why do we continue to treat with the prime authors of our mass suicide ?
Look at BP–“ Beyond Petroleum ” –with its flowery logo and bold vision of transforming energy supplies .
BP CEO Tony Hayward caused a stir last year when it was reported that the company planned to sell off its renewable energy division , * but this was a small kerfuffle compared to the overall perspective , in which BP has never deviated from its drive to overtake Exxon - Mobil as the major fossil fuel company in the world .
For two decades now , environmentalists have courted BP ( once led by another John Browne ) .
Environmental Defense conducts joint programs , ED and NRDC head up USCAP with BP , and CERES , our environmental voice within the investment world , conferred an award on BP .
To what end ?
In the twelve years since BP first teamed up with ED , BP ’s profit has risen from $ 2.8 billion to $ 25.5 billion , with the overwhelming bulk of investment going to fossil fuels .
Capital expenditures and acquisitions in 2008 alone totaled $ 30.7 billion , against which BP ’s pledge of $ 1.25 billion annually over 10 years for renewable energy is paltry , even assuming the promise is kept .
It may once have been reasonable to try negotiating with BP and others , but no longer .
Something other than dialogue is required .
John Brown provided that kick - in - the - pants to complacent anti-slavery efforts by the attempt to capture the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry and ignite a slave rebellion , succeeding in the end in getting two sons and a number of other followers killed , and himself hung .
Poorly conceived and without hope of success , the raid and John Brown ’s bearing through trial and execution nonetheless galvanized both sides , polarizing and elevating the conflict around slavery .
That Brown ’s action was violent and murderous reflected both the author and the times , a thing to be firmly eschewed .
Non-violent civil disobedience is the means for direct moral action , as the waves of protest at coal plants , in the mountains of West Virginia , on the Boston Commons and before the offices of organizations that continue to collaborate demonstrates .
Slavery ended in the United States when it did because slaveholders over - reached , but the end of the peculiar institution could not have been avoided .
Abolition would have been delayed , however , absent the actions of Garrison and Brown .
Time , of course , we do not have , so it is incumbent upon us to take up the same challenge that Garrison made of the citizens of Boston : to examine in what ways our organizations and associations aid and abet the practice of evil ; to take direct , non-violent action to halt those practices ; and , if we are not so situated , to provide all possible assistance and aid to those in the front lines in West Virginia , Boston , and coal blockades across the nation .
* Hayward quickly retracted the statement , reaffirming BP ’s commitment to renewables and carbon emissions reduction , yet the company has taken a number of contrary actions , including recent sale of Indian wind farms , complete withdrawal from the UK renewable sector , and repudiating a pledge to capture and store carbon in natural gas extractions .
[ email protected ] “ ¿ Pedro ?
Ahora si , ya te cargó la ch ... ” , escuchó el conductor desde el asiento de su automóvil mientras el semáforo estaba en rojo .
A plena luz del mediodía , en el cruce de Fortuna y calzada de Guadalupe , en la delegación Gustavo A. Madero , “ Pedro ” — cuyo verdadero nombre fue cambiado por seguridad — , sintió la amenaza y se preguntó cómo sabían sus datos personales .
Un joven de camisa blanca con franjas azules bajó de un taxi que quedó atrás del Chevy .
Caminó entre los autos .
Simulaba hablar por teléfono y se paró junto a la ventana del conductor .
Al confirmar que era él a quien buscaba , se llevó la mano al pantalón y le mostró una pistola .
La luz roja no cambiaba .
Del lado del copiloto , otro joven — que luego dijo llamarse “ Óscar ” y tener 20 años — , esperaba que le abrieran la puerta .
Parecía el inicio de secuestro .
Quien primero lo amenazó retrocedió y de nuevo se subió al taxi con cromática y placas oficiales .
De entre los peatones y los automovilistas hubo alguien que alertó a los cinco policías de tránsito que conversaban a la salida de una tienda , pero no veían el peligro porque un camión torton les tapaba la vista .
“ Se están llevando al señor en el Chevy blanco ” , les alertaron .
“ ¿ Cuál coche ? , ¿ quién es ? ” , preguntaron los uniformados mientras desenfundaban sus armas .
Como escena de película , se acercaron al auto , lo rodearon y le apuntaron al agresor .
Al ver a los policías , “ Pedro ” abrió la puerta y en un salto salió del auto .
“ ¿ Qué te pasa , por qué haces esto ? ” , preguntó encolerizado al segundo agresor .
Éste ya tenía en su poder su cartera , reloj , teléfono celular del comerciante .
Encañonado y sin salida , el presunto delincuente no tuvo opción y fue arrestado .
Aún faltaban sus cómplices que iban en el taxi , pero hábil , el conductor de éste pisó el acelerador y burló a los policías a quienes casi atropelló .
Luego , se perdió entre las calles de la colonia Guadalupe Tepeyac .
El arma del policía lo siguió , pero sin disparar para evitar herir a los testigos que ya armaban alboroto .
Eran comerciantes del lugar , vecinos y curiosos que nunca faltan .
Algunos curiosos exigían ansiosos hacer justicia por propia mano .
Aprehendido uno de sus captores , “ Pedro ” trataba de calmar sus nervios y el color de su rostro regresaba del pálido al normal .
Acababa de salvar su vida .
“ Gracias .
Son mis ángeles .
No sé qué sería de mí si no hubieran hecho lo que hicieron ” , agradeció .
Aún no entendía qué había pasado segundos antes de cambiar la luz del semáforo .
Ya en el Ministerio Público , mientras esperaba el turno para su declaración , “ Pedro ” dudó en levantar la denuncia penal , pues sus agresores le advirtieron que sabían dónde localizar a sus hijos .
Todavía en estado de shock , dijo : “ Por mí no hay problema si me matan o no , pero ¿y mi famlia ? ” .
As the New York City mayor ’s race enters its final , combative stretch , Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his opponent , Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. , have unleashed a flood of advertisements that contain distorted , misleading and , in some cases , outright false claims about everything from the creation of jobs to plans for tax increases .
With many New Yorkers just beginning to tune in to what has been a late - blooming campaign , the truth - stretching  in TV commercials , Web advertisements and mailed brochures  could be the primary exposure they have to the two candidates .
Both the mayor and the comptroller have misrepresented each other ’s records , but Mr. Bloomberg has taken the biggest liberties .
In ads that follow Web users as they move from site to site , the mayor claims that Mr. Thompson “ never created a single job ” ( false ) and “ fought reform ” at the Board of Education ( misleading ) .
The mayor implies , in one commercial , that Mr. Thompson plans to raise income taxes across the board , and he has even bankrolled a Web site , ThompsonTaxHike.com , dedicated to the subject .
But Mr. Thompson has not proposed such a tax increase in his campaign ; instead , he favors a higher income tax for the rich .

Feeling more like a secluded retreat than an office building , the Renzo Piano Building Workshop in Punta Nave radiates with tranquility .
Perched on a steep slope above the sea , Punta Nave houses the Italian headquarters of world - renowned architect , Renzo Piano ( * awesome name alert * ) .
Composed of a system of glass terraces gradually sloping towards the sea , the building recalls the shapes of the greenhouses typical of the Ligurian coastline .
Here , natural light plays a major role on the interior space within .
Based solely on the pictures below , the Workshop in Punta Nave just exudes a calm and peaceful environment I would love to work in !
Absolutely serene .
Built in 1989 toward the western edge of Genoa , the site has been purposely isolated like a desert island .
It invites calm , silence , concentration and creativity .
It is not , however , a hermitage : people of all different nationalities work there , and the door is always open to colleagues .
Punta
Nave is in perfect harmony with its surroundings .
The workshop ’s gradually sloping terraces , which open onto the sea , are built in glass and made to be exact replicas of the traditional greenhouses found on the Ligurian coast .
Lying between the mountain and the Mediterranean Sea , Punta Nave stands as a homage we wished to give to the sea .
The workshop is an immense greenhouse overtaken inside and out by all types of plants and greenery , creating the feeling of a privileged communion with nature .
In the same spirit , we sought to take maximum advantage of the zenithal light that pervades every aspect of life here and has rapidly become our natural clock .
While Punta Nave is a refuge deliberately away from the center , it can nevertheless communicate in real time with the rest of the world thanks to new technology .
It is therefore not really the opposite of the city ; it is what we prefer to call a post - urban research center .

In an update that was recently posted on the official Battlefield Blog , Bad Company 2 - producer Gordon Van Dyke stated that the PC Beta will launch later this month on January 27th , and last until February 25th .
The PC Beta will be feature a different map than the one found in the Playstation 3 beta that has been available for several weeks now .
The new map is known as Port Valdez and is set in the Alaskan mountains where Russian forces have launched an all - out offensive against the oil industry in that region .
The map mixes vehicle and infantry combat .
The PC Beta will be available to players who have pre-ordered the game at participating retailers , such as Gamestop.com or the official EA Store .
Similar to other games in the Battlefield series , the PC version of the game will utilize the Punkbuster system to prevent hacking or cheating in the online - multiplayer portion of the game .
Furthermore , it was stated that EA DICE will not be making the files available that are required to host a private dedicated server .
Instead , players interested in operating their own server will be required to rent a server made available by EA .
Finally , the post concluded with a small teaser image , which showed a player viewing an apparently blurry image from the game .
However , the player is seen to be wearing Nvidea Geforce 3D Vision glasses , and the packaging for these glasses is partially visible in the picture .
This suggests that Battlefield : Bad Company 2 will be one of the very first games to be 3D - enabled .
The teaser image , as well as a picture of the Gefore 3D Vision glasses can be found after the jump .

Dist :: Zilla - 2009-12-11
I Hate Wrapping
I like to give people things that they like .
It 's nice for someone to open a present and find just the thing they wanted -- or better , something that they did n't know they wanted , but that they 're elated to receive .
It 's a nice feeling .
I just do n't like wrapping presents .
I have to pick wrapping paper , measure it , cut it , tape it , and try not to make it look like a five year - old did it .
I generally fail at all of these tasks and hand people presents that are balled up in tape and crumpled paper .
It 's the same feeling I get when I release code to the CPAN : I 'm excited that people might find it useful , even if they had n't realized they 'd wanted something like that -- but I 'm annoyed at the idea of writing up all the stupid boilerplate : generic hunks of Pod , build files , the same tests I use everywhere else , license documents .
It 's just a pain , and I still end up with a big red " You forgot the README ! " light flashing at me on CPANTS .
At least , I used to .
First , to fight this problem , I started using Module : : Starter , and I contributed a number of changes to make it easier to extend .
I did n't get it very easy to extend though , just slightly more than it had been .
In the end , too , it really only got you started , as the name suggested .
Every time you wanted to make a new release or add a file or change something you 'd put in all the files , you realized that Module : : Starter stopped being useful well before your first release .
I tried to use Module : : Install to deal with this problem , and it helped a little .
It could add a few files that I 'd need generated like license documents or tests .
It just did n't do enough -- and it was such a pain to extend , being built with weird fundamental design decisions atop the ancient and insane ExtUtils : : MakeMaker .
My Own Private Gift Counter
Finally I decided that all I really wanted was a way to make make install way , way more powerful and hookable .
I made a little flowchart of the steps I wanted to perform and then build a little skeleton of code to hang those steps on , and that skeleton was Dist : : Zilla .
Dist :: Zilla , as the name suggests , is an absolute monster .
It only needs to be run by maintainers of CPAN distribution , not installers , so it does n't shy away from demanding all sorts of hefty prerequisites .
Here 's how I use Dist : : Zilla , more or less , although there 's more than one way to do it :
~$ cd code ~/ code$ dzil new My - Project will create new dist My - Project in / Users / rjbs / code / My - Project ~/ code $ cd My - Project ~/ code / My - Project $ vi dist.ini
Most of my dist.ini , the master configuration file , is set up for me already -- it 's only about five lines -- but I edit it a bit to make it look like this :
1 :
2 :
3 :
4 :
5 :
6 :
7 :
8 :
name = My - Project
author = Ricardo Signes < rjbs@cpan.org >
license = Perl_5
copyright_holder = Ricardo Signes
[ @RJBS ]
[ @Git ]
[ AutoPrereq ]
Now I 'm ready to start coding .
I 'll make a t/ my - tests.t and lib / My / Project.pm .
My module might look something like this :

2 :
3 :
4 :

use Games :: War : : Nuclear :: Thermonuclear :: Global ;
use Path :: Resolver 2.012 ;
=method play_a_game
$ project->play_a_game ( $num_of_players ) ;
This method starts a game .
It 's a strange game .
=cut
sub play_a_game { ... }
1 ;
You can load up your Changes , too , just adding the details of your release so the file looks like :
Revision history for {{$dist -> name}} {{$NEXT}} first release does n't handle zero players tends to destroy civilization
That 's it .
Now , when you run dzil release , this happens :
abort if you 're not all committed to git
determine all prereqs by finding " use " and similar statements
write out a README , LICENSE , Makefile .
PL , MANIFEST , META.yml and META.json
decide on the next release 's version number
defined $ VERSION in all your packages
add a NAME , VERSION , LICENSE , and AUTHORS section to all the Pod
turn all =method commands into grouped " normal " Pod
update the changelog with the new version and the current date / time
build a tarball and upload it to PAUSE ( submit it for CPAN index )
commit the changes to the changelog file
tag the release
push the changes and tags to the remote git repository
I 've actually left out a few steps that are very useful but harder to explain .
All of those steps happen for each release , so you can reconfigure them all each time without having to update a lot of embedded boilerplate code -- the kind you 'd end up with , with other distribution - creation systems .
Finally , all those steps are configurable .
I described the configuration that I showed , but you could use fewer plugins , or more plugins , or just different plugins .
If you want to maintain your own list of prereqs , you can .
If you want to write your own MANIFEST , you can do that -- and there 's even a plugin to sanity - check it for you when you try to build a release .
By making it so easy to wrap up and deliver your code , Dist : : Zilla lets you just enjoy giving the gift itself -- so you 'll be eager to do it all the more often !

- Berlusconi invoca l'immunità parlamentare .
Quella prevista dall ' articolo 68 della Costituzione per i discorsi dei parlamentari anche quando parlano fuori della Camera di appartenenza .
È la difesa che il premier ha scelto nella causa civile intentata dal gruppocontro di lui , per le parole pronunciate all ' assemblea dei giovani industriali a Santa Margherita Ligure ( Genova ) .
In quell ' occasione , Berlusconi aveva invitato gli industriali a interrompere gli investimenti pubblicitari verso i quotidiani catastrofisti e aveva parlato esplicitamente di " giornali che cantano la canzone della crisi quando loro stessi sono causa della crisi " .
Inoltre , secondo i legali del gruppo , il premier accusava ladi muovere un attacco eversivo nei suoi confronti .
Davanti al presidente della prima sezione civile , Alda Vanoni , i legali del premier Vincenzo Mariconda e Giovanni Lombardi hanno sollevato la questione dell ' immunità da cui sarebbe coperto un parlamentare in merito alle dichiarazioni espresse .
Il giudice Vanoni ha fissato udienza l'8 di gennaio e poi il 23 e il 28 gennaio per le precisazioni e le conclusioni delle parti .
Successivamente il giudice deciderà se ritenere sussistente l'immunità oppure se chiedere alla Camera dei deputati di pronunciarsi .
Nel caso la Camera dovesse esprimersi per l'immunità a quel punto il Tribunale potrebbe sollevare conflitto di attribuzione tra poteri dello Stato davanti alla corte Costituzionale .
Nella citazione i legali del gruppoCarlo Federico Grosso e Francesca Lucchi chiedono la condanna generica di Berlusconi senza indicare cifre relative all 'eventuale risarcimento .
Secondo gli avvocati del gruppo editoriale da parte di Berlusconi ci sarebbe stato un comportamento di concorrenza sleale a favore dei media controllati da lui .

Panos
Ideas are in short supply , too
THE 1990s was “ the age of abundance ” , argued Brink Lindsey in a book of that title .
Round the world , incomes were rising ; capital markets were processing endless flows of money and investment ; technological gains meant that ever more information was available ever more cheaply .
And politics in the age of abundance , Mr Lindsey claimed , was all about values .
In America this was the period of the “ culture wars ” over abortion and gun ownership ; internationally , there was a huge expansion in concern over human rights .
The 2010s , it is sometimes said , will be an age of scarcity .
The warning signs of change are said to be the food - price spike of 2007 - 08 , the bid by China and others to grab access to oil , iron ore and farmland and the global recession .
The main problems of scarcity are water and food shortages , demographic change and state failure .
How will that change politics ?
In the domestic debates of some rich democracies , things are shifting already .
In Europe the talk is of how to distribute the pain of cutting public debts .
In America the return of mad - as - hell populism looks like a turn away from the politics of abundance ( see article ) .
Now , a report for the Brookings Institution , a think - tank in Washington , DC , and the Centre on International Co-operation at New York University * looks at international politics in an age of want .
The sort of problems governments increasingly face , they say , will be much less predictable than those associated with old great - power rivalries .
Pressure from demography , climate change and shifts in economic power builds up quietly for a long time — and then triggers abrupt shifts .
They claim that the current global system is ill - designed for such a world .
It is not just that the foreign policies of big countries are in flux .
Rather , the way states deal with new threats is , in the jargon , “ stove - piped ” .
As a UN panel said in 2004 , “ finance ministers tend to work only with the international financial institutions , development ministers only with development programmes . ”
The authors say that what is needed is not merely institutional tinkering but a different frame of mind .
Governments , they say , should think more in terms of reducing risk and increasing resilience to shocks than about boosting sovereign power .
This is because they think power may not be the best way for states to defend themselves against a new kind of threat : the sort that comes not from other states but networks of states and non-state actors , or from the unintended consequences of global flows of finance , technology and so on .
What would all that mean in practice ?
They cite the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation as the sort of institutions they want more of : bodies that use technical expertise — leaving aside the IPCC 's mistake over the melting of Himalayan glaciers — to induce countries to recognise their mutual interests .
Such agencies can promote foresight , and help governments think harder about the consequences of failure ( unlike traditional diplomacy , which likes muddling along ) .
They propose an Intergovernmental Panel on Biological Safety along the lines of the IPCC to improve biosecurity ; they also suggest boosting the G20 by giving it a secretariat and getting national security chiefs together .
Many of these ideas may go nowhere ; national sovereignty is hugely resilient .
But to those who call the whole exercise pointless , they cite Milton Friedman , who , when monetarism was being mocked in the 1970s , replied “ our basic function [ is ] to develop alternatives to existing policies , to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable . ”

Brookings / CIC .
A member of The Economist served on an editorial board that reviewed an early draft of the paper .
During his recent visit to Dublin , Workers Solidarity took the opportunity , over “ bad coffee ” , to chat to 93 year old Roma Marquez Santo about some of his experiences of the Spanish revolution .
In 1936 Roma was a metal worker and a member of both the UGT trade union and the POUM , an anti-Stalinist communist party .
What was it like on the first day of the revolution ( after the generals ’ attempted coup d’état ) ?
It was chaotic !
For a while no one knew what was happening or what was going to happen .
The streets were full of workers with every type of weapon , the factories and barrios ( neighbourhoods ) were quickly secured but we had to take the main barracks where an anarchist comrade Francisco Ascaso was killed .
The army surrendered there and elsewhere , especially where the Guardia Civil ( Spanish paramilitary police force ) came out on the side of the people .
But there were factories to be organised and food to be got from the countryside .
This was organised very quickly as committees were already set up and ready to deal with such a situation .
After a day or two , there was lots of food .
And weapons too .
The revolution is crazy , disorganised .
But quickly enough it gets organised …
It was a good time to be in Barcelona , we the people were in charge !
What was the journey like to the front ?
We ’d be going through the villages and people would call to us ‘ stop , we want to come too ! ’
Many did but more had to stay to take over the land and secure the harvest .
This was organised by committees in each village and the harvest was organised and sent back to the cities and towns where the factories were now held by workers ’ committees who ’d always been there in the background , waiting for something like this to happen .
We were finally issued with 81 mm mortars and stayed on the front until the government started to arrest the leaders of the POUM in Barcelona , then I became an anarchist and a member of the CNT militia .
What happened to you at the end of the war ?
We were all arrested by the fascists .
Those who admitted to have volunteered were taken away and it looked as if there ’d be mass executions .
However , we were put on trial and were lucky : a fascist officer we ’d captured had no complaint to make against us .
There was nobody to make false allegations about our conduct and they decided to give us 20 years .
This was in 1939 ?
Yes .
But there must have been too many of us and it was reduced to 6 years .
I was actually in for 3 years , 9 months and 14 days before they released me …
What then ?
I went back to Catalyuna but of course I could n’t get work .
The whole place had changed , before the war workers had been reasonably well off ; afterwards … it was a poor time .
As a former political prisoner you were n’t given a ration card ?
Yes .
We had cousins in the US who sent money back and we lived on that for many years .
Finally Roma , what continues to inspire you ?
The economic troubles in the world today show us that capitalism is still here ; it has not been defeated .
It is hard to defeat capitalism , but we ’ve got to try .

Christmas is coming , so it wo n't be long before you 're walking barefoot through spilled soda and children 's vomit at a security checkpoint in some godforsaken airport .
Fortunately , the TSA has leaked a sensitive document explaining how to avoid all that .
Well , not quite .
But the Transportation Security Administration has placed its standard operating procedure manual for screening supervisors online — the document is marked " Sensitive Security Information " and is supposed to be distributed on a " need to know " basis , but what the hell , right ?
Transparency !
The TSA did have the good sense to redact all the stuff they though terrorists might use to game the screening system and get through with weapons , but because they are stupid federal bureaucrats they simply drew little boxes over the secret stuff in the pdf files .
So " hackers , " by which we mean " people with Acrobat Professional , " simply removed the boxes and looked at what was underneath .
( The stuff the TSA tried to redact is outlined in red below . )
You can read the whole thing at Cryptome .
But we 've distilled the unredacted manual with an eye toward whatever tricks we could find to avoid getting pulled aside for special screening and missing your flight .
With that in mind , here are Gawker 's rules to infiltrating our nation 's airports on your way home this Christmas :
1. Do n't Be From Cuba , Iran , North Korea , Libya , Syria , Sudan , Afghanistan , Lebanon , Somalia , Iraq , Yemen , or Algeria
If your passport has any of those countries ' names on it , you 'll get pulled aside as a " selectee " for special one - on - one screening .
So if you are from Pakistan , move right on ahead !
2. Pack Your Ammo Carefully
If it 's in your checked luggage , feel free to bring along any ammunition up to .50 caliber , as long as it's inside a box .
3 . If the Airline Ticket Agent Wrote " SSSS " on Your Ticket , Just Turn Around and Go Home
The industry lingo for people who get pulled aside and questioned at airport security checkpoints is " SSSS , " for " Secondary Security Screening Selection . "
We figured that airlines would use some sort of secret code to communicate to the TSA that a given ticketholder was due for the third degree , but nope — it looks like they literally just write four S's on your ticket .
So now you know .
4. Be a Minor , Member of Congress , Uniformed Military Member , or All Three
If you 're unlucky enough to have been tagged with the dreaded " SSSS " code , all is not lost : Members of Congress , children under 12 , and uniformed military servicemembers are exempted from special screening even if they 're marked for it .
Which is great , because we know that , say , Army officers can't present a special security threat that might merit scrutiny .
The manual also helpfully shows TSA supervisors what a congressional ID looks like , so you might want to forge one before you head to the airport , just in case .
5. Better Yet , Be a Foreign Dignitary in CIA Custody
One of the best bits that the TSA tried , and failed , to redact from the manual reveals the existence of the CIA 's Worldwide Operational Meet and Assist Program ( WOMAP ) , whereby the Agency will apparently dispatch a CIA agent to ferry foreign assets to the U.S.
When they do , the subjects are fully exempt from screening — no magnetometer , no bag search , no nothing .
So if you know anyone at Langley , they may be able to hook you up .
Again , the TSA has helpfully presented an example of a CIA ID card — does n't carrying one of these defeat the purpose of being a CIA agent ?— so you should set yourself up with a fake before you try the WOMAP route .
Oh , and if you get caught , just run : TSA officers are instructed not to " detain or delay " anybody they suspect has presented them a fraudulent ID if they 've already gotten past security .
But if you travel at peak times , the chances they 'll spot the fake will go down to 25 % , because regulations permit the TSA to examine IDs with a black light or loupe on only one in four passengers if traffic backs up .
6. Make Yourself a Diplomatic Pouch
Diplomatic pouches are exempt from security screening .
You 'll still have to go through the checkpoint , but you wo n't be slowed down by the x-ray machine .
The manual helpfully explains how to make one , with a description of where the seal could be .
Do n't worry about getting caught with this one — have you ever seen a diplomatic pouch before ?
Neither has the 19 - year - old TSA officer you 'll be presenting it to .
7. Be Disabled
The explosive trace detection ( ETD ) process , when a TSA officer swabs your bag and runs a sample through a machine to look for trace amounts of explosives , can be cumbersome and time - consuming .
Wheelchairs , orthopedic shoes , and prosthetic devices are exempt .
8. If You 've Got Explosives In Your Checked Luggage , There 's Only a 20 % Chance They 're Going to Actually Open It to Conduct a Test On It
So there 's that .
9. Just Skip the Checkpoint and Go In through the Exit Door — They 're Not Monitored by Trained TSA Officers
It looks like they let just anybody monitor the exits .

I recently read an article by the Nobel Prize - winning economist Paul Krugman in which he described the renewed battle between so - called freshwater economists ( so named because they are largely based at the University of Chicago and other Midwestern universities ) and saltwater economists ( based primarily at Princeton , MIT , Berkeley and other coastal universities ) .
The freshwater economists are disciples of Adam Smith and espouse the free - market and rational actor models .
The saltwater economists align with John Maynard Keynes and his belief in the need for regulation in financial markets and that people are n't rational actors .
The past 50 years have been dominated by freshwater economists who had a reverential faith in the power of free markets ( Smith 's " invisible hand " ) and the rationality of people in their financial decisions .
Given what has happened to our economy in the last decade , noted for its multiple bubbles ( e. . , Internet , housing , mortgage ) , it 's hard to believe that any of these " efficient market " adherents still have jobs , much less credibility in how the economy actually works .
I would love to put these economists on the couch and explore what is going on in their heads that enables them to observe the objective reality of the recent economic devastation , yet still hold as sacred their most basic , yet obviously flawed , beliefs about a free - market - driven financial system .
As I have read more about the Smith followers , what seemed like pretty obvious questions kept popping out of my head :
What universe do these people live in ?
Do these economists live in complete isolation without interaction with actual human beings ?
Have they never been in love , been gambling , or had ?
Have they never seen people get angry , frustrated , , excited , or joyful and then observed their subsequent behavior ?
If we ever had answers to these questions , we would understand the how of their devotion to an economic mindset that is clearly not supported by economic reality .
These questions then led me to ponder the why of their dedication :
Are these economists such number - crunching automatons that they never even consider actual human behavior in the real world of finance ?
Are they so doctrinaire as to miss the obvious ?
Are they so enamored of the sheer elegance of their mathematical theorems that they reject outright and without consideration what is clear even to laypeople ?
What I find ironic is that , by rejecting the irrationality of human behavior , they are in fact affirming its irrationality .
To see ourselves as rational beings is the epitome of irrationality .
Of course we are n't rational , and you do n't need a Ph.D. to realize that ( though an advanced degree from the University of Chicago seems to have the opposite effect ) .
Human beings , for all their cerebral development , still act most of the time the way animals and humans have for millions of years , namely , as irrational , unpredictable , and not particularly intelligent creatures .
What I find so remarkable is that there is any debate at all .
As a former psychology professor of mine once noted , " All psychology does is label things that we already know to be true . "
In the Bizarro world of freshwater economics , that adage would be modified to , " All economics does is reject things that we already know to be true . "
Thankfully , the emerging field of , which is the melding of psychological and economic thinking , has generated a growing body of research demonstrating that we are , in fact , incredibly irrational beings who act in ways that are not only poorly conceived , but that are often counterproductive and sometimes even self - destructive .
Examples of such irrational behavior can be found in a variety of well - researched cognitive biases ( courtesy of Wikipedia.com ) :
Bandwagon effect : we believe or do things because others believe or do them .
: seeking out information that supports our beliefs .
Illusion of control : our belief that we have more control over outcomes than we actually do .
Déformation professionnelle : looking at things through the lens of one 's profession while ignoring broader perspectives .
The last cognitive seems particularly fitting for freshwater economists who seem to have been so busy developing their fancy theories in their laboratories that they forgot to look outside and see what was actually happening in the real world .
The list of cognitive biases that we succumb to goes on and on with most having direct implications for understanding our financial behavior .
Finally , it is instructive - and scary - to consider the degree of hubris or denial on the part of the freshwater economists , whom I would assume are very intelligent men and women .
They continue to cling to now - discredited theories , even when confronted with overwhelming experimental and real - world evidence that demonstrates what just about everyone else in the world can see with their own two eyes : humans , including economists , are not rational !
Game development often lasts for years .
In that stretch of time , studios have their fair share of ups and downs .
From humorous game bugs to stress - relieving antics , Game Informer peers behind the curtain of game development .
In this entry of Tidbits , developer Gearbox Software shares secrets behind the development of Borderlands .
There were about 64,000 check-ins to make Borderlands .
Mikey Neumann ( creative director ) did the motion capture acting for the intro featuring Lilith strutting and blowing a kiss .
The dog paw around Brick 's neck was his dog growing up .
Her name was Priscilla .
You can see him as a child with her in the intro cinema to the game !
Crazy Earl , ClapTrap , Scooter and all of the enemy battle dialogue is voiced by Gearbox employees .
The player character Lilith went through seven full revisions until the art director was satisfied with the final version .
ClapTrap was actually the last character added to Borderlands .
Gearbox uses a proprietary automated build system that runs multiple platform builds nightly in addition to specific builds that are manually triggered by developers .
The final shipping build of the Xbox game was number 5,700 .
There was a suggestion to feature midgets attached to cables that other bandits could toss at you .
A full body explosion will spawn 1 liver , 1 - 2 kidneys , 1 - 3 limbs , skull chunks , lots of blood , and other random body parts that have a chance to stick to walls .
23 babies were born to Gearbox developers during the course of this game – three of them to a single designer and his wife .
The Borderlands Official Strategy Guide is the longest strat guide Bradygames had ever written for a single game .
We had a bug once that Lilith ’s voice sounded ‘ too sexual ’ in the international versions , we let it slide .

Galal Nasser , a prominent columnist in Egypt 's al - Ahram Weekly recently wrote : " Violence has become the norm in Arab life , both on official and non-official levels ... There are many types of violence besetting the domestic scenes of Arab countries , making relations among them unpredictable and unstable . ”
Nasser also notes that “ Some analysts speculate about a culture of violence and argue that its roots are embedded in religious texts that call for Jihad , that urge the faithful to wage a perpetual fight for virtue and against sinfulness … ” he adds that " Neighborliness does n't seem to count for much either .
There are many instances of strained relations among Arab countries .
Currently , tensions exist between Morocco and Algeria , Libya and Tunisia , Jordan and Palestine , Qatar and Saudi Arabia , Syria and Iraq . ”
Hence , an Israeli withdrawal from the mountain ridges of Judea and Samaria ( the most effective tank obstacle in the region , overtowering Jerusalem , Tel Aviv and the 9 - 15 mile sliver along the Mediterranean ) would ignore the intense , volatile and unpredictable 1,400 year old inter-Arab violence and its implications for the security requirements of the " infidel " Jewish State .
" The state is involved in the production , export and triggering of violence … nourishing some and instigating others , making deals and manipulating players just to keep its ruling elite in place …
Ruling elites are fighting tooth and nail to stay in office .
Any challenge to their authority is viewed as an act of war .
Meanwhile , the opposition can find itself in dire straits : either it faces a slow and painful death or opts for suicide in a hopeless war … "
Meanwhile , Dr. Marwan Kabalan last month wrote in the Persian Gulf News :
" Six decades ago , immediately after the departure of the colonial powers , the Arab world had big and ambitious dreams : unity , development , equality , prosperity and a reasonable degree of economic independence .
Sixty years on , one is tempted to ask if the Arab world has really realized any of these objectives and whether they were realistic and achievable in the first place …
" Arab rulers have clung to power with complete disregard for public interest …
The result was total failure in every aspect of state activities … and to a consequent increase in the use of force to maintain order and control …
One consequence of these policies was the weakening of national identity and the revival of communal tension .
Hence , people in Iraq and Lebanon and many other Arab countries came to identify themselves as Sunnis , Shiites , Kurds and Christians ; rather than Iraqis , Lebanese or whatever else . ”
" No wonder that the Arab world looks today much more fragmented , poorer and hopeless than it was at the dawn of independence …
For most of these ills , Arab regimes have only themselves to blame .
They have indeed left us with very little to celebrate . ”
In conclusion , due - diligence of the 1,400 year track record of inter-Arab violence behooves the Jewish State to maintain a Middle East - driven ( and not wishful - thinking - driven ) threshold of security .
Israel 's defensible borders and Israel 's agreements concluded with Arab leaders must withstand the implications of potential highly probable and violent abrogation and inter-Arab regime - change .
Israel 's security requirements must be the derivative of the 1,400 year old inter-Arab reality :
No inter -Arab comprehensive peace , no inter-Arab compliance with most inter-Arab agreements , no inter-Arab ratification of all inter-Arab borders and no Arab democracy !
Hence , the security indispensability of the mountain ridges of Judea and Samaria - the Cradle of Jewish history - for the survival of the Jewish State .
The nickname " The Second City " was intended as a slight by writer and proud New Yorker A.J. Liebling , but taken another way , it inadvertently captures one of the town 's greatest legacies : its ability to rebuild and reinvent itself .
The same century that witnessed the burning of Fort Dearborn and the mass destruction of the Great Chicago Fire also saw the completion of the Illinois - Michigan Canal , the arrival of the World 's Columbian Exposition , and the building of the nation 's first skyscraper .
Today , that resilient spirit can be felt throughout the city 's diverse neighborhoods , but especially in its bustling downtown .
The pulse of industry and progress beats through The Loop , Chicago 's historic commercial center and the country ’s second - largest business district .
Skyscrapers loom large here , including the Willis Tower ( formerly the Sears Tower ) and the Chicago Board of Trade .
This part of town is also home to award - winning waterfront parks and a glitzy theater district , along with a spectacular array of public art , including outdoor sculptures from Picasso and Joan Miro .
A recent cultural renaissance has seen Chicago 's South Loop turn into one of the city 's most vibrant residential and industrial centers .
Here you 'll find some of the buildings that made Chicago one of the world 's leaders in architecture in the 1880s and ' 90s — a title it 's held ever since .
To the east lies Lake Michigan and the Museum Campus , a 57 - acre lakefront park that 's home to the city 's trio of natural - sciences museums : the Field Museum , the Shedd Aquarium , and the Adler Planetarium .
Just north of the Loop , the Gold Coast neighborhood hugs the shore of Lake Michigan , occupying some of the city 's most desirable real estate .
The area 's reputation as an upscale residential spot dates back to 1882 , right after the Great Chicago Fire , when wealthy businessmen began building castle - like mansions along the waterfront––some of which still stand today .
The Gold Coast 's ritzy legacy is also alive and well at the many clothing stores lining North Michigan Avenue — the so - called Magnificent Mile––and on Oak Street , home to luxury boutiques from designers such as Chanel , Prada , and Hermès .
Simply riding down Lake Shore Drive is an architecture tour in itself , thanks to the superstar skyscrapers lined up along the lakefront .
At 18 - miles long , the adjoining Lakefront Trail provides an eco-friendly way for runners and cyclists to take in the view .
The route also conveniently passes by famous Chicago sights such as Grant Park , Navy Pier , and North Avenue Beach , where crowds gather during the summer to people - watch , play volleyball , and listen to live music at beachfront bars .

Swedish Member Of Parliament : Leading Politicians Support 9/11 Truth Movement
Political leaders for 9/11 Truth growing in numbers
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Monday , Nov 9 , 2009
A Swedish Member of Parliament has pledged support for a new investigation into the events of 9/11 , adding that prominent political figures support the view that elements of the U.S. government were involved in staging the attacks .
An article headlined “ The U.S. was part of the attack ” in the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet , highlights comments made by MP Egon Frid of the country ’s “ Left Party ” .
“ The U.S. administration knew of the terrorist attack before and was a part of it , ” Frid said in an interview with Swedish TV network TV4 on it ’s “ Kalla Facts ” ( Hard Facts ) programme .
“ My curiosity has once again led me in new ways and to top it all , I have new theories about what really happened 9/11 ″ Frid writes on his blog .
Frid , who was elected to parliament as a full member in 2006 , also stated that he knows there are several leading politicians in Sweden who are interested in the Truth Movement ’s message , but they will not go public with their views “ because it is an impossible debate . ”
Frid also revealed that he has joined the “ Political Leaders For 9/11 Truth ” group , to which other notables have pledged support , such as Andreas von Bülow , former German State Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Defense , Yukihisa Fujita , Japanese Member of Parliament , Michael Meacher , Minister of the British Parliament , Cynthia McKinney , Jesse Ventura , and many other political luminaries from all corners of the globe .
The group was founded earlier this year , joining the growing ranks of professionals calling for a new independent investigation into 9/11 , including the groups :
Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth
Firefighters for 9/11 Truth
Journalists and Other Media Professionals for 9/11 Truth
Lawyers for 9/11 Truth
Medical Professionals for 9/11 Truth
Pilots for 9/11 Truth
Religious Leaders for 9/11 Truth
Scholars for 9/11 Truth & Justice
Veterans for 9/11 Truth

In 2007 , the popular BitTorrent tracker OiNK was shut down by Dutch and British police .
Four users of the popular BitTorrent tracker have already been sentenced to community service and ordered to pay fines .
The trial of site admin Alan Ellis started today .
OiNK was considered by many to be the finest BitTorrent music tracker the world has ever seen .
The private site tracked hundreds and thousands of torrents linking to the finest recordings from virtually every musical genre .
With millions of peers , it was more popular than many public trackers .
The site was shut down in a joint effort by Dutch and British law enforcement in October 2007 , based on intel provided by two music industry lobby organizations , the IFPI and the BPI .
The police arrested Alan Ellis , the founder of the site , and months later several uploaders were arrested as well .
Four of the uploaders pleaded guilty at Teesside Crown Court in December 2008 , where they were all charged with copyright infringement offenses .
The four were later sentenced to community service and fines .
The trial of OiNK founder Alan Ellis was pushed back and started today at Middlesbrough Crown Court .
Due to a press boycott of the previous court hearings , there was no information available on the reasons for the delay .
What we do know is that Ellis has been charged with conspiracy to defraud the music industry for his role in the OiNK tracker .
During the first day of his trial little has happened .
The case has been adjourned until tomorrow when the jury will be assigned .
There is still a reporting ban in place on three specific issues , but the trial can and will be reported on .
We will cover the rest of the trial , which is expected to end next week , in the coming days .
Update : Court documents list the remaining uploader as part of the trial , but new information received by TorrentFreak says that his case is due later this year .

Anne Boleyn , although unable to survive her marriage to Henry VIII , was rumored to have resisted the onslaught of another sixteenth - century scourge : Sudor Anglicus , or English sweating sickness .
The mysterious illness surfaced in England in the summer of 1485 and struck four times over the next century before disappearing .
This frequently fatal disease caused fever , profuse sweating , headaches , and extreme shortness of breath .
Death usually came quickly .
It killed some within three hours , wrote one Tudor chronicler .
Some within two hours , some merry at dinner and dead at supper .
Medical historians have never known what caused the sweating sickness .
That the disease was neither plague nor typhus was clear from contemporary accounts .
Its victims bore neither the boils typical of plague nor the rash of typhus .
Now physicians Vanya Gant and Guy Thwaites , both of St. Thomas ' Hospital in London , think they may have identified the killer .
Sudor Anglicus , they say , may have been an early version of a disease that has made headlines in recent years : hantavirus pulmonary syndrome , which erupted in the Four Corners region of the American Southwest in the summer of 1993 .
The similarities between the two are striking , says Gant .
First , there is hanta 's rapid course .
Basically , you 've got a headache in the morning , you 're short of breath in the afternoon , you take to your bed at teatime , and you 're on a respirator by midnight , he says .
Second , sweating sickness left its victims breathless .
Hanta also leaves people gasping , filling their lungs with fluid .
Perhaps most suggestive of a common identity for the two diseases is that each epidemic of sweating sickness appeared in the summer and often in rural areas , meaning that a rapidly breeding rodent may have been its primary host ; hanta 's main refuge is the deer mouse .
Finally , the sweating sickness typically killed robust adults , just as hanta does .
Most flu viruses , on the other hand , strike hardest at the elderly .
Gant and Thwaites say they could conceivably test their hypothesis .
Henry Brandon , duke of Suffolk , who succumbed during the epidemic of 1551 , was buried in a cemetery that still exists .
It would be possible to exhume the body and search for hantavirus rna .
Unfortunately , this type of genetic material is unstable and the odds of its survival low , so the researchers have no plans to disturb the duke 's grave .
Even without sixteenth - century hantavirus in hand , though , Gant believes there 's little room for doubting the true identity of the Tudor disease .
People should not be blind to the possibility that things that are hailed as new may well be what has always been here .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Assume you are a scientist and have been given a major financial grant to prove that the mythical unicorn really did exist .
You know that as long as you can demonstrate some progress in showing the unicorn might have existed , your financial grant will be renewed each year , provided some other scientist does not come out with substantial evidence that the unicorn could not have existed .
Under such conditions , you would have a very strong incentive to disregard much of the evidence that the unicorn could not have existed and each year provide only the data that could demonstrate that the unicorn might have existed .
You also would have a very strong incentive to attack any scientist who raised serious questions or provided evidence that the unicorn could not have existed .
You even might go so far as to refer to them with the disparaging term “ unicorn deniers ” and attempt to use your influence with other scientists who also are receiving grants dependent on the existence of the unicorn to try to prevent the unicorn deniers from publishing their findings in well - regarded scientific journals .
The recently released e-mails ( by whistleblowers or hackers , depending on your prejudice ) between some of the best - known scientists behind global warming showed that they succumbed to the all - too - human tendency to protect their turfs and pocketbooks , despite the evidence .
As an economist , not a climatologist , I have followed the debate carefully for years .
It has been all too evident that many in the man -made - global - warming camp have vested interests in certain outcomes because of the government grants they receive .
( This is not meant to imply that most scientists have sold their integrity for government grants . )
It has been known for a couple of hundred years that the Earth goes through regular cooling and warming cycles .
The legitimate debate is about how much man-made carbon dioxide ( and other greenhouse gases ) contributes to the current cycle , if at all , and whether it is more cost - effective ( or even possible ) to try to modify climate change or just adapt to it through engineering changes ( e.g. , the dikes in Holland ) and building at a greater distance from the shoreline .
My colleagues at the Cato Institute found many highly qualified climate scientists ( hundreds of whom were willing to sign a public statement ) who seriously questioned much of the “ science ” behind many of the legislative and other public policy demands of the global warming lobby .
Members of the media are usually quick to understand and publicize conflicts of interest for public officials when it comes to road - building contracts and the like but seem to be blind to the conflicts of interest for scientists and others who claim to be impartial scholars .
The United Nations ’ report on climate change is considered by many in the media and the political world to be a gold - plated standard of truth when it comes to the climate - change evidence - which we now know is tainted .
What the media and the political class should be doing is seeking out those highly qualified climatologists and other relevant scientific experts with no financial or other vested interests ( which include grants from either governments or industries that may have an economic interest ) to provide independent evaluations of the evidence and arguments from all sources .
In my own field of economics , we find an international tax - increase lobby , almost all of whose members are dependent on government grants ( directly or indirectly ) , to be endlessly lobbying for more taxes and regulations , which increase the power of the political class .
The lobby routinely ignores the evidence that almost all governments tax and spend at rates far above the welfare and growth - maximizing rates and that more taxes and bigger expenditures reduce both economic opportunity and individual liberty .
Again ignoring the evidence from almost everywhere that more government makes things worse rather than better , the proponents of higher taxes also argue that government is about the only force for good and , if government only had more money , it would manage things better and waste less .
Sen. Judd Gregg , New Hampshire Republican , and Sen. Kent Conrad , North Dakota Democrat , have proposed a new , bipartisan commission to deal with the government deficit , and it already has 31 sponsors .
The advocates know it ultimately will recommend some cuts in government spending and increases in some taxes .
They are either intellectually ignorant or corrupt because the effort is focused on the deficit , which is only a residual of the real problem - excessive government spending - which neither party has the intellectual and moral courage to address seriously .
Can you think of something much more intellectually dishonest than saying health care reform will insure many millions more , will not add to the deficit , will not result in any increases in taxes for anyone but the rich and will “ bend the cost curve down ” ?
Hmmm .
Businesspeople are fined and even sent to jail for making false claims about what their goods or services will do .
If false - claims standards were applied to the political class ( and those who report this misinformation as fact ) how many in Congress , the administration and mainstream media would be out of jail ?

Sandy 's owners believe he was stolen before ending up on a ferry A cat that went missing in Hampshire turned up on a cross - channel ferry as it arrived in Bilbao , Spain .
Sandy the ginger tom went missing from his home in Lee - on - Solent on 10 December .
He was discovered on the vehicle deck of the Pride of Bilbao as it docked at the Spanish port on Monday morning and returned to the UK the next day .
Sandy 's owners face a bill of about £ 2,000 for fees while the cat spends six months in quarantine .
Luckily Sandy had been micro chipped so staff on the P&O ferry were able to find out where he was from .
' Sting in tail ' Sandy 's owner Tim Austin believes his cat was stolen .
He said : " My wife went and delivered leaflets through doors but he was out of the country all the time .
" We were surprised that he was on a ferry because there was no way he could have got there by himself .
" Without the chip , almost certainly the animal would have been put down and we would have never known . "
Sandy was returned to the UK on Tuesday evening but was met by DEFRA officers and has to stay in quarantine for six months .
Mr Austin said : " The fact that the cat is now in quarantine is just something that has to happen .
" But , quite surprising and a sting in the tail , is that it will cost about £ 2,000 by the time all the bills are paid including the kennel fees if he has to stay there for six months .
" He did n't leave the boat but he left UK waters and that 's the issue but we do n't have a problem with that .
We are allowed to appeal and we will do that and whatever the result , we will abide by that . "

Sorry to say it , but in many ways traveling back to the U.S. these days feels like you 're entering a third world country .
You fly back to America and you think , " Where are the bullet trains , automated customs , and man-made snowstorms ? "
While America definitely had an early lead with allegedly important breakthroughs such as the computer , car , airplane , and internet , Asia has been far better at actually implementing new technology and ideas .
Here are just a few examples ...
North Korea , formally known as the Democratic People ’s Republic of Korea , is often referred to in the mass media as “ The Hermit Kingdom . ”
There is much justification for that designation .
It came as a surprise to me that you can actually obtain a tourist visa for North Korea .
I first read an article in 2007 about how there are a few Canadians who visit each year on a tourist visa .
That is unlike Saudi Arabia , for instance .
From visahq.com , “ The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia does not issue tourist visas . ”
There is the irony that you can get a tourist visa to visit an “ Axis of Evil ” country , as branded by the George W. Bush administration , yet ca n’t get one to visit a designated ally .
The travel advisories issued by the Canadian government , which has among the best relations with most nations of the world , North Korea has the second - lowest travel risk , with 22 countries having a higher level of risk .
The countries with an “ avoid all essential travel ” advisory are : Angola , Burundi , Central African Republic , Congo , Democratic Republic of Congo , East Timor , Eritrea , Iran , Lebanon , Liberia , Madagascar , Mauritania , Niger , Nigeria , and Pakistan .
The countries with an “ avoid all travel ” advisory are : Afghanistan , Chad , Guinea , Iraq , Somalia , Sudan and Yemen .
Sounds like he 's been taking lessons from some of the anti-gay nuts here in the US ( Peter LaBarbera must be so proud ! ) .
But just who is Pastor Ssempa - and why is he known as " Rick Warren 's Man " in Africa ?
Much more , including video , after the jump ...
In the immediate aftermath of the presentation , which ended prematurely , Pastor Ssempa said he did not regret his actions .
Pastor Martin Ssempa on Tuesday plumbed the depths of notoriety when he offered graphic images of gay sex as proof of the need for tough penalties against homosexuals .
But midway through his presentation , saved on a computer , most of his audience walked out , some visibly disturbed , leaving him to wonder if he had done anything wrong .
The cleric seemed genuinely rattled when he asked : " Why should I be traumatised ? "
His solution to garner support to kill gays in Uganda ?
Call a press conference , the latest in a series of events he is holding , to show fetish porn .
I kid you not :
Ugandan pastor Martin Ssempa , who recently made news for planning on February 17th what he called a " million man march " in Uganda in support of the odious " kill the gays " bill , is getting concerned by the international pressure and outrage over the proposed Ugandan bill that would further criminalize homosexuality in the country , including adding life in prison and death sentences to the punishments .
Ssempa has long been the leading voice for anti-gay hate in Uganda .
Back in January 2009 , after Saddleback Pastor Rick Warren was chosen to deliver the inaugural prayer at Obama 's swearing - in , Mike Blumenthal wrote a scathing article about Warren 's anti-gay , anti-HIV work in Uganda .
A main player in the story ?
Pastor Martin Ssempa , whose website identifies him as " A Passionate Voice In The Global Fight Against HIV / AIDS . "
Blumenthal 's piece tells a different tale :
However , an investigation into Warren 's involvement in Africa reveals a web of alliances with right - wing clergymen who have sidelined science - based approaches to combating AIDS in favor of abstinence - only education ... Warren 's man in Uganda is a charismatic pastor named Martin Ssempa .
The head of the Makerere Community Church , a rapidly growing congregation , Ssempe enjoys close ties to his country 's First Lady , Janet Museveni , and is a favorite of the Bush White House .
In the capitol of Kampala , Ssempa is known for his boisterous crusading .
Ssempa 's stunts have included burning condoms in the name of Jesus and arranging the publication of names of homosexuals in cooperative local newspapers while lobbying for criminal penalties to imprison them .
With safe sex advocates on the run , Warren and Ssempa trained their sights on another social evil .
In August 2007 , Ssempa led hundreds of his followers through the streets of Kampala to demand that the government mete out harsh punishments against gays .
' Arrest all homos , ' read placards .
And : ' A man cannot marry a man . '
Ssempa continued his crusade online , publishing the names of Ugandan gay rights activists on a website he created , along with photos and home addresses .
' Homosexual promoters , ' he called them , suggesting they intended to seduce Uganda 's children into their lifestyle .
Soon afterwards , two of President Yoweri Museveni's top officials demanded the arrest of the gay activists named by Ssempa .
Terrified , the activists immediately into hiding .
So what did Rick Warren 's man show at his porn screening for hate ?
Ariel Rubin has the details over at HuffPo in a piece with the brilliant title " Scat Porn and Prayer ?
Welcome To Sssempa World " :
Said Ssemps : " I will not call them gays any more , these are sodomites .
And I ask you please , in the media , stop misusing the word gay , which means happy people .
These are not happy people . "
A pornographic slideshow of black and white photographs of men engaging in scatological fetishism is revealed .
" I want to show you from their website " , he proclaims , a devious smile forming .
" I 've taken the time to research what homosexuals do in the privacy of their bedroom .
It is inhuman , it is animalistic , and it can not be right .
I want to show you these pictures . "
The audience lurches forward , leering at the pictures and groaning in disgust .
This coming from a man of god , a community and church leader , and yet also the co-author of a bill which makes touching another person " with the intention to commit homosexuality " an offense punishable by life in prison .
Head over to read the full , sickening report .
Also , my friend Andy Towle of Towleroad just posted a video ( via Box Turtle Bulletin ) of Ssempa on the show " Hot Seat " bleating about the evils of homosexuality by graphically describing scatological fetishes and fisting .
Ssempa has obviously long been obsessed with this - he must be a big fan of " Two Girls , One Cup " :
Ssempa is a man with deep ties to American Evangelicalism .
He is not only pals with Rick Warren , but also has connections with the secretive political religious group " The Family " , whose C Street House has been the focus of controversy after Mark Sanford and John Ensign 's extra-marital affairs and who host the National Prayer Breakfast every year - which President Obama will be attending , as have Presidents before him .
This is fundamentalism exported from our shores .
Ssempa is using a playbook created by the anti-gay forces here in the US : show gay men as depraved , evil , sick perverts who deserve to be imprisoned or put to death .
I wonder exactly who the audience that walked out on Pastor " Show Some Scat " Ssempa left thinking was the depraved one .
Like " Porno Pete " LaBarbera and Westboro Baptist Church before him , I hope Ssempa 's message shows people the sheer hatred behind these anti-gay laws and this type of " activism . "
Most of us probably do n’t believe we need a formal definition of happiness ; we know it when we feel it , and we often use the term to …

Gold nanoparticles , a relatively new class of surprisingly active supported catalysts , may owe key aspects of their catalytic prowess to the titania ( TiO 2 ) support on which they are commonly dispersed , according to scientists in New Orleans ( J. Am. Chem .
Soc. , DOI : 10.1021/ja907865t ) .
The mechanistic details uncovered by the investigation may lead to strategies for designing improved industrial catalysts .
The unexpected discovery several years ago that gold — generally considered an inert metal — can function as an active catalyst when prepared in nanoparticulate form touched off a wave of research into the precious metal ’s catalytic capabilities .
For example , in 2006 , researchers in Valencia , Spain , reported that nanoparticles of gold supported on titania selectively convert nitro groups to amino groups in multifunctional organic molecules .
Those researchers later found that the same catalyst can also be used in a two - step reaction for hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline followed by oxidation to azobenzene .
Various explanations have been proposed to account for the catalytic system ’s good performance , with much of the attention focused on gold .
Now , Tulane University physicists Shao - Chun Li and Ulrike Diebold report that titania alone facilitates the key steps in interconversion reactions between aniline and azobenzene and that the role of gold , at least in those reactions , may simply be to activate oxygen or hydrogen .
The team explains that depositing azobenzene on titania at sufficiently high concentration causes the molecules to adopt a configuration that leads to cleavage of the N=N double bond .
That process forms surface - bound phenyl imide ( C 6 H 5 N ) intermediates , which can react with hydrogen to form aniline .
The same intermediate , or a very similar one , forms on titania when aniline is dehydrogenated and converted to azobenzene , the team says .
This collection of mechanistic details — the N=N bond scission , hydrogenation of the phenyl imide intermediate , and the catalyst ’s proclivity to facilitate the reverse reaction “ is a very significant first observation of the complex catalytic function exhibited by titania surfaces , ” according to D. Wayne Goodman , a catalysis specialist and professor of chemistry at Texas A&M University .
Goodman adds that these properties of titania are likely applicable to a broad range of catalytic reactions .
As such , he says , future studies should focus on the active role of titania itself in the overall catalytic chemistry mediated by titania and titania - supported metals such as gold in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions .

Three Tamil Tiger rebel leaders who tried to surrender during the bloody climax of Sri Lanka 's civil war in May were shot and killed on the orders of the country 's defence minister and a senior adviser to President Mahinda Rajapaksa , the army commander at the time has claimed .
General Sarath Fonseka , who helped direct the final offensive against the Tigers but later broke with the government and is running for president in next month 's elections , said he had been personally unaware of the Tamils ' attempts to give themselves up , which included frantic last - minute appeals for help to a Norwegian minister , diplomats , journalists and UN and Red Cross officials .
" Later I learned that Basil [ Rajapaska , a senior presidential adviser ] had conveyed this information to the defence secretary , Gothabaya Rajapaksa , who in turn spoke with Brigadier Shavendra Silva , commander of the army 's 58th division , giving orders not to accommodate any [ Tiger ] leaders attempting surrender and that they must all be killed , " Fonseka told the pro-opposition Sunday Leader newspaper in Colombo .
Fonseka said Balasingham Nadesan , head of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 's political wing , Seevaratnam Puleedevan , head of the group 's peace secretariat , and a Tiger leader known as Ramesh had been assured through intermediaries by Basil Rajapaksa and Gothabaya Rajapaksa , brothers of the president , that they would be given safe conduct .
According to subsequent accounts , the men were advised : " Get a piece of white cloth , put up your hands and walk towards the other side in a non-threatening manner . "
" It [ the surrender method ] was their idea , " Fonseka told the newspaper , referring to Basil and Gothabaya Rajapaksa .
When the three men approached government lines some time after midnight on 17 May they walked into a trap , Fonseka suggested .
Troops opened fire with machine guns , killing all three and a number of family members .
A Tamil eyewitness account said Nadesan 's wife , a Sinhalese , called in Sinhali to the soldiers : " He is trying to surrender and you are shooting him . "
She also died in the hail of bullets .
Faced by government denials and threats of legal action today , Fonseka appeared to backtrack , claiming the newspaper reported his remarks out of context .
" They ( army soldiers ) never committed any criminal act .
There was no attempt at surrender on May 17 , 18 and 19 , " he said .
He would take full responsibility for any human rights violations during the final stages of the war .
Despite disavowing his earlier remarks , Fonseka 's claims about the circumstances surrounding the three men's deaths resemble contemporaneous reports in regional and western media , including the Guardian , that were denied by the Sri Lankan government .
Fonseka 's whereabouts during the incident was also a matter of confusion .
He told a press conference in Colombo on Sunday that he was in China .
It was unclear how this statement could be reconciled with his appearance on Sri Lankan state television on 18 May to proclaim victory over the Tigers and confirm that their leader , Velupillai Prabhakaran , had been killed .
" We can announce very responsibly that we have liberated the whole country from terrorism , " Fonseka told Rupavahini television .
Fonseka 's role in the war made him a hero for many Sinhalese , a factor that may have hastened his rupture with President Rajapaksa .
He was removed as army commander two weeks after the war concluded .
His claims about what happened last May , and subsequent backtracking , will be viewed in the context of his presidential campaign .
Sri Lanka denies responsibility for the three men's deaths .
Officials have suggested the Tamil leaders were killed by their own side , after they decided to surrender .
Responding to Fonseka , Mahinda Samarasinghe , the human rights minister , said : " The government totally denies this allegation … We reject this malicious allegation against our heroic soldiers . "
Offering yet another version of events , he said the rebels were carrying white flags in an attempt to fool the army and were not trying to surrender .
Basil Rajapaksa told the Sunday Leader he had not been contacted by a Norwegian intermediary over the surrender offer .
Gothabaya Rajapaksa and Brigadier Silva have not commented in public on Fonseka 's claims .
Sri Lanka 's conduct of the final phases of the war , in which up to 20,000 people may have died , its subsequent internment of an estimated 270,000 Tamil civilians , and violence against government critics , including last January 's assassination of the Sunday Leader 's former editor , Lasantha Wickrematunge , have provoked widespread condemnation by human rights groups , NGOs and some western governments .
But calls by Amnesty International and others for an independent investigation by the UN or another independent body have so far been blocked .
Fonseka 's allegations echo a report published in June by a Sri Lankan human rights group , University Teachers for Human Rights ( Jaffna ) , that cited army sources in stating that a " politically ordered massacre of people who wanted to surrender or surrendered " had taken place .
The group also reported widespread killings by rebels of Tamil civilians who were fleeing the war zone .
The report said : " The army had for the most part conducted itself in a disciplined manner in trying to protect civilians .
But once the command gives a signal for barbarity to be let loose , the men touch the most depraved depths of humanity . "
Tamer of the Tigers
Widely seen as the architect of Sri Lanka 's military success against the Tamil Tigers , General Sarath Fonseka is credited with eliminating the separatist group 's leadership and ending a war that began in 1983 and killed more than 70,000 people .
Born in 1950 , the general started his career in the Sri Lankan army in 1970 .
His training took him all over South Asia as well as to the US and the UK .
He rose through the ranks and became known as a tough commander not afraid to join in with action against the Tigers .
He was wounded in 1993 and almost killed by a suicide bomber in 2006 .
His role in Operation Riviresa in 1995 – when the army captured the town of Jaffna from the rebels – was one of the high points of his career .
One of his biggest setbacks occurred in 2000 when the Tigers managed to gain control of the strategically important Elephant Pass , one of the few routes leading to the Jaffna peninsula .
His troops recaptured it in January this year .
Last July Fonseka was appointed as Sri Lanka 's first chief of defence staff .
He resigned last month , feeling that he had not receive the recognition he deserved for the war victory .
Fonseka is to run as the People 's Liberation Front presidential candidate in the general election , scheduled for 26 January .
He has pledged to abolish the powerful executive presidency and return power to parliament in six months , and to take measures to curb corruption and restore democracy .
Fifteen opposition parties – all with little hope of defeating the incumbent , Mahinda Rajapaksa , on their own – have previously said they would support Fonseka in the election .
The general 's relationship with the government has become increasingly bitter in recent weeks .
The victims have not been named in order to protect CIA operations
The suicide bomber who killed seven CIA agents in Afghanistan was an al - Qaeda double agent , US media reports say .
He is said to have been a doctor from Jordan , arrested there a year ago .
He was then reportedly recruited by the Jordanians and CIA , who wrongly thought they had turned him , and given a mission to find al - Qaeda leaders .
The reports came as the top US military intelligence officer in Afghanistan issued a scathing assessment of the state of the intelligence effort there .
In a report , Maj Gen Michael Flynn said that US intelligence in Afghanistan was still " unable to answer fundamental questions about the environment in which US and allied forces operate and the people they are trying to protect and persuade " .

The study , published by the think tank Center for a New American Security , cites one officer 's remarks that the US was " clueless " due to its lack of useful intelligence about the country .
However the report 's findings were rejected by Mike Hurley , a former member of the US 9/11 commission and a former CIA chief in Afghanistan .
He told the BBC : " Nowhere in the report does the group ... suggest that there is not a significant role for intelligence to play in finding and fixing and finishing off enemy leaders in Afghanistan .
That 's precisely their job , that 's what they 're trying to do . "
Changing sides
The attack at Forward Operating Base Chapman was the worst against US intelligence officials since the US embassy in Beirut was bombed in 1983 .
The Washington Post quoted two former US government officials as saying that the alleged attacker had lured the CIA officers into a meeting with a promise of new information on al - Qaeda 's top leadership .
The reports named him as Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al - Balawi , a 36 - year - old al - Qaeda sympathiser from Zarqa , Jordan , arrested by Jordanian intelligence over a year ago .

The CIA has declined to comment on the reports .
Jordanian intelligence believed they had brought Humam al - Balawi over to their side and sent him to Afghanistan to infiltrate al - Qaeda , US network NBC says .
According to Western intelligence officials quoted in the reports , Humam al - Balawi called his handlers last week to arrange a meeting at Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost , where he said he would relay urgent information about Zawahiri .
Once inside the base , the reports say , he blew himself up killing seven CIA employees and his handler , whom Jordanian media have named as Ali bin Zeid .
Questions were raised after the bomb was detonated in the base 's gym last week about how the attacker could have managed to pass through security .
The Washington Post says he was picked up in a car outside the base and driven in without being thoroughly searched .
A US official , also a former CIA employee , told the Associated Press news agency that such people were often not required to go through full security checks , in order to help gain their trust .
" When you 're trying to build a rapport and literally ask them to risk [ their lives ] for you , you 've got a lot to do to build their trust , " he said .
Drone base A Taliban spokesman quoted on al - Jazeera 's website said Humam al - Balawi was a double agent who had misled Jordanian and US intelligence services for a year .

More from BBC World Service Forward Operating Base Chapman , a former Soviet military base , is used not only by the CIA but also by provincial reconstruction teams , which include both soldiers and civilians .
The airfield is reportedly used for US drone attacks on suspected militants in neighbouring Pakistan .
The CIA has not released the names of the officials killed nor details of their work because of the sensitivity of US operations .
But the head of the base , reported to be a mother - of - three , was among those killed .
The BBC's Mark Mardell in Washington says the CIA will be deeply embarrassed that the bomber was able to work so closely with the agency and with such high level officials .
Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger , a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee , told the BBC it was important to find out why the CIA had not discovered the bomber was an al - Qaeda agent .
He said there was " clearly a breakdown " in security , but added : " I think more and more though when you 're dealing with Afghanistan and even Iraq you have double agents and people working both sides . "

Shortly after the second World Trade Center tower was hit , at 9:03 a.m. on September 11 , 2001 , an officer at Andrews Air Force Base , just outside Washington , DC , was notified that the Secret Service wanted fighter jets launched over the nation ’s capital .
It was now obvious the U.S. was under terrorist attack , and Washington would have been an obvious potential target .
And yet the Secret Service ’s request came to nothing .
No fighters had taken off from Andrews by 9:37 a.m. , when the Pentagon was hit .
Nor had any launched by the time Flight 93 apparently crashed in Pennsylvania , shortly after 10:00 a.m. , while flying toward Washington .
In fact , fighters did not launch from Andrews until over 90 minutes after the second attack in New York .
The first fully armed fighters did not launch from there until more than two hours after that attack .
So why was the Secret Service ’s early request for help not acted upon ?
Why did fighter jets only take off from this massive Air Force base to defend the capital well after the morning ’s attacks had ended ?
SECRET SERVICE CALLS FAA HEADQUARTERS
The Secret Service agent who made the early request that fighter jets be launched appears to have been Nelson Garabito .
Garabito was responsible for coordinating the president ’s movements , and was also the Secret Service ’s liaison to the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) .
He was in the Secret Service Joint Operations Center ( JOC ) at the White House that morning .
Just after Flight 175 crashed into the South Tower at 9:03 a.m. , Garabito called Terry Van Steenbergen , his counterpart at the FAA , who was at the FAA headquarters in Washington .
According to the 9/11 Commission , shortly into the call , Van Steenburgen told Garabito “ that there were more planes unaccounted for–possibly hijacked –in addition to the two that had already crashed . ”
Possibly in response to this information , Garabito appears to have asked Van Steenbergen to arrange for fighters to be launched over Washington .
Van Steenbergen asked three of his colleagues at the FAA to call various air bases to see if they could get fighters into the air .
One of these colleagues , Karen Pontius , had previously worked at Andrews Air Force Base , so she made the call to the FAA air traffic control tower there . [ 1 ]
Garabito would have been unable to call the tower himself , because , according to a 9/11 Commission memorandum , the Secret Service “ did not have a phone line to the Andrews tower . ”
FAA HEADQUARTERS REQUESTS FIGHTERS
Pontius spoke to Steve Marra , an air traffic controller in the Andrews tower .
Marra has recalled that Pontius “ told him to launch F - 16s to cap the airspace over Washington . ”
He relayed this information to the District of Columbia Air National Guard ( DCANG ) , which is based at Andrews , across the airfield from the control tower . [ 2 ]
Marra appears to have done so when DCANG officer Major Daniel Caine phoned the tower and asked if any air traffic control measures were being implemented in response to the attacks . [ 3 ]
Caine later recalled that the tower controller–i.e .
Marra–told him “ that they just received the scramble order . ”
However , oddly , Caine told the 9/11 Commission that the Andrews tower “ would not have been in the loop for any Secret Service orders to scramble aircraft . ” [ 4 ]
If the DC Air National Guard was notified of this early “ scramble order , ” why was that order not acted upon ?
Pilots and others working for the DCANG at Andrews were already well aware of the crisis taking place .
Upon learning of the second crash , someone at the unit reportedly yelled , “ We ’re under a terrorist attack ! ” [ 5 ]
And , seeing the television coverage of the burning WTC towers , an officer exclaimed , “ Well , holy shit , if this is a terrorist attack , we need to get something in the air ! ”
Furthermore , a request from the Secret Service should have carried considerable weight .
According to author Lynn Spencer , “ Given that the Secret Service provides protection to the president–and that the president , and the vice president when the president is not available , is the ultimate commander in chief of the military –the Secret Service also has certain authority over the military and , in this case , the DC Guard . ” [ 6 ]
CAINE CALLS HIS SECRET SERVICE CONTACT
After his call to the control tower , Daniel Caine called his contact at the Secret Service , Kenneth Beauchamp , who was at the White House JOC .
Caine later told the 9/11 Commission that , on reflection , he believed it was his hearing that the tower had received the “ scramble order ” that prompted him to call Beauchamp . [ 7 ]
And yet Beauchamp supposedly contradicted the Secret Service ’s request for fighters .
Even though it was obvious that the U.S. was under attack , and it should have been clear that Washington was a likely target for any further attacks , he said the Secret Service did not require assistance from the DCANG .
Caine had asked : “ Do you have any additional information ?
Are you guys going to need some help ? ” and Beauchamp replied , “ No , but I ’ll call you back if that changes . ” [ 8 ]
Caine has said that during this call , which he described as “ a very quick , confusing conversation , ” Beauchamp told him that “ things were happening and he ’d call me back . ” [ 9 ]
However , Beauchamp did not call Caine back . [ 10 ]
( Another Secret Service agent , though , did subsequently call Caine , and asked about getting fighters launched . [ 11 ] )
According to Lieutenant Colonel Marc Sasseville , the acting operations group commander under the 113th Wing of the DCANG , at the time Caine spoke to Beauchamp , “ we were n’t thinking about defending anything .
Our primary concern was what would happen to the air traffic system . ” [ 12 ]
But when Brigadier General David Wherley , the commander of the DC Air National Guard , subsequently called the Secret Service JOC shortly after the Pentagon was hit and spoke to Beauchamp , Beauchamp implored him to launch jets to protect Washington .
Beauchamp said : “ We want you to put a CAP [ combat air patrol ] up over the city .
We need some fighters now . ” [ 13 ]
DCANG PILOT ‘STANDING BACK , WAITING ’
Between the second WTC attack at 9:03 a.m. and the Pentagon attack at 9:37 a.m. , the DCANG fighter pilots on duty at Andrews appear to have been waiting around and doing very little , when they should have been hurrying to get airborne .
One of those pilots , Captain Brandon Rasmussen , was promptly informed of the second crash in New York after it occurred , and immediately realized its implications .
He recalled : “ I think everybody knew that this was a coordinated attack that was happening .
We had no idea who it was by , but it was definitely intentional when you get two airplanes hitting both towers . ”
And yet , he said : “ At that point , we did n’t know what we could possibly do ; that ’s New York City way up the road .
So … like everybody else in America , we ’re just standing by and watching the news . ”
This is extraordinary !
An Air Force base just 10 miles from Washington had learned that the nation was under attack .
And yet the immediate response of its pilots was to stand around watching television !
Rasmussen said it was only after the news broke about the Pentagon being hit that “ we knew that we were going to be sticking around home and being quite busy , ” and “ the squadron leadership went into action . ” [ 14 ]
DCANG commander David Wherley only headed across the base from his office to the fighter squadron building , to assist his unit ’s response to the attacks , after a woman at his office saw on television that the Pentagon had been hit and started shrieking . [ 15 ]
[ efoods ]
But even after the Pentagon attack , the DCANG pilots were not immediately told to prepare for takeoff .
Rasmussen recalled that at that point , “ I ’m just kind of standing back , waiting for somebody to task me with something . ”
He added , “ I was just waiting at the ops desk for someone to say , ‘ Okay , we ’ve been cleared to take off and go . ' ” [ 16 ]
FIRST JET LAUNCHES AT 10:38
The first DCANG jet to take off from Andrews Air Force Base was an F - 16 that had just returned from a training mission over North Carolina .
It had little fuel remaining , carried no missiles , and had only practice ammunition .
It took off at 10:38 a.m. , an hour after the attack on the Pentagon . [ 17 ]
Two more F - 16s took off at 10:42 a.m. , but these were also armed with only practice ammunition and had no missiles . [ 18 ]
At 11:11 a.m. , Rasmussen and Daniel Caine took off in their F - 16s , the first fighters to launch from Andrews armed with missiles as well as bullets . [ 19 ]
By that time , the attacks were long over .
Rasmussen has expressed his and the other DCANG pilots ’ frustration at having to wait around before being allowed to get airborne .
He said that when his unit finally received authorization for its jets to take off , “ We were relieved to actually be given permission to go up and do something , instead of feeling totally helpless .
I mean , we are fighter pilots , just like guard dogs chomping at the bit , ready to go . ” [ 20 ]
DCANG PROVIDES ‘CAPABLE AND READY RESPONSE FORCES ’
Although the DC Air National Guard was not part of the North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) air defense force , its mission at the time of the 9/11 attacks included providing “ capable and ready response forces for the District of Columbia in the event of a natural disaster or civil emergency . ”
Lieutenant Colonel Phil Thompson , the chief of safety for the DCANG , said , “ We practice scrambles , we know how to do intercepts and other things . ” [ 21 ]
The unit was in fact known as the “ Capital Guardians , ” implying that it was responsible for protecting Washington , DC . [ 22 ]
The fact that , in spite of an early request for help from the Secret Service , it took the DC Air National Guard so long to put together a response to the attacks should be of concern to all Americans .
The unit ’s disastrously slow emergency response needs to be thoroughly probed as part of a rigorous new investigation of the 9/11 attacks .

He ain't no Johnny Depp but Jacob Tannahill - Swift will dress up like a pirate and give you one of the best hugs you 've ever had if you are willing to pay the price .
The 20 - year - old from Hamilton has listed an auction on the Trade Me website to sell a hug to the top bidder because he says he has n't given one this year .
Bidding was just shy of $ 50 last night .
Mr Tannahill - Swift said all money raised from the auction would be given to the Starship Children 's Hospital and Foundation in Auckland .
" Children are the next generation and without them we do n't have a chance , " he said .
" It is pretty much just helping out the next generation . "
The auction has captured the imagination of several Trade Me users .
One asked : " How authentic is the hug ?
Does it have any sort of guarantee ?
Do you happen to have a Ninja hug as well ?
I 'm trying to collect the set .
Thanks in advance ! "
Mr Tannahill - Swift answered : " Well , normally it 's the No1 rule to kill a Ninja on sight for a pirate , but a ninja is never seen .
Depending on where I have to travel , I could maybe chuck a ninja hug in for free .
No promises though . "
Another asked : " Will you be making pirate noises ( ie : ooooh arrrr ) during the hug ? "
" Possibly before and after , " was the reply .
The auction closes on Monday at 9.40 pm and already bids have passed Mr Tannahill - Swift 's expectation .
" To be honest I was expecting about $ 5 - $ 10 , " he said .
A motorised drinking couch , which was also auctioned on the Trade Me site , raised $ 495 for inventor Ryan Ogle , who added wheels and the rear end of a 50 cc scooter to his old green armchair .
He knocked up a steering system from scrap metal .

It ’s video Saturday so I ’ve been on You Tube looking for some good videos to post today .
I came across this one from Chat New ’s Sports Report .
It took place during baseball season and the reporter was talking about an amazing play made by the Atlanta Braves .
It was a line drive to the face and well you can take a guess what she said .
Joint post of Henri Bergius and Michael Marth cross-posted here and here .
Web Content Repositories are more than just plain old relational databases .
In fact , the requirements that arise when managing web content have led to a class of content repository implementations that are comparable on a conceptual level .
During the IKS community workshop in Rome we got together to compare JCR ( the Jackrabbit implementation ) and Midgard 's content repository .
While in some cases the terminology might be different , many of the underlying ideas are identical .
So we came up with a list of common traits and features of our content repositories .
For comparison , there is also Apache CouchDB .
So , why use a Content Repository for your application instead of the old familiar RDBMS ?
Repositories provide several advantages :
Common rules for data access mean that multiple applications can work with same content without breaking consistency of the data
Signals about changes let applications know when another application using the repository modifies something , enabling collaborative data management between apps
Objects instead of SQL mean that developers can deal with data using APIs more compatible with the rest of their desktop programming environment , and without having to fear issues like SQL injection
Data model is scriptable when you use a content repository , meaning that users can easily write Python or PHP scripts to perform batch operations on their data without having to learn your storage format
Synchronization and sharing features can be implemented on the content repository level meaning that you gain these features without having to worry about them
The Islamist group Islam4UK , which planned a march through Wootton Bassett , and its " parent " organisation , al - Muhajiroun , will be banned under new legislation outlawing the " glorification " of terrorism , Alan Johnson announced today .
The order , which will come into effect on Thursday , will make it a criminal offence to be a member of either of the groups , punishable by up to 10 years in prison .
" I have today laid an order which will proscribe al - Muhajiroun , Islam4UK , and a number of the other names the organisation goes by , " Johnson said .
Other names are Call to Submission , Islamic Path and London School of Sharia .
The group is already proscribed under two other names – al - Ghurabaa and the Saved Sect or the Saviour Sect .
Johnson said that proscription was " a tough but necessary power to tackle terrorism " , adding that it was " not a course we take lightly " .
The decision , based on months of monitoring the output of websites and comments by senior figures , will have to be endorsed by parliament .
Al - Muhajiroun was founded by Omar Bakri Muhammad and Anjem Choudary , and has been operating in Britain since the mid-1980s .
The group became notorious for praising the September 11 attacks in 2001 .
Bakri was banned from Britain by the former home secretary Charles Clarke in August 2005 , on the grounds that his presence in the country was " not conducive to the public good " .
At the same time , the Home Office announced its intention to ban the group but it disappeared from view before relaunching itself in June last year .
The Saviour sect and al - Ghurabaa were proscribed under the 2000 Terrorism Act .
Islam4UK has called off its planned march through Wootton Bassett , the Wiltshire market town that has come to symbolise the fatalities sustained by British forces in Afghanistan .
It said it had " successfully highlighted the plight of Muslims in Afghanistan globally " .
The group said that if their organisation and al - Muhajiroun were banned , " another platform with a new name will arise to continue to fulfil these divine objections until the sharia has been implemented " .
Counterterrorism legislation passed in 2006 is designed to automatically ban any " successor " organisations set up by proscribed groups .
Home Office lawyers are drawing up the necessary parliamentary order implementing the ban so it can be debated by MPs within days .
The move came as MPs heard evidence of tensions within government over the direction of the official programme aimed at preventing violent extremism .
Written evidence from the Local Government Association ( LGA ) for a special Commons select committee held in a Birmingham mosque yesterday , confirmed that tension between the Home Office 's office of security and counterterrorism and the Department of Communities and Local Government had been a problem at times .
The LGA said the heart of the disagreements had been the focus of the Prevent programme , with the communities secretary , John Denham , arguing that it should be part of the broader work on community cohesion and equalities .
" Police and the security services will necessarily see things in a different perspective , " an LGA memo said .
Its evidence said that the security services have moved away from developing a profile of a " typical extremist " , to a more rounded analysis of potential risks and interventions .
Evidence from the Association of Chief Police Officers to the MPs ' inquiry said that so far 228 young adults aged under 25 " who have been inspired by the al - Qaida ideology " have been referred to the Channel Project , which provides support to those believed to be vulnerable to radicalisation .
A team of astronomers led by Lynn D. Matthews at the MIT Haystack Observatory has discovered a disk of gas swirling close to a young massive star , which they say offers the first evidence that massive stars form similarly to smaller stars .
Because massive stars are believed to be responsible for creating most of the chemical elements in the universe that are critical for the formation of Earth - like planets and life , understanding how they form may help unravel mysteries about the origins of life .
Until now , it had been difficult to prove how massive stars form because they are rare , form very quickly and tend to be enshrouded in dense , dusty material , making it hard to observe them .
By using the National Science Foundation ’s Very Long Baseline Array ( VLBA ) radio telescope to take images of the wavelengths of light emitted by a massive young star located 1,350 light years away in the Orion constellation , Matthews ’ team has produced a high - resolution time - lapse movie that reveals a disk rotating around the star , known as Source I ( when spoken , “ Source Eye ” ) .
“ It is the first really ironclad confirmation that massive young stars are surrounded by orbiting accretion disks , and the first strong suggestion that these disks launch magnetically driven winds , ” said University of California at Santa Cruz astronomy and astrophysics professor Mark Krumholz of the time - lapse movie , which is described in a paper published in the Jan. 1 issue of the Astrophysical Journal .
For almost 20 years , astronomers have known that low - mass stars form as a result of disk - mediated accretion , or from material formed from a structure rotating around a central body and driven by magnetic winds .
But it had been impossible to confirm whether this was true for massive stars , which are eight to 100 times larger than low - mass stars .
Without any hard data , theorists proposed many models for how massive stars might form , such as via collisions of smaller stars .
“ This work should rule out many of them , ” Krumholz said of Matthews ’ movie .
Movie created from real data collected by Matthews ’ team showing the motions of gas clumps around Source I over the course of 22 months .
The gas emission is color - coded according to the velocity of the material .
Video : Matthews et al .
Piercing the Dusty Cloud
A network of 10 radio telescope dishes located across North America , the VLBA can be thought of as a virtual telescope 5,000 miles in diameter , according to Matthews .
Used as a zoom lens to penetrate the dusty cloud surrounding the massive star , the VLBA captured images up to 1,000 times sharper than those previously obtained by other telescopes , including NASA ’s Hubble Space Telescope .
By assembling 19 individual images of Source I taken by the VLBA at monthly intervals between March 2001 and December 2002 , the high - resolution movie reveals thousands of masers , radio emitting gas clouds that can be thought of as naturally occurring lasers , located close to the massive star .
According to Matthews , only three massive stars in the entire galaxy are known to have silicon monoxide masers .
Because the silicon monoxide masers emit beams of intense radiation that can pierce the dusty material surrounding Source I , the scientists could probe the material close to the star and measure the motions of individual gas clumps .
By tracking the gas motions through space , the astronomers discovered the rotating accretion disk comprised of gas clumps orbiting the central star , as well as clumps moving away from it that appear to be caught in an outflowing wind .
Such gas outflows help form stars by carrying momentum away from the system .
One interesting implication of the masers near Source I is that some gas particles appear to move away from the massive star along curved trajectories that wrap in a helix shape resembling Twizzlers candy .
“ To induce that kind of curvature , our observations seem to suggest , there is some role of magnetic fields during this process , ” Matthews said .
To better understand this possible magnetic field , researchers plan to measure the polarization of the light from gas around the star , which will help them quantify its strength and geometry .
The group would also like to extend the time span of the movie to several years to see the evolution of the material around the star over longer time scales .
“ Full - motion movies are actually quite rare in astronomy , ” Krumholz said .
“ With a few exceptions , most processes take place much too slowly for noticeable changes to occur over a human lifetime . ”
Matthews ’ team includes scientists from the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics , the National Radio Astronomy Observatory and the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , Department of Physics .
Shock and Awe
Gabe Newell is about to make a promise .
It 's 11 am on an overcast morning in Bellevue , Washington , and Newell , the impresario behind Valve , lumbers into the company 's starkly decorated 10th - floor conference room .
He pulls out an Aeron chair , plops himself down , and runs his stubby hands through his reddish - brown hair .
" OK , " he says , taking a deep breath .
" During any project there comes a time to draw a line in the sand and put a stick in the ground and say , ' This is it .
We 're ready , ' " he says .
" That moment , I 'm happy to say , is right now .
We finally know when this game is going to be done . "
The game he 's referring to is Half - Life 2 , the sequel to Half - Life , one of the best - selling PC first - person shooters of all time .
For years gamers have impatiently waited for definitive news on the sequel .
Now Gabe is ready to announce a release date .
As Newell talks about the game 's imminent completion he speaks with such conviction that you half expect him to give you the exact minute and second the game will be released .
He sounds that sure of himself .
Before he divulges the date , however , he pauses .
He pulls off his smudged glasses and gently runs an index finger over his right eyelid .
" Sorry , I was up really late last night , " he explains .
Understandable , you think to yourself - - it 's never easy pulling all - nighters to finish a game .
Unfortunately , Newell 's fatigue is the result of something else entirely .
" I was up until 3:30 am last night watching the first night of bombing in Iraq on CNN , " he explains .
Gabe Newell , Valve 's founder and managing director
Uh-oh .
Today is March 21 , 2003 -- the start of the second war in Iraq , which is a fitting parallel to the battle Newell is about to start with the announcement of Half - Life 2 and its release date .
Like the second American offensive in Iraq , Newell 's battle will begin today with a shock - and - awe campaign of spectacular visual firepower -- the first demo of the game .
Unfortunately , the parallels do n't stop there .
From the perspective of many fans , Newell 's battle to release Half - Life 2 will also end up being a campaign filled with misinformation .
And at times there will seem to be no exit strategy for Newell , no clear sense of when victory -- the release of the game - - will be achieved .
But none of that is evident to Gabe today .
No , today is a day of great resolve -- a carefully calculated announcement of Half - Life 2 and a public declaration that the game is about to enter the final stretch of development .
" We did n't want to do the whole ' when it 's done ' thing , " Newell explains in his preamble .
" The reason we are announcing the game today is because we now know when it will be done . "
OK , so when will it be done ?
" We 're going to launch the product at E3 and we 're going to ship it on September 30 , 2003 , " Newell empathically states .
Knowing what you know now , you want to coach Newell to not be so sure of himself .
He could say " September " and no one would complain .
Even " fall " or " when it 's done " would probably fly .
But no , that 's far too imprecise for Gabe .
Today he wants to make a promise to the fans , to open the eyes of expectation .
Half - Life 2 will be coming on September 30 , 2003 .
Not " hopefully " or " maybe " September 30 .
It will be coming September 30 .
" The reason we are announcing [ Half - Life 2 ] today is because we now know when it will be done . "
- Gabe Newell , March 2003
Of course , Half - Life 2 did n't arrive on September 30 .
In fact , it was n't anywhere close to being done on that date .
Today Newell admits the statements he made in March 2003 have haunted him every day for the past 18 months .
He was embarrassed .
He felt paralyzed .
He did n't know how or when to explain what really happened .
Now he 's ready to come clean .
Club Zero
It 's September 30 , 2004 , and Gabe Newell is looking to the heavens .
" OK , what now ? " he asks the gods above , wondering aloud how the forces of nature will next conspire against Valve .
You imagine the thoughts that must be running through his head .
Maybe a meteor will hit the building .
Lighting could strike him down .
A massive computer virus might infect the network .
Given the roller - coaster ride that Valve has been on for the past 18 months , all three of these things seem more likely than what Newell is about to say .
The scanner piñata hangs in the lobby of Valve Software 's office building .
" We were right about the date , just not the year , " he says with a smile .
Yeah , sure , Gabe .
You really expect us to believe that Half - Life 2 is nearly done ?
Newell just grins wider , turns around and slowly points at an object hanging from the ceiling .
Fashioned after the scanner robot in Half - Life 2 , a papier - mâché piñata hangs in the air , awaiting its fate .
" We just hung it up this morning , " Newell boasts .
Just as he eviscerated a headcrab piñata the day Half - Life was finished , Newell will whack the scanner piñata as soon as Half - Life 2 is sent off to duplication .
OK , you think to yourself , maybe Valve really is within hours of finishing the five - year , $ 40 million odyssey that is Half - Life 2's development .
Either that or Newell is sure good at building up the drama .
Further confirmation of Half - Life 2's imminent release comes at the " 4 o'clock " meeting where Newell assembles the team for a status update .
There have been more than 2,000 of these meetings since the game first began development .
This may be one of the last .
The Valve team prepares for the daily status update meeting .
Today 's meeting is all about reviewing the members of " Club Zero , " a list that appears on a whiteboard .
Programmers join the club as soon as all their bugs are fixed .
Many of them are already in the club , but a few have yet to join .
( You can also be dismissed from the club if someone finds a bug in your level ) .
" We cheer when people join Club Zero and boo when you get moved out of it , " explains John Guthrie , the lanky young designer who joined Valve eight years ago , when he was 23 .
Given the rate that employees are joining Club Zero , Newell thinks the game may be done today or tomorrow .
All the bugs are almost gone .
More than five years in a pressure - cooker environment might finally be coming to a close .
Valve 's David Sawyer checks the clock before heading to the 4 o'clock meeting .
But will the game ship to consumers anytime soon ?
That 's the question that 's been nagging Newell all day .
He says the game 's publisher , Vivendi Universal Games , is " sort of refusing to tell us anything " about the game 's release date .
There 's little wonder why : Valve and Vivendi have been embroiled in a bitter lawsuit for two years related to the sale and distribution of Valve 's games .
Newell does n't know if Vivendi will ship the game when it 's finished or hold it hostage for up to six months .
It 's clear there is no love lost between Valve and its publisher .
The lawsuit against VU Games caps off a development project that , at times , has seemed almost cursed with lawsuits , crimes , delays , and general uncertainty .
" It 's been hard enough to build the game technically , hard enough to build it artistically , and hard enough to do the gameplay , " Newell admits as he slowly walks the halls of Valve after the meeting .
" But to have some of these other challenges on top has been a bit too much . "
In this case , the crushing pressure to build a worthy follow - up to Half - Life - - which won more than 50 game - of - the - year awards - - was just the first of Valve 's worries .
Valve 's Jess Cliffe envisions what it will be like to whack the scanner piñata .
Then again , maybe all the drama was to be expected .
Half - Life 2 is n't just a game .
No , saying that would be like saying the Atlantic Ocean is just a body of water .
Newell sees Half - Life 2 as an engine , a platform , or at best a whole industry unto itself .
Going forward there will be engine licenses , hundreds of user modifications ( mods ) , episodic content , sequels , add - ons , and expansions .
And Steam , Valve 's digital distribution network , may forever change the way consumers buy games .
Newell once told The Puget Sound Journal that he hopes Half - Life 2 will sell more than 15 million copies in three years .
That would translate into more than $ 700 million in revenue , making Half - Life 2 a bigger hit than Grand Theft Auto : Vice City and Halo combined .
Valve designers David Sawyer and programmer Josh Weir put the finishing touches on a level .
Half - Life 2 may end up being all those things -- a huge success , an agent of change , and a sign of where games are going next .
But behind the flashy graphics and the visceral first - person shooter gameplay is the story of what it took to bring this ambitious game to life .
For the 84 - person team at Valve , the five - year odyssey of creating Half - Life 2 was a strenuous -- and sometimes painful -- voyage that tested everyone 's loyalty to the project .
Now , for the first time , the team at Valve opens up about its journey in stunning detail .
No question was off limits :
From the missed release date to the code theft to the lawsuit with Vivendi , you 'll hear directly from Valve about what really happened .
And you 'll find out about other struggles that have never before been revealed to the public .
Ultimately , this is a story about sacrifice .
A story about how 84 passionate gamers gave up nearly everything over five years to create what Newell believes is the best first - person shooter ever created .
This is the story behind the making of Half - Life 2 .
What 's It Going to Take ?
" This time the stakes are different . "
The original Half - Life , released in 1998 .
It was with those six words that Gabe Newell launched the development of Half - Life 2 in June 1999 .
Yes , you read that right -- 1999 , only six months after the original Half - Life shipped .
For Valve there was never a question about whether there would be a sequel to Half - Life .
The question was how the company could top -- or even match -- what was being heralded as one of the best PC titles of all time .
It was , to be sure , a long way from where Valve started back in 1996 .
" Last time the fact that a bunch of ex-Microsoft operating - systems guys could get together and ship a game -- any game - - was a cool story , " Newell told the team in reference to Half - Life .
" This time we have to follow up the best PC game of all time and do it in a way that does n't completely burn out the entire staff . "
Valve certainly could have created a quick and dirty sequel to capitalize on Half - Life 's success .
Newell , however , made it clear that was n't an option .
No , Half - Life 2 had to be something much more ambitious .
It had to redefine the genre .
To innovate where other games had n't .
To be a game that gave fans a totally new first - person shooter experience .
" What 's the number one thing that drives us ? "
Newell says .
" Well , I just hate the idea that our games might waste people 's time .
Why spend four years of your life building something that is n't innovative and is basically pointless ? "
" Why spend four years of your life building something that is n’t innovative and is basically pointless ? "
Gabe Newell
Making a revolutionary sequel would n't be easy .
So , to increase the chances of success , Newell told the team that , at least initially , they had a virtually unlimited budget and absolutely no time pressure .
" There 's going to be no producer making bad decisions about what has to happen on this project , " Newell told the team .
All the money Valve made on the original Half - Life would be rolled into the sequel .
And since Newell was well - off from his days at Microsoft , he was willing to personally endow the development if necessary .
" The only pressure we have is to build a worthy sequel to Half - Life , " he told the team .
Alyx Vance , one of the in - game characters created for Half - Life 2 .
The experimentation and brainstorming began in the summer of 1999 .
Ideas were discussed for weeks and thrown up on the whiteboard .
What if the game included voice recognition so you could actually talk to characters ?
What if Half - Life 2 was a buddy story where you and Barney -- the AI security guard from the original -- worked as a team for the entire game ?
Eventually the team crystallized their thoughts around the key concept of making both the characters and the world in Half - Life 2 more believable and interactive .
The original Half - Life was heralded for many things , but players particularly appreciated the characters and storyline .
" It sounds really goofy , but what we wanted to do was broaden the emotional palette in games , " Newell says .
" We wanted to try and create characters that mattered and have the player feel a strong attachment to them . "
Physics - based gameplay , like using a radiator as a shield , was a design goal for the team .
Valve also wanted to bring the world to life .
Interactive environments have long been synonymous with first - person shooters , but in the past the interactivity has been limited to flushing a toilet or getting a can of Coke out of an in - game vending machine .
Valve wondered if it could create a world that was even more interactive .
" The inherent promise of games is that you are an agent in this world and you can affect things , " Newell says .
So an idea went up on the whiteboard :
What if Half - Life 2 used physics , AI , and game design to push the boundaries of interactivity ?
The team imagined scenarios like letting a player pick up a radiator in an apartment building to use as a shield against an enemy .
By the end of the summer it became clear that Valve would need a new game engine to pull off its ambitious goals .
( Valve licensed id Software 's Quake engine for the original Half - Life ) .
While Valve looked at licensing an engine for the sequel - - such as id's Quake III engine -- the team concluded that no outside technology was a good match for Valve 's ambitious plans .
" Id 's stuff is always cutting - edge , but this time we wanted to cut some different edges , " says Valve cofounder Mike Harrington .
Valve , it seemed , would have to build its own engine from scratch .
So while Half - Life 2 may have started production in mid-1999 , creating a new engine meant that the game would take at least three years to complete .
A Bittersweet Goodbye
By all accounts Half - Life 2 was going to be a hugely ambitious project .
Most of the team members from the original game were more than happy to reenlist for the sequel .
But one key member started having second thoughts .
He happened to be the cofounder of the company .
Valve cofounder Mike Harrington .
Mike Harrington was one of the Gabe 's old buddies from Microsoft .
They worked together for years and left Microsoft in 1996 to form Valve , a true 50 - 50 partnership between two best friends who balanced each other out .
Gabe was the ambitious dreamer , and Mike was the practical realist who " liked to ship product , " as he often told friends .
Newell became the public face of Valve , but Harrington was the company 's secret weapon -- he was responsible for much of the programming on the original Half - Life .
As plans for Half - Life 2 began to solidify , Harrington had to decide if he wanted to devote at least another three years to a new Half - Life game .
" Part of the problem for Mike was that we succeeded so much out of the gate with Half - Life , " Newell says .
" I think he said to himself , ' Do I really want to put my ego and self - worth at risk again ? ' "
Harrington decided the answer was no , in part because he had long planned to take an extended vacation with his wife , Monica , another former Microsoft executive who worked as Valve 's first director of marketing .
Mike and Monica had dreams of building a boat and exploring the world .
They had enough money from their days at Microsoft -- the question was whether Mike had the time .
Harrington spent weeks contemplating what to do .
Eventually he realized that making one Half - Life was enough .
" At Microsoft you always wonder , ' Is it me being successful or is it Microsoft ? '' he says .
" But with Half - Life I knew Gabe and I had built that product and company from scratch . "
So Harrington decided to leave on a high note .
On January 15 , 2000 , he checked in his last piece of code and then dissolved his partnership with Newell .
" It was really sad that first day after I left Valve , " he recalls .
" Something that was so intense , so powerful , and so engaging was completely gone from my life . "
Mike and Monica Harrington in front of their boat .
To the outside world it would seem like nothing had changed at Valve .
But to Newell , Harrington 's departure was much more significant .
It made him feel isolated and alone .
" It was really hard , " Newell admits .
" Mike was the one person who I could talk to more than anyone else about things that worried me . "
Still , Newell was n't about to retire and shut down Valve .
" I 'd go insane if you put me on a boat or if I tried to learn how to golf , " he says .
( Harrington , on the other hand , did just that : He and Monica built their own 77 - foot boat , the MV Meander , which they now sail around the world ) .
Harrington 's departure was tough on Newell , but he could n't dwell on it for long .
Valve needed to aggressively push forward with Half - Life 2 and begin experimenting with new technology .
Wild Experimentation
Valve 's Ken Birdwell worked on new in - game character technology .
" As she lifts her arms up her breasts rise and flatten , " says Valve 's Ken Birdwell .
He 's showing off one of the character models for Alyx Vance , the female lead in Half - Life 2 .
Birdwell , who once wrote software to create custom shoe insoles , was the man tasked with making more - believable characters for Half - Life 2 -- characters who could express emotions through their faces and have full musculatures , as evidenced by the breast demonstration .
Why did Valve place such an importance on creating more - believable in - game characters ?
Birdwell says the decision was a result of the player reaction to the primitive but engaging characters in the first Half - Life .
" We did n't spend a lot of time on them in the first game , " he says .
" But people anthropomorphized them a great deal .
People genuinely felt bad when Barney was killed in the original . "
For the sequel Newell wanted the team to take those characters to the next level by adding believable facial animation and body movement .
" I told Ken I wanted players to see the characters as real people and stop thinking of them as automatons or robots , " Newell says .
Birdwell 's technology allows characters to express a wide range of emotions .
That was an ambitious goal , considering that Hollywood animation houses had yet to crack the problem of creating realistic CG humans .
Nevertheless , Birdwell began researching how he might create lifelike in - game characters .
He spent some time working with Dr. Ken Perlin , a professor at NYU who is one of the leaders in the computer - graphics field .
Perlin's
Web site at NYU includes a demonstration of his computerized characters .
Birdwell also came across the work of Dr. Paul Ekman , a psychologist who had trained police officers how to detect liars by studying facial expressions .
Back in the ' 70s , Ekman wrote an influential book that laid out a set of rules about how facial muscles work together to create expressions like sadness , glee , anger , and puzzlement .
( Eckman 's rules were also used to help diagnose mental illness ) .
Birdwell thought that by setting those rules inside the computer he could create in - game characters who would never make unnatural expressions .
Ken Perlin's ' Face Demo formed the basis for Valve 's character technology .
Jay Stelly , meanwhile , focused on integrating physics into Valve 's new Source engine .
For years game companies had attempted to use physics to make more - believable worlds , often to disastrous results .
( Remember Trespasser ? )
Valve was determined to do physics the right way .
" We wanted integrated physics that mattered in gameplay , " Newell says .
As Stelly puts it , " We wanted to do physics so they would reinforce your presence in the world .
If we did it right , players would be able to impact their surroundings and take the game beyond the constraints of scripted action . "
The idea was to take a regular game level and turn it into a playground of sorts where players could manipulate objects and solve puzzles in multiple ways .
While the core technologists worked on the engine , the rest of the team began thinking about the gameplay and story .
Still , they kept an eager eye on the new technology .
" We wanted to be like Hitchcock and use our new technology in deliberate ways that could have a huge impact on gameplay , " says Marc Laidlaw , Valve 's resident writer .
" I always think of how Hitchcock used the zoom lens for the first time in Vertigo .
It was a very specific effect and afterward everyone did the zoom in and out just like him . "
The Hemoglobin
Valve writer Marc Laidlaw .
As research and development continued , the rest of the team fleshed out the plot and gameplay .
Although Newell was expecting the new game engine to dazzle audiences , he wanted to avoid building a sequel that was all about whiz - bang technology .
" Our games are n't about throwing you in a room with a gun and a bunch of enemies and saying , ' Go have a game experience , ' " he says .
" Look at the tram ride in Half - Life - - it had an almost operatic quality . "
" Our games are n't about throwing you in a room with a gun and a bunch of enemies and saying , ' Go have a game experience . ' "
Gabe Newell
Half - Life 's memorable storytelling can be traced to Laidlaw .
A former legal secretary and novelist , Laidlaw worked with the team to create the game 's overall narrative structure -- he cross- pollinated ideas among the technologists , artists , and designers .
So it 's hardly surprising he 's sometimes referred to as the " hemoglobin " of the team .
While it would be easy describe Laidlaw as the game 's writer , his role is deeper than that .
" I 'm a story guy but what I 'm doing is in service to the gameplay , " he says .
" I 'd be perfectly happy to work on a game that does n't have a line of dialogue or text in it . "
Gordon Freeman , the star of Half - Life 2 .
Laidlaw says the Half - Life 2 team never wanted to stray far from the plot and storytelling devices that worked in Half - Life .
" We still wanted to do a game about the journey of Gordon Freeman , " he says , referring to the MIT - educated scientist who starred in the original game .
" It 's a story about a guy who does n't speak and who finds out about himself only through what others tell him .
The great thing about Half - Life is that Gordon walks around with everyone assuming he knows what to do .
In fact , the player does n't have a clue . "
Viktor Antonov , Valve ’s art director .
Gordon would be back for the sequel , as would the G - Man , the mysterious briefcase - carrying operative who now employs Gordon .
But Black Mesa , the New Mexico research facility featured in the original , would not make a return .
" The problem was that because the original game was set only in Black Mesa , we did n't have to think what was beyond its walls , " Laidlaw says .
For Half - Life 2 , Valve wanted to create a brand - new environment that could support more - varied gameplay .
" We just started coming up with a random list of environments that would be a visual challenge and fun to build , " Laidlaw says .
" We wanted to go from a unified lab to a much more epic and global feel . "
Metal Gear Half - Life ?
This concept sketch for the original opening of Half - Life 2 shows a level reminiscent of the tanker sequence from Metal Gear Solid 2 .
At first the team considered designing a game where Gordon would teleport to various planets around the galaxy and combat the Xen aliens from the first game .
But Laidlaw says the team ultimately rejected that idea because it would be hard to create continuity between levels .
Then Viktor Antonov-- Valve 's Bulgarian - born art director -- suggested that the team think of setting the game in the suburban and outlying areas around an Eastern European - style city .
The team liked the idea .
Soon " City 17 " was born .
In Laidlaw 's first pass at the script , players would start the game by boarding the Borealis , an icebreaker bound for City 17 .
Once players arrived , they would discover the Combine , a new group of aliens trying to take over Earth , and Dr. Breen , an ominous Big Brother - like figure who appears on television monitors throughout the city .
Half - Life 2 , like the original , would be a voyage of discovery for the player .
Valve would purposely not tell players how long it had been since the original game or what Gordon was doing in City 17 .
Marc Laidlaw wanted family relationships to play an important role in Half - Life 2 .
Once Laidlaw nailed down the plot points , he then focused on fleshing out specific characters .
Birdwell 's impressive in - game character models meant that there would be huge potential to create drama using richly animated characters .
( Like the original , Half - Life 2 would n't include any cutscenes or have Gordon speak ) .
Laidlaw , working in collaboration with designer Bill Van Buren , honed in on the idea of building familial relationships between characters such as Eli Vance , a scientist , and Alyx , his daughter .
" Characters in games do n't really have families , but it's this basic dramatic unit everyone understands , " Laidlaw says .
" I know , I know -- this is n't the stuff you 'd expect to see in a game derived from Quake and Doom , " he admits with a chuckle .
Zombie Basketball
By mid-2001 , Valve had been working on Half - Life 2 for almost two years in complete secrecy .
And what did it have to show for all its hard work ?
Not much .
There was a rough script , a bunch of concept art , and tons of experimentation being performed with the technology .
Now it was time for the team to try to blend all that technology together -- the characters , the physics , and the new Source engine .
An exclusive look at some of the physics traps considered for the Ravenholm section of City 17 .
The first big breakthrough came when the physics started working inside the game environment .
All of a sudden , static game levels became virtual playgrounds where the team could create objects with mass and have forces act on them .
Some of the designers even developed a minigame called Zombie Basketball , where they used a physics - manipulator gun to throw zombies through hoops and get them to land in trash bins .
" We got the physics working and started saying , ' Wow , we can do anything in this game ! ' "
Laidlaw remembers .
" But then we came to the painful realization about what that was going to mean for the design .
It was going to be a nightmare to give players so much freedom . "
Outdoor combat sequences were brought to life with physics - based gameplay .
Still , designers like Guthrie thought that allowing players to manipulate objects would help the designers invent new gameplay paradigms .
" I imagined throwing saw blades to cut enemies in half , tossing a paint can against a wall and seeing it splatter , " he says .
" It was going to add another whole layer to the gameplay .
It was going to give us what we needed to differentiate this game from Half - Life . "
Another point of differentiation was Birdwell 's character technology .
Rumors began swirling around the industry that the characters looked as good as those in the Final Fantasy movie , The Spirits Within .
Valve recruited Bill Fletcher , a Disney animator , to bring the characters to life .
Microsoft chairman Bill Gates , who used to play poker at Newell 's apartment , even requested an in - person demo .
EXCLUSIVE : A never - before seen image from “ Get Your Free TVs ! ” the first test level for Half - Life 2 created in 2001 .
Suddenly there seemed to be a lot of positive momentum on the project .
So Valve decided to try something ambitious during the summer of 2001 :
The designers started working on a test sequence that would highlight all the new technology .
The concept was to simulate a street war between rioting citizens and the Metrocops sent to contain them .
Such a sequence would test the engine 's ability to create a vast , believable world and lifelike characters .
There would be APCs and tanks rolling down the streets .
Citizens would throw Molotov cocktails at the vehicles , which would then gloriously explode , thanks to the physics engine .
Other characters would start looting stores and yell , " Get your free TVs ! "
There was even a hand - to - hand fighting system so the Metrocops and citizens could get into fistfights .
No one actually thought the level would make it into the final game .
" It was really just an early attempt at getting something -- anything -- in the game that used non-player characters and physics , " Guthrie remembers .
Still , the street - war sequence showed tremendous promise .
So much promise that , after seeing the sequence , Newell asked the team to prepare a " proof of concept " reel for the actual game .
The reel would contain about a dozen different snippets of gameplay .
If it looked good , Half - Life 2 would be given the green light for full - scale production .
In late 2001 , the team started work on the reel , hoping to finish it in early 2002 and then unveil the game at E3 2002 .
But soon the team would discover the challenges of working with new and unstable technology .
Half - Life 2 was about to hit its first major speed bump .
And the geniuses at Valve were about to get a frightening reality check .
The E3 That Never Was
Normally , Gabe Newell prides himself on being an integral part of the design team at Valve .
On Half - Life 2 , he even came up with the idea of making Dr. Breen , the main antagonist , the same character as the administrator from Black Mesa in Half - Life .
But in early 2002
Newell let the rest of the team take the lead on the development of the game .
He wanted to make sure he maintained an unbiased perspective on the proof - of - concept reel .
That way , he would be able to accurately judge how the press and fans would respond to their first look at the game .
So for months he turned a blind eye to the game 's development .
That did n't mean , however , that Newell was about to head off on vacation .
In 2002 , Gabe Newell let the rest of the team take the lead on Half - Life 2's development .
Instead , he began working on other projects , like Steam , Valve 's ambitious online distribution platform .
Newell unveiled the platform at the Game Developers Conference in March 2002 .
Onstage , Newell positioned himself as a new - age Robin Hood who wanted to take from the greedy publishers what independent game developers deserved : a larger piece of the revenue pie .
Newell told the crowd that , under the current system , most developers make only about $ 7 for each game they sell .
But an online distribution platform like Steam - - which cuts out the middleman and delivers a game directly to the consumer 's desktop -- could net developers more than $ 30 per copy .
Newell announced that , while Valve still planned to ship its future games to retail , it would also start releasing games over Steam .
Back at Valve , the team was putting the finishing touches on the noninteractive proof - of - concept reel .
As soon as Newell returned from the GDC , he was ready to see what the team had accomplished .
Everyone knew the reel was n't perfect , but they had made tremendous strides in a short amount of time .
The characters , physics , and game engine all seemed to be working together for the first time .
The team put on their game faces and summoned Newell into the conference room .
The first concept reel for the game featured the icebreaker Borealis .
As the reel started , Newell carefully watched the screen .
The employees nervously watched Newell 's face for any reaction -- even a faint smile .
The first few segments showed how the physics would work inside the gameworld .
Other segments showed off environments , like the Borealis .
But the linchpin of the demo was a nearly 20 - minute scene that took place in the science lab of Dr. Kleiner -- the bald - pated scientist who appeared with Gordon and Alyx in the demonstration .
The dialogue - heavy sequence was an attempt to show the strides Valve had made with in - game storytelling and emotion .
Then the reel faded to black .
That was it .
Everyone eagerly awaited Newell 's reaction .
Oh My God
The sequence in Kleiner 's lab was too long and boring .
The lights came up and Newell turned to the team to deliver his verdict .
" You guys did amazing work , " he said .
But the way he complimented the team made everyone think there was a big " but " coming .
They were right .
" We could take this to E3 , " Newell told the team .
" But you want this to be the thing the fans want it to be -- something that is going to blow them away . "
The implication was that the demo was n't quite good enough .
The character technology was visually impressive but the dramatic scenes were too long and boring .
The physics gameplay seemed interesting , but there were n't any moments that really sold how the physics would take first - person shooters to the next level .
Newell finished his review by delivering the bad news : " Guys , unfortunately we are just not there yet . "
The decision had been made .
Half - Life 2 would not appear at E3 2002 .
" Guys were walking around the office saying , ' Oh my God , what if we actually f*** this up ? ' "
Gabe Newell on the aftermath of the failed proof of concept
Suddenly , the momentum on the project disappeared .
After nearly three years of work , the employees began wondering if they were on the right track .
No one was confident about the project 's future .
Had they been wrong all this time -- would the physics gameplay really be as revolutionary as they had once thought ?
Were the dramatic sequences going to bore players to death ?
What seemed like brilliant choices three years ago were now being questioned .
The failed proof - of - concept reel was an agonizing reminder that Half - Life 2's success was n't a foregone conclusion .
The disappointment was amplified by the fact that Valve did n't want Half - Life 2 to just be a good game -- it wanted the game to blow the competition out of the water .
" Look , getting game of the year wo n't be good enough for guys like [ designer ] Steve Bond , " Newell says .
" If Half - Life 2 is n't viewed as the best PC game of all time , it 's going to completely bum out most of the guys on this team . "
So , if anything , the failed proof of concept meant that the team would want to double its efforts going forward .
They were n't going to give up , they were just going to work harder and longer until the game was in fighting shape .
" That was the hard part , " Newell admits .
" We had already been working on this thing for bloody forever and now we could n't see the end point anywhere in sight . "
The seemingly invincible Valve had stumbled in a very dramatic -- yet very private - - way .
According to Newell , the mood at Valve took a turn for the worse : " Guys were walking around the office saying , ' Oh my God , what if we actually f*** this up ? ' "
Try , Try Again
Striders were added to the proof of concept reel at the last minute .
Once the initial disappointment subsided , some of the team realized that they may have overreacted to the failed proof of concept .
" In retrospect we crammed a lot of technology into that demo , " Guthrie says .
He was particularly happy that striders , massive 60 - foot robots with gazellelike legs , were now technically possible .
Others at Valve were even more philosophical about the disappointment .
" I find that in any creative process you say , ' I 've forgotten why I 'm doing this , ' about halfway through , " Laidlaw says .
" The key is that you just have to keep plowing through and eventually you end up with the thing you pictured originally and that much more . "
During the summer of 2002 the team worked long hours to redo the proof of concept reel .
So that 's exactly what the team did :
They put their heads down and worked on a new proof - of - concept reel during the summer of 2002 .
The team definitely felt internal pressure to get the project back on track but there was absolutely no pressure from the outside .
There were no publishers threatening to cut off funding or marketing executives demanding that the game be announced on a certain date .
Valve was free to do as it pleased .
In a way , the failed proof - of - concept reel mirrored another failure in Valve 's past .
In the fall of 1997 , Newell played through an early version of Half - Life , only to realize that the game was n't any fun to play .
So Valve scrapped the game and almost completely redesigned it in 12 months .
Choices like these are often the difference between a good game and an exceptional one .
Newell says Valve will always err on the side of redoing things if a game is n't up to snuff .
" We do n't have some producer from the packaged - foods industry coming in here and saying , ' Ship this in six weeks or else ! " he says .
True .
But most game developers also are n't in Valve 's position , where Newell has enough money to fund a game 's development out of his pocket , if he so pleases .
So is it really fair to hold other developers to the same standard as Valve ?
Ask Newell this question and he grows agitated .
" Any developer who bitches about , ' Oh , our publisher cut off our money , ' or , ' The publisher made us ship the game early , ' does n't get it , " he says .
" That 's the interesting problem you have to solve as a developer .
If you do n't , well , you 'll be perpetually screwed . "
But how do you solve the problem ?
Newell cites the development of Counter - Strike , where a young college kid in Vancouver made a Half - Life add - on , as a prime example .
" You bootstrap , " Newell suggests .
" The Counter - Strike guys did n't have some sugar daddy show up and drop a huge wad of cash in their lap .
You have to be creative . "
" The Counter - Strike guys did n’t have some sugar daddy show up and drop a huge wad of cash in their lap .
You have to be creative . "
Gabe Newell on how game developers should get their start
Valve was n't beholden to a game publisher , but it did feel beholden to the fans .
And by the summer of 2002 , the team began to realize that Newell was right -- the March proof - of - concept reel probably would have disappointed the fans .
" The whole Dr. Kleiner 's lab sequence way too long and boring , " Van Buren admits .
Laidlaw says that back in March the team had yet to strike the right balance between dialogue and gameplay .
" It 's like what Hitchcock said : ' Pictures of people talking is not a movie , ' " he says .
" We are building a game with interactivity and gameplay .
The dramatic scenes with the characters are important , but they have to be in service of the interactivity and gameplay . "
Now the question was if Valve could learn from its mistakes and get the project back on track .
The Devil Is in the Details
The summer of 2002 was a tough slog for the team .
Until a new proof of concept was completed , there was no knowing when -- or if -- the project would get back on track .
But one thing was for sure : Expectations were sky - high for the sequel to Half - Life .
And after more than three years of hard work , the team was n't about to let the fans down .
This antlion attack sequence was added to the September proof of concept .
By early September , the team had completed what it judged to be a greatly refined proof - of - concept reel .
The tools for both level design and character animation had improved , so it was now easier to prototype gameplay ideas .
The reel included new and improved gameplay sequences : A buggy race along the coast of City 17 , an encounter with headcrabs on a pier , and the pièce de résistance , a strider attacking the downtown area of City 17 .
Many of the gameplay sequences were actually refined versions of what had been shown in March .
The sequence in Dr. Kleiner 's lab was still included , but it was now just a few minutes long .
Valve ’s Jay Stelly was initially worried whether the September proof of concept would pass muster .
The new demo was set to be presented on a Monday in September .
The weekend before , the team worked around the clock to pull it together .
Yet by Sunday night the team started getting cold feet .
No one was quite sure if the reel was going to be good enough .
When Jay Stelly left the office around 7 pm on Sunday , he remembers being uncertain whether the new proof of concept would pass muster .
" When I left the office the strider was shooting at a bridge and there were explosions , " he recalls .
" It looked OK , but I did n't think it was that impressive . "
Fifteen hours later , the team presented the new proof - of - concept reel to Newell .
Stelly was amazed at what had changed overnight .
" Now the physics of the bridge breaking were in , the people were running across the catwalk , and the strider was ducking under the bridge as it attacked , " he recalls .
" It just seemed like we finally had a game and it came together overnight . "
The rest of the team -- including Newell - - agreed with Stelly 's assessment .
The game was back on track .
A strider attacks the City 17 sky bridge in the finished September 2002 proof of concept .
Newell briefly toyed with announcing the game in the fall of 2002 to celebrate the fourth anniversary of Half - Life 's release .
But those plans were called off because he did n't want to announce the game until he had a ship date .
As a result , the employees went through another holiday season without being able to tell their relatives what game they were developing .
" When I went home for Thanksgiving , my relatives asked me , ' So how did that game you were working on last year turn out ? ' "
Stelly says .
For the fourth consecutive year , he had to admit he was working on the same game .
And he could n't even tell them the name of it .
The secrecy around Half - Life 2 , however , would soon be lifted .
Valve was about to move into full - scale production .
Newell assembled the team in October of 2002 and delivered a rallying call : " We have to prepare to announce the game at E3 and get it out by the end of 2003 . "
There was no turning back now .
The Cabals Move In
John Guthrie at work in his cabal .
The immense scope of City 17 meant that no one designer could oversee the entire game .
So , as was the case with Half - Life , Valve employed its " cabal " design process , in which small design hives tackled different parts of the city .
For Half - Life 2 , there were three main cabals of up to six designers .
Each cabal worked in a large office that looked a bit like the bridge of a submarine .
John Guthrie 's cabal -- which worked on the game 's canal section and Ravenholm , a zombie - infested part of town -- consisted of his longtime friend Steve Bond ( they first started working together at age 16 ) , Dario Casali , and Tom Leonard .
" I actually see these guys more than I do my girlfriend , " Guthrie jokes .
On second thought , maybe he is n't joking .
Before designing levels the cabals worked on pencil drawings for level layout like these sequences for Ravenholm .
The cabals designed levels much like they designed levels for Half - Life , with one notable exception : Level design was separated from art for Half - Life 2 .
In other words , the designers first fleshed out the gameplay before the artists began to gussy up the levels with beautiful textures .
This new production pipeline let the cabals rapidly create new content .
( The first pass at a map was called an " orange map " because all the level textures would be the same shade of orange ) .
The cabals even designed the scripted elements of the game using simple text bubbles that would pop up on screen .
So in the first pass at a level , the cabal might put in a text bubble that said , " One day you 'll be able to drive a jeep and jump this ramp . "
This allowed the team to perfect the gameplay and work out story issues like pacing long before an artist touched the level .
The orange maps even helped the cabals when it came to designing the physics of the gameplay . "
Before you could hoist up cars and drop them on enemies , you were hoisting up orange cubes , " Guthrie says .
Integrating vehicles into gameplay proved a challenge .
By early 2003 , the cabals were cranking away on game design , working on countless levels and collaborating with Laidlaw to make sure all the levels would fit into the larger storyline .
Still , there were struggles during the early days of production .
Namely , the core game technology was unstable and unfinished .
Unlike Half - Life 's development , in which Valve licensed the fully working Quake engine and built a game on top of it , Half - Life 2's development employed the Valve - created Source engine , which was a constant work in progress .
In - game vehicles , for instance , were n't working when the cabals first started the design .
That led to much frustration .
" We needed levels built for vehicles but we did n't know how the vehicles would work , " Newell says .
" For instance , we did n't know how high off the ground the buggy could bounce . "
But since vehicles played a major role in the game , the cabals had to make assumptions about how they 'd work .
" Unfortunately , those assumptions often turned out to be wrong , " Newell says .
Orange maps were created for all the levels before the artists added textures .
Despite these early concerns , Newell had a meeting late in late February of 2003 to discuss the state of the project with Yahn Bernier and Stelly .
Newell still planned to show the game at E3 and ship it later in the year .
But now he wanted to get more precise .
He looked at the schedule and made a bold prediction :
The game could be finished in September .
Then his calculus got even more specific :
The game would ship on September 30 , 2003 .
While he wo n't confirm it , many have speculated that Newell set such an aggressive target to make sure the team stayed motivated during the summer .
He maintains that when he made the September 30 decision , he fully believed the game could be done by that date .
" The good news was that we actually had a ship date - - a date to look forward to . "
John Guthrie ’s initial thoughts on the September 30 , 2003 ship date
Newell next announced the ambitious date to the team .
Many of them were surprised by Newell 's aggressive target .
" The good news was that we actually had a ship date - - a date to look forward to , " Guthrie says .
But then the harsh reality set in :
There would be no room for error .
In fact , there would hardly be any room for sleep .
" I figured there were enough hours left between where we were in February and where we needed to be in September to finish the game , " Guthrie says .
" But I was n't exactly looking forward to using all those hours to hit that date . "
The Half - Life 2 team was about to enter a very serious crunch mode -- a period of intense development that would last until the game was finished , hopefully in mid-September .
The days of working on a project with no time pressure and an unlimited budget were a distant memory .
Newell had now fast - tracked the game 's release .
It was going to be a very stressful summer at Valve .
The Potemkin Village ?
It 's March 2003 and Gabe Newell looks like he 's about to start a shadow - puppet show .
Sitting in the conference room at Valve , Newell has raised his right hand and clasped his thumb to his index finger to make a mock mouth .
" I 've sort of been having this internal conversation with our fans for years , " he says while looking at his hand .
" So I have to pretend my hand here is a fan and I need to guess what they are going to think of Half - Life 2 . "
Newell goes on to say that he 's sick and tired of guessing what the fans will think .
He 's ready to show them the game and get their reaction .
" At E3 I 'm finally going to be able to look the fans in the eyes and say , ' OK , what do you guys think ? ' " he says .
" We looked at the cost of doing a demo like that and said , ' No way in hell . "
Ken Birdwell on the aborted E3 demo concept
How would Valve unveil the game at E3 2003 ?
At first Newell wanted the team to create an extensive 30 - minute demo that would feature Alyx , the main female character , guiding the audience through a science lab that showcased the Source technology .
Then , halfway through the demo , the lab would suddenly be attacked and the player would have to escape alongside Alyx .
It sounded like a great way to break the fourth wall and show off Valve 's character technology .
But in the weeks leading up to E3 , it became clear there was no time to create such an elaborate demo .
" We looked at the cost of doing a demo like that and said , ' No way in hell , ' " Birdwell remembers .
" If we were shipping September 30 , everything that was going to be at E3 had to be something we could ship . "
The G - Man opened the E3 2003 demo of Half - Life 2 .
The fans at E3 would have no idea that Valve had dramatically scaled back its plans for the demo .
In place of the Alyx demo , Valve showed off a number of the proof - of - concept demos , along with a few new snippets of gameplay .
The demo started off with everyone 's favorite character , the G - Man .
Valve even thought up a brilliant way to add some dramatic flair to the demo :
At first the G - Man looked as he did in the original Half - Life .
Then the image changed to the new photo - realistic character model for Half - Life 2 .
The contrast between the two character models was a masterstroke -- it showed the audience just how far Valve had come in five years .
The outside of the Half - Life 2 theater at E3 2003 .
But it did n't matter if Valve thought its demo was cool .
Newell was more interested in the fan reaction .
As soon as the first E3 demo was finished , he turned to the audience and asked a simple question :
Is this a worthy successor to Half - Life ?
Time and again , the answer was yes .
" I can't tell you how much that meant to me , " Newell says .
" Our fans said , ' We trusted you to do something very cool and exciting and this lives up to our expectations . ' "
Newell would keep asking the same question for all three days of the show .
Every time he'd get the same response .
Half - Life 2 was the buzz of the show .
In the weeks following its debut , the Game Critics Awards : Best of E3 2003 awarded it the highly coveted Best of Show award .
But just like with any popular demo at E3 , competitors and some members of the press remained skeptical about what Valve had shown -- especially in light of the promised September 30 ship date .
Competitors claimed that Valve ’s City 17 was actually an elaborate façade .
The line of reasoning went like this :
If the game really were coming September 30 , that meant Valve had to finish the game in the summer .
So why did n't Valve let people actually play the game at E3 in mid-May ?
The physics gameplay looked interesting , but competitors said that it could never actually work in a game like that -- it would be a design nightmare to let players have so much control .
The skeptics wondered if Valve had hoodwinked the entire industry with an elaborate tech demo that would never become a game .
Was City 17 actually a Potemkin village , an elaborate fake town like the one Russian field marshal Grigori Aleksandrovich Potemkin supposedly created to impress Catherine the Great on her tour of the Ukraine in the late 1700s ?
Valve had heard all this before -- it was sour grapes , it thought .
And Newell had just one message for the doubters :
We will see you on September 30 .
Or maybe not .
As soon as Newell returned from E3 , he took a long , hard look at the team 's progress .
And he soon reached a heartbreaking conclusion .
The Sweater Falls Apart
The post -E3 celebration at Valve was short - lived .
With Newell hell - bent on shipping the game on September 30 , there was n't time to celebrate or take a vacation .
But it might have been a good time for a reality check .
Even though Newell kept talking about the September 30 release , the team knew there was no way the game could make that date .
No one , however , had the heart to tell Gabe .
" In retrospect I could tell things were off with the schedule when I came back from E3 , " Newell admits .
" I 'd sit in meetings and when I 'd talk about September 30 the rest of the team would just start looking at the ceiling . "
" In retrospect I could tell things were off in the schedule when I came back from E3 [ 2003 ] . "
Gabe Newell
But at the time Newell did n't pick up on the signals .
He just kept talking about how exciting it would be to ship the game on September 30 .
" I 'd say we needed to get the localization going for the dialogue to meet the September date , " he recalls .
" But the dialogue was n't done so we could n't start that . "
Slowly Newell began to realize that something was wrong .
" We had n't put a bunch of items on the list that needed to be there -- and the items on the list were taking longer than expected , " he says .
Newell felt backed into a corner :
He had been so absolute in setting the September 30 date that he felt an obligation to deliver the game as promised .
When he finally realized the game was unlikely to make the date he called a meeting with the team .
" We all sat around and said , ' OK , what the hell do we do ? ' "
Birdwell remembers .
FacePoser , the tool used to create the animated sequences , still was n’t working well in the summer of 2003 .
One option considered was to drastically cut the size and scope of the game .
" We looked at the game and said , ' OK , if we cut this in half can we ship it in time ? ' "
Birdwell says .
If Valve took that path it would mean cutting the most difficult -- and potentially memorable -- scenes out of the game .
Since vehicles were n't working yet , the Jet Ski levels would have to be cut .
The dramatic scenes would also have to be scaled back because they were still too hard to animate .
" So we went back to Gabe and said , ' OK , here 's what we can do to meet your date or a date close to it :
We can cut all this stuff and ship a game that 's half of what it 's supposed to be , ' " Birdwell says .
" There was n’t one big moment where we said , ‘S ***!
We ’re going to miss September 30th . ' "
Gabe Newell on the missed release date
Not surprisingly , Newell told the team that they should n't compromise the game design to meet a release date .
And that 's when reality set in :
The game was n't going to ship on September 30 .
" There was n't one big moment where we said , 'S ***!
We 're going to miss September 30 , " Newell says .
" It was more like slowly pulling the thread of a sweater until eventually the whole thing falls apart . "
Newell now admits that by July it was " pretty obvious " the game was n't going to ship in September .
But Valve kept the change of plans quiet .
No one outside the company knew the game was going to miss its widely publicized release date .
Except maybe the executives at Vivendi Universal Games .
On July 29 , 2003 , Vivendi informed retailers that Half - Life 2's release date had been moved from September 30 to " holidays 2003 . "
The fans on the Internet hit the roof .
Had Half - Life 2 really been delayed ?
One webmaster e-mailed Newell for confirmation .
He received a response that has now become legendary among Half - Life fans : " First time I 've heard of this , " Newell wrote .
The fans read that response as Newell confirming the game was still on for September 30 .
In the summer of 2003 the fans did n’t know if Half - Life 2 was really coming on September 30 or not .
In August , Valve continued to confirm the September 30 release date in a very public and direct fashion .
On August 24 , Valve said that the " release date 's unchanged " and went so far as to confirm the game would come out worldwide on September 30 .
Perhaps the most telling comment , however , came on August 27 , when Valve 's Greg Coomer told a journalist at the ECTS trade show in London that , " It 'll be tight , but Half - Life 2 is still on for a September 30 ship . "
The fans began preparing for the gold announcement in early September .
They started discussing what they would do on September 30 .
Would they take the day off from school ?
Call in sick to work ?
For months everyone had been anticipating the September 30 date .
And while rumors kept swirling that the game would n't ship on time , Valve insisted it was right on schedule .
Even as late as September 18 , a Half - Life fan visited Valve and asked Newell about the September 30 release date .
The fan must have been skeptical -- would n't the game have to be in duplication by now to ship in only 12 days ?
Newell looked the fan square in the eyes and still would n't confirm the delay .
But he hedged for the first time .
" We 'll see , " he said .
Broken Promises
Some devoted fans of Half - Life 2 created the game 's logo out of soda cans .
Gabe Newell loves his fans .
He answers their e-mails all the time .
He even answers their weird e-mails .
Like the one in which a fan asked Gabe if he 'd trade some sexual favors in return for an advance copy of the game .
( " Whose sexual favors ? " he wrote back .
" If they are Cameron Diaz's , and you get my wife to agree , then you 're on . " )
Newell says he gets more than 400 e-mails a day from fans who want to check in with him and see how things are going .
Sometimes the fans even call him at home -- at 3 am .
He briefly indulges them in conversation and then politely asks them to call at a more reasonable hour .
For Gabe almost everything at Valve is done for " the fans . "
You'd be hard - pressed to find another developer in the game industry who spends more time writing to fans , posting on forums , and even giving fans tours of the Valve office .
Why spend so much time talking to the fans ?
" They pay the bills , " Newell says .
The release date was so uncertain that one fan created a game of ' Half - Life 2 Release Date Twister ' .
Why would a guy who cares so much about his fans keep them in the dark for months on end about the state of Half - Life 2 ?
During the summer of 2003 Newell practically stopped communicating with the fan community .
No one knew what to think .
But they trusted Gabe .
If the game was n't going to ship on September 30 , the fans figured that Gabe would come out and tell them that .
Or at least he'd admit that the game might be delayed .
But Gabe said nothing and the fans took that to mean good news .
" The previously announced September 30 release date for Half - Life 2 is being pushed back . "
E-mail from Valve on Sept 23 , 2003
But on the night of September 23 the truth emerged .
Exactly one week before the game was supposed to ship , Valve released a short statement to the Shacknews Web site .
" The previously announced September 30 release date for Half - Life 2 is being pushed back .
We are currently targeting a holiday release , but do not have a specific ' in store ' date to share at this time . "
The fans were stunned .
A month ago Valve was confirming a September 30 ship date .
And now Valve claimed the date had been pushed back ?
The fans did n't understand .
Why did Valve create a false sense of hope ?
Why did they string us along for so long ?
Why would Valve , a company that seemed to do everything for " the fans , " turn around and bite the hand that had fed it so well ?
As September 30 approached , Newell turned down interview requests , and no one at Valve would elaborate on the state of the game .
The fans were enraged .
After all the hype and all the buildup , they began to wonder what else Valve might have been lying about .
Perhaps the cynics were right -- maybe the E3 demo really was a sham or a facade .
Some fans remembered Team Fortress 2 , a game that was announced at E3 in 1999 , won countless awards , and then disappeared shortly afterward .
Was Valve up to its old tricks again -- was Half - Life 2 going to disappear like Team Fortress 2 ?
The webmaster of one Half - Life fan site posted a bitter missive on Valve : " The bottom line is this : I 'm not a fan of Valve anymore .
I do n't believe a damn thing they say and I 'm sick of their bulls ***. "
Valve , the company that had created one of the greatest PC games of all time , now seemed to have pulled off one of the greatest cases of deception ever seen in the game industry .
The fans felt burned .
They wanted answers .
The problem was that Valve was n't giving any .
Until now .
Gabe Comes Clean
Game release dates slip all the time .
In fact , it 's hard to think of a cutting - edge , genre - defining game that did n't have its release date moved back at least once .
Even the original Half - Life shipped a year later than first projected .
So why did the fan community whip itself into such a frenzy over the Half - Life 2 delay ?
It boiled down to this :
The fans were n't upset that the game was delayed , they were upset over the way the delay was handled by Valve .
In the weeks following the delay announcement , Valve would n't say anything to explain the delay .
Indeed , until now , Gabe Newell has never publicly commented on the release - date fiasco .
Gabe Newell finally comes out of hiding to discuss the missed release dates on the project .
But he wants to set the record straight -- to explain to the fans why Valve did what it did .
It 's not , however , an easy thing for him to do .
Ask him about the debacle and his first explanation is utterly unsatisfying .
" I was just dumb , " he says bluntly .
So you ask him again .
This time he delivers a highly technical and emotionally distant answer : " I made the decisions I had to make based on the problems that were apparent and the questions that needed to be answered . "
But finally , after much prodding , Newell begins to explain why Valve seemingly misled the public for months .
First , he wants everyone to know that those initial September 30 promises haunt him to this day .
" Listen , I feel absolutely terrible about the date fiasco , " he explains .
Then he lists every possible adjective of regret he can conjure : " I feel totally guilty and embarrassed and ashamed and humiliated about what happened . "
So what did happen ?
As Newell and the team have explained , by July it was obvious that Half - Life 2 would not be finished in time for a September 30 release .
So why was Valve still telling the public in late August that the game was on schedule ?
" We were paralyzed , " Newell says .
" We knew we were n't going to make the date we promised , and that was going to be a huge fiasco and really embarrassing .
But we did n't have a new date to give people either . "
In other words , Newell did n't want to announce the delay until he had a new official date to announce .
It 's that simple .
" So I decided we should just stay quiet , " he says .
Still , there 's a difference between staying quiet and confirming a ship date that you know to be incorrect .
Newell says that , in retrospect , he may have made the wrong decision on this front .
At the time , however , he did n't want to announce the delay until he had something better to tell the fans .
" I did n't want to go to ' when it 's done ' or announce 17 different dates over the next few months , " he says .
" We were paralyzed ... We knew we were n’t going to make the date we promised and that was going to be a huge fiasco and really embarrassing . "
Gabe Newell on the missed release date
So by mid-summer he was in an awkward situation :
He had dug himself into a hole by loudly proclaiming the September 30 ship date .
Now he knew he was going to miss that date .
So what did he do ?
Like people sometimes do in an embarrassing situation , he stalled .
He thought that by saying , " The game 's still on schedule , " he could quickly move on to other questions in interviews and not have to confront the slippage .
But as September 30 approached , Valve did n't have a new date , and Newell finally had to fess up about the delay .
Looking back on those months , would Newell change anything about how he handled the situation ?
He says yes .
" If I learned anything , it 's just that we should be more open with the community -- to tell them what we know and do n't know , " he admits .
Indeed , no one asked Valve to promise the game on a specific date .
That was Newell 's choice .
And it 's a choice he now regrets .
" Yeah , " he says with a chuckle .
" In retrospect I probably should have just said , ' When it 's done . ' "
On Top of the Rock
The Half - Life 2 launch party was supposed to happen on Alcatraz Island .
If Gabe Newell had his way , he would have spent September 30 , 2003 , lying low at the Valve office .
He was deeply embarrassed by the slipped date and frustrated that the fans were berating Valve on the Internet .
In other words , he just wanted September 30 , 2003 , to quietly pass .
Unfortunately , that was n't a possibility .
He had a prior obligation : the Half - Life 2 launch party , which graphics - card manufacturer ATI had scheduled months in advance -- fully assuming , of course , that the game would ship on September 30 .
ATI , which is rumored to have paid more than $ 6 million to Valve as part of a broad endorsement deal , planned a massive fete to celebrate the launch of the game and a new ATI graphics card .
ATI rented out the entire island of Alcatraz in San Francisco and planned to host the party inside the prison .
Newell wanted to pull out of the event but could n't .
It was an obligation to a business partner - - a partner that was " none too pleased we missed our date , " he says .
Newell did n’t show any new Half - Life 2 gameplay on Alcatraz .
But he did show this benchmark demo .
On the afternoon of September 30 , Newell arrived at Pier 41 in San Francisco and boarded the ferry that would take him to Alcatraz .
It must have been his worst nightmare : to be trapped on an island with the world 's gaming press , a group that wanted nothing more than to pelt Newell with tough questions about Half - Life 2's release date .
At about 8:30 pm , Newell , dressed in a red polo shirt , walked onto a makeshift stage inside the prison .
No one knew what he was going to say .
Was he going to address the botched release date ?
Was he going to show a new demo of the game ?
This was Newell 's chance to win back the fans he 'd alienated and misled .
All he had to do was say he was sorry and show that the game was nearly done .
But he did n't do that .
In what seemed like a carefully prepared speech he praised ATI and then showed a very brief " benchmark " demo of the Source engine .
Half - Life 2 was nowhere to be seen .
" It was n’t me saying , ' You know , the Doom 3 engine is looking really good right about now . ' "
Gabe Newell on a leaked e-mail message from Valve
The press was floored .
Here it was September 30 and Valve still was n't showing Half - Life 2 to anyone ?
Not even a level ?
Once again rumors started swirling about the state of the project .
Would it even come out in 2003 ?
Newell , who desperately wanted to get back to Seattle , was briefly cornered by GameSpot as he tried to leave the prison .
" I hate release dates , " he said .
" No matter how hard we try we screw them up . "
And with that comment Newell slipped out the door and caught the first ferry back to the mainland at 9:30 pm .
Newell just wanted September 30 to end .
And who could blame him ?
Six months earlier , this was the date he promised everyone they'd be playing the game .
And now no one was playing the game .
No one , that is , except a young man in southern Germany .
An Unthinkable Crime
It all started one September day in 2003 .
That 's when the hard - drive light on Gabe Newell 's PC started flashing at bizarre times .
The problem persisted even after he reformatted his hard drive and ran a virus scan .
So he sent an e-mail to check if anyone else 's PC was on the fritz .
" Has anyone seen anything weird going on ? " he asked the staff .
No one responded .
After hearing of the Source code theft , fans made a poster parody of ' Pirates of the Carribean '
Then something even weirder happened .
A copy of an e-mail between Newell and Valve programmer Dave Riller appeared on the Internet .
It was an innocuous e-mail about Counter - Strike .
" It was n't me saying , ' You know , the Doom 3 engine is looking really good right about now , ' " Newell jokes .
But how did the private e-mail end up online ?
Newell walked down to Riller 's office and asked if he had forwarded it to anyone .
Riller said no .
" All of a sudden I got this sinking feeling , " Newell says .
He started to worry that someone had figured out his e-mail password .
He quickly changed it .
Problem solved ?
Not quite .
" In retrospect we were looking for bruises when our throats had already been cut , " he says .
As Newell looked into the situation more closely , he came to an alarming conclusion : " We were f***ed . "
He found odd software installed on his machine .
There were hidden hard - drive partitions .
The network activity on Valve 's servers showed uncommon spikes .
When he began to check other computers , he found at least 13 that had similar software installed .
Valve 's security had been compromised .
Racing around the office , he told everyone to disconnect their computers from the Internet .
He started pulling wires out of walls , shutting down computers and effectively cutting Valve off from the outside world .
It was too late .
As soon as the hacker realized that his access had been cut off he started releasing to the Internet parts of what he had been able to obtain from Valve 's network .
On October 4 , the first bomb dropped :
The entire source code to Half - Life 2 was let loose .
Newell was furious , but he also did n't know if it was the start or the end of the hacker 's plans .
" It 's not like someone hands you a card that says , ' This is how screwed you are , ' " he says .
" Then people started using the game to compose their own screenshots of Dr. Kleiner performing [ oral sex ] on Alyx .
It 's basically your worst nightmare . "
Gabe Newell on the leaked copy of Half - Life 2
The source - code leak turned out to be only the opening salvo from a man calling himself " Osama Bin Leaker . "
( It would later be learned that the hacker was " Axel G , " a 21 - year - old man in Germany ) .
On October 7 , only three days after the source code leaked , the second bomb dropped : A playable version of the game was released , including portions of the E3 2003 demo .
Newell did n't know what to think -- was the worst over ?
" It just felt like each day things kept getting worse , " he recalls .
" First the source code .
Then the game .
And then people started using the game to compose their own screenshots of Dr. Kleiner performing [ oral sex ] on Alyx .
It 's basically your worst nightmare . "
Osama Bin Leaker said the E3 demo of Half - Life 2 , including this attack by a Hydra , was fake .
The theft of the game and its release to the Internet was a crushing blow for Valve .
But it had an even worse aftershock :
It exposed the real state of the game 's development as of September 19 , only 11 days before the scheduled release .
In his notes accompanying the release , Osama Bin Leaker said , " I 'd like to point out this is what you wanted Valve to release on 9/30/03 . "
And then he added a pithy footnote : " I 'd like to point out the E3 demo was one big fake by Valve . "
" For months Newell had n’t told anyone about the state of the game .
Now he was getting his comeuppance -- the game was speaking for itself . "
For months
Newell had n't told anyone about the state of the game .
Now he was getting his comeuppance -- the game was speaking for itself .
Those who obtained the illegal release found a game that was nowhere near finished .
While it was uncertain if the leaked version fully represented Valve 's progress , some insensitive fans took pleasure in the effects of the code theft .
Valve got what it deserved for lying to us , they claimed .
Conspiracy theories started bouncing around the Internet .
Some fans advanced the theory that perhaps Valve deliberately leaked the code to buy itself more time and deflect attention from the delay .
( This , of course , was not true ) .
Still , it was strange that the game leaked only days after September 30 .
Newell says the hacker 's claim that he released the code to prove Valve was lying about September 30 was , as he puts it , " utter bulls * **. "
What triggered the code release was n't the date , " Newell says .
" They knew we had discovered them in our network so they were just going to go ahead and release what they had .
They just made up a goofy excuse . "
The damage had already been done .
At Valve no one knew what the code theft meant for a project that had been through its fair share of twists and turns .
Would this unthinkable crime derail the game ?
Newell had no idea how to measure the impact of what had just happened .
And worse , the team members -- the people who had spent more than four years tirelessly working on the game -- were absolutely crushed to see their unfinished work exposed to millions .
One young designer brought his concerns right to Newell in his office .
" Gabe , " he said , " is this going to destroy the company ? "
Picking up the Pieces
Gabe was mad .
No , he was more than mad .
He was furious with whoever perpetrated this crime against Valve .
It was one thing for the fans to make fun of him online .
But as soon as he saw that his designers , artists , and programmers were worrying about the future , well , that 's when he really went off .
For years Newell had worked to make Valve a safe creative haven for the best and brightest in the business .
He was the video game equivalent of the X - Men 's Professor X , running his own school for the gifted .
While the code theft might have meant millions in lost revenue for Valve , Newell was much more concerned about the morale and well - being of his team .
The team at Valve sits and discusses the code theft .
So he put on a brave face .
He called everyone into the conference room and displayed remarkable sangfroid .
" You know guys , every id release has leaked early and it's been no big deal , ' " he told the disillusioned team in an attempt to comfort them .
Then he tried to turn lemons into lemonade .
" We 've made it through all this , " he told the team .
" How much worse can it get ? "
Keeping his team in high spirits was only part of the problem .
Newell also had to figure out just who had compromised Valve 's security and stolen the game off the network one byte at a time .
He called the FBI to start an investigation .
He also kicked off his own investigation by posting a message to fans online -- yes , those very same fans that were furious over the missed release date .
" Ever have one of those weeks ? " he asked in a forum post .
Newell went on to appeal to the Half - Life community for help in tracking down the hacker .
" We lost a fair amount of time because of the theft . " --
Gabe Newell on the impact of the code theft
Newell also had to keep his team focused on the task at hand : finishing Half - Life 2 , a game that was now costing Valve more than $ 1 million a month to develop .
While there was no way the game could be finished in 2003 , Newell wanted to make sure the project did n't lose momentum .
" We lost a fair amount of time because of the theft , " he says .
But that lost time was n't necessarily because the game had to be reprogrammed .
It was more due to the team losing focus for a number of weeks .
" It was sort of like running this race and you fall down , " he says .
" You eventually get back up and probably run just as fast as you did before .
But for a while you are stunned and just staring around , wondering what just happened . "
By the end of 2003 Half - Life 2 was finally starting to come together .
The 2003 holiday season was supposed to be a time of great celebration and relaxation for Valve .
Half - Life 2 was supposed to be done and on store shelves .
But now the employees would return in January and face 20 - hour workdays with no clear sense of when the game would be finished .
" By Christmas there were still a lot of empty spots in the game and really low density to the levels , " Laidlaw says .
Would 2004 be Half - Life 2's year ?
Newell , now the eternal pessimist , could n't see any way the game would be done before the summertime .
But he did n't want to say anything to the public just yet .
One thing was for sure :
He did n't want a repeat of the September 30 fiasco .
Hello , Gabe
By early 2004 tools like Hammer , the game ’s editor , were getting easier to use .
When the team returned to work in January 2004 , it had been in crunch mode for almost a year .
Worst of all , there was no sign the stressful development period would end anytime soon .
There was , however , a silver lining : Improved level design and animation tools meant that it was now easier to produce game content .
" By January there were n't any really interesting problems left for us to solve , " Newell says .
He even went so far as to calculate that Valve could produce about three hours of quality gameplay per month .
" I finally got the sense that we were turning the crank on this project in a major way , " he says .
While Newell was n't confident enough to predict a release date , he started to believe an " alpha " version -- where the game could be played from beginning to end -- would be ready by March .
An animator works on a sequence starring Alyx Vance .
There was other good news as well .
While Birdwell 's in - game characters had always been visually impressive , no one was sure how the in - game acting would blend with the fast - paced action .
But in early 2004 the game 's dramatic scenes started coming together in a powerful way .
For years Laidlaw and Van Buren worked on honing the script for the game , which ended up amounting to more than 150 pages of dialogue , or about two hours of fully animated in - game scenes .
( The original game had only 19 pages of dialogue ) .
They even hired an impressive Hollywood cast of actors to play a number of key roles , including Robert Culp as Dr. Breen , the game 's antagonist .
( Robin Williams expressed interest in voicing the alien character Voiteguart , but scheduling conflicts prevented him from playing the role ) .
Newell finally got his wish :
The characters were n't robots -- they acted , talked , and moved like real people .
Even the fans seemed to be coming back around in early 2004 .
Many of them realized that perhaps they had overreacted in the wake of the September 30 release - date fiasco .
One even e-mailed Newell in January 2004 to express concern about his health .
" You seem to have taken on some weight [ in your recent media appearances ] , " the fan , MJA Lebbink , wrote .
" All the fanboys are going to kill me for saying this , but if delaying HL2 is what it takes to keep you healthy by all means do so .
I 'd rather see HL2 in 2005 and you healthy and making more great games than a HL2 today and no more Gabe in the future . "
Newell , after reading the e-mail , sent a response .
" I appreciate the sentiment , " he wrote .
The e-mail from MJA underscored the unique relationship Newell maintained with Valve 's fans throughout the project .
Over the course of Half - Life 2's development he gave many tours of Valve to fans and responded to thousands of e-mails .
But there was one e-mail that stood out from the rest .
Newell found that one sitting in his inbox the day after Valentine 's Day .
I 'm Getting My Crowbar
On February 15 a strange e-mail arrived in Gabe Newell 's inbox at 6:18 pm .
The subject line was blank , but the text of the e-mail from " Da Guy " was rich in detail .
" Hello , Gabe , " the author began .
He then proceeded to admit that yes , he was the hacker who had broken into Valve 's network .
In fact , he had been inside Valve 's network for about six months , watching the game 's development on a daily basis .
He claimed he never intended to harm Valve with his hacking .
Instead he just wanted to observe Half - Life 2's development because he was such a huge fan of the original game .
And then , unbelievably , he even offered his compliments to Newell and the team on their amazing development skills .
" I 'm getting on a plane and I 'm bringing my crowbar with me . "
Gabe ’s reaction to an e-mail from the hacker who attacked Valve
At first Newell did n't know if the e-mail was some sick joke or an authentic mea culpa .
But then , at the end of the e-mail , the hacker provided proof that he was legit :
He included two files from Valve 's network that had n't been released to the public .
One was a Microsoft Word document that detailed Valve 's plans for the E3 2003 demo .
That was all the evidence Newell needed .
This was " da guy " who had screwed them .
His first reaction : " I 'm getting on a plane and I 'm bringing my crowbar with me . "
The crowbar in Valve ’s lobby .
Newell almost wanted to use it against the hacker .
But Newell was smarter than that -- he decided to play along with the hacker .
So two days later he responded at 5:39 pm .
He did his best to seem calm and collected , stripping all emotion out of his e-mail .
He wrote that he " need[ed ] to run home to deliver chicken yakisoba to the starving children , " but he'd " take a look at [ the files you sent ] tonight . "
Then he ended his brief e-mail to " Da Guy " with a question : " So it 's cool that you are clearing up the mystery for us , but why are you doing it ? " he asked .
Over the next few weeks , Newell and " Da Guy " would continue their e-mail conversation .
" He had the typical hacker mentality , " Newell says .
" He thinks , ' If I can get away with it , you deserve it ! ' "
So Newell tried playing to the hacker 's line of reasoning :
He told him how cool it was that he was able to break into Valve 's network .
In fact , it was so cool that Valve wanted to hire him as a special security consultant to protect Valve from any future attacks .
" Da Guy " could n't believe it !
Newell was offering him a job at Valve headquarters in Bellevue , Washington .
As the e-mail exchange continued , " Da Guy " -- whom Newell came to know as " Axel G , " a 21 - year - old from the southern German state of Baden - Wüerttemberg - - started preparing for his " job interview , " which would take place at Valve headquarters in Bellevue .
Unbelievably , he even asked Newell if he could also fly over his dad and his brother for the occasion .
Newell said that sounded great -- he'd even give them all a tour .
" [ Newell ] told the hacker how cool it was that he was able to break into Valve networks .
So cool , in fact , that Valve wanted to hire him as a special security consultant . "
There would , of course , be no job interview .
Newell had convinced the hacker to fall for the oldest trick in the book .
As soon as " Axel G " was to walk off the plane in Seattle , the FBI would be there waiting to place him under arrest .
Those plans changed at the last minute , however , when the German government got wind of Newell 's plan .
The government objected to Valve enticing a German national out of the country solely so he could be arrested on US soil .
The German authorities wanted to handle the arrest directly .
And they did just that : " Axel G " was arrested this spring in Germany and now faces charges not just for hacking into Valve , but also for developing a number of pernicious viruses , including the Phatbot worm .
" He 's really a pretty evil guy , " Newell says .
" He built up these distributive productivity tools for hackers so you can send off 100,000 machines to look for unprotected IP addresses . "
The arrest of " Axel G " solved the mystery of who hacked Valve and why .
Now all that remained was solving the other mystery on the project : Was Half - Life 2 going to be any fun to play ?
In early March the team would solve that mystery by playing through a rough version the game from start to finish .
Would the game come together like a masterpiece , or would it flounder , much like the team 's first crack at Half - Life ?
No one knew what to expect .
The fate of Half - Life 2 hung in the balance .
Oh My God ( Reprise )
Early March brought an important milestone on the project : the alpha play test .
In the fall of 2003 , the idea of playing through the entire game from start to finish seemed like an unattainable goal .
Now , thanks to months of hard work and perseverance , the Valve team was ready to put all 14 chapters of the game through a rigorous play test .
The entire company stopped what it was doing and played for an entire week .
Even Gabe 's dad , a retired Air Force officer , came in to play the game and provide some feedback .
A sequence inside the engine room of the Borealis was cut from the game .
As the team played through the game , they began to realize just how much had changed over the past three years .
The story no longer started on the icebreaker Borealis .
Instead , it started with Gordon arriving on a train at City 17's central station .
The Jet Ski , which never quite worked from a control perspective , had been changed to an airboat .
But the most significant change was made to the physics - manipulator gun .
In the original design , Gordon was n't supposed to acquire the gun until the latter stages of the game .
Early play tests , however , indicated that players particularly enjoyed manipulating objects in the environment .
So the team decided to give players access to the gun at an earlier point in the story .
The game ’s opening sequence now takes place inside a train station .
After the play test wrapped , Newell gathered the team to solicit feedback .
Was it fun ?
Was it revolutionary ?
Was it long enough ?
Did all the disparate elements fit together in the right way ?
Newell thought so , but he never trusts his own judgment .
( " I 'm the most negative person in the company , " he explains .
" The - world - is - going - to - end , all - life - is - going - to - cease - throughout - the - universe negative . " )
So he listened carefully to what the team had to say .
One by one they got up and praised the game .
" Guys were standing up and going , ' Oh my God , this is actually a great game ! ' "
Newell remembers .
Valve was on the right track -- there would be no need to redo the game .
Finally , there was light at the end of the tunnel .
" The fact that you could go from one end of the game to the other was a really big thing for us . "
Gabe Newell on the alpha playtest in March 2004
Of course , the game was still nowhere near done .
Levels were still incomplete , the enemy placement had yet to be finalized , and the pacing of the game needed to be reviewed with a fine - tooth comb .
The next step was to improve what Valve calls the game 's experiential density -- the amount of interactivity a player encounters in any given environment .
" We went through the game minute by minute and said , ' OK , what is the player doing right now ?
How long has it been since something cool happened ? ' "
Laidlaw says .
Valve knew it had months of tweaking and polishing to do before the game was done .
But Newell was confident the worst part of the development was over .
" The fact that you could go from one end of the game to the other was a really big thing for us , " he says .
" Then we knew it just had to get better -- but it was all there . "
The Home Stretch
John Guthrie walks into the office in July 2004 .
It 's a late - July morning at Valve , and designer John Guthrie walks into the lobby to start another long day at work .
The team is still deep in crunch mode , but there are signs the pressure is abating .
As Guthrie picks up his mail , he starts talking to another employee about how it will soon be time to cancel the laundry service provided by Valve .
( Time spent washing clothing is apparently time that could be spent working on the game . )
" It looks like we should be slowing down here pretty soon , " Guthrie tells the other Valver .
By now all the game content has been locked down .
Minor changes are being made , but the majority of the work involves bug testing and play testing the game again and again .
Guthrie currently spends at least eight hours a day playing through the game .
Based on the number of bugs in the system -- around 1,000 -- Newell predicts they could be done by sometime in mid-August .
But he 's quick to equivocate on that date because the physics gameplay is proving difficult to test .
It 's a huge step forward for the genre but a nightmare from a bug - testing perspective .
" You can really burn people out on projects like this ... sometimes they never come back . "
Gabe Newell
Still , the writing is on the wall : Half - Life 2 will be done in a matter of weeks .
The thought of finishing the game clearly excites Newell .
But on this July afternoon he also seems deeply concerned about his team .
" We absolutely have chewed people up on this project , " he admits while walking through the lobby .
" You can really burn people out on projects like this . "
Then he adds a rather ominous footnote : " Sometimes they never come back . "
Today Newell should be hanging from the rafters with glee because the game is a thousand bugs away from being finished .
Instead he seems almost miserable , quickly walking into his office and shutting the door tight after walking through the office .
Newell is clearly worried about the well - being of his team .
The ' Wall of Hearts ' helps the team keep track of bug testing for the Coast section of the game .
He also had something else on his mind : an expansive lawsuit between Valve and its publisher , VU Games , that has been going on for nearly two years .
In late 2002 Valve sued VU Games over claims that VU Games illegally sold Counter - Strike licenses to cybercafés around the world .
Later VU Games countersued Newell and Valve COO Scott Lynch ( plus their wives ) , asserting , among other things , that Valve was n't diligently developing Half - Life 2 and that Newell had once threatened to slow down the game 's development unless Vivendi paid Valve millions of dollars .
But the crux of Vivendi's lawsuit related to Steam , Valve 's digital distribution network .
VU Games claims that Steam undermines its rights to publish and distribute Valve games .
The technicalities of the case fill thousands of pages of claims , counterclaims , and depositions .
( Valve has a team of seven lawyers working on the case every day ; Newell says he 's spent millions in legal fees . )
But what worries Newell today is that VU Games might not ship Half - Life 2 until up to six months after it goes gold .
" They 've threatened us with holding Half - Life 2 for six months already , " Newell confirms .
The lawsuit against VU Games had clearly caused great consternation inside of Valve .
But the team knew it had to push forward and finish Half - Life 2 .
And by late September , it looked like the game 's development was finally coming to a close .
The Scanner Gets It
One of the cabals loads up a near finished version of Half - Life 2 .
" At this point , we 're standing around , saying , ' Do you have anything to do ?
Well , I do n't have anything to do , ' " Newell says as he walks the halls of Valve .
It 's September 30 , 2004 , and Half - Life 2 is nearly done .
A release candidate was sent to Vivendi on September 15 .
Now Valve is working to fix the final bugs that were found in that version .
There is other good news as well : Valve is beginning to sense that Vivendi may end up shipping the game this year , mostly due to intense pressure from retailers who think Half - Life 2 could become the best - selling PC game of all time .
" I 'd love to play a game that tells the story of Alyx and Dog , her pet robot . "
Gabe Newell on Valve ’s plans for the Half - Life 2 universe
Newell is already thinking about where Valve goes next .
One thing is for sure :
The company wo n't embark on another five - year project anytime soon .
" We need to do smaller and shorter projects at first to avoid burnout , " he says .
On that note , one cabal has already started work on what Newell refers to as the " ATI levels , " a series of single - player levels that will require a super - high - end graphics card to run .
Valve hopes to release those over Steam later this year .
Newell is hoping that the other cabals will move on to creating episodic single - player content that will be released in chunks over Steam .
One tentative plan calls for Valve to start developing an episodic game that lets players assume the role of Alyx Vance .
" I 'd love to play a game that tells the story of Alyx and Dog , her pet robot , " Newell says .
John Guthrie and his cabal work on testing a release candidate .
It turns out episodic content is just one of many projects in the works at Valve .
Also on the docket are new versions of mods like Counter - Strike and even an Xbox - - not an Xbox 2 -- version of Half - Life 2 .
But what excites
Newell more than anything else is the idea of mod makers using the Source engine to create new games , much like Half - Life birthed Counter - Strike and Day of Defeat .
" I firmly believe that our users will be able to make Half - Life 2 mods that a commercial company could n't make with 24 months of development and a $ 5 million budget , " he says .
And finally there is one other game on the horizon : Team Fortress 2 , which Newell says is far from a dead project .
So what 's the release date ?
" I 'm sure we will screw that up again , " he says with a sly grin .
" I can connect the dots and look at history at this point . "
A year after the September 30 date debacle , Newell can finally laugh about Valve 's history of missed release dates .
If anything , that may be the clearest sign yet that Half - Life 2 is nearly done .
Now all that stands between the game and its completion are a few final bugs .
And a piñata .
The Whack Heard Around the World
The scanner piñata awaits its fate in Valve ’s lobby .
September 30 , 2004 , comes and goes , and Half - Life 2 is n't quite done .
It 's now October 13 , and there are only a few dozen bugs left to fix .
What 's taking so long ?
The problem is that more bugs keep cropping up every day because of the unpredictable physics gameplay .
" We started telling people , ' OK , if we just stop testing we wo n't find anymore bugs and we can finally ship this thing , ' " Guthrie jokes as he sits at his desk and tests one of his maps for what must be the 10,000th time .
As the day wears on , the bug count keeps decreasing .
Newell , sensing that today might be the final day of development , begins reflecting on how this compares with the final hours on Half - Life .
" It 's like the difference between being a wide receiver and a running back , " he says .
" The first project was this total Hail Mary , catch - in - the - end - zone - with - no - time - left adrenaline rush .
This one was much more slamming away bit by bit , a few yards at a time . "
Finally , though , Valve is almost in the end zone .
A design cabal at Valve discuss one of the last remaining bugs .
On the night of October 13 , the team prepares a version of the game that everyone thinks could be the final one .
After a night of testing , both Valve and Vivendi are confident that the game is officially done -- no more bugs are in the database , and every employee is enrolled in Club Zero .
Newell sends an e-mail to the team to announce that more than five years of development has come to a close .
Half - Life 2 is done .
There 's a tremendous sense of relief .
And there 's excitement about what comes next : the ceremonial whacking of the piñata .
Valve initially had planned to whack the piñata at a restaurant on the night of Thursday , October 14 .
But on Thursday morning , the employees start pestering Newell to whack the piñata right away .
A mob even starts forming outside Newell 's office .
After five long years , the team can't bear to wait another six hours .
A photo from a cell phone captures the moment of impact .
At noon , Newell finally relents .
He sends out an e-mail to the team and tells everyone to meet him in the lobby in 15 minutes .
The employees dash out of their offices and head to the lobby .
Once they arrive , they see Newell firmly grasping a steel baton in his left hand .
He 's rhythmically tapping it against the palm of his right hand .
You get the sense that he 's really looking forward to eviscerating the scanner piñata .
The team forms a circle around the piñata and Newell stands up .
He grasps the baton with both hands , winds up , and lays a massive blow into the piñata .
As the baton connects , a thud resonates through the lobby .
The entire back of the piñata flies off .
Cameras flash .
Candies and other trinkets hit the cement floor .
And what 's left of the piñata hangs on a string , violently swaying back and forth .
With one whack , Gabe Newell has signaled the end of Half - Life 2's development .
And boy did it feel good .
Next : Newell hands the baton to Laidlaw to strike his own blow .
While Laidlaw winds up , Newell turns around and takes a good look at his assembled team .
You can tell he 's immensely proud of what they 've accomplished .
Newell says the game is exactly what he wanted it to be .
" I 'm less jittery than I was last time around , " he admits .
" We know Half - Life 2 is going to be a huge success .
Personally , I think it 's a much better game than the original . "
While the destruction of the scanner piñata marks the official end of the game 's development , Newell says his real reward will come after the game becomes a success .
" Sending off the final discs wo n't be the most exciting moment for me , " he later says in Valve 's conference room .
" For me that moment will come when I get to hand Yahn 's wife a big check and say , ' All those promises we made about building an exciting company and the value that your husband represents to us are true , ' " he says .
Newell surveys the damage from his first whack at the piñata .
The aftermath of Gabe ’s piñata smashing .
Once again , Newell begins expressing great concern about the well - being of the Valve team .
" I just feel a tremendous responsibility to take care of everyone at Valve , " he admits .
" You have to make sacrifices to work here but we want to continue to bring together the best people in the world to create the best games in the world . "
Coming from anyone else , a line like that would come off like human - resources gobbledygook .
But after Half - Life and Half - Life 2 , it 's hard not to credit Newell for delivering on that promise .
More than five years after it began , Half - Life 2's development is finally over .
Suddenly , the missed release dates , the crimes , the lawsuits , and the unending stress evaporate into the ether .
Those moments and their associated drama will become part of history , battle scars that the Valve team will bear as a celebration of the sacrifices they made .
But what will remain for posterity 's sake is something much more profound : A spectacular game on five CDs that , according to Newell , is a worthy sequel to one of the best PC games of all time .
Yes , at times the game 's development might have seemed cursed .
But maybe all those challenges were just tests -- tests to see how far Valve was willing to go to make Half - Life 2 all it could be .
Laidlaw takes his own whack at what ’s left of the scanner .
Now the cycle starts again .
There will be a next game , a new set of challenges , and yes , perhaps another release - date promise .
Or maybe not .
" I do n't think that 's ever going to happen again , " Newell says with a laugh .
" Gamers should trust us on quality issues , but we 've pretty much emptied the account when it comes to trust on release dates . "
Fans , you have officially been warned .

Formula 1 teams are scheduled to put the finishing touches to plans for a common car launch of their 2010 contenders on Thursday , with outfits looking to unveil their machines in Valencia in late January .
Members of the Formula One Teams ' Association ( FOTA ) are due to meet in Monaco later today to discuss their plans for next season - and on the agenda is the common car launch .
Mercedes - Benz GP CEO
Nick Fry said at the Motor Sport Business Forum that the idea had now received approval from the teams , with the finer details now due to be settled .
It is understood that the event will take place in Valencia in late January , prior to the first official 2010 test at the Spanish city 's nearby track a few days later .
Speaking about the matter on Thursday , Fry said : " I do n't want to go into too much detail about what the plans actually are , but we have agreed between all the teams to do a joint launch and we do wish to turn it into a proper event .
" We are getting a lot of help from the venue and investment in communication and marketing to do that .
I think I am going from here to a meeting this afternoon to discuss the subject .
" I would n't wish to spill the beans on what we are going to do , but it is going to be hugely innovative .
It is going to be a clear demonstration of how we are going to be working together .
We are not all going off and doing our own individual launches , so we can do something that is a lot more customer friendly . "
With Green Porno , Isabella Rossellini produced a series of shorts in which she , playing the part of various horny animals , taught audiences how insects and sea creatures went at it by dressing up and humping models .
She 's basically making advancements in education that make Maria Montessori look like an asshole .
Last night at a screening of Green Porno , my friend Chris tells me ( and now you ! ) she 's hoping to make a semi-prequel to the bizarre series , this time stepping back from actual reproduction and examining just how creatures get potential mates into their animal apartments in the first place :
So I went to a a screening of Green Porno last night and Isabella Rossalini was there to talk about it .
She said that on Monday she was going to Sundance to pitch them another series of shorts , this one about the seduction techniques of animals .
Also , she said she was working on an hour long documentary for one of the Discovery Channel channels , tentatively titled Manhattan Beasts .
No clue what Manhattan Beasts is all about , but I 'll still watch it as long as it involves Isabella Rossellini dressing up and humping something .

The Federal Reserve left its lending rates unchanged again on Wednesday , even as the central bank reiterated that the economy is on the mend .
That central bank decision came at the conclusion of a two - day meeting , with Fed officials voting unanimously to leave its federal funds rate at a range of 0 percent to 0.25 percent , keeping the prime rate at 3.25 .
Variable rate credit cards — which account for the majority of plastic — have annual percentage rates that are set using the prime rate .
The Fed led off its post - meeting statement in an upbeat fashion .
“ Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September suggests that economic activity has continued to pick up , ” the statement said .
They specifically pointed to improvements in financial markets and housing .
In other key portions of the Fed ’s statement , its language did n’t change at all from earlier statements — for example , when saying that the strength of the economic growth is n’t enough to warrant interest rate hikes .
The Federal Open Market Committee held the key lending rate close to zero , adding that it continues to expect the health of the economy to require “ exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period . ”
Although analysts had speculated that changes would involve that specific phrase — possibly in an attempt by the Fed to hint at when another rate hike might be expected — others predicted that the Fed would continue to be cautious with its wording .
That ’s because central bankers are aware that even slight shifts in their language carries the power to impact equity markets .
“ They ’re walking a really fine line here , so they do n’t want to spook anyone , ” says Keith Davis , research analyst with Farr , Miller and Washington in Washington , D.C .
The last change to the federal funds rate came in December 2008 ; as long as the Fed sees inflation as remaining subdued , it will leave the federal funds rate alone and will not be the cause of credit card rate changes .
Fed officials grow antsy
Although the Fed collectively decided to maintain interest rates at their existing levels , some central bank officials appear to be pushing for a change in the near future .
“ There are some people — voting members of the Fed — that are getting pretty antsy ” about hiking rates , Davis says .
These so - called hawkish Fed officials are concerned that higher rates are needed to head off any potential inflation as the economy rebounds .
At a speech in Chicago on September 25 , Fed Gov. Kevin Warsh — a voting member of the Fed ’s monetary policy committee — indicated that the next change to monetary policy may be “ accomplished with greater swiftness than is modern central bank custom . ”
Separately , Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenig , who will become a voting member of the policy setting committee next year , told an audience last month that rates should increase “ sooner rather than later . ”
( Note : Presidents of all 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks take part in these monetary policy meetings and can express their views , but they only hold seats — and thus a vote — on the Fed ’s policy - making committee on a rotating basis .
The Fed ’s Board of Governors , including chairman Ben Bernanke and Warsh , are always able to vote . )
Other officials , however , believe that the Fed should n’t begin raising rates until the employment situation in the United States improves .
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told Bloomberg Radio that the Fed ’s key lending rate can only rise after the unemployment rate begins to come down from its lofty levels .
“ You want some jobs growth and unemployment coming down .
That is a prerequisite ” for raising rates , Bullard said .
In September , the unemployment rate hit a 26 - year high of 9.8 percent .
Some forecasts predict the jobless rate rose again in October , with those numbers set for release on Nov. 6 .
There are some people — voting members of the Fed — that are getting pretty antsy ” about hiking rates .
Keith Davis , Research analyst
Credit card rates head higher
Regardless of the federal funds rate ’s lack of movement , credit card annual percentage rates are headed higher .
According to CreditCards.com data , the national average APR advanced to 12.64 percent on Oct. 29 from 12.59 percent six months earlier .
Davis points to a number of factors that could make lending more troublesome for banks : the Fed ’s eventual unwinding of programs that encourage the purchase of asset backed securities ( ABS ) , new accounting rules that will require banks to hold ( rather than lend ) more money and the Credit CARD
Act ’s restrictions on credit card fees .
“ All this stuff leads to the same conclusion for me : credit card rates are going to be higher for borrowers , ” Davis says .

‘N- Word ’ Sign Dogs Would - Be Tea Party Leader
Created : January 04 , 2010 13:04 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Dale Robertson , a Tea Party activist who operates TeaParty.org , is getting stung for an old photo — taken at the Feb. 27 , 2009 Tea Party in Houston — in which he holds a sign reading “ Congress = Slaveowner , Taxpayer = Niggar . ”
After the ResistNet listerv promoted “ Liberty Concerts ” to be held by TeaParty.org , a source passed on this photo of Robertson , after the jump .* *
Update : Josh Parker of the Houston Tea Party Society tells me that Robertson was booted out of the event for this sign .
Houston Tea Party
I emailed Robertson ’s group for comment , but have n’t heard back yet .
Here ’s the email that was sent from ResistNet to members of its list .
Tea Party Taking The Next Step
“ We are setting the tone for taking back America with Liberty Concerts .
We are not waiting until the first quarter of the year , we have already begun . ”
Dale Robertson , President and Founder of the Tea Party – TeaParty.org
‘ Liberty Concerts ’ is a venue designed to be the key to create a model for our Nation to Take Back America .
The Tea Party does not intend to waste their time simply rallying .
The Plan is to optimize the events , they will be fun and Citizens will be asked to run for office , with the focus of Restoring America , and thus , putting it on the Conservative track .
The goal is to shift attendees from being merely a presence at a rally , into involved Patriots recognizing the need to be engaged in the process of Self - Governance .
The Tea Party is gearing up for action .
Robertson has a developing strategy to bring the Republic back under the control of ‘ We The People . ’
He is asking for thousands of Patriots across America , to run for office .
Robertson stated : “ Even though the likelihood of their success is diminished by the lack of experience or financial support ; the knowledge will be invaluable for the next election cycle and a point of pride for the American People . ”
The Tea Party ’s number one imperative , is to have candidates on the ballot .
The second priority is to get out the vote , especially in Texas where Robertson lives and the home of over 800,000 members of the Tea Party ……….
Robertson is molding the Tea Party events to empower Citizens so they will make a difference in the November 2010 elections .
The ongoing tactics are to prioritize States , creating a durable model for ballot access , voter eligibility , precinct chair / county chairs , and candidate awareness .
The Tea Party is actively seeking candidates that represent Conservative Constitutional Values .
It appears the Major Parties ca n’t get in step with such a complex idea as Conservative Constitutional Values ; therefore , the Tea Party will make it easy for the Independent Parties to break the glass ceiling and get on the ballot .
The ‘ Liberty Concerts ’ event taking place in Stafford , Texas is a developing prototype , which when successful , will allow the Tea Party to create a thriving event not in months but days .
We will be quick on the draw , sure fired and ready to rock in a matter of only a few days .
This Tea Party formula will work against incredible odds and will be nothing short of a miracle , but Robertson believes with all his heart all the pieces will fall into place .
Transparency International has just released its 2009 Corruption Perceptions Index , the preeminent , annual study of governmental corruption levels around the world .
This time , they ’ve added a nice little interactive map–not much too it , besides the fact that mousing over the country gives you the numeric value .
But it does give you a great indication of what countries do well , relative to their neighbors and what countries are basically sinkholes of graft and fraud .
For example , Uruguay and Botswana do far better than the countries around them–no wonder that Botswana in particular is a prime example of economic development that works .
The CPI is a survey of surveys , which combines indexes found in 13 feeder studies with the expertise of academics who follow these issues .
( Experts are polled on questions like how well a country ’s courts work , and the effectiveness of its watch dog agencies . )
If you ’re new to the study , the most surprising thing will be how poorly the U.S. does , relative to its first world peers .
We ’re basically just a shade above some pretty dicey governments .
The reasons are complex , but you can point to the influence of lobbying on our lawmaking and the ongoing controversy over how we ’ve prosecuted the war on terror , among other things .

LA MACARENA , Colombia —
In this farm town once ruled by drug - running rebels , Mayor Eliecer Vargas wants to pave the dirt roads , install water pipes and build parks .
He wants to convince people that the government is on their side .
But hardly anyone living in and around La Macarena holds legal title to their land .
As a result , they pay no property taxes , rendering the town hall nearly bankrupt .
“ We should be taking in about 200 million pesos [ about $ 100,000 ] per year , ” Vargas said .
“ But there ’s no way to collect . ”
Here in the southern plains of Colombia where coca — the raw material for cocaine — has long been the main cash crop , the lack of land titles is more than just a tax concern :
It ’s a national security issue .
That ’s because Colombia ’s farm economy runs on credit .
Coca growers trying to switch from drugs to legal crops ca n’t buy seeds , fertilizer or machinery because they lack the land titles required to secure bank loans .
Many peasants have lived on their land for decades yet have the legal status of squatters .
This legal limbo makes it easier for drug traffickers — who are quick to provide start - up money — to convince them to grow coca and for guerrillas to recruit their sons and daughters into the war .
“ People here are in a state of transition and are only now beginning to have confidence in the state , ” said Eunice Ramirez , the government ’s human rights advocate in La Macarena , a town that was formally turned over to the guerrillas during three years of peace talks that ended in failure in 2002 .
“ But these bandits are still very influential . ”
Part of the problem is government bureaucracy .
Whether registering a business , signing up employees for social security or selling a car , doing things the legal way in Colombia and elsewhere in Latin America , can turn into expensive , nightmarish , 50 - step operations .
Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto has pointed out that a well - established system of property rights helped turn the United States and other Western nations into prosperous capitalist societies .
In developing countries , he says , the great masses of poor people actually sit atop billions of dollars in assets but are unable to leverage this wealth because of their informal status .
“ The existing legal system in the Third World conspires against them , ” De Soto said in a recent PBS documentary .
Not only do land titles help raise property values , but they formalize the social contract between the state and its citizens — no small thing in areas like La Macarena where guerrillas and drug traffickers have long held sway .
For the past two years , La Macarena and nearby towns have been the focus of a two - year - old “ consolidation plan ” that has brought together troops , drug warriors and aid agencies in an effort to drive out the rebels , undermine the cocaine trade and bolster the legal economy .
Alvaro Balcazar , who manages the program , fears that the security patrols , new schools and crop substitution programs may fall short unless local peasants are brought into the legal system .
“ Land titling is what ’s going to make the difference in whether or not we can consolidate security and the rule of law , ” he said .
Yet over the past two years , Balcazar admits that he does n’t know of a single case in which a small land - holder has been awarded title to his land .
And although plots can be bought and sold with informal documents , these papers are of no use when applying for loans .
Peasant farmers are not alone in their frustration .
Despite his political connections , Vargas , the mayor of La Macarena , has been unable to secure title to his land — a 250 - acre cattle ranch he inherited from his father .
“ I ’ve struggled for 15 years and have yet to achieve this dream , ” Vargas said as he sat behind the desk of his Spartan office just off the town ’s main square .
In addition , efforts to build health clinics and roads and to put up cell phone antennas to connect rural communities to the outside world often run aground amid uncertainties over who owns the land .
“ It ’s a vicious circle in which the lack of land titles blocks development , ” Balcazar said .
Even the Colombian army has become embroiled in disputes with La Macarena residents over a military base built on the edge of town on land of disputed ownership .
Guillermo Giraldo grows mangoes , guavas and avocados on nine acres next door to the base .
He ’s just the kind of law - abiding small producer the Colombian government would like to see flourish .
But without title to his land , Giraldo has no chance for bank loans to upgrade his farm .
Now , after five years of struggling , Giraldo points to the weeds taking over his fields and admits that he ’s thinking of selling out .
Post office hostage drama in US state of Virginia ends
The suspected hostage taker told police he had a military background A man suspected of taking hostages in a post office in the US state of Virginia has been arrested after a stand - off lasting several hours , police say .
Authorities in Wytheville persuaded Warren Taylor to give himself up and release three people he was holding .
Mr Taylor was reported to have entered the post office pushing a wheelchair and claiming to be carrying explosives .
He initially fired shots from the building but no - one was reported to have been injured .
" We 're just grateful it ended peacefully , " the Associated Press news agency quoted Police Sgt Michael Conroy as saying .
" This is just the best outcome we could hope for . "
Earlier reports said the suspect was holding five people but some of those were later accounted for .
A witness told CNN that he and two other employees had escaped as the situation was unfolding .
Sgt Conroy of the Virginia State Police said Mr Taylor entered the post office at about 1430 local time ( 1930 GMT ) .
Police negotiated with him by telephone but he made no demands other than a request for a pizza , said Pete Rendina , spokesman for the US Postal Inspection Service .
Mr Taylor is reported to have told police he had a military background .
' Explosives device ' Local media reported the hostage taker was in a wheelchair , although witnesses later said they saw him walking inside the building .
He emerged from the post office in the chair .

The town 's mayor , Trent Crewe , told reporters police had been " acting on the assumption there is an explosive device of some kind in some location " .
Police had cordoned off the scene and advised people to evacuate homes and businesses in the immediate area .
Local businesswoman Susan Holman told the Wytheville Enterprise newspaper police had warned the man had " enough explosives to take out the whole block " .
However Sgt Conroy said no explosives had yet been found on the man or in the building .

From the party that brought you “ death panels , ” meet — well — just “ death . ”
Republicans and private health insurance firms are aghast at the inclusion of a so - called “ public option ” in House and Senate healthcare overhaul bills .
None more so than Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , who ’s charged with leading resistance in the Senate .
In an interview Wednesday revealed by ThinkProgress , McConnell declared that the government insurance option would lead to government takeover of the entire healthcare system .

“ I think if you have any kind of government insurance program , you ’re going to be stuck with it and it will lead us in the direction of the European style , you know , sort of British - style , single payer , government run system , ” McConnell remarked .
“ And those systems are known for delays , denial of care and , you know , if your particular malady does n’t fit the government regulation , you do n’t get the medication .
Then , he added , “ And it may cost you your life .
I mean , we do n’t want to go down that path . ”
Republicans are n’t the only party throwing around the d-word , however .
Democratic Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - FL ) recently took fire over comments on the House floor in which he declared that the Republican health care plan involved hoping for patients to “ die quickly . ”

“ NASA has not been involved in any manipulation of climate data used in the annual GISS global temperature analysis .
The analysis utilizes three independent data sources provided by other agencies .
Quality control checks are regularly performed on that data .
The analysis methodology as well as updates to the analysis are publicly available on our website .
The agency is confident of the quality of this data and stands by previous scientifically based conclusions regarding global temperatures . ”

Dr. Hansen writes on his website :
… if we , in effect , destroy Creation , passing on to our children , grandchildren , and the unborn a situation out of their control , the contrarians who work to deny and confuse will not be the principal culprits .
The contrarians will be remembered as court jesters .
There is no point to joust with court jesters .
They will always be present .
They will continue to entertain even if the Titanic begins to take on water .
Their role and consequence is only as a diversion from what is important .
Yet here he is , jousting with the biggest jester of them all .

The girl who sneezes 12,000 times a day has doctors baffled
Lauren Johnson is a typical 12 - year - old girl - except that she can't stop sneezing .
It is so bad that she sneezes up to 20 times a minute , or 12,000 times a day .
The non -stop sneezing began two weeks ago when Lauren from Virginia in the U.S. caught a cold .
Lauren can't go to school and is even struggling to eat .
The sneeze : Lauren Johnson is like this 12,000 times a day
The only relief she gets is when she falls asleep each night .
Her condition has left doctors baffled .
During a five - minute interview on the Today Show in the U.S. Lauren sneezed hundreds of times , her speech interrupted every few seconds .
The 12 - year - old - dubbed the ' Gesundheit Girl ' said : ' I can't stop .
' I thought it would n't last this long but it 's been two weeks now . '
She said she is not in pain - simply in discomfort .
' It 's primarily the sneezing , ' she added .
' Maybe I 'll get a raw nose from the tissues but that 's it . '
' Miserable ' : Lauren with her mother Lynn Johnson on the Today Show in a bid to find someone who might be able to cure her non-stop sneezing
One expert believes she is suffering from a syndrome known as ' machine gun sneezing ' , in which victims sneeze incessantly .
Lauren told the Today Show that she felt ' miserable ' .
' It 's been a long two weeks .
I 've seen my friends here and there but I have n't been to school . '
Her mother , Lynn Johnson , has spent the past week going to a variety of doctors looking for a diagnosis and relief for her daughter - and has now gone on television in a bid to find a cure or a specialist who can help .
They have tried 11 different medications so far .
' Life for her has stopped .
Everybody is baffled .
Nobody really knows how to treat it , ' Ms Johnson said .
She added : ' It turns off when she sleeps .
Only in a deep REM sleep it turns off . '
Bless you :
As Lauren sneezes again her mother explains that they have tried everything from conventional medicine to hypnosis therapy
They tried hypnosis but it did not work .
Lauren has also seen a therapist in case a psychological factor is triggering the physical reaction .
She has been unable to go to school because it puts other students off - and she struggles to eat between sneezes .
Lauren told a local news website : ' The hard part is missing school and when people stare .
' It 's very hard . '
Doctors believe it may be that she is suffering from an ' irretractable psychogenic disorder ' that could be triggered by stress .
Her mother added : ' There 's less than 40 cases ever documented ever in the entire world .
Nobody really knows how to treat it , what 's going to work , and even in the cases where it might have worked or turned the sneezing off for awhile , a lot of times it comes back again and then you 're right back to where you started . '
Neither Lauren nor her mother say she is stressed out .
Her sneezing is not contagious .

' What I saw was a bunch of filled - in trenches with people 's arms and legs sticking out of them .
For all I know , we could have killed thousands '
On February 25 1991 the war correspondent Leon Daniel arrived at a battlefield at the tip of the neutral zone between Iraq and Saudi Arabia .
Daniel was one of a pool of journalists who had been held back from witnessing action the previous day , when Desert Storm 's ground war had been launched .
There , right where he was standing , 8,400 soldiers of the US First Infantry Division - known as the Big Red One - had attacked an estimated 8,000 Iraqis with 3,000 Abrams main battle tanks , Bradley fighting vehicles , Humvees and armoured personnel carriers .
Daniel had seen the aftermath of modest firefights in Vietnam .
" The bodies would be stacked up like cordwood , " he recalled .
Yet this ferocious attack had not produced a single visible body .
It was a battlefield without the stench of urine , faeces , blood and bits of flesh .
Daniel wondered what happened to the estimated 6,000 Iraqi defenders who had vanished .
" Where are the bodies ? " he finally asked the First Division 's public affairs officer , an army major .
" What bodies ? " the major replied .
Months later , Daniel and the world would learn why the dead had eluded eyewitnesses , cameras and video footage .
Thousands of Iraqi soldiers , some of them firing their weapons from first world war - style trenches , had been buried by ploughs mounted on Abrams tanks .
The tanks had flanked the lines so that tons of sand from the plough spoil had funnelled into the trenches .
Just behind the tanks , straddling the trench line , came Bradleys pumping machine - gun bullets into Iraqi troops .
" I came through right after the lead company , " said Colonel Anthony Moreno .
" What you saw was a bunch of buried trenches with people 's arms and legs sticking out of them .
For all I know , we could have killed thousands . "
Two other brigades used the same tank - mounted ploughs and Bradleys to obliterate an estimated 70 miles of defensive trenches .
They moved swiftly .
The operation had been rehearsed repeatedly , weeks before , on a mile - long trench line built according to satellite photographs .
The finishing touches were made by armoured combat earth - movers ( ACEs ) .
These massive bulldozers , with armoured cockpits impervious to small - arms fire , smoothed away any hint of the carnage .
" A lot of guys were scared , but I enjoyed it , " said PFC Joe Queen , an ACE driver awarded a Bronze Star for his performance in the battle .
What happened in the neutral zone that day is a metaphor for the art of war in an era when domestic politics is often more important than the predictable outcome on the field of battle .
In 1991 American voters rallied behind President George Bush Sr for the seemingly bloodless confrontation with Saddam Hussein .
Neatly hidden from a small army of journalists was the reality of war - a reality that can make these very same voters recoil in disapproval .
His son is likely to use the same sort of tactics to blind one of the world 's freest and most influential media establishments .
Running the show for President George Bush is the man who manipulated global perceptions of the first Gulf war for Bush Sr : Dick Cheney .
Then defence secretary and now vice - president , Cheney is likely to buffalo the New York Times , the Associated Press , CNN and others ready to bend to US government censorship .
According to White House officials , no final decisions have been made by Bush , Cheney and current defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
" We 're still negotiating with the media , " said one administration official .
But Bush has already implemented ground rules that require journalists to give up their mobile and satellite phones to military commanders who would control the movements of these so - called pool reporters during Desert Storm II .
If the final rules , organised by the Pentagon , are anything like the pool system designed by Bush Sr and Cheney in 1991 , the world will be given a cloudy mixture of video footage and misinformation that will fog the reality of war .
Daniel , the wire service veteran , was part of the 1991 pool system .
About 150 American journalists , photographers and film crews were scattered among attacking units .
Their reports were supposed to be fed to a rear headquarters and then shared by hundreds of journalists from around the world .
" They would n't let us see anything , " said Daniel , who has seen just about everything there is to see in war .
Not a single eyewitness account , photograph or strip of video of combat between 400,000 soldiers in the desert was produced by this battalion of professional observers .
Most of the grisly photos from Desert Storm seen today were the work of independent journalists who raced to the " Highway of Death " north of Kuwait , where war planes had destroyed thousands of vehicles in which Iraqi soldiers had fled after the start of the ground war .
The area was free of the military handlers who routinely interrupted interviews to chastise soldiers into changing their statements while reporters stood back , or forcibly removed film from cameras that captured images deemed offensive by an Army public affairs officer .
Cheney , brimming with contempt and hostility for the press , saw journalists as critics of the military who must be contained .
" Frankly , I looked on it as a problem to be managed , " he said after the war .
" The information function was extraordinarily important .
I did not have a lot of confidence that I could leave that to the press . "
Since being brought into government as an intern by Donald Rumsfeld , then a congressman , Cheney has spent most of his adult life fencing with the media and learning its strengths and weaknesses .
A stunning victory in 1991 was the media 's agreement to permit the Pentagon to censor journalists ' reports before they were printed or broadcast .
In the past the Pentagon had left censorship up to individual reporters .
During 10 years of war in Vietnam , not one journalist violated self - imposed rules against reporting , for example , specific locations of attacks .
As a result , the conventional wisdom was that the government was not violating the First Amendment to the Constitution : that Congress " will make no law to abridge [. . .] freedom of the press " .
Only a handful of journalists went to federal court to challenge the government censorship imposed by Bush , Cheney and Colin Powell , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff .
The court ruled the suit moot - the war was over - but invited the press to try again so that the issue might be settled .
It never was .
The media was more duped than cowed .
Cheney won over some people with the promise that places in the pool would give them an advantage over competitors .
For instance , a Washington Post pool reporter kept to himself all details of a US Marine operation for exclusive use by the Post and , later , a book .
For independent journalists , life was much more difficult .
More than 70 operating outside the pool system were arrested , detained , threatened at gunpoint or chased from the front line .
Army public affairs officers made nightly visits to hotels and restaurants in Hafir al Batin , a Saudi town on the Iraqi border .
Reporters and photographers would bolt from the table .
The slower ones were arrested .
But when the ground war started , the mighty were hamstrung along with the mediocre .
The Associated Press , which benefited most from a system that turned all journalists into wire service reporters , sent photographer Scott Applewhite to cover victims of a Scud missile attack near Dahran .
The warhead had hit an American tent , killing 25 army reservists and wounding 70 .
It was the single biggest loss to Saddam Hussein during Desert Storm .
Applewhite , an accredited pool member , was stopped by US Army military police .
When he objected , they punched and handcuffed him while ripping the film from his cameras .
Cheney made sure it was just as bad for the rest of the pool .
When the ground war started , the defence secretary declared a " media blackout " , blocking all reports .
After the war , General Norman Schwarzkopf and his aides revealed that the blackout was ordered because of fears that Saddam would use chemical weapons on allied forces .
Potential news reports of soldiers writhing in agony from a cloud of sarin nerve gas had spooked the president and his commanders .
" No pictures of that , " said General Richard Neal , who directed ground operations during the war .
As a result , reports and film were delayed or " lost " by military commanders so that most of it arrived too late for most deadlines .
Neal and Schwarzkopf provided the bulk of briefings and videos in Saudi Arabia , and these were the first reports to filter through ; many became the basis of the most lasting perceptions of Desert Storm .
Gun camera footage always showed empty bridges or aircraft hangars being destroyed by " smart bombs " - laser - guided munitions that never struck a single human .
But only 6 % of the munitions used against Iraq could be guided to a target .
Over 94 % were far less surgical during the 30 - day air war , which often saw 400 sorties a day .
Those bombs depended on gravity and variable winds , and were capable of causing " collateral damage " to nearby unarmed civilians .
The global television audience was awed by Tomahawk cruise missiles roaring from the decks of US Navy warships at sea .
But less than 10 % hit their targets .
The missile 's accuracy depends on landmarks that can be spotted by an on - board camera that can shift the weapon 's direction .
But the featureless desert led many Tomahawks to wander away like so many lost patrols , according to Pentagon studies .
Schwarzkopf conducted televised briefings about the allied counterattack on Saddam 's Scud missiles that had terrorised Saudi Arabia as well as Israel .
Yet an air force study after the war showed that Iraq had ended up with as many Scud launchers as it had possessed before the war started .
A murky Schwarzkopf video showed the destruction of what seemed to be a Scud launcher , but later turned out to be a bombed oil truck .
Controlling the briefings , the videos and the press during Desert Storm was an extension of US policy started by President Ronald Reagan and his defence chief , Caspar Weinberger .
It was Weinberger , an anglophile , who admired Margaret Thatcher 's manipulation of the media during the Falklands war , which led directly to her political revival in 1982 .
A year later , Weinberger took control of the US media when Reagan found himself in a deepening hole in Lebanon .
On October 23 1983 , 241 US Marines died after a truck laden with explosives destroyed a makeshift barracks at Beirut airport .
The massacre suddenly focused attention on the ageing actor 's foreign policy decisions as the reports and pictures showed the removal of American bodies .
Within 48 hours of the bombing , the president dispatched the first wave of 5,000 American troops to Grenada in the Caribbean .
But the invasion angered Thatcher .
Grenada was linked to the UK as a member of the Commonwealth .
Only the previous week , Washington had informed London that there was no need for outside intervention , as local political turmoil was likely to play itself out without further bloodshed .
Geoffrey Howe , Britain 's foreign minister , was explicit .
" The invasion of Grenada was clearly designed to divert attention , " Howe said in an interview .
" You had disaster in Beirut ; now triumph in Grenada .
' Do n't look there , ' " he said , gesturing with his forefinger , " ' look over here . ' "
Reporters were banned from Grenada .
Those who tried to land on the island , such as Morris Thompson of Newsday , were arrested and imprisoned on US ships offshore .
All details and videos were supplied by military reporters and photographers at Pentagon briefings .
The media barons howled , but little changed .
When Bush Sr invaded Panama in 1989 , journalists were once again banned .
Democratic congressman Charles Rangle of New York still insists that as many as 5,000 civilians in Panama City were killed by US invaders .
But there are no pictures , no eyewitness accounts .
The invasion of Panama and the arrest of Manuel Noriega were , like Desert Storm later , something of a political triumph for Bush .
But the reality of that particular war asserted itself during a televised briefing by the president .
It was just at the end of the session , when Bush was wisecracking with reporters , that most networks split their screens to show the arrival of dead US soldiers from Panama .
Bush was caught bantering as flag - draped coffins arrived at an air force base in Dover , Delaware - a military mortuary .
Later that week , Bush ordered the press banned from covering the arrival ceremonies for the fallen .
President Clinton continued the ban .
And his successor , President George Bush , also wants to keep the dead out of the national limelight .
· Patrick J Sloyan 's reporting on the war after the end of Desert Storm won the Pulitzer prize for international reporting in 1992 .
The " Public Money - Public Code " campaign , as well as the " REUSE Initiative " made me notice that the FSFE is an organization which supports the same ideals that I do .
I want to help them do more great things , and so now I am proud FSFE supporter .

From the oral argument transcript today in Briscoe v. Virginia , a funny moment in the argument of University of Michigan law professor Richard Friedman :
MR. FRIEDMAN : I think that issue is entirely orthogonal to the issue here because the Commonwealth is acknowledging –
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS : I ’m sorry .
Entirely what ?
MR. FRIEDMAN : Orthogonal .
Right angle .
Unrelated .
Irrelevant .
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS : Oh .
JUSTICE SCALIA :
What was that adjective ?
I liked that .
MR. FRIEDMAN : Orthogonal .
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS : Orthogonal .
MR. FRIEDMAN : Right , right .
JUSTICE SCALIA : Orthogonal , ooh .
( Laughter . )
JUSTICE KENNEDY : I knew this case presented us a problem .
( Laughter . )
MR. FRIEDMAN : I should have — I probably should have said –
JUSTICE SCALIA : I think we should use that in the opinion .
( Laughter . )
MR. FRIEDMAN : I thought — I thought I had seen it before .
JUSTICE SCALIA :
Or the dissent .
( Laughter . )
MR. FRIEDMAN : That is a bit of professorship creeping in , I suppose .
I think Friedman should have explained “ vectors with a dot product of zero , ” but I guess that would have been overly technical .
If you ’re curious , the Supreme Court has never used the word “ orthogonal ” in a written opinion .
It has usually appeared in the federal reports in patent cases , although it occasionally surfaces elsewhere .
See , e.g. , United States v. Harris , 491 F.3d 440 ( DC Cir. 2007 ) ( “ This test is fact - intensive , and the facts at issue are often orthogonal to those explored at trial . ” ) .
Historian and writer Tariq Ali and Professor Noam Chomsky speak in London 29 October 2009 on U.S. hypocrisy toward Iran , U.S. occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan , the Israeli occupation of Palestine , the U.S. role as Israel ’s enabler and ‘ mafia godfather ’ , Palestinian leadership ’s ‘ collaboration ’ with the U.S. and Israel against a ‘ solution ’ , international law , the hopes for peace in the near future and the double game the Obama Administration plays with its rhetoric and contrary actions .
Mr. Ali begins speaking around the 7:00 mark , Prof Chomsky around the 21:00 mark and a Q&A follows where he suggests a “ no - state solution ” as “ the best solution for the whole world ” .

As civilised people across the world breathed a sigh of relief to see the back of former U.S. president George W. Bush , top American intellectual Noam Chomsky warned against assuming or expecting significant changes in the basis of Washington ’s foreign policy under President Barack Obama .
During two lectures organised by the School of Oriental and African Studies ( SOAS ) in London , Chomsky cited numerous examples of the driving doctrines behind U.S. foreign policy since the end of World War II .
“ As Obama came into office , Condoleezza Rice predicted that he would follow the policies of Bush ’s second term , and that is pretty much what happened , apart from a different rhetorical style , ” said
“ But it is wise to attend to deeds , not rhetoric .
Deeds commonly tell a different story , ” he added .
“ There is basically no significant change in the fundamental traditional conception that we if can control Middle East energy resources , then we can control the world , ” explained Chomsky .
Chomsky said that a leading doctrine of U.S. foreign policy during the period of its global dominance is what he termed as “ the Mafia principle . ”
“ The Godfather does not tolerate ‘ successful defiance ’ .
It is too dangerous .
It must therefore be stamped out so that others understand that disobedience is not an option , ” said Chomsky .
Because the U.S. sees “ successful defiance ” of Washington as a “ virus ” that will “ spread contagion , ” he explained .
Iran
The U.S. had feared this “ virus ” of independent thought from Washington by Tehran and therefore acted to overthrow the Iranian parliamentary democracy in 1953 .
“ The goal in 1953 was to retain control of Iranian resources , ” said Chomsky .
However , “ in 1979 the [ Iranian ] virus emerged again .
The U.S. at first sought to sponsor a military coup ; when that failed , it turned to support Saddam Hussein ’s merciless invasion [ of Iran ] . ”
“ The torture of Iran continued without a break and still does , with sanctions and other means , ” said Chomsky .
“ The U.S. continued , without a break , its torture of Iranians , ” he stressed .
Nuclear attack
Chomsky mocked the idea presented by mainstream media that a future - nuclear - armed Iran may attack already - nuclear - armed Israel .
“ The chance of Iran launching a missile attack , nuclear or not , is about at the level of an asteroid hitting the earth — unless , of course , the ruling clerics have a fanatic death wish and want to see Iran instantly incinerated along with them , ” said Chomsky , stressing that this is not the case .
Chomsky further explained that the presence of U.S. anti-missile weapons in Israel are really meant for preparing a possible attack on Iran , and not for self - defence , as it is often presented .
“ The systems are advertised as defense against an Iranian attack .
But … the purpose of the U.S. interception systems , if they ever work , is to prevent any retaliation to a U.S. or Israeli attack on Iran — that is , to eliminate any Iranian deterrent , ” said Chomsky .
Iraq
Chomsky reminded the audience of America ’s backing of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein during and even after Iraq ’s war with Iran .
“ The Reaganite love affair with Saddam did not end after the [ Iran - Iraq ] war .
In 1989 , Iraqi nuclear engineers were invited to the United States , then under Gorge Bush I , to receive advanced weapons ’ training , ” said Chomsky .
This support continued while Saddam was committing atrocities against his own people , until he fell out of U.S. favour when in 1990 he invaded Kuwait , an even closer alley of Washington .
“ In 1990 , Saddam defied , or more likely misunderstood orders , and he quickly shifted from favourite friend to the reincarnation of Hitler , ” Chomsky added .
Then the people of Iraq were subjected to “ genocidal ” U.S. - backed sanctions .
Chomsky explained that although the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 , which was launched under many false pretexts and lies , was a ” major crime ” , many critics of the invasion — including Obama — viewed it as merely as “ a mistake ” or a “ strategic blunder ” .
“ It ’s probably what the German general staff was telling Hitler after Stalingrad , ” he said
“ There ’s nothing principled about it .
It was n’t a strategic blunder : it was a major crime , ” he added .
Chomsky credited the holding of elections in Iraq in 2005 to popular Iraqi demand , despite initial U.S. objection .
The US military , he argued , could kill as many Iraqi insurgents as it wished , but it was more difficult to shoot at non-violent protesters in the streets out on the open , which meant Washington at times had to give in to public Iraqi pressure .
But despite being pressured to announce a withdrawal from Iraq , the U.S. continues to seek a long term presence in the country .
The U.S. mega-embassy in Baghdad is to be expanded under Obama , noted Chomsky .
Optimism
Chomsky stressed that public pressure in the ‘ West ’ can make a positive difference for people suffering from the aggression of ‘ Western ’ governments .
“ There is a lot of comparison between opposition to the Iraq war with opposition to the Vietnam war , but people tend to forget that at first there was almost no opposition to the Vietnam war , ” said Chomsky .
“ In the Iraq war , there were massive international protests before it officially stated … and it had an effect .
The United Sates could not use the tactics used in Vietnam : there was no saturation bombing by B - 52s , so there was no chemical warfare — [ the Iraq war was ] horrible enough , but it could have been a lot worse , ” he said .
“ And furthermore , the Bush administration had to back down on its war aims , step by step , ” he added .
“ It had to allow elections , which it did not want to do : mainly a victory for non-Iraqi protests .
They could kill insurgents ; they could n’t deal hundreds of thousands of people in the streets .
Their hands were tied by the domestic constraints .
They finally had to abandon — officially at least — virtually all the war aims , ” said Chomsky .
“ As late as November 2007 , the U.S. was still insisting that the ‘ Status of Forces Agreement ’ allow for an indefinite U.S. military presence and privileged access to Iraq ’s resources by U.S. investors — well they did n’t get that on paper at least .
They had to back down .
OK , Iraq is a horror story but it could have been a lot worse , ” he said
“ So yes , protests can do something .
When there is no protest and no attention , a power just goes wild , just like in Cambodia and northern Louse , ” he added .
Turkey
Chomsky said that Turkey could become a “ significant independent actor ” in the region , if it chooses to .
“ Turkey has to make some internal decisions : is it going to face west and try to get accepted by the European Union or is it going to face reality and recognise that Europeans are so racist that they are never going to allow it in ? , ” said Chomsky .
The Europeans “ keep raising the barrier on Turkish entry to the E.U. , ” he explained .
But Chomsky said Turkey did become an independent actor in March 2003 when it followed its public opinion and did not take part in the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq .
Turkey took notice of the wishes of the overwhelming majority of its population , which opposed the invasion .
But ‘ New Europe ’ was led by Berlusconi of Italy and Aznar of Spain , who rejected the views of their populations — which strongly objected to the Iraq war — and preferred to follow Bush , noted Chomsky .
So , in that sense Turkey was more democratic than states that took part in the war , which in turn infuriated the U.S. .
Today , Chomsky added , Turkey is also acting independently by refusing to take part in the U.S. - Israeli military exercises .
Fear factor
Chomsky explained that although ‘ Western ’ government use “ the maxim of Thucydides ” ( ‘ the strong do as they wish , and the weak suffer as they must ’ ) , their peoples are hurled via the “ fear factor ” .
Via cooperate media and complicit intellectuals , the public is led to believe that all the crimes and atrocities committed by their governments is either “ self defence ” or “ humanitarian intervention ” .
NATO
Chomsky noted that Obama has escalated Bush ’s war in Afghanistan , using NATO .
NATO is also seen as reinforcing U.S. control over energy supplies .
But the U.S. also used NATO to keep Europe under control .
“ From the earliest post - World War days , it was understood that Western Europe might choose to follow an independent course , ” said Chomsky .
” NATO was partially intended to counter this serious threat , ” he added .
Middle East oil
Chomsky explained that Middle East oil reserves were understood to be “ a stupendous source of strategic power ” and “ one of the greatest material prizes in world history , ” the most “ strategically important area in the world , ” in Eisenhower ’s words .
Control of Middle East oil would provide the United States with “ substantial control of the world . ”
This meant that the U.S. “ must support harsh and brutal regimes and block democracy and development ” in the Middle East .
Somalia
Chomsky tackled the origins of the Somali piracy issue .
“ Piracy is not nice , but where did it come from ? ”
Chomsky explained that one of the immediate reasons for piracy is European counties and others are simply “ destroying Somalia ’s territorial waters by dumping toxic waste — probably nuclear waste — and also by overfishing . ”
“ What happens to the fishermen in Somalia ?
They become pirates .
And then we ’re all upset about the piracy , not about having created the situation , ” said Chomsky .
Chomsky went on to cite another example of harming Somalia .
“ One of the great achievements of the war on terror , which was greatly hailed in the press when it was announced , was closing down an Islamic charity — Barakat — which was identified as supporting terrorists .
“ A couple of months later … the [ U.S. ] government quietly recognised that they were wrong , and the press may have had a couple of lines about it — but meanwhile , it was a major blow against Somalia .
Somalia does n’t have much of an economy but a lot of it was supported by this charity : not just giving money but running banks and businesses , and so on .
“ It was a significant part of the economy of Somalia … closing it down … was another contributing factor to the breaking down of a very weak society … and there are other examples . ”
Darfur
Chomsky also touched on Sudan ’s Darfur region .
“ There are terrible things going on in Darfur , but in comparison with the region they do n’t amount to a lot unfortunately — like what ’s going on in eastern Congo is incomparably worse than in Darfur .
“ But Darfur is a very popular topic for Western humanists because you can blame it on an enemy – you have to distort a lot but you can blame it on ‘ Arabs ’ , ‘ bad guys ’ , ” he explained .
“ What about saving eastern Cong where maybe 20 times as many people have been killed ?
Well , that gets kind of tricky … for people who… are using minerals from eastern Congo that obtained by multinationals sponsoring militias which slaughter and kill and get the minerals , ” he said .
Or the fact that Rwanda is simply the worst of the many agents and it is a U.S. alley , he added .
Goldstone ’s Gaza report
Chomsky appeared to have agreed with Israel that the Goldstone report on the Gaza war was bias , only he saw it as biased in favour of Israel .
The Goldstone report had acknowledged Israel ’s right to self - defence , although it denounced the method this was conducted .
Chomsky stressed that the right to self - defence does not mean resorting to military force before “ exhausting peaceful means ” , something Israel did not even contemplate doing .
In fact , Chomsky points out , it was Israel who broke the ceasefire with Hamas and refused to extend it , as continuing the siege of Gaza itself is an act of war .
As for the current stalled Mideast peace process , Chomsky said that despite adopting a tougher tone towards Israel than that of Bush , Obama made no real effort to pressure Israel to live up to its obligations .
In the absence of the threat of cutting U.S. aid for Israel , there is no compelling reason why Tel Aviv should listen to Washington .
What can be done ?
Chomsky stressed that despite all the obstacles , public pressure can and does make a difference for the better , urging people to continue activism and spreading knowledge .
“ There is no reason to be pessimistic , just realistic . ”
Chomsky noted that public opinion in the U.S. and Britain is increasingly becoming more aware of the crimes committed by Israel .
“ Public opinion is shifting substantially . ”
And this is where a difference can be made , because Israel will not change its policies without pressure from the ‘ West ’ .
“ There is a lot to do in Western countries … primarily in the U.S. ”
Chomsky also stressed the importance of taking legal action in ‘ Western ’ countries against companies breaking international law via illegitimate dealings with Israel , citing the possible involvement of British Gas in Israeli theft of natural gas off the coast of Gaza , as one example that should be investigated .
In conclusion of one of the lectures , Chomsky quoted Antonio Gramsci who famously called for “ pessimism of the intellect , optimism of the will . ”

Hey , remember Pyro , the villainous X - Men mutant with fire powers ?
If so , perhaps you will also recall that he could n't actually create fire , only control it , so he had to wear flamethrowing devices around his wrists that allowed him to shoot fire at his enemies .
Well , someone went ahead and built them , in real life .
" The Prometheus Device , " ( which he says is Version 3 of " The Pyro System " ) was designed specifically to emulate the mutant 's powers , and admittedly it looks freaking awesome .
There are even instructions for building your own Pyro devices , which I DO NOT IN ANY WAY RECOMMEND as you will probably end up lighting everything around you on fire , including yourself .

Fred Thompson , the actor and former Republican Senator , told listeners of his radio show Thursday that the war in Afghanistan is “ already lost , ” and put the blame on President Barack Obama ’s delays in making a decision on a troop surge for the war effort .
Thompson ’s salvo “ seem[s ] to lay the groundwork for Republican opposition to further American engagement in Afghanistan , ” suggests Ben Smith at Politico , but the former presidential candidate ’s words have roiled some critics , who note that , during the Bush administration , Thompson was a fierce opponent of those who painted the war effort negatively .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It ’s becoming increasingly apparent with every passing day that it really does n’t matter how President Obama divides the Afghan baby , how he splits the difference between [ Gen. Stanley ] McChrystal and [ Vice President Joe ]
Biden , because the war in Afghanistan has been lost , ” Thompson said on his radio show , The Fred Thompson Show .
“ It did n’t have to be that way , it does n’t have to be that way , but that ’s the way it is . ”
Thompson took up a now - familiar theme among critics of the Obama administration ’s foreign policy , attacking the White House for taking its time with a decision on a troop increase for the war effort .
“ This delay will not in and of itself do irreparable harm to the war effort — it ’s much worse than that , ” Thompson said .
“ This delay is evidence that the war is already lost .
So take your time on the new troop numbers , Mister President .
Unless you have total change of heart and mind on this , it really does n’t make any difference . ”
But one of Thompson ’s points in his polemic — that “ our enemies are emboldened ” and “ our friends are discouraged ” because of Obama ’s delay — has critics accusing the former Republican presidential contender of hypocrisy .
Thompson until recently considered criticism of the war effort to be detrimental because it emboldens the US ’s enemies .
As Matt Corley pointed out at ThinkProgress , Thompson fiercely criticized Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in 2007 when Reid declared outgoing Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Peter Pace to be “ incompetent . ”

“ The problem is that every one of Reid ’s comments I ’ve noted here has also been reported gleefully by Al Jazeera and other anti-American media , ” Thompson said at the time .
“ Whether he means to or not , he ’s encouraging our enemies to believe that they are winning the critical war of will . ”
“ According to Thompson ’s own logic , his declaration of defeat today — “ whether he means to or not ” — is “ encouraging our enemies to believe that they are winning the critical war of will , ” Corley writes .

Protests against shutdown of Canadian parliament
A socialist policy to defend democratic rights
Socialist Equality Party ( Canada )
23 January 2010
Demonstrations and rallies are being held in cities across Canada this Saturday to protest against the minority Conservative government ’s two - month shutdown of parliament .
While the protest movement against prorogation was initiated from outside the political establishment and its official “ left flank ” ( the unions , NDP , and groups like rabble.ca ) , it has now been appropriated by “ the Anybody but Harper ” bourgeois opposition .
Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff and NDP leader Jack Layton have endorsed the protests , as has the Green Party ’s Elizabeth May .
In opposition to these forces , the Socialist Equality Party insists that the turn of the Harper Conservative government and Canada ’s ruling elite as whole toward more authoritarian forms of rule cannot be defeated by appealing to establishment parties to defend and reform bourgeois parliamentary institutions that are crumbling under the impact of the capitalist crisis .
What is required is the independent political intervention of the working class on the basis of its own program — a program that fuses the defence of democratic rights with the struggle to defend jobs and public services and against imperialist war .
The proroguing of parliament was an anti-democratic maneuver : the culmination of a three - year campaign to prevent public exposure of the Canadian government ’s and military ’s complicity in the torture of hundreds of Afghan detainees .
Previously the Harper Conservative government had sought to shut down an inquiry by the Military Police Complaints Commission ( MPCC ) into the Afghan detainee issue ; threatened government officials and military personnel who testified before the MPCC with prosecution under the country ’s draconian national security laws ; mounted a campaign of slander and lies against a former top Canadian official in Afghanistan who testified that the government and Canadian Armed Forces ’ top brass had suppressed his repeated warnings about Canada ’s complicity in torture ; and defied a House of Commons resolution ordering it to turn over key documents concerning the Afghan detainees .
Last month ’s prorogation of parliament grew out of any even more egregious attack on democratic rights .
Thirteen months ago , the Conservatives carried out a veritable constitutional coup .
Less than two months after a federal election , they prevailed upon the unelected and unaccountable Governor - General to use the vast arbitrary powers of her office to prorogue parliament so as to prevent the opposition parties from exercising their democratic right to defeat the government in an impending non-confidence vote .
Never before in modern times had the parliament of Canada or , for that matter , any country with a British - derived parliamentary system been shut down for the explicit purpose of avoiding a confidence vote .
Yet this flagrant breach of democratic norms and parliamentary practice was overwhelmingly supported by big business and its media .
The Conservatives ’ use of prorogation to undemocratically cling to power and cover up their commission of war crimes was the culmination of a decade of mounting attacks on democratic rights — attacks often spearheaded by the Liberals .
Canada ’s complicity in torture is by no means limited to Afghanistan .
As was illustrated by the cases of Maher Arar and Abousfian Abdelrazik , to name only the best known , Canada ’s security agencies have colluded in the torture of Canadian citizens by foreign governments .
This included inciting the foreign arrest of Canadians as a means to get round constitutional prohibitions on detention without trial and the use of “ aggressive ” interrogation techniques .
The Harper government , like the Liberal government that preceded it , has defended the Guantanamo Bay detention of Omar Khadr , who was seized by the US at the age of 14 and is being prosecuted as an act of vengeance by the US military and state against his late father .
Under Canada ’s omnibus anti-terror legislation longstanding juridical principles were overturned , including an accused ’s right to a public trial , full disclosure of the prosecution ’s evidence , and the presumption of innocence .
The powers and budgets of the RCMP and CSIS have been dramatically expanded , and the establishment has increasingly portrayed dissent as suspect if not criminal , while extolling the armed forces and their imperialist interventions abroad as the “ bulwarks of our democratic freedoms . ”
Federal and provincial governments continue the now decades - old practice of “ suspending ” workers ’ basic union rights to negotiate collectively and strike , virtually at will .
This process is paralleled by developments in all the other advanced capitalist countries .
In the US , the Republicans sought to use a sex scandal to unseat Bill Clinton ; then , with the sanction of the US Supreme Court , stole the 2000 election .
The September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks and trumped up claims of weapons of mass destruction were used to stampede the US into illegal wars of aggression in Afghanistan and Iraq and to vastly expand the powers of the state and the national security apparatus , effectively laying the groundwork for a police state .
A new lexicon was created as hitherto illegal practices were given state sanction — extraordinary rendition , enemy combatant , Patriot Act …
Behind this universal assault on democratic rights lie deepening and explosive class cleavages .
The past quarter century has seen a vast growth in social inequality and economic insecurity , as the various rival national bourgeoisies , locked in a ferocious struggle for markets and profits , seek to expand their wealth and geo-political power .
Governments , whether nominally of the left or right , have pursued social reaction at home — the dismantling of the welfare state , privatization and deregulation , and tax cuts designed to enrich the most privileged layers — while pursuing imperialist war abroad
It is widely conceded by the corporate media that Canada ’s parliamentary system is in crisis .
But when the ruling elite speaks of a dysfunctional parliament it means something entirely different from the attitude of working people .
Workers are angered by the fact that whichever party holds power in Ottawa and the provinces , governments pursue the same basic program of restructuring Canadian society to ensure the “ competitiveness , ” i.e. profitability , of big business .
When the corporate media decries the “ inertia ” and “ political jockeying ” in Ottawa , Toronto or Quebec City , it is expressing anger and frustration at the extent to which the inter - party competition for popular support constitutes an encumbrance to pressing forward with big business ’s agenda — and this under conditions where all of the parliamentary parties are beholden to the existing social order .
To return again to the December 2008 constitutional coup : if the ruling elite was willing to short - circuit parliamentary democracy so as to prevent the coming to power of a coalition led by the Liberals , its traditional governing party , how would it respond if confronted with a genuine challenge to its rule from the working class ?
Working people must beware the political agenda of those who have rallied round the “ grassroots ” opposition to prorogation and who are now seeking to place their political stamp on it — the trade union bureaucracy , the social - democrats and liberals of rabble .ca , the nationalist Council of Canadians and the Green Party .
These forces are seeking to channel the mounting opposition to the unresponsiveness of the political system to the needs of working people and the open breaches with democratic practices behind the traditional political establishment .
Many are actively working to revive the abortive Liberal - NDP coalition of December 2008
It is not accidental or incidental that the principal slogan these forces have advanced for Saturday ’s demonstration is one that has been employed countless times against striking workers and is suggestive not of an emancipatory movement but of a reactionary , petty bourgeois mobilization of irate taxpayers : “ Get back to work ! ”
This slogan is aimed not at alerting working people to the ruling class attack on democratic rights , but at promoting the bourgeoisie ’s claim that the parliamentarians — the vast majority of them Conservative and Liberal MPs and appointed senators — are the “ people ’s representatives . ”
The central problem facing the working class is that it has been systematically politically disenfranchised .
All of the parties — and this goes for the trade union - supported NDP — have participated in the ongoing assault against the working class .
What is urgently required is the development of an independent political movement of the working class .
All of the struggles of working people — against factory closures , cuts to public and social services , university tuition hikes , and police violence — must be united into a political challenge to the existing social order , under which economic and political power is wielded by a capitalist oligarchy .
To reiterate , the Liberals and NDP , whether together or separately , represent no genuine alternative to the Harper Conservatives .
They are both defenders of the capitalist order and as such implacably opposed to the mobilization of the working class in defence of democratic rights and against the destruction of jobs , living standards , and public and social services .
The same needs to be said of the BQ and its sister party the Parti Quebecois .
The Harper government has only expanded and extended the rightwing agenda of the Chretien - Martin Liberal government that preceded it .
During their twelve years in office , the Liberals imposed the greatest public spending cuts in history , soon to be followed by massive tax cuts geared to boosting corporate profits and the incomes of the wealthiest sections of society .
At the behest of the military , they shut down the public inquiry into CAF torture in Somalia , sent the CAF to war in Yugoslavia and southern Afghanistan , and initiated a vast expansion and rearmament of the Canadian armed forces .
The Liberals ’ commitment to democratic rights is exemplified by its leader Michael Ignatieff , who is infamous for the role he played internationally as a “ liberal ” advocate of the Iraq war and as an apologist for the Bush administration ’s use of torture .
As for the NDP , Canada ’s social - democratic party and its trade union allies have responded to the greatest crisis of world capitalism since the Great Depression by lurching further right .
In Dec. 2008 the NDP proclaimed its readiness to join a Liberal - led coalition government committed to implementing the Conservatives $ 50 billion corporate tax - cut scheme and waging war in Afghanistan .
Last September , the social democrats made a deal , in the name of “ making parliament work , ” to keep the Harper Conservative government in office .
When the Conservatives carried out their constitutional coup in December 2008 , the unions and NDP meekly submitted .
Their initial response to Harper ’s latest prorogation was equally tepid .
They only bestirred themselves after there was a public outcry and sections of the corporate media criticized the latest shutting down of parliament .
If establishment voices like the Globe and Mail did so , it is because they think that the Conservatives are needlessly bringing discredit on the office of the Governor - General — whose sweeping powers they want deployed only in time of real crisis , the better to preserve the illusion that “ the people rule . ”
Working people in Canada should critically review the record of US President Barack Obama .
The unions , liberals and all - manner of self - styled lefts rallied round Obama claiming that the big business Democrats were the only viable opposition to the Republican right .
Yet the Obama administration has continued and even carried forward Bush ’s policies , expanding the war in Afghanistan , providing vast sums to the financial aristocracy in the form of the bank bailouts , and joining with Harper and Ontario Liberal Premier Dalton McGuinty to impose sweeping cuts in wages , jobs and benefits on auto workers .
The defence of democratic rights cannot be entrusted to the representatives of the ruling elite .
It requires the independent political mobilization of the working class in opposition to all the parties of big business and the capitalist social order .
The Socialist Equality Party appeals to all workers and youth who agree with this program to read the World Socialist Web Site and join our ranks .
Not much of a game at this point -- but if you are a fan of the series ...
An alpha version of a Last Stand 3 , a very promising flash game made by Con Artist Games , became available this week .
The third game in the flash series picks up before the the earlier games -- sort of a prequel to them .
It takes place when the zombie infection is just starting to catch on like wildfire .
Turning your friends and neighbours into mindless blood - thirsting zombies .
You know the drill : it 's a zombie game .
While the excellent Last Stand 2 ( check it out if you have n't ) was a base - defender type game , where you have to defend yourself from zombie waves , while working through a town , the new game in the series is getting a big expansion to gameplay .
It is looking like a sort of adventure , light - ARPG game now ; you 'll have to do a lot more exploring through randomized locations , and you 'll experience levels , skills ( setting traps , picking locks , conversational skills , etcetra ) , and a customized appearance .
The alpha posted is n't admittedly much of a game at this point .
It is only two rooms ; you have two weapons and you go kill zombies .
Pretty straight - forward .
It should amuse you for only about two minutes .
But -- the big but -- if you are a fan of the series you 'll want to check it out to see what the Con Artists have been up to .
The Last Stand 3 promises to be a pretty big deal as far as flash games go .
Today I received an envelope from the UK , which was completely surprising to me .
I had no idea that my Secret Santa was from there .
Anyway , after opening it up I found that I had received one the best home made gift I have ever gotten in my life .
My Santa made a coin purse for me out of one of a cassette tape !
Plus , she put a note and money inside !
Thank you so much .
It actually brought tears to my eyes to think that someone went out of there way to make something , send it over seas , and just I dunno .
Thank you , you made my holiday fantastic .
Yes .
You really really can make yogurt at home in your kitchen using your very own crockpot slow cooker .
It ’s much cheaper than store - bought yogurt and there is no need to go out and buy a new appliance .
The fact is that yogurt machines use very low heat and moisture and you can recreate the entire thing with the crockpot that you already own !
Day 297 .
You can !
You really , really can !
Posts like this get me so excited .
I love finding new ways to use the crockpot .
My friend Jessica has always made homemade yogurt for her kids , and after looking up what a yogurt maker did , I had the idea that a crockpot could work .
But I never found a source that would walk me through the steps .
Until Debbie .
Debbie ( who needs to start a blog because she is an almost - debt - free homeschooling mom to six ) came to my rescue and held my hand ( virtually ) through yogurt - making .
Thank you , Debbie !
xoxo
The Ingredients for Crock Pot Yogurt .
* 8 cups ( half - gallon ) of whole milk -- Pasteurized and homogenized is fine , but do NOT use ultra- pasteurized .
( Debbie recommends starting with whole milk until you get the hang of yogurt - making )
* 1/2 cup store - bought natural , live / active culture plain yogurt .
You need to have a starter .
Once you have made your own , you can use that as a starter .
* Frozen / fresh fruit for flavoring
* Thick bath towel
The Directions for Homemade Yogurt .
This takes a while .
Make your yogurt on a weekend day when you are home to monitor .
I used a 4 quart crockpot .
This is so exciting .
My fingers are shaking !
Plug in your crockpot and turn to low .
Add an entire half gallon of milk .
Cover and cook on low for 2 1/2 hours .
Unplug your slow cooker .
Leave the cover on , and let it sit for 3 hours .
When 3 hours have passed , scoop out 2 cups of the warmish milk and put it in a bowl .
Whisk in 1 /2 cup of store - bought live / active culture yogurt .
Then dump the bowl contents back into the crockpot .
Stir to combine .
Put the lid back on your crockpot .
Keep it unplugged , and wrap a heavy bath towel all the way around the crock for insulation .
Go to bed , or let it sit for 8 hours .
In the morning , the yogurt will have thickened --- it 's not as thick as store - bought yogurt , but has the consistency of low - fat plain yogurt .
Blend in batches with your favorite fruit .
I did mango , strawberry , and blueberry .
When you blend in the fruit , bubbles will form and might bother you .
They are n't a big deal , and will settle eventually .
Chill in a plastic container (s ) in the refrigerator .
Your fresh homemade yogurt will last 7 - 10 days .
Save 1/2 cup as a starter to make a new batch .
ALSO , you can buy " gogurt " bags to make homemade versions of gogurt .
That is TOTALLY awesome !!
Amazon has them , here
The Verdict .
Wowsers !
This is awesome !
I was completely astonished the next morning that the yogurt thickened .
I was so excited to feel the drag on the spoon --- and sort of scared the kids with my squealing .
They each ate a huge serving that morning ( they added honey to their servings ) and have eaten it for every meal for 2 days .
I 'm actually kind of worried they 're over - doing it , but whatever .
They 're happy and are eating real food .
This is so much more cost - effective than the little things of yo - baby I was buying for them .
I have n't run the numbers , because I sort of suck at math , but it 's huge .
Seriously huge savings .
Updated 10/23 8:45 pm :
I have gotten quite a few emails alerting me that yes , you can use lower - fat content milk with this method .
To thicken the best , add one packet of unflavored gelatin to the mix after stirring in the yogurt with active cultures .
Some have had good success mixing non -fat milk powder in as well .
The way I created fruit - flavored yogurt was by taking a cup or so of the plain and blending it in the stand blender ( vitamix ) with frozen fruit .
Although this tastes great , the yogurt never thickened back up the way the plain did .
I think maybe keeping the plain separate and adding fruit daily is your best bet .
Or you can try the gelatin trick .
I was able to achieve a Greek - style yogurt this afternoon by lining a colander with a coffee liner and letting the liquid drip out of the leftover plain I made .
The remaining yogurt was as thick as sour cream .
A HUGE honking THANK YOU to Johanna ( banana ? ) for doing the money - saving math :
Here ’s your milk / yogurt math … you have to add the cost of electricity , starter and fruity stuff :
Where I live ( Seattle area ) :
One 6 - pack of yo- baby is $ 6.50 ( 24 ounces )
One gallon of almost totally organic milk is $ 3.00 ( 128 ounces )
One gallon of yobaby would be $ 34.67 or 10 times what it cost you to make it , more or less .
THAT ’S A BIG DEAL .
yobaby milk yobaby would be cost $ 6.50 $ 3.00 $ 34.67 ounces 24 128 128 cost / oz $ 0.27 $ 0.02 $ 0.27
Barack Obama has displayed a disturbing pattern of work ethics : shirking work ; claiming success when he was not entitled to do so ; hiding his failures ; and claiming the work of others as his own -- when it was successful .
These are not character traits that we should associate with Presidents .
Barack Obama won praise for Dreams From My Father , a 1995 memoir of his life that was published when he reached the grand old age of thirty - four .
The provenance of the book has come into question , led by a series of American Thinker columns by Jack Cashill , who used textual analysis to ascribe its writing -- or at least a good portion of it -- to Bill Ayers , Obama 's neighbor , former Weatherman , Obama campaign supporter and partner in various activist groups in Chicago .
This claim has been echoed in a new book by best - selling author Christian Andersen , Barack and Michelle : Portrait of an American Marriage who wrote that sources close to the Obamas told him that Barack Obama turned over his notes and tapes to Bill Ayers to compose the book .
Subsequently , under questioning by Cashill on a nationally - syndicated radio program , Andersen averred that two separate sources in Hyde Park confirmed to him the story of sending the notes and tapes to Ayers .
Whoever wrote Dreams clearly embellished Obama 's work history following graduation from Columbia .
Obama claimed to have worked at a high powered consulting firm as a research assistant .
A former colleague who sat down the hall from him debunked Obama 's puffery in 2005 :
First , it was n't a consulting house ; it was a small company that published newsletters on international business .
Like most newsletter publishers , it was a bit of a sweatshop .
I 'm sure we all wished that we were high - priced consultants to multinational corporations .
But we also enjoyed coming in at ten , wearing jeans to work , flirting with our co-workers , partying when we stayed late , and bonding over the low salaries and heavy workload .
Barack worked on one of the company 's reference publications .
Each month customers got a new set of pages on business conditions in a particular country , punched to fit into a three - ring binder .
Barack 's job was to get copy from the country correspondents and edit it so that it fit into a standard outline .
There was probably some research involved as well , since correspondents usually do n't send exactly what you ask for , and you can't always decipher their copy .
But essentially the job was copyediting .
Obama may have felt the need to polish a resume that would fit on the back of a postage stamp , as my colleague Kyle Shiver has characterized his curriculum vitae .
But the problem goes deeper than Cashill may have uncovered .
As a young attorney did he engage in the grind that is the fate of all young associates in law firms ?
Was he buried in books at the law firm library , barely able to keep his eyes open ?
Was he paying his dues ?
Not quite .
Instead , he can be pictured with his feet up on his desk , scribbling ideas on a legal pad for Dreams of My Father -- the book that helped make him a star .
Allison Davis , a founding name partner of the firm that hired the young Barack Obama out of law school had this bit of history to share :
" Some of my partners were n't happy with that , Barack sitting there with his keyboard on his lap and his feet up on the desk writing the book . "
I am sure Barack Obama 's fellow associates were none - too - pleased , either .
They were doing the work that paid for his salary .
To whom did he bill his time ?
Tony Rezko ?
We will never know , since Barack Obama refused to release his billing records .
Incidentally , he did not finish the book when he was contractually required to do so .
He jetted off to Bali , purportedly to work full - time on the book .
Now , I ask you dear reader , is there any place in the world less conducive to work -- especially the arduous , thankless task of writing -- than a lush tropical paradise like Bali ?
Even the novelist James Michener had to wait until returning to the states to write a book about his time in the South Pacific .
Nevertheless , somehow , miraculously , the manuscript was later completed -- but by whom ?
Not content with the practice of law -- or whatever he was doing at the office , Obama left the law firm for greener pastures .
While he was on the verge of running for the state Senate , he was tapped ( by Bill Ayers , no less ) to head the Chicago Annenberg Challenge , a donor - funded effort to improve Chicago schools .
This was the only time that Obama had experience running anything .
How did he do ?
He wasted over 100 million dollars and the program was declared a failure in an independent audit .
Did we hear much about this failure ?
No .
A cover -up shielded Barack Obama from being blamed for the program 's failure .
Access to records was denied to researchers .
Stanley Kurtz appeared on the Milt Rosenberg radio show on WGN in Chicago to report his findings .
The show was bombarded by the talk radio equivalent of computer denial of service attacks : a blizzard of phone calls , intimidating and harsh , that tried to shut down the show and silence Kurtz .
The attack was coordinated by the Obama campaign .
So much for transparency , and welcome to 1984 , delayed two decades or so .
When he became a state senator were there instances that revealed work practices that might rub people the wrong way ?
Yes there were .
His state senate colleagues took umbrage at his modus operandi .
He was what came to be known as a bill - jacker : someone who takes credit for legislation that others had written and worked the aisles to get passed .
He had a powerful patron , state Senate leader Emil Jones , who blessed this practice as a way to promote the career of a friend :
Back in his days as a state legislator , one of Obama 's early claims was that he passed a " major " ethics bill in Springfield , Illinois the State Capitol .
But , author David Freddoso's research for the book The Case Against Barack Obama finds that Obama did n't actually write the legislation but that Illinois State Senator Emil Jones merely allowed him to take the lead of an already crafted bill .
Freddoso calls Obama 's role " bill - jacking " as opposed to crafting .
... Abner Mikva , a former congressman and federal judge , had recommended to Jones that he give Obama a popular piece of legislation barring political fundraising on state property and barring lobbyists and contractors from giving gifts to legislators .
The bill had enough loopholes to be relatively harmless , but it was a step in the direction of reform .
Jones gave it to Obama .
Obama proposed it .
It passed , 52 - 4.18 The " Friends and Family " man , the old ward - heeler , was even capable of making Obama look like a reformer .
Instead of taking the lead in writing and proposing legislation , it has been Obama 's practice to join bills crafted by other people and attempt to take a partial or full measure of credit not due him .
Old habits die hard - he carried on the noisome practice when he became a U.S. Senator .
He " embellished " his role - as the Washington Post politely put it .
Any more examples of his modus operandi ?
Why yes , there are !
Barack Obama had the audacity to claim to have worked across the aisle with John McCain on ethics legislation ( a two - fer : he claimed bipartisanship and having worked on a bill ) when in fact , that was a " misrepresentation " or " blooper " as FactCheck .
Org ( a highly regarded , non-partisan monitoring group ) so delicately put it :
" I worked with John McCain " on ethics legislation .
In fact , the two worked together for barely a week , after which McCain accused Obama of " partisan posturing " and added , " I wo n't make the same mistake again . "
Obama offered a twisted account of his working with a Republican and " against party loyalty . "
He said he " worked with John McCain " on ethics legislation , when in fact their short - lived collaboration collapsed into bitter public wrangling long before any bill resulted .
How about claiming to be on a committee that had just successfully passed out some high - profile bit of legislation ?
Barack Obama today boasted about a bill in " my committee , '' a committee on which he has no seat .
While speaking to the press in the Israeli town of Sderot , Obama mistakenly put the U.S. Senate banking committee on his resume , although the Illinois senator does not serve on the committee and Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - Conn. ) is the chairman .
The Republican National Committee distributed an e-mail pointing out Obama 's mistake with a subject line of " Obama 's Gaffe Machine Rolls Into Israel . "
During the press conference , Obama said , " Just this past -- this past week , we passed out of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee , which is my committee , a bill to call for divestment from Iran as a way of ratcheting up the pressure to ensure that they do n't obtain a nuclear weapon . "
There he goes again .
How about his finely crafted speeches ?
Did he actually write all those on his own -- as did , say , Abraham Lincoln ?
No , though the mainstream media obscured ( hid ) this fact until after the election .
During the campaign , it was clear that he had plagiarized the speeches of his friend , Deval Patrick , Governor of Massachusetts .
That revelation became widely - known .
They shared a campaign strategist in David Axelrod .
What worked for Patrick , worked for Obama .
The same type of ringing phrases , the same cadences , the same ideas .
They had passed the test and helped to elect Patrick .
Market - proven and battle - tested .
But what is not as well - known is the provenance of his famous " race - speech " made in Philadelphia after revelations of the bigotry of his Pastor - Jeremiah Wright - became public .
Obama 's campaign for the Presidency was at risk .
What to do ?
Well - give a speech , of course - because the media loved praising his speeches .
In this notable case , they went into overdrive with over the top praise for the brilliance of Obama who - the story was - had written the speech himself .
Except , of course , that he had n't .
He did n't write it : it was manufactured for him by his ghostwriter - speechwriter Jon Favreau ( Kennedy had his Ted Sorensen ; Obama has his Jon Favreau ) .
We had to wait for this revelation until after Barack Obama assumed office .
James Taranto of the Wall Street Journal :
Remember Barack Obama 's big race speech back in March , the one that invited comparisons to Lincoln ?
Neither does anyone else , but it seemed like a big deal at the time .
On March 18 The Atlantic 's Marc Ambinder did a short item called " Speechwriter of One " ( quoting verbatim ) :
This was n't a speech by committee ...
Obama wrote the speech himself , working on it for two days and nights .... and showed it to only a few of his top advisers .
This now appears to have been puffery , at least if the Washington Post has the story right :
One Saturday night in March , Obama called [ Jon ] Favreau and said he wanted to immediately deliver a speech about race .
He dictated his unscripted thoughts to Favreau over the phone for 30 minutes -- " It would have been a great speech right then , " Favreau said -- and then asked him to clean it up and write a draft .
Favreau put it together , and Obama spent two nights retooling before delivering the address in Philadelphia the following Tuesday .
" So , " Obama told Favreau afterward .
" I think that worked . "
Favreau is now the most highly paid of President Obama 's staffers .
A matter of fact , he earns as much as he can legally earn at the West Wing - hundreds of thousands of dollars every year .
I suppose he is worth every one of our hard - earned dollars -- at least he is to Barack Obama .
So are we to treat his claim regarding his two books ( The Audacity of Hope being the other ) that he " actually wrote them myself " with some skepticism and the claim of Cashill with some credence ?
A side effect of his sorry work habits is what he does when he cannot avoid having mistakes pinned on him .
What does he do then ?
Jake Tapper of ABC
News noted a very discreditable practice of Obama's : he scapegoats staffers as the ones to be blamed .
Is this the type of person anyone of us have ever enjoyed working with - let alone enjoy watching ascend the corporate ladder .
Is this the type of person we want as President ?
Has he continued this type of behavior as President ?
Yes he has .
When his policies have come up a cropper he makes Cabinet and other leading officials fall on their swords so he can be shielded from owning up to his responsibility . .
Lately , Greg Craig has taken the dive for Obama 's Gitmo policy disaster .
He was the latest fall guy .
The buck does not stop at Obama 's desk .
But we should have known that from his budget - busting deficits .
Is this why he dithers in the face of major geopolitical challenges ?
Is he afraid of making a mistake ?
Can he just vote present as President ?
Is this why he outsources so much domestic policy to Congress and foreign policy to the United Nations ?
Does he carry on his practice of voting present -- as he did as a state Senator -- while being President ?
Does it seem he just does n't like to do hard work ?
Are all these habits just manifestations of a horrible ethic when it comes to work ?

Rove granted divorce in Texas
Karl Rove , former senior adviser to President George W. Bush , has been granted a divorce in Texas after 24 years of marriage , family spokeswoman Dana Perino said .
“ Karl Rove and his wife , Darby , were granted a divorce last week , " said Perino .
" The couple came to the decision mutually and amicably , and they maintain a close relationship and a strong friendship .
There will be no further comment , and the family requests that its privacy be respected . ”

The Roves were married in January 1986 .
A family friend told POLITICO : “ After 24 years of marriage , many of which were spent under incredible stress and strain during the White House years , the Roves came to a mutual decision that they would end the marriage .
They did spend Christmas together with their son , and they plan to spend time together in the future .
They maintain a strong friendship , and they both feel that that friendship is a source of comfort and inspiration for their friends and family . ”
Rove ’s 608 - page memoir , “ Courage and Consequence : My Life as a Conservative in the Fight , ” is due out from Simon & Schuster ’s Threshold Editions on March 9 .
Ed Gillespie , former counselor to President George W. Bush , whose wife Cathy has been friends with the Roves for 20 years , said : “ It ’s always sad to see a marriage end .
These are two very good people , who came to a not - easy decision .
But they care a lot about each other , and they love their son .
And they ’ll work through it . ”
Sarah Palin frequently refers to to her religious beliefs as part of her core values , but she has never made it clear just what those beliefs are .
Now one casual remark during an interview last week with Barbara Walters may have drawn back the curtain a bit .
In response to a question about Jewish settlements on Palestinian land , Palin told Walters , “ I believe that the Jewish settlements should be allowed to be expanded upon , because that population of Israel is , is going to grow .
More and more Jewish people will be flocking to Israel in the days and weeks and months ahead . ”

Palin ’s expectation of massive Jewish immigration to Israel — which would have to come primarily from the United States — has no basis in current fact but does correspond closely to the end - times theology espoused by many evangelical Christians .
After Palin ’s interview , The Atlantic ’s Jeffrey Goldberg spoke to a representative of Liberty University , who told him , “ ‘ What Sarah Palin probably believes is that this is the first regathering , ’ when the Jews all migrate to Israel .
‘ This is a condition for the second regathering , the regathering in belief , when the Jewish nation is converted .
Then there will be the battle of Armageddon . ' ”
“ In the last two weeks , ” MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann commented on Tuesday , “ she has revealed pieces of the puzzle of her religious doctrines that suggest she shares the beliefs of her church , the Assemblies of God , that in the end - times , the Rapture , Jesus lifts true believers up with him as non-believers suffer through the apocalypse .
She is also implying now that her interpretation of Biblical prophecy drives core elements of her foreign policy . ”
Palin met recently with the elderly evangelist Billy Graham , whose son Franklin told reporters that Palin had “ quizzed him on the presidents he ’s known and wanted his take on what the Bible says about Israel , Iran and Iraq , ”
Olbermann appeared to be particularly concerned by whether Palin shares the convert - or - perish attitude towards the Jews expressed in end - times theology .
“ If Mrs. Palin truly wants to discuss her faith , we invite her to clarify what her faith says about Israel , its role in the Rapture , and the ultimate fate of Israel and the Jews who choose to keep their faith , ” he concluded .

Hugo Chavez denounces Obama 's ``imperial '' deal .
Photo COP15 .
December 18 , 2009 -- Speaking on behalf of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas , President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela took the floor at the plenary of the COP15 climate talks in Copenhagen to denounce the final ``deal '' that was soon to emerge and be imposed on the majority poor - country delegates , and which would fall far short of their demands .
Chavez accused US President Barack Obama of behaving like an emperor “ who comes in during the middle of the night … and cooks up a document that we will not accept , we will never accept ” .
Chávez declared that “ all countries are equal ” .
He would not accept that some countries had prepared a text for a climate deal and just “ slipped [ it ] under the door ” to be signed by the others .
He accused them of “ a real lack of transparency ” .
“ We ca n’t wait any longer , we are leaving … We are leaving , knowing that it was n’t possible getting a deal , ” he said .
Evo Morales , the president of Bolivia , also took the floor to express annoyance at the way a climate deal was being thrashed out by a small group of world leaders at the last minute .
" If there is no agreement at this level , why not tell the people ? " , he said at the plenary meeting .
He called for further consultations with the people .
" Who is responsible ? " , Morales he asked .
Concluding that " the responsibility lies on the capitalist system -- we have to change the capitalist system " .
Sham deal
The so - called " Copenhagen Accord " was pushed by the US and Australia , and sealed in meetings behind closed doors with the leaders of China , India , Brazil and South Africa .
It was announced by Obama late on the evening of December 18 , and presented as ``final '' even before the COP15 delegates had a chance to vote on it .
It does not commit governments to interim 2020 carbon emissions - reduction targets , or to legally binding reductions and only expresses a general aim of limiting the global warming increase to 2 degrees Celcius -- well above the 1 degree C - 1.5 degree C target most delegations were calling for .

Lumumba Stanislaus Di-Aping , delegation head of the G77 group of developing countries , rejected the accordand vowed to fight it .
" Obama , acting the way he did , definitely established that there 's no difference between him and the Bush tradition " , he told Time magazine .
Nnimmo Bassey , prominent Nigerian environmentalist and chair of Friends of the Earth International , described Copenhagen as " an abject failure " .
" Justice has not been done .
By delaying action , rich countries have condemned millions of the world ’s poorest people to hunger , suffering and loss of life as climate chang accelerates .
The blame for this disastrous outcome is squarely on the developed nations .
We are disgusted by the failure of rich countries to commit to the emissions reductions they know are needed , especially the US , which is the world 's largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases .
" In contrast African nations , China and others in the developing world deserve praise for their progressive positions and constructive approach .
Major developing countries cannot be blamed for the failure of rich industrialised countries .
“ Instead of committing to deep cuts in emissions and putting new , public money on the table to help solve the climate crisis , rich countries have bullied developing nations to accept far less .
Those most responsible for putting the planet in this mess have not shown the guts required to fix it and have instead acted to protect short - term political interests . "
` Real leadership ' on the streets
“ The only real leadership at the conference has come from the hundreds of thousands of ordinary people who ’ve come together to demand strong action to prevent climate catastrophe .
Their voices are loud and growing – and Friends of the Earth International will continue to be part of the fight for climate justice . ”
Greenpeace criticised the accord for not having “ targets for carbon cuts and no agreement on a legally binding treaty ” .
Oxfam International called the deal “ a triumph of spin over substance .
It recognises the need to keep warming below two degrees but does not commit to do so .
It kicks back the decisions on emissions cuts and fudges the issue of climate cash . ”
The ``accord '' confirms the continuation of the Kyoto Protocol and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change .
Developed countries commit collectively to providing US $ 30 billion in new , additional funding for developing countries for the 2010 - 2012 period .
It also says developed countries support “ a goal of mobilising jointly 100 billion dollars a year ” by 2020 from a variety of sources .
Erich Pica , president of the Friends of the Earth ( USA ) , said that the " climate negotiations in Copenhagen have yielded a sham agreement with no real requirements for any countries .
This is not a strong deal or a just one -- it is n't even a real one .
It 's just repackaging old positions and pretending they 're new .
The actions it suggests for the rich countries that caused the climate crisis are extraordinarily inadequate .
This is a disastrous outcome for people around the world who face increasingly dire impacts from a destabilising climate ...
" With the future of all humans on this planet at stake , rich countries must muster far more political will than they exhibited here .
If they do not , small island states will become submerged , people in vulnerable communities across the globe will be afflicted with hunger and disease , and wars over access to food and water will rage .
" The devastation will extend to those of us who live in wealthy countries ' ' , said Pica .
" The failure to produce anything meaningful in Copenhagen must serve as a wake up call to all who care about the future .
It is a call to action .
Corporate polluters and other special interests have such overwhelming influence that rich country governments are willing to agree only to fig leaf solutions .
This is unacceptable , and it must change .
" Fortunately , while the cost of solving the climate crisis rises each day we fail to act , the crisis remains one that can largely be averted .
It is up to the citizens of the world -- especially citizens of the United States , which has so impeded progress -- to mobilise and ensure that true solutions carry the day .
I firmly believe that together , we can still achieve a politics in which climate justice prevails . "
Rich countries blackmailing poor to sign onto flawed , unjust `accord '
December 19 , 2009 -- Friends of the Earth International --
On the day that the UN Climate talks officially closed , Friends of the Earth International warned against the false conclusion that the UN Climate Conference has adopted the ``Copenhagen Accord ' ' .
The Copenhagen Accord announced on December 18 by US President Barack Obama was not adopted by delegates to the United Nations climate conference here .
Instead , delegates merely ``noted '' the agreement 's existence , giving it no force whatsoever .
Today rich countries led by the United States are pressuring poorer nations to ditch the UN process and sign onto the Copenhagen Accord .
They are threatening poor nations that refuse to sign on with the loss of their share of the US $ 100 billion that rich countries have pledged to compensate for climate impacts the rich countries themselves have caused .
UN officials are struggling to figure out what the accord even means and how it 's related to the UN process , but what 's is clear is that it was not approved by the 192 countries that are members of the UNFCCC .
By signing onto the accord , poor countries risk displacing the legitimate negotiation process taking place under the auspices of the UN .
The US is so desperate to claim a Copenhagen success that it is now attempting to destroy the existing climate process and sideline 20 years of real multilateral negotiation .
Nnimmo Bassey , Friends of the Earth International chairperson , said :
These amazing embryonic animal photographs of dolphins , sharks , dogs , penguins , cats and elephants are from a new National Geographic Documentary called “ Extraordinary Animals in the Womb ” .
The show ’s producer , Peter Chinn , used a combination of three - dimensional ultrasound scans , computer graphics and tiny cameras to capture the process from conception to birth .
They are the most detailed embryonic animal pictures ever seen .
" It took me a couple of years from the launch of the prototype in around 2001 to become really proficient with them , " said Valentino .
Cattle ranching accounts for half of Brazil ’s greenhouse gas emissions according to a new study led by scientists from Brazil ’s National Space Institute for Space Research ( INPE ) .
The research found emissions from cattle ranching in the Amazon and the cerrado , a woody tropical grassland south of the Amazon rainforest , generated 813 million to 1.09 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions between 2003 and 2008 .
The Amazon accounted for 499 to 775 million tons in CO2 emissions , while the cerrado accounted for 229 - 231 million tons .
Emissions from cattle ranching in other parts of the country amounted to 84 - 87 million tons over the period .
The study , which is based on Brazil ’s cutting - edge system for monitoring land use change , found that 75 percent of the rainforest cleared during the period ended up as cattle pasture , while 56 percent of cerrado clearing results in pastureland .
The study estimates that each kilogram of Brazilian beef is associated with 300 kilograms ( 660 pounds ) of CO2 emissions .
“ We found that the cost of carbon emissions per unit of output exceeds the actual cost of the product at wholesale , ” said Roberto Smeraldi of Friends of the Earth – Brazilian Amazon , a co-author of the study .
The authors , led by Carlos Nobre of INPE , said the study shows that Brazil needs to focus on ways to reduce the environmental impact of cattle ranching in order to cut greenhouse gas emissions .
They suggest that policy reforms , increased law enforcement , and improved land management practices could curtail deforestation and associated emissions .
Payments for forest restoration and conservation could incentivize ranchers and forests to adopt more ecologically - responsible approaches .
Further , certification of Amazon agricultural products to allow traceability through the supply chain back to farms and ranches where cattle are produced could foster better environmental performance among producers .
Brazil has offered to reduce emissions by nearly 40 percent from projected levels ( 14 to 19 percent below 2005 levels ) by 2020 .
Most of the reductions would come from a 70 percent reduction in deforestation rates .

Brazil could halt Amazon deforestation within a decade
( 12/03/2009 ) Funds generated under a U.S. cap - and - trade or a broader U.N. - supported scheme to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and degradation ( “ REDD ” ) could play a critical role in bringing deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon to a halt , reports a team writing in the journal Science .
But the window of opportunity is short — Brazil has a two to three year window to take actions that would end Amazon deforestation within a decade .
Deforestation emissions should be shared between producer and consumer , argues study
( 11/19/2009 ) Under the Kyoto Protocol the nation that produces carbon emission takes responsibility for them , but what about when the country is producing carbon - intensive goods for consumer demand beyond its borders ?
For example while China is now the world ’s highest carbon emitter , 50 percent of its growth over the last year was due to producing goods for wealthy countries like the EU and the United States which have , in a sense , outsourced their manufacturing emissions to China .
A new study in Environmental Research Letters presents a possible model for making certain that both producer and consumer share responsibility for emissions in an area so far neglected by studies of this kind : deforestation and land - use change .
Concerns over deforestation may drive new approach to cattle ranching in the Amazon
( 09/08/2009 )
While you ’re browsing the mall for running shoes , the Amazon rainforest is probably the farthest thing from your mind .
Perhaps it should n’t be .
The globalization of commodity supply chains has created links between consumer products and distant ecosystems like the Amazon .
Shoes sold in downtown Manhattan may have been assembled in Vietnam using leather supplied from a Brazilian processor that subcontracted to a rancher in the Amazon .
But while demand for these products is currently driving environmental degradation , this connection may also hold the key to slowing the destruction of Earth ’s largest rainforest .
Brazilian beef giant announces moratorium on rainforest beef
( 08/13/2009 ) Brazil ’s second - largest beef exporter , Bertin , announced it would establish a moratorium on buying cattle from farms involved in Amazon deforestation , reports Greenpeace .
The move comes after the World Bank ’s International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) withdrew a $ 90 million loan to Bertin following revelations in a Greenpeace report that the company was buying beef produced on illegally deforested lands .
The report , which linked some of the world ’s most prominent brands to rainforest destruction in the Amazon , had an immediate impact , triggering a cascade of events .
Timberland announces policy to avoid using leather produced by Amazon destruction
( 07/29/2009 ) Timberland , a maker of hiking boots and other footwear , today announced it would demand a moratorium on leather produced from newly deforested areas in the Amazon .
The move is a direct response to pressure from Greenpeace , which last month released Slaughtering the Amazon , a report that linked some of the world ’s most prominent brands to illegal clearing of the Amazon rainforest .
Timberland says it will require its leather suppliers to commit to the moratorium on newly deforested areas in the Amazon .
Greenpeace says the policy “ makes Timberland the industry leader in environmentally and socially responsible Brazilian leather procurement . ”

Nike , Unilever , Burger King , IKEA may unwittingly contribute to Amazon destruction , says Greenpeace
( 06/01/2009 ) Major international companies are unwittingly driving the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest through their purchases of leather , beef and other products supplied from the Brazil cattle industry , alleges a new report from Greenpeace .
The report , Slaughtering the Amazon , is based on a three - year undercover investigation of the Brazilian cattle industry , which accounts for 80 percent of Amazon deforestation and roughly 14 percent of the world ’s annual forest loss .
Greenpeace found that Brazilian beef companies are important suppliers of raw materials used by leading global brands , including Adidas / Reebok , Nike , Carrefour , Eurostar , Unilever , Johnson & Johnson , Toyota , Honda , Gucci , Louis Vuitton , Prada , IKEA , Kraft , Tesco and Wal - Mart , among others .
Beef consumption fuels rainforest destruction

The finding confirms what Amazon researchers have long known – that Brazil ’s rise to become the world ’s largest exporter of beef has come at the expense of Earth ’s biggest rainforest .
More than 38,600 square miles has been cleared for pasture since 1996 , bringing the total area occupied by cattle ranches in the Brazilian Amazon to 214,000 square miles , an area larger than France .
The legal Amazon , an region consisting of rainforests and a biologically - rich grassland known as cerrado , is now home to more than 80 million head of cattle .
For comparison , the entire U.S. herd was 96 million in 2008 .
Jean Simmons , a radiant British actress who as a teenager appeared opposite Laurence Olivier in “ Hamlet ” and emerged a star whose career flourished in the 1950s and 1960s in such films as “ Guys and Dolls , “ Elmer Gantry ” and “ Spartacus , ” has died .
She was 80 .
Simmons , who won an Emmy Award for her role in the 1980s miniseries “ The Thorn Birds , ” died Friday evening at her home in Santa Monica , said Judy Page , her agent .
She had lung cancer .
“ Jean Simmons ’ jaw - dropping beauty often obscured a formidable acting talent , ” Alan K. Rode , a writer and film historian , told The Times in an e-mail .
Plucked from a dance class by a talent scout at the age of 14 , she had already made several movies before gaining attention for her portrayal of the young Estella in David Lean ’s film adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel “ Great Expectations . ”
Considered one of the greatest British movies ever made , it had lasting impact on the actress , who was 17 the year it was released .
Until then , moviemaking had mainly been “ fun and games , ” she later said , but she realized it could be a career .
“ That ’s when I thought , ‘ Oh , yes , I think this is it , ’ ” Simmons told the San Diego Union - Tribune in 1990 .
After Olivier cast her as Ophelia in his 1948 film “ Hamlet , ” she received the first of two Academy Award nominations .
More than 20 years later , she was nominated for her searing portrayal of an alcoholic wife in “ The Happy Ending . ”
Olivier urged the young actress to perfect her craft by acting on stage , but she chose a more romantic path -- and followed her future husband , dashing British screen idol Stewart Granger , to Hollywood .
Howard Hughes bought her film contract from a British company but nearly strangled her fledgling American career .
After she became entangled in a contractual lawsuit with Hughes , then head of RKO Studios , he prevented her from appearing in many meaningful roles until the suit was settled .
“ An outstanding exception of her time at RKO was ‘ Angel Face ’ [ 1952 ] , a wonderfully dark film noir that had Simmons playing a femme fatale with murderous intentions opposite Robert Mitchum , ” Rode wrote .
Over a career that spanned more than 60 years , she appeared in about 55 feature films and nearly as many television productions .
In the 1950s and 1960s , she made more than 30 movies and displayed her versatility by appearing in costume epics , romances , musicals and dramas .
She co-starred with such notable actors as Richard Burton in “ The Robe , ” Gregory Peck in the western “ The Big Country , ” Marlon Brando in “ Desiree , ” and Brando and Frank Sinatra in “ Guys and Dolls . ”
While playing the title character in “ Desiree , ” the mistress of Brando ’s Napoleon , she was so in awe of the actor that “ I was sort of forgetting what I was supposed to do , ” she said in 1990 in the Union - Tribune .
When Brando and Simmons next starred in “ Guys and Dolls ” in 1955 , they were initially supposed to lip-sync their songs .
During rehearsal , “ Samuel Goldwyn came on the set one day and he heard us and said , ‘ I think it ’s better you do your own singing .
. . .
Maybe you do n’t sound so good , but at least it ’s you , ’ ” she recalled in the Union - Tribune interview .
Among her films , she favored 1953 ’s “ The Actress , ” which she said she “ just loved ” for the “ sheer heaven ” of working with Spencer Tracy , who became a good friend , she said in the 1990 interview .
She also enjoyed “ The Grass Is Greener , ” which co-starred Cary Grant , “ because it was comedy and I usually play these uptight puddings , ” she said in 1988 in the Toronto Star .
In 1960 , she and Granger divorced after a decade of marriage .
The same year , she married Richard Brooks , who had just directed her as the saintly evangelist in “ Elmer Gantry . ”
In 1987 , Brooks told People magazine , “ Every man I would meet would say to me , ‘ I have always loved your wife , ’ ” who was considered one of the great screen beauties of her generation .
“ For men of a certain age , the memory of seeing Simmons naked from the back in the 1960 ’s ‘ Spartacus ’ ranks high among their early carnal thrills , ” the People article said .
She had portrayed Kirk Douglas ’ love interest in the Roman epic .
Brooks directed her in the 1969 film “ The Happy Ending , ” which he also wrote .
He later said that he created the character of the alcoholic wife as a way to tell his real - life wife that she also had a drinking problem .
Of their breakup after about 18 years of marriage , Simmons later said , “ It was simply that the mixture of an alcoholic and a workaholic just was n’t working . ”
In 1986 , she underwent treatment for alcoholism at the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage .
“ All I can say is thank God for Mrs. Ford , ” Simmons said in the People interview .
After marrying for the second time , she took a few years off .
She had two daughters , one with Granger named Tracy , for her “ Actress ” co-star , and the other with Brooks , named Kate , for Katharine Hepburn .
Simmons returned to the big screen in 1963 in “ All the Way Home , ” giving an “ award - caliber performance ” as a recently widowed mother , according to “ Leonard Maltin ’s Movie Guide . ”
But she found good roles harder to come by .
“ Every actress has to face the facts there are younger , more beautiful girls right behind you , ” Simmons said in 1988 in the Toronto Star .
“ Once you ’ve gone beyond the vanity of the business , you ’ll take on the tough roles . ”
Increasingly , she turned to television movies and miniseries .
In the 1980s , she appeared in the ABC historical drama “ North and South ” and its sequel ; in a well - reviewed Disney Channel version of “ Great Expectations ” as the miserable recluse Miss Havisham ; and as the mother , Fiona “ Fee ” Cleary , in the ABC miniseries “ The Thorn Birds . ”
“ I did n’t have a dominant personality .
It helped me slip into character parts very easily , ” she told the Toronto Star in 1988 .
“ I simply had to play the mother in ‘ The Thorn Birds . ’
I understood her pain .
I badgered the producer until he gave in .
He said it was n’t a star part .
That ’s why I wanted it ! ”
Jean Merilyn Simmons was born Jan. 31 , 1929 , in London to Charles and Winifred Ada Simmons .
Her father competed as a British gymnast in the 1912 Olympics and later coached the sport .
He died when she was 16 .
Her mother once described Cricklewood , the north London area where Simmons grew up , as “ a place where they make lovely parts for automobiles . ”
At 15 , Simmons appeared in five British films , including a role as a precocious teenager in “ Give Us the Moon . ”
She also appeared in such major British productions as “ Black Narcissus ” ( 1947 ) and “ The Blue Lagoon ” ( 1949 ) .
In 1956 , she became a U.S. citizen and while married to Granger lived on an Arizona ranch .
For years , she lived in a Santa Monica home that she decorated in a style she once described as “ early mishmash . ”
“ It was extraordinary for a Cockney kid from Cricklewood to have this happen , ” she said in a 1989 Times interview as she expressed amazement over the life she had lived .
“ If I had n’t gone to that dancing school , I would have married and had children like my mum and had a normal life .
“ My career has had a lot of ups and downs , ” she said , “ but basically it has been wonderful . ”
She is survived by her two daughters , Tracy Granger and Kate Brooks .

French legislators are expected to pull back from plans to pass a law barring Muslim women from wearing full face veils in public , according to the head of the commission looking into the issue .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy had made the wearing of Muslim headdresses a political issue in his country this year , and on Thursday repeated his conviction that " France is a country that has no place for the burka . "
But commission head Andre Gerin told Europe 1 radio on Friday the panel will simply propose recommendations , rather than a law .
The wearing of burkas — all - concealing traditional dresses , with built - in mesh covering the eyes — has been a controversial issue in France , with Sarkozy calling them " a sign of subservience , a sign of debasement . "
The president 's comments have drawn criticism in the Muslim world and from community leaders among the five million Muslims in France who worry the law would stigmatize their faith .
French police intelligence agencies have also issued reports saying the use of burkas was a " marginal phenomenon , " one in use by fewer than 400 women in the country .
A commission of 32 legislators from all four major political parties in the country 's National Assembly , the lower house of parliament , was expected to deliver its report on the issue by the end of the year .
Gerin said the report will likely propose a ban on burkas in hospitals and other public services , but did not elaborate on how this would be accomplished .
Burkas have also been controversial in other parts of the world as well , including in Egypt , where the garb is viewed as cultural and not religious in nature .
Egypt put in place a ban on nurses wearing full veil in 2008 , but it has not been enforced .
The niqab , a face - veil with a thin opening for the eyes , has been controversial in Canada as well , with the federal Conservatives introducing a bill in 2007 that would have forced veiled women to show their faces when voting .
But earlier this year Steven Fletcher , minister of state for democratic reform , said the Canadian government had no plans to go forward with the legislation because of other priorities .
' What do you think ? '
Beth Summers turned round and burst out laughing as her grandma brandished a bright red feather boa around her shoulders .
' This used to belong to my mother , ' continued Beth 's gran as she jiggled her hips , causing her 12 - year - old grand - daughter to laugh even more .
' You could put it on the Christmas tree if we can't find the tinsel , ' replied Beth .
They were hunting in the attic for the Christmas decorations and had found all manner of things but there was not a bauble in sight .
As her laughing subsided , Beth pulled an old blanket off a dusty box , uncovering copper pots and pans and something that looked quite out of place .
Pulling it free , Beth held a frame of some kind and her gran came over .
' Now this belonged to my great - grandmother ...' said the old lady .
For a moment it seemed to stir a half - memory before she added , ' I 'd forgotten all about it .
It 's the advent calendar she was given for her first Christmas . '
The frame was a dull silver colour and about the size of a large book .
Its edges were intricately designed and Beth thought it looked quite beautiful .
She could see small hinged windows all over its surface , some of which were open and behind each one was a very old photograph .
' That 's her there , ' murmured Gran wistfully as she pointed to one of the tiny sepia images , a baby in a pretty white dress .
' Ah ha ! '
Moving the box of pots and pans aside she revealed another , crammed full of decorations .
' I think we deserve a cup of tea now we 've found these , ' she announced and picking up the box she made her way out of the attic .
Beth went to put the advent calendar back , but on a sudden impulse decided to take it with her and after switching off the attic light , made her way downstairs .
Some hours later they were putting the finishing touches to the Christmas tree which sparkled as the tree lights caught the reflective glow of the decorations .
Gran 's living room , despite being quite large , was warm and cosy .
Beth loved seeing her gran and had jumped at the chance to spend a few extra days with her ahead of the holidays .
Her parents were arriving on Christmas Eve , so Beth had her grandma all to herself for nearly another week .
Exhausted , they both plopped down on chairs admiring their handiwork .
Next to Beth 's chair , on a small , round , slightly battered mahogany table lay the advent calendar .
Picking it up she studied it more closely .
On each of the closed windows she could make out ornate numbers .
Beth tried to close one of the open windows , but it would n't budge and neither would the next or the next .
' Probably rusted open , ' thought Beth .
The lowest number that she could see closed was ' 15 ' .
' Today 's the fifteenth ! ' declared Beth rather more loudly than she intended .
' That 's right dear ...' muttered her gran , whose voice tailed off as she fell asleep .
Beth reached for the window and with just the gentlest of touches it swung open ...
Was that lightning ?
Beth looked up sharply .
A blast of cold air made her shiver and jump at the same time .
The room was darker and her gran was gone .
The Christmas tree stood in a slightly different position and was now unlit .
Where there had been a gas fire seconds earlier a log fire roared but did little to warm the room .
The wallpaper was more austere and somehow the furniture had changed .
The round mahogany table still stood by Beth 's chair but looked new and unscathed .
' I must be dreaming ' thought Beth but another chilly breeze made her think again .
She reached out , touching the table and suddenly felt the smooth mahogany scar beneath her fingers .
It was old again .
The room had returned to its usual state and her gran was sleeping quietly .
Shaken ,
Beth stood and in spite of her instincts reached for the sixteenth window .
It remained firmly stuck .
Realising she had been holding her breath , she let out a deep sigh of relief and put the calendar down .
' Just a silly dream , ' she muttered to herself as she tip - toed out of the room to get ready for bed .
It was getting late , after all .
' Just a silly dream ...'
The following morning was bright and sunny and promising .
Gran had nipped into town for a spot of Christmas shopping and Beth was in her bedroom , finishing the last of her holiday homework .
Satisfied with her answers , she closed her school books and wandered out onto the landing which overlooked the hall below .
Her gran lived in a grand old Victorian house which had been in the family for generations .
Beth descended the wide sweeping staircase , which always made her feel like a movie star , and went through to the lounge .
The advent calendar was sparkling in the sunlight and Beth picked it up , smiling as she looked at the photographs .
Then her heart seemed to miss a beat as she saw , for the first time , the fifteenth photograph .
It was of the living room she had dreamt of the night before .
Her heart pounded as she again tried to open the sixteenth window .
This time she felt it move easily beneath her fingertips .
After an afternoon of negotiations produced an agreement , Mike Shanahan signed a five - year contract to become executive vice president and head coach for the Washington Redskins .
Under the terms of the new deal , Shanahan will team with Redskins executive vice president and general manager Bruce Allen , but Shanahan will have the ultimate authority on football decisions .
Shanahan will appear at a 2 p.m. ET news conference Wednesday .
As the contract was being signed at the Redskins ' training complex , Shanahan and team owner Dan Snyder posed together for a picture .
Then , with the deal signed , Shanahan , his agent Sandy Montag , Allen and Snyder headed out for a celebration dinner .
Shanahan 's contract is worth approximately $ 7 million a year , The Denver Post reported on its Web site .
Now that Shanahan has been hired elsewhere , the Denver Broncos , who fired Shanahan one year ago , will recoup $ 7 million in offset money over the next two seasons under the terms of the agreement they had with the coach .
Our world is on an unsustainable path that threatens not only our environment , but our economies and our security .
It is time to launch a broad operational accord on climate change that will set us on a new course .
A successful agreement depends upon a number of core elements , but two are shaping up to be essential : first , that all major economies set forth strong national actions and resolve to implement them ; and second , that they agree to a system that enables full transparency and creates confidence that national actions are in fact being implemented .
Transparency , in particular , is what will ensure that this agreement becomes operational , not just aspirational .
We all need to take our share of responsibility , stand behind our commitments , and mean what we say in order for an international agreement to be credible .
Representatives from more than 190 countries have gathered in Copenhagen in the hopes of meeting this urgent challenge to our planet .
If we are serious about that goal , we will all embrace these principles .
Band of Dems Blasts Geithner Plan
Created : October 30 , 2009 06:00 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ( WDCpix )
Appearing before a House panel on Thursday , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner made his best pitch for legislation granting the White House broad new powers to seize Wall Street firms when their collapse might torpedo others in the industry .
It did n’t go so well .
[ Congress1 ] A number of Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee unfurled a laundry list of charges against the proposal , including the prominent concern that the bill would empower the president — and future presidents — with unlimited bailout authority to prop up “ too - big - to - fail ” institutions at the expense of taxpayers .
“ Mr. Secretary , I ’m not a man that fears this administration or you , ” Rep. Paul Kanjorski ( D - Pa. ) told Geithner .
“ But I do fear the accumulation of power exercised by someone in the future that can be extraordinary . ”
Rep. Brad Sherman ( D - Calif . ) echoed those concerns , arguing that the bill represents “ the most unprecedented transfer of power to the executive branch to make decisions about both spending and taxes in history — all without congressional approval . ”
The tone of the comments could foreshadow a tough road ahead , not only for the White House , but for Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) , who introduced legislation this week that grants the Treasury ’s request to broaden the president ’s “ resolution authority . ”
The bill is one of the final pieces of the finance - reform puzzle that Frank has been putting together all year .
But by conceding most of the administration ’s requests , the Massachusetts Democrat — who asked no questions of Geithner Thursday — has riled others on his panel , who want to see more taxpayer protections in the bill .
Frank ’s proposal would create an oversight commission to monitor and regulate Wall Street ’s investment houses and other non-bank institutions to ensure that they ’re on solid footing .
Federal regulators could , for example , force companies to increase capital reserves or decrease the amount of debt they ’re holding , if the scenario was deemed a threat to topple the firm .
The bill would also empower the White House to swoop in and dismantle failing Wall Street institutions in order to minimize the impact on the finance system as a whole — a strategy modeled on the authority of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to intervene when commercial banks are threatening to fall .
To protect taxpayers , Frank ’s bill aims to have failed - company shareholders and creditors cover the cost of the government help .
If more money is needed , taxpayers would initially pick up the tab , to be reimbursed later by an after - the - fact tax levied against other large Wall Street institutions that would presumably benefit from the stabilizing effects of the government intervention .
Supporters maintain that the proposal does not empower bailouts at all , but would simply allow the government to manage the deaths of failed companies so they do n’t drag down the financial system with them — a kind - of controlled euthanasia designed to protect consumers from the hubris of the finance industry .
“ If we do have to step in , it will be very painful for those companies ” Frank told MSNBC Thursday .
“ They will be put out of business .
The CEOs will be fired .
Shareholders will be wiped out .
We are not going to have a situation where people can expect to be bailed out and live happily ever after . ”
Geithner , for his part , denied that the proposal authorizes the White House to tap federal coffers at all .
Asked by Rep. Maxine Waters ( D - Calif. ) if the bill grants “ the authority to spend the taxpayers ’ money to bail them out if you deem that to be a good way of handling that situation , ” the Treasury secretary answered with one word : “ No . ”
Yet the House bill empowers the administration to make loans , buy assets , and invest in failing institutions if regulators determine those steps are required to prevent “ serious adverse effects on financial stability or economic conditions in the United States . ”
To do so , of course , the White House would use taxpayer funds .
And no monetary limits are specified .
And while the bill aims to recover the taxpayer dollars within 60 months of the bailout , Sherman notes that the White House would also have the authority to extend that deadline indefinitely .
“ It could be 60 years , ” he said .
That these bailout protections are limited only to those institutions whose failure is deemed a system - wide threat is another source of criticism on Capitol Hill .
Many lawmakers and finance experts contend that that stipulation creates an unfair advantage for big firms over their smaller competitors .
For example , they could get capital at lower rates if lenders know they have access to some level of federal lifeline .
That dynamic , critics argue , would act to promote “ too - big - to - fail ” institutions , rather than reining them in .
“ Why should the American people have to sit out there and see us creating mammoth organizations that nobody says we have the authority to control or limit , but we have the authority to help them when they get into trouble ? ” asked Kanjorski .
There are still other concerns .
For example , some lawmakers are attacking the proposed bailout tax on large institutions , arguing that it should be collected beforehand as a type of insurance fund , rather than imposed after a competitor goes under .
“ No more TARP .
No more bailouts , ” said Rep. Luis Gutierrez ( D - Ill . ) .
“ Let them [ the companies ] create the fund , the systemic risk fund , that will guarantee that the American taxpayer will no longer have to be involved should they cause such a crisis ever again . ”
Geithner responded that such a system would encourage even more risky behavior from the largest companies .
“ If you create a fund in advance , there ’s a risk you ’re going to create more moral hazard , ” Geithner said .
“ People will live the expectation where the government will come in and protect them .
We do n’t want to create that expectation .
That ’s why we think it ’s better to do it after the fact . ”
Meanwhile , conservatives and representatives in the finance industry are blasting the notion that solvent companies should be forced to pay to bail out the mistakes of competitors .
“ Should Ford bear the costs of compensating the taxpayer for what happened to G.M. and Chrysler ? ” asked Rep. Jeb Hensarling ( R - Texas . ) .
Gutierrez pointed out yet another concern :
Placing such broad new powers in the hands of Treasury leaders – who often arrive directly to the job from previous positions of power on Wall Street – creates the impression of the fox guarding the hen house .
“ How do we know the next secretary of the Treasury wo n’t be the former CEO of Goldman Sachs as they have been in the past ? ” he asked .
“ They seem to be interwoven , and that ’s what the American public sees .
“ They see the interconnectedness in terms of their power , their influence and always to their benefit . ”

An American couple has won a federal court case that could change the way Canada treats would - be immigrants who are HIV - positive .
Justice Sean Harrington ’s December 31 decision could be appealed before the end of January , but if it stands , it will make it easier for applicants who can afford to cover their own prescription costs to immigrate .
Canada does not have a blanket ban on HIV - positive immigrants , but most applicants are rejected by Citizenship and Immigration Canada ( CIC ) on the grounds that they would impose “ excessive demand ” on health or social services .
This is an issue for people with any number of health conditions , but it is a major concern for applicants with HIV .
The case in question concerns Ricardo Companioni , an American programmer who was initially approved to immigrate as a skilled worker .
He and his partner are both HIV - positive , and while they are expected to remain healthy for at least the next 10 years , the period that CIC considers , their drugs cost a combined $ 33,500 every year .
The couple promised to cover their own costs if they could not obtain employer health insurance and showed that they had half a million dollars in assets , but were still rejected based on excessive demand .
“ I was really shocked that they rejected the application , especially at that stage of the game , ” says Companioni .
“ Why did n’t they reject the application sooner , before they made us do all this other stuff , get notarized letters , on and on ? ”
On the advice of a Toronto lawyer , Michael Battista , Companioni and Grover decided to appeal .
Thanks to Justice Harrington ’s decision , their case will be sent back to another officer for consideration .
But the decision has broader implications , because it extends a 2005 Supreme Court decision on excessive demand .
In Hilewitz v Canada , a family was refused permanent residence on the grounds that their disabled son would impose an excessive demand on social services .
The family had promised to place their son in private care .
Ruling in favour of the family , the court held that CIC had to take into account each applicant ’s individual circumstances before refusing them based on excessive demand .
Justice Harrington ’s new decision extends the Hilewitz reasoning from social services to prescription drug costs .
“ This changes the law for people with HIV in a beneficial way because , previous to this , their willingness , their capacity to finance their prescription medication themselves was not considered by Immigration , ” says Battista .
“ That ’s a good thing , because in my experience , having HIV was almost always an automatic refusal , just on the mere potential to access provincial drug plans . ”
The decision could still be appealed though , and Companioni is not sure what he will do if that happens .
“ I would like to [ continue in court ] but not if it ’s going to cost a lot of money , because I ’ve already spent $ 10,000 .
Here I am two years later and I still do n’t have my visa , ” he says .
“ But I understand that the law ca n’t change or move forward unless people are willing to go to court . ”
In fact , quiet changes may already be underway .
Even though the Hilewitz decision was restricted to social services , John Norquay , an immigration lawyer at the HIV and AIDS Legal Clinic of Ontario ( HALCO ) who formally intervened in the Companioni case , says that immigration officers have been applying it to prescription drug costs .
Some HIV - positive applicants may already have been admitted to Canada based on Hilewitz , but so far Norquay is only aware of incomplete cases .
Beyond these technical issues , questions remain about the constitutionality of the excessive demand clause .
The Supreme Court could have addressed this in the Hilewitz case , but as higher courts often do , it chose to rule on a narrower question instead .
That does n’t mean that another case will not call the clause into question though , and HALCO and other organizations are getting ready .
“ Our position is still that the excessive demand provision is overly broad , and that it ’s essentially unjustifiably discriminatory , ” says Norquay .
“ Because the grounds that they are refusing people on — a medical condition — is so strongly related to disability , which is a prohibited ground of discrimination , we think there is probably some angle to litigate this .
We ’re still in the early stages of planning what the right strategy is for that . ”

If the first year of President Barack Obama 's foreign policy were a law firm in Charles Dickens 's London , it would have a name like Bumble , Stumble and Skid .
It began with apologies to the Muslim world that went nowhere , a doomed attempt to beat Israel into line , utopian pleas to abolish nuclear weapons , unreciprocated concessions to Russia , and a curt note to the British to take back the bust of Winston Churchill that had graced the Oval Office .
It continued with principled offers of serious negotiation ...
A United Nations report on climate change that has been lambasted for its faulty research is under new attack for yet another instance of what its critics say is sloppy science -- adding to a growing scandal that has undermined the credibility of scientists and policymakers who back the U.N. 's findings about global warming .
In the Fourth Assessment Report ( AR4 ) , issued in 2007 by the U.N. 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , scientists wrote that 40 percent of the Amazon rainforest in South America was endangered by global warming .
But that assertion was discredited this week when it emerged that the findings were based on numbers from a study by the World Wildlife Federation that had nothing to do with the issue of global warming -- and that was written by a freelance journalist and green activist .
The IPCC report states that " up to 40 percent of the Amazonian forests could react drastically to even a slight reduction in precipitation " -- highlighting the threat climate change poses to the Earth .
The report goes on to say that " it is more probable that forests will be replaced by ecosystems ... such as tropical savannas . "
But it has now been revealed that the claim was based on a WWF study titled " Global Review of Forest Fires , " a paper barely related to the Amazon rainforest that was written " to secure essential policy reform at national and international level to provide a legislative and economic base for controlling harmful anthropogenic forest fires . "
EUReferendum , a blog skeptical of global warming , uncovered the WWF association .
It noted that the original " 40 percent " figure came from a letter published in the journal Nature that discussed harmful logging activities -- and again had nothing to do with global warming .
The reference to the Brazilian rainforest can be found in Chapter 13 of the IPCC Working Group II report , the same section of AR4 in which claims are made that the Himalayan glaciers are rapidly melting because of global warming .
Last week , the data leading to this claim were disproved as well , a scandal being labeled " glacier - gate " or " Himalaya - gate . "
The Himalaya controversy followed another tempest -- the disclosure of e-mails that suggested that leading global warming scientists in the U.K. and the U.S. had conspired to hide a decline in global temperatures .
" If it is true that IPCC has indeed faked numbers regarding the Amazon , or used unsubstantiated facts , then it is the third nail in the IPCC coffin in less than three months , " Andrew Wheeler , former staff director for the U.S. Senate 's Environment and Public Works Committee , told FoxNews.com .
" For years , we have been told that the IPCC peer review process is the gold standard in scientific review .
It now appears it is more of a fool 's gold process . "
Wheeler , who is now a senior vice president with B&D Consulting 's Energy , Climate and Environment Practice in Washington , said the latest scandal calls into question the " entire underpinnings " of the IPCC 's assessment and peer review process .
The U.N. did not return calls seeking comment on the scandal .
Jean - Pascal van Ypersele , vice chairman of the IPCC , was quoted in the European press as saying , " I would like to submit that this could increase the credibility of the IPCC , not decrease it .
Are n't mistakes human ?
Even the IPCC is a human institution . "
But not everyone agrees .
Ross McKitrick , a professor of economics at the University of Guleph in Ontario , said the U.N. needs to start from scratch on global warming research and make a " full accounting " of how much of its research findings have been " likewise compromised . "
McKitrick said this is needed because the U.N. acknowledged the inaccuracy of the data only now that its shortcomings have been exposed .
" They are admitting what they did only because they were caught , " he told FoxNews.com .
" The fact that so many IPCC authors kept silent all this time shows how monumental has been the breach of trust . "
Lubos Motl , a Czech physicist and former Harvard University faculty member , said the deforestation of the Amazon has occurred , but not because of global warming .
He said it was due to social and economic reasons , including the clearing of cattle pastures , subsistence agriculture , the building of infrastructure and logging .
" Such economically driven changes are surely unattractive for those of us who prefer mysterious and natural forests , " says Motl .
" But they do help the people who live in Latin America . "
The rapidly accumulating scandals surrounding climate change research appear to be driving the public away from its support for government measures to intervene .
On Wednesday , Yale University and George Mason University released a survey showing that just 57 percent of respondents believe global warming " is happening . "
That was down 14 percentage points , from 71 percent , in October 2008 .
Fifty percent of people said they were " very " or " somewhat " worried about global warming , down 13 points from two years ago .
Another poll released Monday by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press asked respondents to rank 21 issues in terms of their priority .

Public Education is Socialism
" It 's time to admit that public education operates like a planned economy , a bureaucratic system in which everybody 's role is spelled out in advance and there are few incentives for innovation and productivity .
It 's no surprise that our school system does n't improve ; it more resembles the communist economy than our own market economy . "
Albert Shanker , President , American Federation of Teachers
What is Socialism ?
I am amazed at how often my online arguments must detour to define socialism for people who vehemently support its principles yet just as vehemently deny that they are socialists .
Therefore , to head off confusion , I 'll put a working definition up front :
Socialism : " Government mandated social engineering ( shaping society or shaping individuals to conform to a societal ideal ) . "
On the political left , that especially involves economic control up to and including collective ownership and operation of commercial enterprise .
If you have a different or better definition , or if you can help me to refine mine , please let me know .
Social Engineering
Ever since public schools were first organized , various groups have used ( or attempted to use ) them to mold future citizens and thereby shape society to their own ideals .
You can probably think of a few yourself .
I bet it 's easy to think of the abuses that run counter to your own ideals .
Are you open minded enough to confess any applications by your philosophical allies ?
There are so many dimensions to ideological school content that I plan to write about them separately in Propaganda .
In addition , as agents of the state , teachers are sometimes asked to do more than teach .
State legislators are also trying to draw them into the police state and the nanny state .
See Reason Magazine 's Mental Detector , and Home Invasion .
Government Ownership
By taxing residents in advance and then giving away education at no additional charge , government is able to claim a virtual monopoly on K - 12 education in almost every school district .
The government owns the land and the buildings .
With very few exceptions , government operates the facilities and employs all of the teachers .
QED
Public education is government owned and operated , and ideologues of various stripes work continuously to effect social engineering by controlling curricula , text books etc .
Therefore , public education is socialism .
I feel like the cow in Gary Larsen 's Far Side cartoon who suddenly realizes , " Hey !
This is grass !
We 've been eating grass ! "
To defend public education , you must first prove that socialism is superior to capitalism .
You will never do that .
Every tactical claim you make about some classroom level detail will be moot because capitalism can always do better or do the same for lower cost .
Always .
We would n't allow the government to dispense religion or monopolize food , and we came to our senses in time to avoid nationalizing health care .
Why do we continue to tolerate government monopolization of K - 12 education ?
Why to we tolerate a government institution overseeing and second guessing the raising of most families ' children ?
It 's an abomination .
We should kill it .
Total government control is too extreme .
A system where government pays while free enterprise owns and operates it is a much more balanced and moderate compromise between the society 's collective interests and citizen 's individual liberties .
Unintended Consequences
Is it any wonder that all of today 's public education problems look just like the plagues on every socialized business ever to exist anywhere ?
It has big , self - perpetuating bureaucracy and large , centralized facilities instead of smaller , convenient ones .
It induces uniformity and inhibits variety .
Costs are high , but many facilities and equipment are poorly maintained and wages are low .
Tedious teacher certification selects the bureaucratic and protects them from competition from the intelligent .
Read Thomas Sowell 's article .
Resource allocation is heavily unbalanced toward the politically strong , and there 's a go - to - hell attitude toward everyone else .
There are shortages : overcrowding and lack of materials both trivial and critical .
Employees are unhappy
Customers ( parents ) are unhappy
Powerful , entrenched political organizations like the teachers ' union ( moguls ) shriek continuously about the unknown dangers of changing to anything else .
If you ask me , their fear of structural change makes them way too conservative .
Perhaps worst of all , a politicized system compromises teaching by adding various social engineering and police tasks to teachers ' job descriptions , and the control is becoming more centralized every year .
Is it any wonder that the organizational structure and delivery mode are mostly unchanged after almost two centuries ?
How many generations of America 's disadvantaged must suffer the cycle of ignorance begetting poverty before education 's self serving elite confess that the solution is in liberty , not bureaucracy ?
America needs a radical liberal to liberate American schools the way Margaret Thatcher liberated Britain 's nationalized industries in the 1980s .
Free Market Power
A competitive free market will give many immediate and far ranging benefits , some going far beyond education :
Economy :
If we were wise enough to reduce the government 's involvement to just investigating reported fraud and recording quarterly enrollment ( not daily or hourly attendance taken by hand like the idiotic bureaucracy does now ) , we could then eliminate 99 % of the government education bureaucracy , thereby eliminating over 50 % of the cost of K - 12 education in this country .
Trimming the bloated bureaucracy would yield tax cuts , higher teacher salaries , and improved facilities / equipment in schools .
Secondary economic effects : Reforming a major segment of our economy would spread economic dividends far and wide .
Putting all of those former bureaucrats to work in productive enterprises ( like picking lettuce ) would fuel explosive economic growth all around .
Government waste is mind boggling , and every year we allow that waste in education costs all of us dearly .
Investment Induction : Private enterprise buys its own land , buildings and equipment .
That means no more tax levies to build new schools .
Not only that , but most communities will get a huge , one - time windfall when it auctions off all of its schools and the land under them .
Improved Facilities : Private Enterprise tends to buy better stuff and take better care of it , at least when and where it makes a difference .
Government stuff tends to be crap , unless they paid too much for it .
If you ever see top quality government property , then you should ask how much it cost , but first make sure you are sitting down .
Liberty : Consumers rule directly over what they choose to buy , voting with their feet and their dollars .
It is the most free and democratic system devised by human kind .
Motivation : Entrepreneurs are motivated not only by the quest for profit but by the risk of bankruptcy ( Note : The profit margin in any sector tends to be proportional to its perceived level of risk ) .
Managers must tread a fine line between cutting costs and maintaining high quality .
Contrarily , in government , bureaucrats are motivated to build as big of an agency under themselves as they can .
Big departments mean promotions , and spending all of one 's budget is rewarded by increased funding in subsequent years .
Culling : Unnecessary or overly costly versions of goods and services are ruthlessly driven out of existence by bankruptcy or submission to competing management .
That includes schools that yield to extreme activists , unlike public school boards that can be compromised by special interest groups and just go on taxing .
In government , unpopular goods and services persist year in and year out as politicians make promises they can't keep , and bureaucrats waste ever bigger bundles of money building ever expanding empires to fail to solve problems they themselves created , and then tell taxpayers to cough up another lung to pay for the same things they were supposed to get from the last tax increase .
Participation : Even apathetic parents will need to make an occasional decision , inducing them to pay at least some attention .
The odds are high that they 'll stumble into a school that encourages them further .
Structural Evolution :
The system will become much more dynamic than when centrally controlled , rapidly adapting to new technologies and other changes .
Government inertia is mind boggling , and its strangle hold on education is costing our society dearly .
See Innovation .
Diversification : Many providers can bring many variations of a product or service to market simultaneously to satisfy a wide variety of tastes .
In government , one complex compromise is imposed on nearly everyone , and it satisfies almost nobody .
With a free system , we would no longer be saddled with a lowest common denominator curriculum designed to offend nobody .
Instead , we could give full flower to each and every culture that has a following .
A free system will promote a wide variety to choose from .
Instead of everyone being stuck with their school board 's decision on whether to have a football team or a theater program ( or both ) , each family will be free to choose a school that caters to its own tastes .
As long as government is n't dictating design choices , it does n't force consensus where none is needed .
Peace :
When every family can get what it wants , then none will need to force their preferences on others just to get something for themselves .
The school board fights over religion and budgetary trade - offs should end forever .
What about charter schools ?
They 're a slight reversal of government centralization , but they are still at the mercy of government ( see Reason 's " Threatened by Success " ) .
Therefore , charter schools merely turn back the clock a few years without curing the fundamental flaw in the system :
As long as government owns and operates the schools , education decisions will be driven by political dynamics to the detriment of prosperity and independent citizenship .
Government is like ivy ; merely trimming it back is but a temporary respite from its stranglehold .
The signs of government 's willingness to incrementally creep into charter programs are already appearing .
Just keep watching , and you 'll realize that charter schools merely demonstrate the economic benefits of independence ; they are not a permanent , long term solution .
Charter schools are an improvement , so they 're worth having , but they should not deter us from demanding the correct solution of total , irrevocable privatization .
Why can't public and private coexist , as with colleges ?
When I was younger , I could n't understand why anyone would pay big bucks for a private college when public was available for next to nothing .
Only later did I realize that not everyone could get into top public universities , that I had been very fortunate to get high test scores and grades in one of the very best public school districts in the nation .
At the college level , public and private coexist , but there are some special forces at work , and still there are cracks :
There have been extreme shortages at the few public universities that have high rankings .
If you can't qualify , then paying dearly for an obscure private college is a way to get a good education in spite of weak scores .
Public universities are under some pressure from privates , so some are not as horrible as their K - 12 counterparts .
pressure from privates , so some are not as horrible as their K - 12 counterparts .
Public universities are n't as " free " as K - 12 schools ; they charge some fees and sometimes tuition .
Truancy laws do n't force people to go to college based on age .
People are free to work first and go to college later , if ever .
A college education has a shorter payback period .
Snobbery : Some families simply do n't want their kids mixing with riff raff .
They can control that somewhat in K - 12 by living in exclusive suburbs , but college is a regional mixture .
Government and other institutions offer grants and loans that students can take to private colleges , even religious ones .
So I turn the question back at whomever asks it : Government grants money to students to go to private college , so why do n't we do the same thing for K - 12 ?
Where public universities are highly regarded , they are horribly expensive .
While I attended UC Berkeley , I was shocked to learn that its budget per student was higher than Stanford's .
Of course , that included all of the bureaucracy .
Berkeley 's overhead was much , much more than Stanford's .
The Berkeley is only able to be as decent as it is because it is fabulously costly to the taxpayers of California .
Ironically , it was because of California 's high taxes that I took myself and my knowledge elsewhere as soon as I started earning above average money in my career .
Perhaps the State of Washington should thank California for first financing my education and then driving me out .

me : I ’m dying .
Victor :
You ’re not dying .
You have a cold .
me : I have hemorrhagic fever .
Victor : Did you just make that up ?
me : No , I ’m deadly serious .
First of all , I have a fever , and last night I had a nosebleed , and now my teeth are bleeding .
Victor : I ’m pretty sure teeth can’t bleed .
me : My gums then .
Whatever .
The point is that I ’m hemorrhaging internally .
Probably to death .
Victor : I think you ’re confusing hemorrhagic fever with gingivitis again .
me : I do n’t have gingivitis .
Victor :
Well you also do n’t have hemorrhagic fever .
me : It feels kind of like the Ebola Virus .
But like , totally worse .
Victor :
Where are all the forks ?
me : I think I ’m bleeding out of my eyeballs .
Victor :
Try to do it over the sink .
Seriously , why do n’t we ever have any clean forks ?
me : My nose just fell off .
Victor :
Why are all these dirty dishes in the washer ?
Why would you go to the trouble of loading the dishwasher and not just start it ?
me : I ca n’t feel my legs .
Victor : Great .
Now we have no forks .
Way to go , hon .
me : My heart just stopped and now I ’m craving brains .
Victor :
And of course we do n’t even have plastic forks .
If you use all the damn plastic forks you need to tell me so I can buy more .
me : … braaaaaains …..
Victor :
How the fuck am I supposed to eat spaghetti with a spoon ?
me : * gurgle * * associated sounds of decomposition *
Victor : Motherfucker .
So I guess I ’ll have to go buy the forks since you ’re too sick ?
me : … braaaaaaai -
Victor : Fine .
I ’m taking your car .
I ’ll be back in a bit .
me : * sigh *
Disclaimer :
Only the first few sentences of this post have actually happened .
The rest is a reenactment of what I assume will happen later this afternoon when Victor realizes that we do n’t have any forks and I die of spite neglect whatever made those Nazi ’s explode at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark .
I ’m pretty sure that was hemorrhagic fever too .
Comment of the day : Just be thankful it ’s not * Hemorrhoidic * Fever .
Cleaning up exploding brains would be the LEAST of your worries .

AFTER the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004 , aid agencies clubbed together to review their efforts .
The main conclusion was sobering : “ It was local people themselves who provided almost all immediate life - saving action . ”
But “ international agencies often brushed local capacities aside . ”
This lesson is relevant to Haiti now .
Focused on raising money , bedevilled by disputes over logistical precedence and haunted by fears that the country is too weak to help itself , the Haiti operation shows signs of becoming an aid stampede .
Like the tsunami , the earthquake has produced an outpouring of generosity amounting to $ 1 billion so far .
The experience of the tsunami suggests that agencies will not be able to spend it .
Nine months on , governments and non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) had disbursed just 39 % of the money they had promised to spend .
A French NGO , Médecins Sans Frontières ( MSF ) , stopped emergency fund - raising , saying it did not need more .
It was criticised for this , but in retrospect was justified .
As the tsunami evaluation put it , “ allocation and programming … were driven by the extent of public and media interest , and by the unprecedented funding available , rather than by assessment and need . ”
This seems to be happening in Haiti , too ; MSF has again asked people to switch donations to its general fund .
Viagra , ski jackets and Father Christmas costumes were all sent to tsunami victims .
Indonesia destroyed 75 tonnes of out - of - date medicine .
And sometimes aid was worse than merely useless .
There was a fashion for financing new fishing boats after the tsunami .
A UN agency found that a fifth of the boats given to Sri Lanka were unseaworthy .
Much reconstruction work was shoddy .
A private company with no medical experience built health centres in the Indonesian province of Aceh .
Because reconstruction work takes longer to organise than emergency relief , it has to begin right away .
Sri Lanka built 40,000 transitional shelters — something between a tent and a proper house — in six months .
The tsunami also shows why someone has to be in charge .
The aid operation worked best in countries , such as Malaysia , that have the most effective governments .
Aceh , the tsunami's epicentre , had huge problems because the destruction was worst there , the province had been riven by rebellion in the 1990s and 180 different NGOs were operating there at one point .
Organisational problems may be worse in Haiti , which before the earthquake had more NGOs per head than anywhere else in the Americas .
But Aceh managed to bring a measure of control to the flood of aid by setting up a special agency .
Paul Collier , an economist at Oxford University who has advised Haiti 's government , says it and the UN should do something similar .

Geht es nach Bundesfamilienministerin Köhler , sollte es der Staat künftig generell unterstützen , wenn in einer Familie für einander Verantwortung übernommen wird .
Traditionelle Rollenmuster will Köhler jedoch nicht fördern - stattdessen will sie sich für Alleinerziehende und flexible Arbeitszeitmodelle einsetzen .
Köhler will Verantwortung belohnen - in welcher Form man diese übernimmt , sollte ihrer Ansicht nach jedoch egal sein .
( Foto : dpa )
Bundesfamilienministerin Kristina Köhler will Familien nicht vorschreiben , wie sie leben sollen .
Es sei nicht Aufgabe des Staates , " ein mit einer bestimmten Rollenverteilung verbundenes Familienmodell zu fördern " , schrieb die 32 - jährige CDU - Politikerin in einem Beitrag für das Nachrichtenmagazin " Focus " .
Die traditionelle Familie solle nicht mehr bevorzugt werden .
Der Staat solle vielmehr die " Übernahme von Verantwortung unterstützen - egal in welcher Form dies geschieht " , schrieb sie .
Sie setzte sich damit klar von Hoffnungen mancher Unionsmitglieder auf eine konservative Positionierung der Ministerin ab .
Die staatliche Hilfe für Alleinerziehende soll nach dem Willen von Köhler ausgeweitet werden .
Trotz aller Unterstützung sei diese Gruppe immer noch von Armut bedroht , sagte sie der " Frankfurter Allgemeinen Sonntagszeitung " ( FAS ) .
Es gebe unter ihnen viele Hartz - IV - Empfänger .
" Im Moment bekommen 300.000 Eltern den Kinderzuschlag .
Wir wollen die Gruppe erweitern . "
Mit dem Zuschlag wird verhindert , dass Berufstätige , die knapp über Hartz - IV - Niveau verdienen , wegen ihrer Kinder unter dieses Niveau fallen .
Teilzeitarbeit bei vorübergehendem Gehaltsverzicht
Zudem plant Köhler , das Grenzalter für den Unterhaltsvorschuss von zwölf auf 14 Jahre zu erhöhen .
Mit diesem Zuschuss geht der Staat für solche unterhaltspflichtigen Väter in Vorlage , die nicht für ihr Kind aufkommen .
Wer neben dem Beruf Angehörige pflegt , soll nach Köhlers Ansicht künftig auch die Möglichkeit bekommen , weniger zu arbeiten .
Köhler plant eine Regelung , die Teilzeitarbeit bei vorübergehendem Gehaltsverzicht vorsieht .
So könnte jemand , der einen Angehörigen pflegt , nur 50 Prozent arbeiten , aber 70 Prozent seines Gehaltes bekommen , damit er davon einigermaßen leben kann , erläuterte Köhler der " FAS " .
" Wenn er wieder zu 100 Prozent arbeitet , weil die Pflegezeit vorbei ist , verdient er 20 Prozent weniger , bis das zusätzlich bezahlte Geld zurückgeflossen ist . "
Dem Staat entstünden so keine zusätzlichen Kosten , sagte die Ministerin , die darüber auch mit dem Deutschen Industrie - und Handelskammertag im Gespräch ist .

Mean improvement scores were not available in five of the 47 trials ( Figure 1 ) .
Specifically , four sertraline trials involving 486 participants and one citalopram trial involving 274 participants were reported as having failed to achieve a statistically significant drug effect , without reporting mean HRSD scores .
We were unable to find data from these trials on pharmaceutical company Web sites or through our search of the published literature .
These omissions represent 38 % of patients in sertraline trials and 23 % of patients in citalopram trials .
Analyses with and without inclusion of these trials found no differences in the patterns of results ; similarly , the revealed patterns do not interact with drug type .
The purpose of using the data obtained from the FDA was to avoid publication bias , by including unpublished as well as published trials .
Inclusion of only those sertraline and citalopram trials for which means were reported to the FDA would constitute a form of reporting bias similar to publication bias and would lead to overestimation of drug–placebo differences for these drug types .
Therefore , we present analyses only on data for medications for which complete clinical trials ' change was reported .
The dataset comprised 35 clinical trials ( five of fluoxetine , six of venlafaxine , eight of nefazodone , and 16 of paroxetine ) involving 5,133 patients , 3,292 of whom had been randomized to medication and 1,841 of whom had been randomized to placebo .
Confirming earlier analyses [ 2 ] , but with a substantially larger number of clinical trials , weighted mean improvement was 9.60 points on the HRSD in the drug groups and 7.80 in the placebo groups , yielding a mean drug–placebo difference of 1.80 on HRSD improvement scores .
Although the difference between these means easily attained statistical significance ( Table 2 , Model 3a ) , it does not meet the three - point drug–placebo criterion for clinical significance used by NICE .
Represented as the standardized mean difference , d , mean change for drug groups was 1.24 and that for placebo 0.92 , both of extremely large magnitude according to conventional standards .
Thus , the difference between improvement in the drug groups and improvement in the placebo groups was 0.32 , which falls below the 0.50 standardized mean difference criterion that NICE suggested .
The amounts of change for drug and placebo groups varied widely around their respective means , Q ( 34 ) s = 51.80 and 74.59 , p-values < 0.05 , and I 2 s = 34.18 and 54.47 .
Thus , the mean change exhibited in trials provides a poor description of results , and moderator models are indicated .
Baseline HRSD scores , improvement , and sample sizes in drug and placebo groups for each clinical trial are reported in Table 1 .
As in the FDA files , studies are identified by protocol numbers .
The data from these trials can be obtained from the FDA using FOIA requests and citing the medication name and protocol number .
The table also includes references to published reports of the data abstracted from the FDA files , when they could be found ( using the search methods described above ) .
Studies in which data only from selected sites of a multisite study were published are not cited in the table .
We have also excluded published reports in which dropouts have been removed from the data .
For each of the trials , the pharmaceutical companies had submitted to the FDA data in which attrition was handled by carrying forward the last observation carried forward ( LOCF ) on the patient , which was the basis in all cases of the FDA review .
These data and their corresponding citations appear in the table .
Even in the LOCF data , there sometimes are some minor discrepancies between the published version and the version submitted to the FDA .
In some cases , for example , the N is slightly larger in the published studies than in the data reported to the FDA .
Further complicating this problem is the fact that occasionally , the company has published a trial more than once , with slight discrepancies in the data between publications .
Data in the table are those reported to the FDA .
Drug and Initial Severity Trends in Change
Moderator analyses examined whether drug type , duration of treatment , and baseline severity ( HRSD ) scores related to improvement .
Although drug type and duration of treatment were unrelated to improvement , the drug versus placebo difference remained significant , and amount of improvement was a function of baseline severity ( Table 2 , Model 1a ) .
Specifically , the amount of improvement depended markedly on the quadratic function of baseline severity , but the linear function of baseline severity interacted with assignment to drug versus placebo ( Model 1 b ) .
Specifically , as Figure 2 shows , improvement from baseline operated as a ∩ - shaped curvilinear function in relation to baseline severity , with those at the lowest and highest levels experiencing smaller gains , whereas those in - between experienced larger gains ; the slope for placebo declined as severity increased , whereas the slope for drug was slightly positive .
The difference between drug and placebo exceeded NICE 's 0.50 standardized mean difference criterion at comparisons exceeding 28 in baseline severity .
Further analyses indicated that drug type did not moderate this affect .
Although venlafaxine and paroxetine had significantly ( p < 0.001 ) larger weighted mean effect sizes comparing drug to placebo conditions ( ds = 0.42 and 0.47 , respectively ) than fluoxetine ( d = 0.22 ) or nefazodone ( 0.21 ) , these differences disappeared when baseline severity was controlled .

For all but one sample , baseline HRSD scores were in the very severe range according to the criteria proposed by the American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) [ 21 ] and adopted by NICE [ 1 ] .
The one exception derived from a fluoxetine trial that had two samples , one with HRSD scores in the very severe range and the other with scores in the moderate range .
Because the low - HRSD condition might be considered an outlier , the analyses were performed again without it .
Results continued to reveal that drug versus placebo assignment interacted with initial severity to influence improvement ; yet the curvilinear function of the baseline was no longer significant , although group continued to interact with the linear component ( Table 2 , Model 2c ) .
As Figure 3 shows , drug efficacy did not change as a function of initial severity , whereas placebo efficacy decreased as initial severity increased ; values again exceeded NICE 's 0.50 standardized mean difference criterion at comparisons greater than 28 in baseline severity .
This final model comprising three simultaneous study dimensions ( viz. , drug vs. placebo , baseline , and the interaction ) explained 51.45 % of the variation in improvement .
Although this model was in a formal sense incorrectly specified ( Q Residual ( 64 ) = 96.07 , p < 0.01 ) , when a random - effects constant was instead assumed , the same pattern of results remained in this more statistically conservative mixed - effects model .
A final model that incorporated even the drug types for which only some trials were available confirmed these trends .

Figure 4 displays raw mean differences between drug and placebo as a function of initial severity , rising as a linear function of baseline severity levels ( Table 2 , Models 3a and 3 b ) even though , almost without exception , the scores were in the very severe range of the criteria proposed by APA [ 21 ] .
Yet when these data are considered in conjunction with those in Figure 3 , it seems clear that the increased difference is due to a decrease in improvement in placebo groups , rather than an increase in drug groups .

A visual inspection of Figure 4 suggests that studies ' effects are fairly evenly distributed above and below the NICE criterion ( 3 ) but that most small studies have high baselines and show large effects .
Although sample size ( N ) was negatively linked to the drug- versus - placebo differences ( β = − 0.34 , p = 0.003 ) , when mean baseline severity values are controlled , this effect disappears and the baseline effect remains significant .
The interaction of sample size with baseline severity was marginally significant , p = 0.0586 , and the pattern indicated that baseline severity was somewhat more predictive for smaller than for larger studies .
Yet , because simple - slopes analyses revealed that baseline scores were significantly predictive even for the largest studies , study differences in sample size would appear to qualify neither the pattern of results we have reported nor their interpretation .
Examination of publication bias often relies on inspections of effect sizes in relation to sample size ( or inverse variance ) [ 22 ] .
A funnel plot of the data depicted in Figure 4 indicates that the larger studies in the FDA datasets tended to show smaller drug effects than smaller studies .
Although such a pattern might be construed as indicating a publication or other reporting bias , our use of complete datasets precludes this possibility , unless some small trials were not reported despite the FDA Guidelines [ 6 ] .
A more plausible explanation is that trials with higher baseline scores tended to be small .
In any case , funnel - plot inspections assume that there is only one population effect size that can be tracked by a comparison between drug and placebo groups , whereas the current investigation shows that these effects vary widely and that the magnitude of the difference depends on initial severity values .
Consequently , funnel - plot inspection is much less appropriate in the present context .
Unfortunately , there are no other tools yet available to detect publication or other reporting biases in the face of effect modifiers .
MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann pulled no punches in criticizing Rush Limbaugh and Pat Robertson over their eyebrow - raising comments in the wake of the devastating earthquake in Haiti , now estimated to have taken the lives of “ hundreds of thousands ” of people .
“ Even the worst of us in this political mosh pit of the early 21st century can stop on occasion in grief and human sympathy and mourning , or just in self - preservation , ” Olbermann said on Countdown Wednesday night .
“ Not Rush Limbaugh , and not Pat Robertson . ”

Olbermann took Limbaugh to task for the radio host ’s comment earlier Wednesday that the Obama administration would benefit politically from the disaster in Haiti because they would “ use this to burnish their … credibility with the black community , in … the both light - skinned and dark - skinned black community in this country .
It ’s made to order for them . ”
But Olbermann saved his most scathing comments for Pat Robertson , the televangelist who said on Wednesday that Haiti ’s suffering was the result of a “ deal with the devil ” that Haitian rebels made when fighting French colonial rule .
Olbermann referred to Robertson as “ mister , ” rather than “ reverend , ” because “ it is laughable now to try to call him reverend .
“ Sir , because of your tone - deafness and your delight in human misery and your dripping , self - satisfied , holier - than - thou senile crap , I ’m likelier to believe now that you are the devil , ” Olbermann told Robertson .
The prime - time news host ended his segment with this :
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Mr. Robertson , Mr. Limbaugh , your lives are not worth those of the lowest , meanest , poorest of those victims still lying under that rubble in Haiti tonight .
You serve no good , you serve no God .
You inspire only stupidity and hatred , and I would wish you to hell .
But knowing how empty your souls must be for you to be able to say such things in a time of such pain , I suspect the vacant , purposeless lives you both live now are hell enough already . ”

Have Western attitudes to the rise of China been based on wishful thinking ?
China 's increasingly tough approach to diplomacy is leading governments in the U.S. and in Europe to rethink their policies towards China .
Western leaders are starting to question some of the optimistic assumptions on which those policies have been based .
Until very recently , many Western bankers , business people and politicians were broadly optimistic about the rise of China .
They assumed that as China became more developed it would become more Western .
As it integrated into the global economy its society would open up , it would play a constructive role in multilateral institutions , and it would help Western governments sort out key foreign policy challenges .
China 's leaders seemed to understand that their top priority - the economic development of their country - required friendly relations with other major powers , notably the U.S .
There has also been a pessimistic view of China 's rise , held by people in the U.S. defence establishment , some right - wing think - tanks and the human rights lobbies .
They have argued that as China develops it is becoming more assertive , less willing to compromise with the West , less welcoming to foreign investors and more repressive politically .
Like other rising powers throughout history , the pessimists have thought , China would disrupt the international system .
They have pointed to China 's soaring defence budget as support for their case .
Of course , both views have been based on truth .
China is not a monolithic entity .
Within the leadership , many institutions and personal and ideological factions compete for power .
But until recently the optimists dominated Western views of China .
I was an optimist when , two years ago , I wrote ( with Katinka Barysch ) Can Europe and China Shape a New World Order ?
Our report argued that China was evolving into the " responsible global stakeholder " that Robert Zoellick had urged it to become when he was US deputy secretary of state .
Over the past year the optimists have found it increasingly difficult to sustain their view .
There are still examples of China being helpful - for example , it has sent ships to catch pirates in the Indian Ocean , and engaged in G20 discussions - but overall it has become a much pricklier partner .
China 's foreign policy has become more assertive .
Its claims to the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh have become more vociferous .
It is being less helpful to the West over the Iranian nuclear problem - and has become more hostile than Russia to further sanctions on Iran .
Its treatment of the EU is sometimes contemptuous - it cancelled one summit and regularly punishes countries whose leaders meet the Dalai Lama in an official setting .
Western governments have suffered increasingly powerful cyber-attacks that have been traced to mainland China .
China 's political system has become more repressive .
Moves to introduce greater democracy into local government and the Communist Party have faltered .
Dissidents are facing a tougher time .
In December Liu Xiaobo was sentenced to 11 years in prison for organising a pro-democracy petition .
China 's economic policies have become more nationalist .
Many foreign investors in China complain about exclusion from key markets and unofficial forms of discrimination .
China 's manipulation of its currency downwards , driven by a mercantilist desire to boost exports and foreign currency reserves , exacerbates the problem of global economic imbalances and is fuelling protectionist sentiment in other countries .
Recent events have brought home to public opinion in the West how China is changing .
At the Copenhagen climate change conference in December , China worked hard behind the scenes to scupper the kind of deal that Western countries and many poor nations wanted ( at one point it sent a deputy foreign minister to negotiate with Barack Obama ) .
And this month Google has said that it may leave China because of cyber attacks on its business and increasingly stringent internet censorship .
If one talks to people in China about the troubled state of relations between China and the West , many of them are baffled .
They know little of the incidents that have caused problems , which are unreported in the Chinese media .
They say that most Chinese people are focused on domestic issues - such as jobs , pollution and soaring house prices - rather than foreign policy .
So the source of China 's tougher line seems to be the leadership , rather than pressure from the people .
Three factors may explain why hard - liners are winning more arguments within the leadership .
China 's economy has performed impressively during the global recession , growing by 9 per cent in 2009 .
Meanwhile the Western economic model is viewed as discredited .
China 's leaders would not be human if they did not feel a bit cocky - especially since they have been on the receiving end of patronising lectures from Western leaders about the superiority of Western capitalism .
The emerging super - power feels it has the right to assert its own interests more forcefully .
Yet China 's leaders feel insecure .
The unrest in Tibet ( in 2008 ) and Xinjiang ( in 2009 ) caught them by surprise .
Rapid economic growth and urbanisation are creating huge social tensions .
Endemic corruption makes local party bureaucrats unpopular .
The booming housing market - fuelled by the government selling land to property speculators - means that many young middle class people cannot afford to buy flats .
Few Chinese people want Western - style democracy , but the leaders know their legitimacy is built on thin foundations .
Hence their reluctance to allow a more open society .
The current leadership , led by Hu Jintao and Wen Xiabao , is due to hand over to the ' fifth generation ' of leaders in 2012 .
There is much manoeuvring for position .
The machinations within Zhongnanhai , where the top communists live and work , are impossible to decipher .
But some key figures seem to be pushing a nationalist line in order to boost their support among party cadres .
In China , as in most countries , nationalist policies can be popular .
American attitudes to China are palpably hardening .
At some point this year the US may declare China to be a currency manipulator and then apply protectionist measures .
The EU finds it very difficult to get tough with anyone .
But European leaders are increasingly critical of China , at least in private .
China 's leaders should not assume that European markets will remain open to them indefinitely .
China 's attitude to international relations is ultra-realist .
It will take what it can get , while respecting power and facts .
But China 's leaders may have miscalculated by underestimating the impact of their harder line on Washington and European capitals .
How well - informed are the people in Jonghnanhai ?
Do they receive objective reports on how Chinese words and actions impact on Western political systems ?
And do they care what Western leaders think ?
Undoubtedly , there are Chinese leaders who stand by the premise of the ' peaceful rise ' slogan - that China 's economic development requires some modesty in international affairs and good relations with the West .
When the most senior leaders see that their current approach may spur several powerful countries to work together to contain China , they may wish to modify their course .
But if they maintain the hard line for a prolonged period , China 's relations with the West will become very tense .
Free trade and the world economy may well suffer .
The thundering knock came early in the morning .
It was 6.30 am .
Without waiting for an answer the security chain across the door was smashed from its fittings .
Feet thundered up the staircase .
The five children , all under the age of 10 , were alarmed to be woken from their sleep by the dozen burly strangers who burst into their bedrooms , switched on the lights and shouted at them to get up .
This is not a police state .
It is Manchester in supposedly civilised Britain in the 21st century .
There is a clue to what this is about in the names of the children : Nardin , who is 10 ; Karin who is seven ; the three - year - old twins Bishoy and Anastasia , and their one - year - old baby sister Angela .
Their parents , Hany and Samah Mansour , are Coptic Christians who fled to the UK after a campaign of persecution by a group of Islamic fundamentalists in Egypt whose friends in the secret police tortured Hany .
But even though six Coptic Christians were shot dead by Muslim extremists only last week in a town not far from their home , the British Government has decided that it does not believe them .
And so Britain 's deportation police have launched another of their terrifying dawn raids on sleeping children .
Neighbours , awoken by the noise , tumble out bleary - eyed into the street , to find out what is going on .
They look on , visibly shocked , as the family they have come to regard as friends in the tight - knit community of Moss Side over the past four years are bundled into vans and taken away .
" They woke the children up ; they did n't even allow my wife to do it , " says Hany Mansour .
" They gave her a few big laundry bags and told her she had 30 minutes to pack .
She and I were not allowed to talk to one another .
They kept me downstairs .
When she was brought down they took me upstairs .
The most scary thing as that when we were put in the vans my wife and I did n't even know if we were being taken to the same place . "

No one knows how many children have been snatched from their beds in this way in Britain in the past year .
But the Immigration Minister Phil Woolas admitted in a letter to a concerned MP recently that more than 1,300 children were detained at three immigration removal centres in the UK during the 15 months between July 2008 and September 2009 .
Some 889 children have been detained for more than 28 days in the past five years .
In each of those cases an immigration minister or a judge had to sign a new authorisation every four weeks for their continued detention .
The UK now has one of the worst records in Europe for detaining children .
" Are we in prison , Dad ? " 10 - year - old Nardin Mansour asked her father , when they were taken into a police cell block in Birmingham , where they had stopped for a lavatory break on their way to a deportation centre near Gatwick Airport .
Around her were prisoners in handcuffs .
" No , we are not prisoners , " Hany told his daughter .
But she could be forgiven for not believing him .
The immigration centre which was their final destination was Yarl 's Wood in Bedfordshire .
It is surrounded by massive fences topped with barbed wire .
Its staff wear uniforms .
Child inmates have to pass through between eight and 10 locked doors .
The children , many of whom are under the age of five , are photographed and fingerprints can be taken .
There are body searches – even of Nardin 's one - year - old baby sister – and frequent roll calls .
Children are required to carry identity cards with them at all times .
All of this does untold psychological damage , according to the Royal College of Paediatrics and the Royal College of Psychiatry .
Last month they joined with the equivalent body for GPs to warn that the detention of children and their families caused " significant " serious physical and psychological harm to children who are already among the most vulnerable members of the community – and who require special and humane treatment but are being accorded the exact opposite .
" All the young people I have been talking to have lingering effects , after months and even after years , " said Sheila Melzak , a consultant child psychotherapist who has worked with families in detention , at the time the three colleges made their call for the detention of children to be ended .
" It is frightening for children to see their parents in tears , " she added .
" They see adults in a high state of stress , they hear a lot of shouting and crying .
It is a highly institutionalised environment and that leads to problems with eating and sleeping and learning . "
A copy of the research on which those anxieties were based has been passed to The Independent .
It is the first study of its kind in the UK into the mental and physical health of 24 children held within a British immigration detention centre .
It shows that every single one of the children seen in Yarl 's Wood by a team of paediatricians and psychologists displayed some signs of distress and 73 per cent of children they examined had developed clinically significant emotional and behavioural problems since being detained .
None had previously had such problems .
The study 's lead authors were the consultant paediatrician Dr Ann Lorek , of the Mary Sheridan Centre for Child Health in Lambeth and the clinical psychologist Dr Kimberly Ehntholt of the Traumatic Stress Clinic in Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust .
It catalogued symptoms of depression and anxiety in every child they examined .
All the children seen by clinical psychologists presented as being disorientated , confused and frightened .
More than half , who had previously been well behaved at home and in school , had developed conduct problems .
They had been affected by a combination of factors , Dr Ehntholt believes , " including a recent deterioration in their parents ' mental health , increased fear after being suddenly placed in a detention facility , anxiety over returning to their country of origin where they may have experienced traumatic events , as well as the abrupt loss of home , school and friends " .
Eight children had lost weight since entering detention ; a two - year - old and a nine - year - old had both lost 10 per cent of their body weight .
Three were refusing to feed themselves or would only take milk .
Five children had begun bed - wetting and one was also soiling herself in the daytime since being detained .
Four had manifested a regression of language since entering detention , including one child who had become selectively mute .
The problems the children displayed included post - traumatic stress disorder , depression , anxiety , nightmares , refusal to sleep except in bed with a parent , changes in appetite and somatic symptoms like headache and stomach pain .
They showed a loss of previously - acquired cognitive skills and had developed particular problems with peer relationships .
Children were distressed at missing " real school " and at being unable to take important exams , says the study .
Many also missed important hospital appointments .
" The emotional well - being and health of many detained children is extremely vulnerable and likely to deteriorate further if exposed to additional stressors or traumatic events , " the study says .
" The risk of exposure to additional stress is high within immigration detention centres where riots , violence , hunger strikes , and incidents of deliberate self - harm , including deaths due to suicide , have been reported . "
One man committed suicide on his first night at Yarl 's Wood in the desperate hope that his 13 - year - old son would then be allowed to remain in the UK .
But this is not the only damning evidence .
Before they were sent to Yarl 's Wood , the Mansour family were detained for 18 nights at Tinsley House Immigration Removal Centre near Gatwick , despite the fact that the place has no real facilities for the detention of children .
On 18 December last year , the Chief Inspector of Prisons , Dame Anne Owers , published a highly critical report into Tinsley House after an unannounced visit to the centre at the time the Mansours were there .
" The arrangements for children and single women were now wholly unacceptable , " her visit revealed .
Indeed , things had considerable worsened since the inspectors ' previous visit .
Children continued to be detained for more than 72 hours .
They had limited access to fresh air .
Childcare and education arrangements had deteriorated because trained and dedicated staff had left .
There were continuing worries about children 's safety in a largely adult male environment .
The conduct by some of those who escorted inmates for deportation was unprofessional .
" Unnecessary force " had been used on children while removing one family .
" Overall , this is a deeply depressing report , " the Chief Inspector concluded .
" It is a wholly unacceptable state of affairs . "
It followed a report on Yarl 's Wood by the same inspectorate which concluded that " there was no evidence that children 's welfare was taken into account when making decisions about initial and continued detention " .
It highlighted the case of a child with a broken arm who was left in pain for more than a day before being taken to hospital , children with sickle cell disease being denied painkillers , children who were separated from their parents and the handcuffing of one adolescent child .

Defenders of this system say that since Britain wants to place limits on immigration to ensure that foreigners do n't abuse our asylum system it is inevitable that children are locked up .
" If people refuse to go home then detention becomes a necessity , " the Border and Immigration Minister Phil Woolas has said .
Yet it is incontestable that Government policy has become more draconian here .
Under the rules in force in 1998 , official policy was that children under 18 should only be detained " as close to removal as possible so as to ensure that families are not normally detained for more than a few days " .
But in October 2001 the Government changed that rule to allow detention without time limit .
Earlier this year planning permission was given to double the capacity of Yarl 's Wood .
Those charged with implementing the policy insist the system they run is " humane and compassionate " .
" We would much rather that those families found not to need international protection leave the UK voluntarily , " Jo Liddy , the regional director of the UK Border Agency in North West – the area responsible for the handling of the Mansour family – was quoted as saying in the South Manchester Reporter .
" Where people refuse to leave , however , it is our responsibility to enforce the decisions of the courts and send them home .
The decision to detain a family before removal only happens as a last resort , keeping the family together .
Where an enforced removal is necessary these are undertaken with extreme care treating those to be removed with courtesy and dignity . "
Friends and supporters of the Mansour children find those words laughable .
" There is not much courtesy or dignity in seeing a family of young children lined up in the street waiting to be taken away , " says Jackie Tarpey , chair of governors at the school four of the Mansour children attend , Our Lady 's RC Primary in Whalley Range , Manchester .
" It is shocking that the Home Office is trying to forcibly deport a family with five young children in this way .
Four of the children were born in the UK .
No family should have to go through the ordeal that the Mansours are being put through . "
Talk to Hany Mansour and you get some idea of the extended nature of that ordeal with its ritual of tiny humiliations .
In his quiet voice , the man who ran a prosperous shop in Luxor in Egypt before he was driven out catalogues a long list of little indignities : officers entering the house without waiting for him to answer the door ; not allowing him to speak with his wife ; not permitting his wife to wake the children ; not allowing him to help her pack ; forcing the children to leave behind treasured possessions ; putting them in separate vans and not telling them where they were going ; taking his mobile phone from him ; not permitting him a phone call from the house .
On the petty limitations went .
At the detention centre the children were body searched .
" They even searched our one - year - old baby , " he recalls .
" When I asked why , they gave no answer .
Officials asked inappropriate questions of him – whether he had been imprisoned , hurt or tortured , about whether he used drugs – in front of his children .
After three weeks at Tinsley House the family were taken to Gatwick to be put on a plane to Cairo .
" On the way to the airport we were not allowed to sit next to the children , " he says .
" A different woman officer , with a bag of sweets , sat next to each of them trying to make friends with the child .
But it did n't work .
The children started crying as soon as they saw the plane .
" Ten minutes before take - off the senior officer asked me to get on the plane .
I told him it was dangerous for us to go back to Egypt .
I said : , 'I do n't want to go .
I 'm not going to resist .
But I do n't want to go , and I will tell the pilot that . '
So he asked the children if they wanted to go and they said ' No ' .
" Then he said he could use force on me but not on the children and asked me to persuade them .
I said I would n't .
So he turned the bus round .
He was n't angry but the rest of the team were .
One of them said to me , ' So what 's your next plan ? '
I did n't answer .
I just said , ' Please leave me alone , I 'm tired . '
On the way back all the children fell asleep ; they were emotionally and physically exhausted . "
Next day the children asked if we were going home now .
" But I could n't tell them .
Then letters arrived from the children 's classmates , and books from the school .
My children were crying hard as they read the letters . "
Nardin went to phone Childline and asked for help .
" She had a long talk to them but in the end they told her there was nothing they could do .
She put the phone down sadly and asked if there was anyone else she could ring but I steered her away from that and said , ' No , let 's leave it just now . ' "
A week later a judge directed that the family should be freed and allowed to return to their home in Moss Side .
" The children did n't jump for joy that first time , " their father recalls .
" They were just bewildered . "

It is easy to agree to the idea that illegal immigrants must be removed from Britain .
But need this involve treating children with such callous indifference and even cruelty ?
The idea of dawn raids by state officials on people 's homes smacks of the kind of police state from which Britons instinctively recoil .
Political pressure is now building for an end to imprisoning children in immigration centres .
The call by the Royal Colleges of Paediatrics , General Practice , and Psychiatry for an immediate end to the practice echoes other moves .
The Children 's Commissioner , Sir Al Aynsley - Green , has conducted his own investigation into Yarl 's Wood , which painted a shocking picture of neglect and even cruelty towards children trapped behind the state 's razor - wired walls – with claims of officers laughing and making fun of inmates when they showed signs of distress or anxiety .
He too concluded that there is " substantial evidence that detention is harmful and damaging to children and young people " and said it was " extremely worrying " that more than one in three children was being held for longer than 28 days .
More than half were eventually released , suggesting their detention was unnecessary .
In the House of Commons 105 MPs have in the last few weeks signed an early day motion put down by Chris Mullin calling for an end to locking up children , noting that families with kids are among the least likely to abscond and that other countries have alternative solutions than the locking up of innocent children .
One of the signatories , the Liberal Democrat MP Dr Evan Harris , has been campaigning for three years through the Commons Joint Committee of Human Rights on alternatives to detention – such as tagging or daily reporting to a police station .
" The detention of children is absolutely wrong .
It is unnecessary , unethical and a waste of public funds , " he told The Independent .
" It is shocking that the UK is the only country in Europe that allows the indefinite detention of children ... in this prison - like environment . "
His party leader , Nick Clegg , has accused the Prime Minister , Gordon Brown , of " moral cowardice " for allowing the immigration authorities to continue to inflict what is " in effect , state - sponsored cruelty ... behind a veil of Government secrecy . "

Five months after the Mansour children were freed , the immigration police struck again .
This time the knock at their Moss Side home came at 6.15 am .
Again UK Border Agency officials entered the Mansour home without waiting for the door to be opened to them .
" They did n't give me chance to open it , " Hany Mansour reveals .
" When I got downstairs they were in the house already .
I told them I had put in a fresh claim for asylum with a new lawyer who had n't been informed that it had been declined . "
" Here 's the letter rejecting it , " the lead officer said , giving them this time two hours to pack their entire life into a few chequered laundry bags .
Many of the Mansours ' neighbours and a large number of parents at the children 's school insist that a miscarriage of justice has been perpetrated here .
Hany , a Coptic Christian , had fallen out with some Muslim business associates and had then been subjected to a campaign of persecution by a group of Islamic fundamentalists who burned his car and destroyed his house .
When he went to the police to complain , he says , he was arrested and charged with insulting Islam .
He was detained in solitary confinement for 17 days and tortured .
On his release the family fled , leaving all their belongings behind .
The local Coptic bishop paid for their flight out of Egypt .
His claim was corroborated by the medical evidence of a doctor in the UK who examined him on his arrival in Dover . "
The court did n't challenge the medical evidence that he had been tortured , " says his new solicitor Anita Vasisht , a partner at Wilson & Co Solicitors in London , who has now successfully applied for a judicial review of the case .
" In Egypt he had a boat , a bookshop and a busy shop in the Hilton hotel , " said Kim Draper , a parent - support adviser at the Mansour children 's school .
" Why would he want to give all that up and come and live in Moss Side if he was n't being persecuted ? "
The school and the neighbours mounted an effective campaign on behalf of the family , raising a 2,000 - signature petition to testify to the support of the local community for the Mansours – and using Facebook and the internet to flood the Immigration Minister Phil Woolas with pleas to allow the family indefinite leave to remain in the UK .
The campaign has been a double - edged sword , raising fears that the public attention would make the Mansours even greater candidates for persecution by Muslim extremists if they are eventually put on a plane to Egypt .
But it has all been so embarrassing for Government ministers that Home Office lawyers were instructed to ask a judge to expedite a rejection of Hany Mansour 's application for a judicial review .
" Clearly , they were hoping to bundle the family out of the country quickly , specifically because of the media interest in the case , " his lawyer , Anita Vasisht , says .
" It was a cynical political act and really shoddy behaviour . "
The judge refused the Home Office challenge and a judicial review of the Mansour family 's case will proceed in the coming weeks .
But whatever the technical rights and wrongs of Hany Mansour 's asylum situation , it is hard not to see the way the Mansour children have been treated as an affront to the traditional British sense of decency .
Four of the five children have been born in the UK .
They are entirely blameless victims whose human rights have been grossly infringed and who have already been significantly damaged by what has happened to them .
" These children are witnessing their parents in an extreme state of fear , " says Anita Vasisht .
" They are very afraid of what might happened to them if they go back to Egypt . "
Added to that is the disorientation of being snatched from their beds by strangers not once but twice .
The impact of all this is clear to the children 's teachers .
" Nardin was a lovely gentle little girl , quietly confident , " says her teacher , Audrey Land .
" She was a model pupil , happy , with lots of friends , the kind of child you would give extra responsibilities .
The change in her has been massive .
" Nardin does n't share her feelings ; she internalises a lot .
But if I raise my voice at all she starts to cry .
She 's been aggressive with other children , which is n't like her , then she gets upset at her own behaviour .
Before , she would play with anyone , but when another child touched her she went hysterical just as she had with the immigration officers at the airport , shouting , ' Nobody touch me !'
" I 'm quite horrified at some of the things she 's seen and the questions that have been asked of her parents within the child 's earshot .
She knows she 's been manipulated by adults .
She 's taken on the role of an adult in her attitude to her little brother and sisters .
She has talked about how she thought of killing herself , which is neither the appropriate experience or vocabulary for a child of 10 . "
Anna Ward , who teaches Nardin 's seven - year - old sister Karin , has seen other kinds of distress .
" Since she came back she is very different , " she says .
" Before she was up for anything new but now she 's reserved and easily upset .
She 's very very tired .
She 's emotionally exhausted .
There 's a massive difference in her .
She looks worried all the time .
It 's really hard to coax a smile from her and she 's bitten her nails right down to the skin . "
Karin had returned to school just before Christmas when the family were released after their lawyer lodged the application for a judicial review .
The day before she had been snatched in the dawn raid she had been cast as Mary in the school nativity play .
" She was thrilled , " recalls Anna Ward , " but the next day she had gone . "
Her teacher and a group of her pupils phoned her in the detention centre and told her we were keeping the part for her .
" I had asked another girl in the class to read the part while Karin as away , " her teacher said .
" The day before the performance I came into the class and found that girl sitting on the floor crying .
When I asked her what the problem was she said , ' I do n't want to be Mary .
I want Karin to be Mary . ' "
When a family is ripped so brutally from their home it is not just those who are carted away by the police to whom an injustice is done .
Something is rent in the very fabric of the community .
" The second time they were taken away was very disturbing for the rest of Karin 's class , " said Anna Ward .
" The other children were all crying they were very shaken by it .
It was as if they did n't know who to trust . "
" Everyone was more shocked the second time because we thought it had been sorted , " said Kim Draper .
" But if you look on the website of the National Coalition of Anti-Deportation Campaigns you can find families this has happened to not just twice – but eight times . "
Justice , in cases where children are involved , needs to be tempered by mercy , but that is a quality that is in short supply thanks to New Labour 's pandering to the right wing anti-immigration lobby .
What would happen , I ask 10 - year - old Nardin , if the family gets another sunrise knock on their front door .
She cuts me off , mid-question .
" Do n't say knock , " she corrects me , " because they do n't knock .
They just smash the chain off the lock and march in . "
What kind of country allows that happen to innocent children as they sleep in their own beds ?
Mine , I 'm ashamed to say .
Nardin 's story : " The next time they came to take us away they were very angry .
You could tell " " First they break the door .
Then they just run in up the stairs making as much noise as possible .
Then they put the lights on to wake you .
You are scared to see these people just there in front of you in your bedroom .
They were freaky looking , they have a belt with handcuffs on and those police sticks – truncheons .
There were loads in the room , about 10 of them .
They said : " Get dressed because we are going to take you to our office . "
I went to the bathroom but they told me I had to leave the door open and I was n't allowed to open the window – they did n't say why but it was because they do n't want you to escape .
I went downstairs .
My dad was there .
He said everything would be OK but they would n't let me go into the kitchen because it has windows .
Then I went outside the house and I had to go in a van .
Dad was put in a different one , surrounded by these people .
Mum looked very worried but I told her Dad had said everything was going to be alright .
When we got there you had to take off your shoes and coat and they took my dad 's phone off him .
But they gave him another one which did n't have a camera on it – you are n't allowed to take pictures inside the detention centre because they do n't want people to see what it 's like .
The second time they came to take us away they were really angry .
They did n't say but you could see by their face .
Dad told them that my brother had just had an operation on his hand and my sister had an ear infection and was waiting to go to hospital .
But they took no notice .
On the coach I felt sick three times because of all the travelling .
You 're not allowed to sit next to the door .
We got there and there was this massive fence as big as a house with all curly wire on the top .
When you get in it 's like all empty space with nothing and then another big fence .
Then we had to go through a lot of doors .
They lock each one behind you .
Inside , on the other side of the fence , there is a pretty garden out there but you are not allowed to go in it even though it has a big wall around it .
We went in a room with three sofas and some toys but most of the toys were broken .
It was mainly baby stuff .
They gave us colouring books but I 'm too big for that .
They told my mum and dad to take some stuff out of all our suitcases and put it in one bag .
We were allowed the keep one bag and the rest of our things were put away in a storeroom .
You had to stand in a line and have your photograph taken .
I did n't smile .
If I had known what was going to happen I would have stuck my tongue out .
They use the photograph to give you an ID card .
Then we had to go to the nurse .
She asked my dad : " Do you drink drugs ? "
And he said , ' No ' .
She asked him if anybody had ever attacked or hurt him .
I do n't know why .
It was all confusing .
At first they were nice and then they were asking you all these silly questions .
And the lady from the nursery did n't change Angela 's nappy .
They gave us three rooms but one was stinky , and dirty on the floor .
There were windows in the room but they only opened a tiny bit so we slept two in a bed in the other rooms .
The bed was made of wood .
It did n't have a proper mattress so you could n't bounce on it .
You could see rabbits out of the windows , that was the best bit , but I felt really confused and worried .
They were nice to me but sometimes they treated my parents different from me .
One woman said very bossy to him : " If your child goes out again I 'm going to lock the door . "
He said : " She 's just gone to the toilet ; do n't get angry till you know the full story . "
There was a school there but you did n't get proper lessons , just colouring and painting .
The teacher was Miss Jen .
She asked us what score we would give Yarl 's Wood out of ten .
I said zero .
She said how can we improve .
I said you can improve by being nice to people and treating them all in the same way .
Actually I did n't say that to her .
I said it to my friend Vivienne but she was n't there long because she was sent to Kenya .
She did n't want to go because she had loads of friends and a nice school .
Vivienne was nice but some of the children there were mean to me and used to push me and say horrible things .
One boy , who was 14 or 15 , said he was going to get a stone and kill one of the rabbits on the other side of the fence .
I said " Why ? "
And he started shouting .
He threw the stones but he missed .
But he kept throwing stones down the hole where the rabbit had gone .
He was angry .
A lot of people were angry .
They said : " Do you want to help decorate the Christmas tree . "
I said : " No , I have already decorated my own tree at home .
We did it the day before they came and took us away . "
They try to be nice to you to make you think that nothing is going on wrong .
Some presents came .
[ An Anglican priest dressed as Santa took them to the centre as a protest against children being locked up in immigration centres . ]
There was a big sack .
They said you have to show your ID card and you get one present and one coin .
It 's a funny Santa if you have to show an ID card .
They keep saying to you : " Are you ready to go to Egypt ?
Egypt is a nice place , a wonderful country . "
I said : " No , I want to stay here with my friends , at my school to get a good education . "
They are trying to make you say the opposite of your Mum and Dad , they try to divide you up from them .
She was trying to , but she was not very good at it .
I felt really angry .
I said : " No way , I can do whatever I like with my own life . "
I thought : " Why is she doing this ? "
When we were in the bus on the tarmac at the airport they said : " Do you want to get on the plane ? "
And I said : " No . "
And she said : " Well we can always come back next week . "
Then a judge said they had to let us out .
When I heard I said : " I 'm free , I 'm free . "
I was so happy , I tried to bounce on the bed but you can't , it 's too hard .
When I got back to school I was very happy and all my friends were hugging me – just the girls – the boys just said hi – but my sister Karin got hugged by the boys as well in her class .
A boy said : " I 've kissed Karin ; I 'm glad she 's back . "
One boy said to me : " You 're lucky , you missed school . "
But I said to him : " I 'd rather have been here , even doing maths . "
Karin knows what 's going on .
The last day she said : " it was nightmare but it is over . "
But I 'm thinking now that maybe I should come to school very early every day before these people can come and wake me up to take me away again .
When you wake up in your bedroom at home you should just see your wardrobe and the mirror , not a load of freaky people stood looking at you .
If it happens again I 'm going to complain .
I 'm going to write them a letter to say : " Why are you doing this .
I can stay in this country if I like .
Who do you think you are ?
You are not in charge in this country . "
If they do n't stop I will write to the Queen because I do n't want to go to Egypt .
Last time I was so fed up that I wanted to throw myself out of the window .
The Queen is nice because I have read it in The BFG .
I 'll tell the Queen these people get money for being mean to people .

Late last year , the JPMorgan chief executive , Jamie Dimon , called Britain ’s chancellor of the Exchequer , Alistair Darling , to voice his displeasure over the tax  the only head of an American bank to make such a call , people at the British Treasury said .

During the conversation , Mr. Dimon said that JPMorgan , which employs 15,000 people in Britain , was not just a significant taxpayer but was also making a $ 2.4 billion investment in Canary Wharf and that it had not taken a penny of government aid .
The conversation was first reported by The Daily Telegraph and received considerable attention in London , with some arguing that it was an early indicator that increasing regulation was going to induce banks to take their business elsewhere  to Geneva , New York , Frankfurt or Singapore .
But the situation is far more complicated than that .
A person who was briefed on the conversation said that while it was true that JPMorgan , as with most banks , was furious over the tax , the conversation between Mr. Dimon and Mr. Darling was civil and did not represent a threat that the bank would pull back from its Canary Wharf project .
In fact , there were other reasons before the tax was announced that made the building project less than attractive for the bank  namely that the bank had laid off thousands of employees since the project was conceived in 2008 and no longer needed such a large space .
Still , even if unspoken , the message behind the call was clear :
There is a limit to what banks will accept as the price of doing business in Europe ’s premier financial center .
To be sure , bankers are often noted to be the best of blusterers .
It is one thing for a strategy committee to study the feasibility of moving part of a bank ’s business to an alternative locale , as Goldman Sachs has done .
It is quite another matter  logistically and financially as well as culturally  to move , say , 2,000 bankers and operations staff members to another European city , no matter how appealing it might be for their bonus pay .
Dec. 7 , 2009 – H1N1 swine flu wo n't be as severe as was feared , but the pandemic is nothing to sneeze at , new predictions suggest .
When the fall / winter wave of H1N1 swine flu is over , it will have been no more severe than an average flu season , predict Harvard researcher Marc Lipsitch , DPhil , and colleagues from the U.K. Medical Research Council and the CDC .
" The good news is that ... the severity of the H1N1 flu may be less than initially feared , " Lipsitch says in a news release .
There are some big asterisks next to that prediction :
Most of the deaths and hospitalizations in a typical flu season are elderly people .
Most of those killed or hospitalized in the H1N1 swine flu pandemic are children and young adults .
Deaths attributed to seasonal flu include heart attacks , strokes , and other fatal conditions triggered by the flu .
Nearly all deaths attributed to H1N1 flu are due to flu or to bacterial complications of flu .
The new predictions would be four or five times higher in populations without access to mechanical ventilation or intensive care .
All bets are off if the H1N1 swine flu shifts to older populations .
Even so , the new numbers are cause for relief if not for celebration .
Before the 2009 H1N1 swine flu came along , planners were preparing for a pandemic with a case / fatality ratio of 0.1 % -- that is , for one death in every 1,000 symptomatic infections .
The Lipsitch team now calculates that the H1N1 swine flu has a case / fatality ratio no higher than 0.048 % -- and maybe seven to nine times lower , depending on the methods used for calculation .
" This is a serious disease , " Lipsitch says in the news release .
He noted that between one in 70 and one in 600 people who fall ill with H1N1 swine flu will be hospitalized .
The CDC has been careful not to characterize the severity of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic .
The new predictions are very much in line with CDC 's working estimates , says Beth Bell , MD , MPH , associate director for science at the CDC 's immunization and respiratory disease center .
" This study sends the message that this is primarily a young person 's disease and highlights the importance of taking advantage of this window of opportunity to get the vaccine and take preventive measures , " Bell tells WebMD .
" While most people who get this illness do OK , it can be very severe -- and the severity is concentrated in younger people . "
Barack Obama has won a place in history with the worst ratings of any president at the end of his first year : 49 % approve and 46 % disapprove of his job performance in the latest USA Today / Gallup Poll .
There are many factors that explain it , including weakness abroad , an unprecedented spending binge at home , and making a perfectly awful health - care plan his signature domestic initiative .
But something else is happening .

Barack Obama 's steely vow to hunt down all those responsible for the attempted bombing of an American airliner on Christmas Day has left a crucial question unanswered : whether it was his personal order to US military forces to attack two suspected al - Qaida bases in Yemen with cruise missiles on 17 December that triggered a " revenge " terrorist operation against the Northwest Airlines plane one week later .
According to a report aired on 18 December by the American ABC News network and not denied by the White House , US and Yemeni government forces jointly targeted al - Qaida training camps in the Arhab district , 60 km north - east of the capital , Sana'a on 17 December .
Another alleged camp in the village of al - Maajala , in Abyan , 480 km south - east of Sana'a , was also hit after US officials determined " an imminent attack against a US asset was being planned " there .
Both targets were bombed repeatedly from the air by Yemeni air force planes .
Subsequent official estimates said about 35 militants were killed .
But Yemeni opposition spokesmen said a total of between 60 and 120 people had died during bombardments of the two targets and a third location .
They said many of those killed were civilians , including women and children .
They denied the villages contained al - Qaida camps .
Television pictures broadcast from Yemen by the Arab news channel al - Jazeera on 18 December showed dozens of bodies covered in sheets .
Citing unidentified administration sources , ABC News reporter Brian Ross said the US military fired two cruise missiles during the attacks , one at each alleged camp , after Obama personally gave the go - ahead .
" White House officials tell ABC News the orders for the US military to attack the suspected al - Qaida sites in Yemen on Thursday came directly from the Oval Office , " Ross reported .
American officials have neither confirmed nor denied a US role in the air strikes , while the Yemeni government has insisted only its own forces were involved .
" We are not going to get into any details at this point , " one US official said .
The official added that Yemen and the US " co-operate closely on counter - terrorism " .
But White House officials could confirm that Obama telephoned Yemen's , Ali Abdallah Salih , after the raids to " congratulate " him on his efforts to combat al - Qaida .
Asked about a New York Times report on 19 December of US involvement in the attacks , Bryan Whitman , a Pentagon spokesman , said : " Yemen should be congratulated for actions against al - Qaida . "
The newspaper said Obama had approved US military and intelligence support , following a request from the Yemeni government .
The assistance was intended to help stem growing attacks against American and other foreign targets in Yemen .
According to an Associated Press report , also published on 19 December , residents of Abyan said there was no al - Qaida training camp in the area and that the air attack had destroyed homes – a collection of mud brick houses , huts and tents – in the rural tribal area .
The report said a mass grave had been dug for those killed .
Obama 's actions in supporting the Yemen attacks appear to have had a bigger than expected impact .
In a statement issued on Monday claiming responsibility for organising the failed bombing of Northwest Airlines flight 253 , al - Qaida said the plot was specifically intended to avenge US attacks on the group in Yemen and " unjust aggression on the Arabian peninsula " .
" From here , we say to the American people : since you support your leaders and you stand behind them in killing our women and our children , rejoice for what will do you harm .
We have come to you with slaughter and we have prepared for you men who love death as you love life , " that statement said .
The US military 's support for the Yemeni operations marks a significant escalation in US involvement there and may presage a deepening intervention in coming months as Obama follows up on his vow to track down the would - be bombers .
Speaking on Fox News on Sunday , Senator Joe Lieberman called for immediate , extended " pre-emptive " military action in Yemen to counter the terror threat .
Obama has taken a close interest in combating the al - Qaida build - up in Yemen since taking office in January .
He sent his senior counter - terrorism adviser , John Brennan , to Sana'a in September and issued a statement proclaiming Yemen 's security to be " vital " to the US national security interest .
Last month Yemen announced it had signed a military co-operation pact with the US , although Washington was unforthcoming about the details .
Yemen 's official Saba news agency said the co-operation agreement was signed during talks in Sana 'a between the two countries ' militaries .
Now , having taken the plunge , Obama faces the prospect of the opening up of another front in the " war on terror " as jihadis displaced by US military action in Afghanistan and Pakistan make the trek south – and attempt to turn the Arabian peninsula into a new launch - pad for attacks against the west .

I have never been a Liberal voter ( never say never , right Brendan ? ) , but the schadenfreude at recent events wore off surprisingly fast .
I find myself in the strange position of being simultaneously opposed ( on balance ) to the Labor ETS legislation because it is not aggressive enough given the scale and speed of the problem , and dismayed by the reasons why members of the opposition wish to scuttle it .
This is not nearly as paradoxical as it might seem – it is precisely because I want a more visionary response to the problem than Labor has offered that I want a viable opposition with a constructive approach to climate change .
Recent events suggest that you ca n’t have one without the other
Labor ’s ETS legislation is being fought by a large number among Coalition ranks not because of the specifics of the response to human - induced global warming , but because of the very fact of there being one .
To the denialists it is a straightforward absurdity – there can be no appropriate response to a non-existent problem .
Andrew Bolt hammered this point home in his rather fractious interview with Mark Colvan on PM last Friday : there is no warming , therefore the Liberal party ’s problem is Turnbull , pure and simple .
Sophie Mirabella went one better with her desperate , up - is - down argument against Turnbull in the Sunday Age – the party room objection to the ETS is about model rather than concept , thus colonising the curious new territory of denial denial , though she would surely , um , deny this .
It ’s contravened by the fact that the Liberals got most of the changes they purportedly wanted out of recent negotiations , not to mention Nick Minchin flagging well before the legislation reached the senate that even if they got the lot , he was n’t necessarily inclined to support it .
For the Liberals ( not so the Nationals , well and truly united in denial – disciplined delusion is something I guess ) , the issue has been lurking , Ridley Scott Alien - like , beneath the surface for several years .
Now the bloody denouement – but will John Hurt ’s corpse be Malcolm Turnbull or the Liberal Party ?
Climate change denial within Coalition ranks was always an open secret , but even those members of parliament who – like Mr Bolt – serially misinterpret graphs involving global temperatures were apparently able at the very least to understand polling numbers suggesting that a majority of Australians believed that recent climate change : i ) was largely human caused ; ii ) was of concern , and ; iii ) demanded some form of response from the country ’s leadership .
Break this down by age , and the numbers only get uglier for the future of the Liberal party .
The realisation of which the Howard government arrived at late – interviewed on Four Corners in 2006 , the then - PM acknowledged mildly that a world 3 oC warmer might be ‘ less comfortable for some ’ .
This was the year that the world seemed to turn the page on climate , and this kind of apparent environmental naivete played to the bulk of the punters pretty much as it probably was – the dissembling of an ageing leader with a stubbornly anachronistic take on the world .
The run up to the election correspondingly saw both a hasty rhetorical greening and the birth of an ETS proposal from the Coalition .
Malcolm Turnbull , by that time minister for environment and water resources , had previously argued unsuccessfully for the adoption of an ETS , and subsequently found himself spruiking the government ’s somewhat Meatlofianly titled ‘ Be Climate Clever ( I Can Do That ) ’ campaign .
I still have the promotional pamphlet , and – other than it ’s remarkable triviality ( like , I shit you not , ‘ Choose solar powered garden lights ’ … ) – there ’s nothing overtly wrong with most of the material .
It ’s just that , divorced from the last - minute political calculation that saw it hastily printed and rammed into every mailbox in the country , it ’s so damned innocent .
But while the intent was to demonstrate leadership , the impression given was instead of a government that had spent eleven years leaning on its shovel suddenly pointing at the ground and suggesting that we all dig .
It was deeply condescending , and darkly , unintentionally funny .
That aside , this was Coalition policy under John Howard , and most of the same players involved in the current Malcolm - you ’ve - broken - our - hearts sturm und drang were members of that government , so it ’s worth quoting Turnbull ’s ‘ Be Climate Clever ( I Can Do That ) ’ introductory message at some length :
‘ Australians know that our climate is changing and that greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels are a major cause .
A drier , hotter climate will affect our economy , our environment and our way of life .
‘ Together , we need to slow and then stop the rate of global warming .
This means the whole world will need to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
Over time , all , or almost all , of the world ’s electricity will need to come from clean energy sources which do not emit greenhouse gases . ’
Obviously , the likes of Minchin et al – and for that matter Howard – did n’t actually buy any of this , but it was judged politically necessary to offer something to the electorate .
If the Coalition had miraculously pulled off the win , it ’s possible that Howard could have secured party room support for an ETS not dissimilar to Labor ’s current proposal because the hard core conservatives of the party – from whose ranks the deniers are largely drawn – could relate to the man ( though for Abbott , it ’s always been something … more ) .
Who knows , they might have eaten the proverbial shit sandwich for him .
But no way for Turnbull .
Fate of course delayed the reckoning .
And ever since , the party has been content to let the problem gestate – a strategy that had little downside as long as the party did n’t have to make decisions on substantive legislation .
Last week ’s desperate delaying tactics – farm it out to another committee etc – before the senate rose represented the last desperate attempts to cling to this approach .
Steve Fielding ’s outraged senatorial scoldings have become pretty routine , but the one on Friday actually found the mark as he pilloried the recalcitrants – despite his common cause with their opinions – for their failure to take a position .
It ’s hard to guess just how far out the Rudd government consciously played this , but moral considerations of , you know , the future of the planet and stuff aside , this was a political master stroke : initially withhold some of what the Coalition party demands with the ultimate intention of including it ; negotiate with the Coalition in the knowledge that the denialist faction will not , on principle , accept ANY deal , and is thus hoping for a hard ball offer that can be rejected while maintaining the subterfuge of Mirabella ’s ‘ bad model ’ ; commend warmly the contribution of the opposition leader and offer a generous deal that an opposition negotiating in good faith could not reasonably refuse ; stand back and watch the blood spray up the walls as the alien climbs out .
I ’ve been amazed by the near - constant refrain across the media of just how badly Malcolm Turnbull has handled this issue in the party room .
What was the right way to handle it ?
If some members of the party chose to stamp their feet like petulant children because they did n’t get their way , then blood was inevitable .
Are we really to believe that his arrogance was the primary culprit here , that if he ’d leant a more tender ear to their concerns they would all have lined up behind him ?
I do n’t .
In some ways it mirrors the old media approach to the climate change issue – the deniers must get a balanced hearing regardless of their numbers ( though in the case of the Liberal party room they ’re admittedly pretty high ) or the extent to which their views stand against the physical , planetary reality of the situation .
This is manifestly not balance – it reflects not a lack of bias but a lack of judgement .
As Malcolm Turnbull more or less pointed out in his defiant speech on Thursday , the aims of placating the denialists while contributing to the kind of meaningful action on climate change that the bulk of the electorate demands are fundamentally incompatible .
For his good judgement Turnbull will probably lose his head , which is made all the more ridiculous by the fact that the party clearly perceived before the last election that its leader was damaging its electability and nobody would chance the guillotine .
It ’s also been cast by many as a fight for the soul of the Liberal party .
Maybe it ’s Abbott ’s curse – the two public institutions seemingly most important to this man ’s life are both fighting ( and seemingly failing ) to balance the need to evolve in step with ( and thereby maintain relevance to ) a changing world while holding to a core set of principles upon which its members can agree .
You make the church too broad and everybody wants to sing a different hymn ; too narrow and they stop turning up .
But maybe it ’s simpler than that .
Yes , there are good reasons why the denialists show up where they do within the political spectrum ( an interesting issue for a later post ) , but at the risk of serious naïvete , to the extent that the Left / Right paradigm still means something , it is humanity ’s response to climate change that can be approached via this framework rather than the physical facts of its existence .
But if it is naïve , well , Sarkozy in France understands this , Cameron in Britain understands this , and to suggest that the soul of the Liberal party hangs on this question does n’t say much for that soul .

Ask yourself the following question right now : which of these two fears  fear of failure or fear of success – is holding me back the most ?
Most people will say its the fear of failure that holds them back , and I think that s a bunch of baloney .
Id be willing to bet that more than anything , its your fear of success that s holding you back .
Let me explain .
If you re like most everyone else , there is an element of fear that holds you back from doing anything and everything you want .
Whether you want to start a business , train for a marathon , or take an improv class and you have yet to do it , its because you re afraid of something .
I think that something you are afraid of is that you re actually going to be successful .
According to LiveStrong.com , fear of success consists of the following things :
Fear that you will accomplish everything youve set out to do , but you still wont be happy , content or satisfied
The belief that you are undeserving of all the recognition and praise that will come your way as a result of your accomplishment ( s )
The belief that when you do achieve success the first time , you will not have the ability to sustain it , so you re simply setting yourself up for a massive letdown
Any of these things sound familiar ?
I know each and everyone one of the above points could have my name written next to them !
Not that I m trying to dimmish the fear of failure ( well , I guess am ) , but its rooted in the idea that were not good enough .
I know I m taking a giant leap here , but I think that each of us knows ourselves well enough to know that when push comes to shove , we are good enough , smart enough , and capable enough to accomplish what we set out to do .
It might not be easy , but with a little bit of blood , sweat , tears , and ingenuity , we wont fail .
This alone is enough to rule out the fear of failure , mostly because , when it comes down to it , failure doesnt exist .
Success on the other hand , now that s a completely different beast .
What if I find success and I m unfulfilled ?
Do I truly deserve the success ?
What if I m successful but I cant maintain it ?
These are tough questions , which usually lead to analysis paralysis ,  meaning we get so bogged down wondering about the what - ifs that we simply end up doing nothing .
So , how do you get over your fear of success ?
I recommend the following things :
Learn how to smell the roses and enjoy your small successes .
If you can learn how to be satisfied with the little things , just imagine how happy youll be once you accomplish something big . 
Realize that people are going to want to pat you on the back for your accomplishments , and they wouldnt compliment you if you didnt truly earn it or deserve it .
Even if you dont continuously achieve 100 % success , by trying youve accomplished more than 95 % of the people out there ( ok , I know this is a little too on the  youre a unique snowflake side , but it really is true ) .
Now you have no reason to not go out there and accomplish everything you want , so get moving !
Chris Johnson is the sixth NFL player to rush for more than 2,000 yards .
But how would the 2009 NFL rushing champion fare on a running track , without a helmet and pads , against Usain Bolt , the world 's fastest man ?
We might never know .
The Tennessee Titans running back said Monday as he cleaned out his locker that he recently learned that a potential race against the Jamaican Olympian is n't going to happen -- at least , not at a distance less than 100 meters , where Bolt holds the world record .
" We got word two days ago .
He do n't want to do it .
He only wants to run the 100 , he do n't want to run the 50 , " Johnson said .
" He said the only way he 'll do it is if he runs the 100 . "
ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter reported Monday that according to sources , representatives for the Titans running back and Bolt had spent recent days trying to set up a race between the two men to determine who really is the world 's fastest human .
According to sources , the hangup seemed to be the length of the race .
Johnson wanted the race to be 60 yards or less , while Bolt wanted it to be longer .
The race would be used to raise money for charity .
But Bolt 's agent , Ricky Simms , told Universal Sports.com that it the race was not going to happen .
" Usain does n't follow the NFL too closely and is not really familiar with all of the players .
He likes [ international ] football and cricket , " Simms said , according to the report .
" But more importantly , he has a schedule and a coach to follow and there is no chance that we would set up this type of event . "
Bolt won three gold medals at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , setting world records in the 100 meters and 200 meters and sharing a third world record with the Jamaican 4x100 meter relay team .
At last year 's world championships , he shattered both of his own sprinting world records , running the 100 meters in 9.58 seconds and the 200 meters in 19.19 seconds .
Johnson on Sunday became the NFL's sixth 2,000 - yard rusher when he completed his season with 2,006 , breaking Earl Campbell 's franchise record of 1,934 .
The second - year back from East Carolina also broke Marshall Faulk 's NFL single - season record with 2,254 total yards from scrimmage .
At the 2008 NFL scouting combine , Johnson was timed in the 40 - yard dash at 4.24 seconds -- the fastest time clocked at the combine that year .
Johnson 's longest run from scrimmage this season was a 91 - yard touchdown run in Week 2 .

Jenson Button has revealed how he almost made an unintended impact upon McLaren when he arrived at the McLaren Technology Centre to visit his new team during a snowstorm two weeks ago .
The 2009 world champion recently took delivery of a white Mercedes C63 road car , but speaking on the interview stage at AUTOSPORT International in Birmingham , described how the 500 bhp machine became a bit of a handful in the icy conditions .
" I actually arrived at Woking about 10 days ago in the snow , and I was struggling a little bit with the car in the snow , " Button related .
" To be fair , I should be ok at driving whatever , but I drove into the factory sideways and thought I was going to wipe out the entrance sign .
I just gathered it up and left it there , because I could n't drive it any further . "
Button got away with it , but later discovered that there were benefits to being a McLaren F1 driver that he had not taken into account .
" They came to me and said that the tyres were on the limit of being illegal .
They were still legal , but they were on the limit .
So they took it away and they put new tyres on it for me .
It was like going to the Kwik - Fit .
How good 's that ?
Fantastic .
And they did a great job with it . "
How loud do the alarms have to get ?
There is an economic emergency in the country with millions upon millions of Americans riddled with fear and anxiety as they struggle with long - term joblessness , home foreclosures , personal bankruptcies and dwindling opportunities for themselves and their children .
The door is being slammed on the American dream and the politicians , including the president and his Democratic allies on Capitol Hill , seem not just helpless to deal with the crisis , but completely out of touch with the hardships that have fallen on so many .
While the nation was suffering through the worst economy since the Depression , the Democrats wasted a year squabbling like unruly toddlers over health insurance legislation .
No one in his or her right mind could have believed that a workable , efficient , cost - effective system could come out of the monstrously ugly plan that finally emerged from the Senate after long months of shady alliances , disgraceful back - room deals , outlandish payoffs and abject capitulation to the insurance companies and giant pharmaceutical outfits .
The public interest ?
Forget about it .
With the power elite consumed with its incessant , discordant fiddling over health care , the economic plight of ordinary Americans , from the middle class to the very poor , got pathetically short shrift .
And there is no evidence , even now , that leaders of either party fully grasp the depth of the crisis , which began long before the official start of the Great Recession in December 2007 .
When I write about US foreign policy in places such as Haiti or Honduras , I often get responses from people who find it difficult to believe that the US government would care enough about these countries to try and control or topple their governments .
These are small , poor countries with little in the way of resources or markets .
Why should Washington policymakers care who runs them ?
Unfortunately they do care .
A lot .
They care enough about Haiti to have overthrown the elected president Jean - Bertrand Aristide not once , but twice .
The first time , in 1991 , it was done covertly .
We only found out after the fact that the people who led the coup were paid by the US Central Intelligence Agency .
And then Emmanuel Constant , the leader of the most notorious death squad there – which killed thousands of Aristide 's supporters after the coup – told CBS News that he , too , was funded by the CIA .
In 2004 , the US involvement in the coup was much more open .
Washington led a cut - off of almost all international aid for four years , making the government 's collapse inevitable .
As the New York Times reported , while the US state department was telling Aristide that he had to reach an agreement with the political opposition ( funded with millions of US taxpayers ' dollars ) , the International Republican Institute was telling the opposition not to settle .
In Honduras last summer and autumn , the US government did everything it could to prevent the rest of the hemisphere from mounting an effective political opposition to the coup government in Honduras .
For example , they blocked the Organisation of American States from taking the position that it would not recognise elections that took place under the dictatorship .
At the same time , the Obama administration publicly pretended that it was against the coup .
This was only partly successful , from a public relations point of view .
Most of the US public thinks that the Obama administration was against the Honduran coup , although by November of last year there were numerous press reports and even editorial criticisms that Obama had caved to Republican pressure and not done enough .
But this was a misreading of what actually happened : the Republican pressure in support of the Honduran coup changed the administration 's public relations strategy , but not its political strategy .
Those who followed events closely from the beginning could see that the political strategy was to blunt and delay any efforts to restore the elected president , while pretending that a return to democracy was actually the goal .
Among those who understood this were the governments of Latin America , including such heavyweights as Brazil .
This is important because it shows that the State Department was willing to pay a significant political cost in order to help the right in Honduras .
It convinced the vast majority of Latin American governments that it was no different from the Bush administration in its goals for the hemisphere , which is not a pleasant outcome from a diplomatic point of view .
Why do they care so much about who runs these poor countries ?
As any good chess player knows , pawns matter .
The loss of a couple of pawns at the beginning of the game can often make a difference between a win or a loss .
They are looking at these countries mostly in straight power terms .
Governments that are in agreement with maximising US power in the world , they like .
Those who have other goals – not necessarily antagonistic to the United States – they do n't like .
Not surprisingly , the Obama administration 's closest allies in the hemisphere are rightwing governments such as those of Colombia or Panama , even though Obama himself is not a rightwing politician .
This highlights the continuity of the politics of control .
The victory of the right in Chile , the first time that it has won an election in half a century , was a significant victory for the US government .
If Lula de Silva 's Workers ' party were to lose the presidential election in Brazil this autumn , that would be another win for the state department .
While US officials under both Bush and Obama have maintained a friendly posture toward Brazil , it is obvious that they deeply resent the changes in Brazilian foreign policy that have allied it with other social democratic governments in the hemisphere , and its independent foreign policy stances with regard to the Middle East , Iran , and elsewhere .
The US actually intervened in Brazilian politics as recently as 2005 , organising a conference to promote a legal change that would make it more difficult for legislators to switch parties .
This would have strengthened the opposition to Lula 's Workers ' party ( PT ) government , since the PT has party discipline but many opposition politicians do not .
This intervention by the US government was only discovered last year through a Freedom of Information Act request filed in Washington .
There are many other interventions taking place throughout the hemisphere that we do not know about .
The United States has been heavily involved in Chilean politics since the 1960s , long before they organised the overthrow of Chilean democracy in 1973 .
In October 1970 , President Richard Nixon was cursing in the Oval Office about the Social Democratic president of Chile , Salvador Allende .
" That son of a bitch ! " said Richard Nixon on 15 October .
" That son of a bitch Allende – we 're going to smash him . "
A few weeks later he explained why :
The main concern in Chile is that [ Allende ] can consolidate himself , and the picture projected to the world will be his success ...
If we let the potential leaders in South America think they can move like Chile and have it both ways , we will be in trouble .
That is another reason that pawns matter , and Nixon 's nightmare did in fact come true a quarter - century later , as one country after another elected independent left governments that Washington did not want .
The United States ended up " losing " most of the region .
But they are trying to get it back , one country at a time .
The smaller , poorer countries that are closer to the United States are the most at risk .
Honduras and Haiti will have democratic elections some day , but only when Washington 's influence over their politics is further reduced .
David Mixner reacts to the unfortunate events in Maine :
" Refuse to allow any of our fellow Americans , President Obama or our
allies to view this as a political issue who time has n't quite come .
America is in the process of creating a system of Gay Apartheid .
We
will not quietly sit and accept it .
All over the place , this nation is
creating one set of laws for LGBT Americans and another set for all
other Americans .
That is the classic definition of Apartheid .
Either
our political allies are for Gay Apartheid or against it .
If they are
against it , they must fight with us and no longer duck like President
Obama did in Maine and Washington .
There is no half way in fighting
Apartheid …
… President Obama standing on the sidelines in Maine and Washington was
appalling .
The failure of our national organizations and leaders to
demand his involvement was equally appalling .
The outrageous act of the
Democratic National Committee sending an email into Maine asking Maine
Democrats to call into " NEW JERSEY " instead of to support the fight
against bigotry was unbelievable .
No one gets to sit on the sidelines
in an epic battle against apartheid and no one gets a free pass .
If you
want our support , you have to earn it .
We are way beyond where we will
accept a little bit in 2009 , some in 2010 and maybe more in the second
term .
Does anyone think after yesterday election results and the
upcoming 2010 election , Obama has the ability to repeal " Do n't Ask ,
Do n't Tell " and " DOMA " next year ?
Does anyone really believe we have n't
already missed a historic opportunity in the first 10 months of this
year ?
Only a courageous fighting President and Congress can now help
turn us this around and that we have not seen so far .
Enough . "

Celluloid Heroes : Best Characters of the Decade
There are a lot of variables that go into making a successful movie – actors , writers , directors , producers , and all of the other overlooked crew members – but even if everything is done exactly right , it does n’t mean anything without a good character .
And at the end of the day , that ’s what people remember the most when they leave the cineplex .
As part of our look back at the movies of the 2000s , I present you with a list of the best characters of the decade .
Obviously , some cuts had to be made ( notable omissions include The Joker , Batman and Derek Zoolander ) , so feel free to comment on which of your favorite characters did n’t make the cut .
10 . Spider-Man
The web - slinger would probably make a list of best characters in any decade - end review of comic books , but this is the first time he can even be considered for a movie list .
Thank Bryan Singer ’s “ X - Men ” for that , because without its success , there ’s a good chance we may have never seen Spider - Man jump to the big screen .
Sam Raimi definitely deserves credit for adapting the character without all the cheese of the 60s TV series , but it ’s Tobey Maguire ’s strong performance that really brings the character to life .
Although many claim the second film to be the best in the series , we think that all three have their own strengths and weaknesses .
Sure , Peter Parker may lose some of his appeal when he goes all emo in “ Spider - Man 3 , ” but seeing Spidey rock the black symbiote suit was just as cool as anything he did in the first two films .

9. Jigsaw
Say what you will about the deteriorating quality of the “ Saw ” films : Jigsaw is right up there with Jason Voorhees , Michael Myers and Freddy Kruger as one of the ultimate horror icons .
What makes him so different from the others , though , is that he ’s a fairly regular guy ( when he dies , he really dies ) who is n’t so much a villain as he is someone who goes to radical extremes to get his point across .
Though his argument that he does n’t ever kill anyone could be debated for eternity , Jigsaw is still a pretty badass dude .
Not only is he one of the most inventive baddies to ever grace the silver screen , but the fact that he ’s doing all of this while dying from cancer is beyond impressive .
Tobin
Bell may never be remembered for anything other than his work in these films , but his limited appearances are so memorable that we would n’t really mind .
Memorable Quote : “ I want to play a game . ”
8. Wolverine
Though it ’s difficult to think of anyone other than Hugh Jackman playing Wolverine , it certainly could have ended up that way .
You can go ahead and thank the comic book gods for interfering , because if Dougray Scott had n’t gotten hurt while shooting “ Mission : Impossible 2 , ” “ X - Men ” fans might have seen a decidedly different take on their beloved adamantium - laced berserker .
And since Wolverine has since become the mascot for those films ( even earning a mediocre spin - off of his own ) that also would have affected the movie as a whole , which might have stopped the whole comic book movie revolution before it even began .
Just think about that the next time you see Jackman in his role as the wise - cracking , cigar - chomping mutant , because without his charismatic , star - making performance , this list would look a lot different .
Memorable Quote : “ I ’m gonna cut your goddamned head off .
See if that works . ”
7. Napoleon Dynamite
Undoubtedly the most controversial of my choices , I still stand by it for the simple fact that when “ Napoleon Dynamite ” fever caught in the summer of 2004 , there was n’t a single person who did n’t know about this curly - haired social reject from Idaho .
That alone earns him a spot as one of the greatest characters of the decade , but it ’s ultimately Jon Heder ’s fantastically awkward performance that makes it official .
Heder certainly made the most of his 15 minutes of fame by booking as many gigs as possible , but he never even came close to replicating the success he found as Napoleon Dynamite .
Love him or hate him , Napoleon helped lead a geek chic film movement that has continued to grow to this day .
Plus , you have to admit : even if you did n’t like the movie , you probably still laughed at Heder in that ridiculous getup .

6. Capt. Jack Sparrow
They made three “ Pirates of the Caribbean ” movies for a reason , and while money was certainly a big factor , Disney never would have made a dime if they had n’t trusted Johnny Depp ’s risky portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow .
Though you can understand why a studio would be hesitant about their lead actor parading around like a gay pirate doing a Keith Richards impression , it turned out to be the right call .
Depp ’s hilarious performance as the boozy Capt .
Jack not only earned him his very first Oscar nomination , but it convinced Disney execs to completely redesign the classic “ Pirates of the Caribbean ” theme park attraction around the character .
Many people in the industry thought it meant a pirate renaissance was just around the corner , but thankfully , no one followed through .
And wisely so , because there ’s no way you can top Jack Sparrow .
Memorable Quote : “ Me ? I ’m dishonest , and a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest .
Honestly .
It ’s the honest ones you want to watch out for , because you can never predict when they ’re going to do something incredibly … stupid . ”
5. Frodo Baggins
UK movie magazine Empire recently ran a similar feature on the best characters of the decade , and while I agree that Peter Jackson ’s “ Lord of the Rings ” deserves to be represented in some form , I was surprised to see Aragorn selected instead of Frodo Baggins .
Not only is Frodo the heart of the story , but he ’s the reason there ’s even a story to begin with .
Anyone that accepted the role had to know they would forever be associated with the famous hobbit no matter what they did before or after , but Elijah Wood embraced the situation completely , and in doing so embodied everything that Frodo is supposed to stand for .
He may not have any of the great lines or partake in many battle sequences , but Frodo will always be the face of “ LOTR . ”
Memorable Quote : “ I wish the Ring had never come to me .
I wish none of this had happened . ”
4. Jason Bourne
You could probably swap Jason Bourne for James Bond with little argument , but while Bond is certainly the more iconic of the two characters , Bourne had a much bigger influence on the decade , including Bond himself .
Plus , it ’s not like we do n’t know what to expect with Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig , but Matt Damon surprised moviegoers everywhere with his performance as Robert Ludlum ’s title character .
The actor had never even thrown a punch in a movie , much less carried an entire action film , and yet Bourne quickly rose to popularity as this generation ’s action hero of choice .
That ’s not to discount the appeal of 007 ( Bourne is neither charming nor has any of the fancy gadgets ) , but when you ’re constantly on the run from trained assassins , there ’s really no need for the former .
As for the latter ?
Well , everyday household items seem to work just fine .
Memorable Quote : “ Who has a safety deposit box full of money and six passports and a gun ?
Who has a bank account number in their hip ?
I come in here , and the first thing I ’m doing is I ’m catching the sightlines and looking for an exit . ”
3. Harry Potter
The Boy Who Lived was already a pop culture icon by the time the first movie was released , but in these past nine years , Harry Potter has become one of the most popular movie characters of all time .
One of the reasons the character has continued to thrive is because J.K.
Rowling did such a great job of giving the character room to develop throughout the course of all seven novels .
That same approach has been taken with the movies as well , and while it certainly helps to have different directors offering their varied interpretations of the character , Harry Potter ’s success has always hinged on the performance of the actor playing him .
Though director Christopher Columbus could have never known that Daniel Radcliffe would grow into such a promising young actor , it certainly helps that he ’s been able to handle the material .
The same can be said of Harry ’s partners in crime , but although Ron and Hermoine are just as deserving to be on this list , leaving off Harry would be like choosing Han Solo over Luke Skywalker .
It might make sense , but it just would n’t feel right .
Memorable Quote : “ But I am the Chosen One . ”
2. The Bride
After a six - year break from the film scene , Quentin Tarantino returned to the director ’s chair in 2003 with a character so awesome and shrouded in mystery that she was simply referred to as The Bride .
The brainchild of Tarantino and Uma Thurman during their time together making “ Pulp Fiction , ” The Bride was the kind of empowered female role that Joss Whedon only wishes he would ’ve created .
No offense to Buffy , but The Bride has better weapons ( a Hatori Hanzo sword and a steeled determination ) and better outfits ( that “ Game of Death ” - inspired jumpsuit is practically an icon all its own ) – not to mention Thurman ’s unique blend of physical masculinity and sensual femininity that made her both a menacing threat and an alluring piece of eye candy .
Memorable Quote : “ Those of you lucky enough to have your lives , take them with you .
However , leave the limbs you ’ve lost .
They belong to me now . ”
1. Shaun
Edgar Wright ’s 2004 film , “ Shaun of the Dead , ” is a lot like Sam Raimi ’s “ Evil Dead ” trilogy in that the movie does n’t work without someone they can relate to cheer on .
And although Shaun is n’t as big of a dimwit as Ash , he ’s also not the brave leader that he tries so hard to become .
Simon Pegg ’s hilarious performance as the record - throwing , cricket bat - wielding hero might not compare to more mainstream icons like Harry Potter and Spider - Man , but it ’s that Everyman quality that makes him so appealing .
After all , who would have thought that hiding out at the local pub might actually work ?
And if he can take on an army of the undead with an unhelpful best friend at his side , then so can just about any slacker .

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York gave up much of its power in high - pressure negotiations with the American International Group ’s trading partners last year , according to a government report made public on Monday .
Just two days before the New York Fed paid A.I.G. ’s partners 100 cents on the dollar to tear up their contracts with the insurance giant , one bank volunteered to take a modest haircut  but it never got the chance .
UBS , of Switzerland , alone offered to give a break to the New York Fed in the negotiations last November over how to keep A.I.G. from toppling and taking other banks down with it .
It would have accepted 98 cents on the dollar .
But UBS ’s good - faith gesture was quickly drowned out by Goldman Sachs and the top French bank regulator .
They argued , with others , that it would be improper and perhaps even criminal to force A.I.G. ’s trading partners to bear losses outside of bankruptcy court .
CBS News is retiring Walter Cronkite ’s voice , nearly six months after the esteemed anchorman died .
Beginning Monday , the actor Morgan Freeman will read the introduction to the “ CBS Evening News . ”
Listen to the audio of Mr. Freeman ’s introduction here .
When Mr. Cronkite died in July , CBS said it would retire his voice - over , but then changed its mind for the time being .
“ We knew that , at some point , it would be time to transition , ” Rick Kaplan , the executive producer of the “ CBS Evening News , ” said Monday .
“ The time was right . ”
Mr. Kaplan said that Mr. Freeman recorded the new introduction on New Year ’s Day .
“ All three network broadcasts now have celebrities as their announcers , ” TVNewser notes .
“ Michael Douglas began announcing ‘ NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams ’ on Dec. 17 , 2007 .
And Mike Rowe , best known for hosting Discovery ’s ‘ Dirty Jobs ’ debuted as the voice of ABC ‘ World News with Diane Sawyer ’ last month . ”

A Minnesota man was arrested Monday for throwing two tomatoes at former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
According to police , 33 - year - old Jeremy Paul Olson threw the tomatoes at Palin from a second - floor balcony in the Mall of America in Bloomington , Minn. , while the former GOP vice presidential candidate was signing books at a Barnes & Noble .

Palin was not hit by the flying tomatoes , which instead hit two police officers standing near the former governor .
Olson was arrested on charges of suspicion of assault and disorderly conduct .
Palin — who has sold more than 1 million books since starting her signing tour last month — did not comment on the incident .
Following the incident , Palin attended a private fundraiser for Minnesota Republicans that was attended by Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) among others .
“ I hope I can get a book and maybe get it signed , ” Bachmann told reporters Monday .
A whole new road system has been built from Beirut airport to the city centre since the last time I visited .
What 's more , there are new , exciting roadside accessories .
" Oh my God ! " says my friend Anna .
" What 's that ? "
" It 's a traffic light , " I say although it 's somewhat self - explanatory .
" You 're not stopping , are you ? " says Anna .
" Oh do n't be so ridiculous !
As if anyone 's going to pay any attention to that ! "
She has a point .
We lived in Beirut for eight months back in 1995 , a time when there were not only no traffic lights , there were also no road signs , no speed limits , no traffic police , and , indeed no apparent traffic laws .
None .
Our friend Khaled 's means of negotiating jams was to take his gun out of his glove compartment , strap it to his under-arm , and if the traffic was really bad , wave it around a bit .
As it turns out , the lights are a mixed success : some people stop , some people do n't .
A very Lebanese solution .
You can do what you want , but you may have a super - charged Lebanese yuppie ram you in the back .
Ah , yes , the memories come flooding back .
It 's that signature Beirut cocktail of adventure and excitement – with just a hint of sudden death .
Fourteen years ago , Anna and I wrote the first post - civil - war guidebook to Lebanon .
I do n't think either of us have felt the same about anywhere since : Beirut looms over our lives like … well , like the kind of psychotic ex-lover who you worry might strangle you in your sleep .
But it 's thrilling to be back .
We cruise along the seafront Corniche , and around the reconstructed downtown .
On Martyrs ' Square , Beirut 's Ground Zero , the southernmost point of the old Green Line that divided Muslim West Beirut from Christian East Beirut , we reel at the sight of a Virgin Megastore and practically faint when we see a Dunkin ' Donuts .
Although – thank God ! – the hulking Holiday Inn with its bullet holes and bomb craters is still there , as derelict and abandoned as ever .
It 's beautiful , Beirut , beautiful and ugly and pock - marked and damaged and glamorous and unstable and exciting and just a bit mentally unhinged .
It 's the Elizabeth Taylor of the Mediterranean .
Or it would be if you replaced the words " alcohol " with " Israel " and " a string of unsuitable marriages " with " 15 years of civil war " .
And like a hardened celebrity hack , I 've learnt the hard way not to be taken in by its appearance .
Because Beirut is back .
Again .
It 's having a moment .
Another one .
There are two spanking new hotels – Le Gray , a sister hotel to the feted One Aldwych in London and Carlisle Bay in Antigua , has just opened ; and that seal of international luxury approval , a Four Seasons , is opening soon .
What 's more , this year the New York Times nominated it its number one destination in the world .
Yadda , yadda yadda .
Talk to the hand …
I 've spent the past 14 years telling people how great Lebanon is .
How vast the mountains and sublime the food and empty the ruins and friendly the people and cool the bars .
And periodically they 've even believed me .
And then news breaks out .
There 's always too much news in Lebanon : 2005 when prime minister Rafik Hariri got blown up by a car bomb ; 2006 when Israel subjected the country to a month - long bombardment , blowing up the airport , highways , bridges , electricity sub-stations , and killing some 1,000 or so people ; winter 2008 , when Hezbollah gunmen took to the streets .
Could reports of a new dawn really be true this time ?
I hope so , I really do , but I worry that I 'll jinx it somehow .
I said the same when our guide came out in 1996 , when we did a new edition in 1998 , and when I returned to see the south after the Israelis pulled out in 2000 .
And I 'm not the only one .
When I talk to Nehme Abouzeid , the publisher of Time Out Beirut , he starts telling me about the record - breaking forecasts for next summer , and then has to interrupt himself : " I mean , if everything stays the same ...
We always have to say that in Lebanon , because you never know .
God willing ... "
He speaks from experience : he started publishing Time Out in the spring of 2006 , with a brand new office , a new editor , new staff .
And then the Israeli bombardment began .
" It just came out of nowhere .
No one was expecting it .
I was in Switzerland at a meeting where I 'd just been telling people how , even at the height of the war , the airport never closed .
And then came the news : the airport was closed .
It was so shocking .
Particularly for the youngsters , I think .
The war was just something that their parents talked about .
They 'd never had any experience of it . "
The magazine closed for two years , but it 's back now , presiding over a nightlife scene that the recent unpleasantness seems only to have enhanced .
We wander through Gemmayzeh – which in our time had been an atmospheric but entirely ramshackle quarter , and has now become Beirut 's Shoreditch , stuffed full of trendy bars and huge 4x4s disgorging chic young things – and then head up the hill to a bar called Centrale .
To get to it , we go down a jasmine - lined , floodlit walkway into a bombed - out building encased in wire , up inside an industrial wood - panelled lift , and out into a long , narrow , metal tube , one of whose walls had been removed to give a view over the Beirut skyline .
Maybe I 've caught a touch of Lebanese hyperbole but it just seems to be the most amazing bar in the world .
" Do bars like this exist in London and it's just that we do n't go to them ? " asks Anna as we sip our perfect cocktails and gaze on the perfect people .
It seems unlikely , and , anyway , in London they'd be stuffed with Hoxtonites with annoying haircuts , whereas the Lebanese are beguiling , fluent in three languages , English , French and Arabic , often in the same sentence .
" Bonsoir habibi , how's it going ? " is their version of " Hello " .
It 's so impossibly glamorous , Beirut .
The people so cosmopolitan .
The nightlife so sophisticated .
There 's nowhere else like it in the Middle East , invigorated as it is by its sizeable diaspora , who fly back from London and Paris and Sydney and LA , with a thriving gay scene ( although homosexuality is officially illegal ) , a free press , and an urban fashion code that encompasses everything from micro skirts to full - length abaya and veil .
Khaled shows up in his latest 4x4 , which has the size and manoeuvrability of a tank , and whisks us around the city .
" That 's the Skybar , " he says .
" Where a bottle of Cristal champagne costs $ 10,000 and they deliver it to your table with fireworks to make sure that everyone knows .
People do n't bother to drink it usually .
" That 's White 's – probably the most exclusive nightclub .
See the cars outside .
Look at those Ferraris .
You know the popular thing right now ?
Plastic surgery loans .
My secretary got a pair of new breasts with one .
You know there are 10 million plastic surgery procedures a year in Lebanon ?
And we have only four million people ! "
But then showing off is in the Lebanese DNA .
Khaled wears the biggest Rolex you 'll ever see or " Lebanese travel insurance " as he used to call it .
" You can cash it in anywhere in the world . "
He 's probably right .
Khaled always seemed to us to be Lebanon personified , enterprising , clever , brilliant at business .
Like most of the Lebanese he 's a " businessman " – something involving mobiles phones , possibly , I 've never quite caught the details .
Anna and I once watched him try to negotiate a 20 % discount off a suit in Selfridges .
" Khaled , " I said , " in England , we have what is known as a price . "
Needless to say , he got the discount .
It 's so flashy , so very un - PC .
In a shop in the chi-chi suburb of Achrafiyeh , I spot a stuffed polar bear for sale .
A stuffed baby polar bear .
And Gordon Campbell Gray , the hotelier behind Le Gray , tells me about going out for dinner and being offered bluefin tuna .
" I said , ' Is n't that an endangered species ? '
And the host leaned over and whispered , ' Not here ' . "
But , oh God , the food !
It 's the food of your dreams , the apotheosis of all Middle Eastern cuisine , made from only the freshest ingredients , beautifully presented , and served in the kind of abundance that suggests it might be your last meal on earth .
At the end of dinner with Khaled there seems to be more food left on the table than when we started ( including a platter of little birds , roasted in pomegranate molasses , complete with their heads and little beaks , and a plate of raw liver so fresh it 's practically quivering ) .
" In Lebanon , " says Khaled , leaning back and spreading his arms out in an expansive fashion , " we have everything .
We have the Mediterranean .
We have classical ruins .
We have ... "
" Religious extremists , " I say .
" Armed militiamen . "
" Exactly .
If you want religious extremists , we have religious extremists .
If you want mountains , we have mountains .
If you want lingerie shows on the ski slopes of Mount Lebanon , we have lingerie shows .
We have everything .
Everything . "
It 's true .
They do .
Even Beirut manages to be all things to all people .
We leave the flashy bars of downtown and head south , but we get lost and end up in Haret Hreik , the suburb where Hezbollah had its headquarters , flattened in 2006 .
We drive down an avenue that 's strung with the portraits of " martyrs " – the unmistakeable " heroic " - style photographs of dreamy - looking young men and women who 've gone to their maker .
The old boast about Lebanon used to be that you could swim and ski in the same day .
But even more astounding is that you can swim and tour Hezbollah country in the same day .
We spend a day driving to Baalbeck to see , again , the amazing Roman ruins ( " How many visitors today ? " I ask .
" Ten , " the guardian replies .
And these , bear in mind , are some of the finest Roman ruins anywhere in the world ) .
And then through the hot , dry Bekaa , not so much a valley as a high - altitude plain , with its Hezbollah flags and roadside effigies of its leader , Hassan Nasrallah , waving his machine gun in the direction of Israel .
And then through the military checkpoints and over Mount Lebanon , on a high and lonely pass where Bedouin graze their sheep .
In one direction , there 's the Mediterranean , in the other Syria .
And then it 's down through lush , cloudy orchards , the villages of the Christian heartlands , with shrines to the Virgin Mary on every corner until , finally , we reach the tiny port of Batroun , where there are women in bikinis lounging on the beach .
It seems impossible that this is the same continent , let alone the same country , just an hour or so apart .
The mystery is n't why the Lebanese tried to kill each other for 15 bloodthirsty , murderous years ; it 's why they finally stopped .
I meet Gordon Campbell Gray on the roof terrace of his hotel , Le Gray , and it seems sure to be a huge international hotel hit , a Wallpaper * sensation ... if everything stays the same .
God willing , etc , etc .
Elections were held in Lebanon in spring , and it still has n't got a government .
Squashed up against Syria and Israel , its constitution delicately balancing the rights of 17 different religions , its destiny has always been at the mercy of greater Middle Eastern politics .
" How many years are you behind schedule ? " I ask Campbell Gray .
" Oh God , years .
We were very close to opening when the Israelis started bombing .
It was very difficult to crank it back up after that . "
" Everybody assumed he 'd pull out , " Nehme Abouzeid tells me .
" It 's quite amazing that he has n't . "
And when I repeat his comments to Campbell Gray , he says , " I know !
I 'm quite the accidental hero .
Of course , I was just too stupid to think about pulling out .
It did n't even occur to me . "
But then Campbell Gray has been through the same sort of Lebanese love affair that Anna and I have .
Rapt adoration , mostly ; interspersed with moments of appalled horror .
" The social snobbery is just something else , is n't it ?
I mean even the nationality of your help is a status thing . "
He came out for a weekend in the mid-90s and just fell in love with the place .
" Oh it was just wonderful .
It was so beautiful but such a mess .
There were all those security checkpoints yet it felt quite safe .
And the people were incredible . "
And he has persevered with the project against all odds .
" You know every week we get asked to open a hotel somewhere but this is where I wanted to do it .
It really is just the most exciting city on earth .
It 's not perfect .
That 's what makes it , I think .
You can wander around at two in the morning , quite safe , and I leave my car unlocked , but there 's still an edge , is n't there ? "
There is .
Even with Dunkin ' Donuts and TGI Fridays .
In 1995 , they 'd just started bulldozing the ruins of the old downtown .
Solidere , a private company owned by former prime minister Hariri , bought the entire area and was hell - bent on total transformation .
We watched ancient , decrepit , bullet - riddled Mandate - era mansions being pulled down , and worried that they were going to turn the place into a new Dubai .
But the restoration work is impressive .
Street after street of hand - carved stonework , beautifully restored mosques and churches , and floodlit Roman ruins and new fountains and designer boutiques bursting forth all over .
And if the new " souks " are just another shopping mall , and there are too many luxury apartment blocks for my taste , at least the people have come back .
In the evening , promenading families eating ice creams come out , and women in the streetside cafes smoke nargilehs .
It 's outside the Solidere zone that the real horrors are happening : the last surviving seafront mansions are being torn down to make way for marble skyscrapers .
And in lovely Jbeil – or Byblos – just up the coast , with its Crusader castle and Phoenician fishing port , they 've bulldozed the beach !
A flashy private " beach club " has been built right on top of it .
But then this – backhanders , corruption , uncontrolled development – is as much a part of the Lebanese way as roasting songbirds and driving backwards at speed the wrong way down the hard shoulder .
It 's a beautiful country , blessed by the gods , yet cursed by them too .
As I write this , a week after I return , it still does n't have a government .
But Beirut is back .
And the New York Times is right : it should be your number one destination .
All things being well .
God willing , etc etc .
Or as we say , touch wood .

Cox & Kings ( 020 7873 5000 ;coxandkings.co.uk ) offers four - night breaks at Le Gray from £ 1,095 , including flights and private transfers .
The Four Seasons ( fourseasons.com /beirutcorrect ) is due to open later this year .
GUIDE BOOKS
A Hedonist 's Guide to Beirut by Ramsay Short is a couple of years old but is the still the best one around .
There are no good , up - to - date guides to the rest of the country – or any in print that take you off the beaten track .
The 1998 edition of our book , Traveller 's Survival Kit : Lebanon , will help you find out - of - way spots .
Better still is Bruce Conde 's 1959 See Lebanon .
BEYOND THE CITY
One way to get out into the countryside is to go with with one of the new hiking groups springing up in Lebanon .
A good bet is Vamos Todos ( vamos - todos.comcorrect ) , which organises adventure trips catering for different abilities and fitness levels all over the country .
Monad
class Monad m where return :: a -> m a ( >>= ) :: m a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b
class Monad m => MonadPlus m where mzero :: m a mplus :: m a -> m a -> m a

MonadPlus
It is often claimed that mplus must be associative and mzero must be its left and right unit .
That is , supposedly mplus and mzero should satisfy the same laws as list concatenation and the empty list -- that is , the monoid laws .
It should be stressed and stressed again that the Haskell Report says nothing about the laws of MonadPlus .
Absent any other authority , the status of the MonadPlus laws is undetermined .
Do we want the monoid laws for MonadPlus ?
The answer is surprisingly complicated .
In a short and confusing form , it may be reasonable to use the commutative monoid laws to contemplate non-determinism and to approximate the result of a program .
If one objects to the commutativity of mplus , the associativity should not be a requirement either .
This article shows simple examples of this complex issue .
Along the way , we discuss why we may want equational laws to start with .
An equational law is a statement of equality : for example , the left - unit monoid law for MonadPlus states that mzero `mplus` m and m must be ` the same ' .
This may mean that given the particular definitions of mzero and mplus , the expression mzero `mplus` m reduces to m for any m .
Such a fine - grained , intensional view of equality is most helpful when writing implementations and proofs .
Let 's take the following simple model of non-deterministic computation :
data NDet a = Fail | One a | Choice ( NDet a ) ( NDet a )
One a
a
Fail
Choice
mzero
Fail
mplus
instance MonadPlus NDet where mzero = Fail Fail `mplus` m = m -- ... continued below
mplus
( Choice m1 m2 ) `mplus` m = Choice m1 ( m2 `mplus` m )
( One v ) `mplus` m = Choice ( One v ) m
MonadPlus
One does not have to take equational laws too literally .
For example , with the following , even more lucid instance
instance MonadPlus NDet where mzero = Fail mplus = Choice
mzero `mplus` m
Choice Fail m
m
mzero `mplus` m
m
m
NDet
return v `mplus` m
v
mzero
return v1 `mplus` ( return v2 `mplus` m )
v1
v2
NDet
run
run :: NDet a -> a run Fail = error " failure " run ( One x ) = x -- the intended meaning of One run ( Choice ( One x ) m ) = x -- ... continued
mzero `mplus` m
m
run
run ( Choice Fail m ) = run m
mplus
run ( Choice ( Choice m1 m2 ) m ) = run ( Choice m1 ( Choice m2 m ) )
To recap , in this implementation , mzero `mplus` m does not reduce to m .
Likewise , m1 `mplus` ( m2 `mplus` m3 ) , which is ( Choice m1 ( Choice m2 m3 ) , is a structurally different NDet value than m1 `mplus` ( m2 `mplus` m 3 ) .
Still , as programs , mzero `mplus` m and m produce the same results .
Furthermore , replacing the former expression with the latter , as part of any larger expression , preserves the result of the overall program .
( That claim , while intuitively true for our implementation , is very hard to prove formally . )
The same can be said for m1 `mplus` ( m2 `mplus` m3 ) and ( m1 `mplus` m 2 ) `mplus` m3 .
This preservation of the results , the observational equivalence , lets a compiler , a programmer or a tool to optimize mzero `mplus` m to m .
Deriving and justifying optimizations is another compelling application of equational laws .
Finally , the equational laws can be used to predict and understand the behavior of a program without regard to any particular implementation .
Let consider the programs ones and main :
ones = return 1 `mplus` ones main = ones >>= \x -> if x == 1 then mzero else return x
return v `mplus` m
v
ones
1
main
main = ones >>= \x -> if x == 1 then mzero else return x === {- inline ones -} ( return 1 `mplus` ones ) >>= \x -> if x == 1 then mzero else return x === {- distributivity of mplus over bind -} ( return 1 >>= \x -> if x == 1 then mzero else return x ) `mplus` ( ones >>= \x -> if x == 1 then mzero else return x ) === {- the second clause of mplus is just main -} ( return 1 >>= \x -> if x == 1 then mzero else return x ) `mplus` main === {- monad law -} mzero `mplus` main === {- monoid law -} main
That chain of equational re-writes brought out nowhere .
Clearly , no other chain does any better : there is no way to convert main either to the form return v `mplus` something or mzero .
Our intuition agrees : ones keeps offering 1 , which main rejects .
Now consider onestoo and the program maintoo :
onestoo = ones `mplus` return 2 maintoo = onestoo >>= \x -> if x == 1 then mzero else return x
mplus
onestoo
onestoo = ones `mplus` return 2 === {- inlining ones -} ( return 1 `mplus` ones ) `mplus` return 2 === {- associativity -} return 1 `mplus` ( ones `mplus` return 2 ) === return 1 `mplus` onestoo
Absent any other laws , we must regard maintoo just as diverging as main .
This time the conclusion goes against our intuitions .
We would like to interpret m `mplus` return 2 as a non-deterministic choice that includes 2 .
There is therefore a chance that maintoo may produce that result .
If MonadPlus is meant to represent non-determinism and to implement non-deterministic search , a search procedure ought to be complete : if it is possible maintoo may produce 2 , it should be found sooner or later .
A MonadPlus instance with the associative mplus cannot be an implementation of a complete search procedure , unless we assume some sort of commutativity .
To derive the result 2 in our maintoo example , we have to posit additional laws for mplus , at the very least , m `mplus` return v === return v `mplus` m .
One can even take mplus to be commutative for arbitrary arguments .
The commutative and associative mplus agrees with our intuitions of non-deterministic choice .
But it violently disagrees with the notion of observation used so far : return v `mplus` something is to be observed as resulting in v .
With the commutative mplus , return 1 `mplus` return 2 is to be equal to return 2 `mplus` return 1 , which are observed as 1 and 2 respectively .
It is not reasonable to treat 1 and 2 as the same observation .
We have to re-define observation and treat return v `mplus` m as a program that might produce the result v in one particular run .
The program may finish with some other result .
Intuitive as it is , such notion of observation is weak , feeling like a typical disclaimer clause : the program we sold you may do nothing at all .
It feels , well , non-deterministic .
It is still reasonable to assume the commutative monoid laws as a over - broad specification .
If a MonadPlus implementation produces one of possibly many answers predicted by the specification , the implementation should be deemed correct .
We have to be , however , explicit about such an interpretation .
To avoid the confusion with the common notion of observation -- what the program actually returns -- we should not be saying that a MonadPlus is required to be be associative and commutative .
A program m1 `mplus` ( m2 `mplus` m3 ) may still print different results from ( m1 `mplus` m 2 ) `mplus` m3 .
Lost in # Haiti
If Iran ’s post-election uprising last summer was the world ’s first " Twitter revolution , " the massive Jan. 12 earthquake in Haiti was the first " Twitter disaster . "
In a sign of how much the media landscape has changed since the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 or Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , Twitter users around the world quickly turned to the massively popular microblogging site to read the latest news , express their sympathy , and learn how to help .
Haiti quickly became the site ’s top " trending topic , " edging out such favorites as # TeamConan and #nowTHATSghetto .
In an effort to catch the wave , established media sources like the News York Times and CNN used Twitter ’s new list feature to set up aggregator feeds featuring the latest updates from the ground in Haiti .
The tweeting fever did not let up in the days that followed .
On Wednesday Jan. 20 , more than a week after the original quake , a rush of Twitter activity following news of new aftershocks in Port - au - Prince actually shut down the site .
It ’s clear that Twitter became a portal for people looking to connect about the tragedy — just click the # Haiti hashtag and then refresh after three seconds if you do n’t believe me .
But did Twitter actually replace other , more old - school media as a means for staying informed about events on the ground ?
Unsurprisingly , instead of offering news , the vast majority of Haiti - related tweets seem to consist of either expressions of personal sympathy for the victims of the quake or links to news articles from other sites .
Foreign reporters , including CNN ’s Anderson Cooper and Sanjay Gupta , tweeted their impressions , but these were more of a supplement to their coverage than actual works of reporting .
Foundations like Doctors Without Borders and CARE provided Twitter updates on their efforts , but these were of little interest to those not directly involved in the relief effort — who presumably had more reliable sources of information anyway .
Then there was the dark side .
False rumors quickly began to spread on Twitter about relief initiatives that did n’t exist .
A Twitter message stating that UPS was shipping free to Haiti and another that U.S. airlines were flying doctors to the country for free — when in fact , the country was completely closed to commercial flights in the days following the earthquake — led those companies to be deluged with phone calls and requests they could n’t answer .
Twitter can occasionally be an effective means of organization —
Tweets played a role in the online campaign to pressure the U.S. Air Force into opening the Port - au - Prince airport to aid flights — but they can just as often lead well - meaning readers astray , particularly when there ’s celebrity involved .
Haitian - born musician Wyclef Jean quickly became one of the most popular Haiti - tweeters as he traveled to his home country to help with the relief effort and urged readers to donate to his Yele Foundation .
( # Yele was a top trending topic in the immediate aftermath of the quake . )
But concerns were quickly raised over the foundation ’s financial irregularities and ability to deal with a problem the size of the earthquake .
Many in the development community resented that Jean ’s group was diverting funds away from groups better equipped to respond .
In fact , though it ’s often said that new technologies like Twitter can empower individuals to communicate directly to a large audience , those who seemed to be benefiting most from it during this crisis were mainstream news outlets , who have the manpower to pick out the decent information from Twitter for more discerning readers ; foundations and charities looking to raise money , whether deserving or not ; and government agencies publicizing their own efforts .
If anything , the few tweets resembling news — generated by genuinely engaged tweeters like musician Richard Morse or the New York Times ‘ Damien Cave — only pointed out the limitations of Twitter as a news medium .
A tweet like Cave ’s " Navy helicopters circling the embassy now .
More military on the way .
Iraq , Afghanistan , Haiti — different , but all nation building ? " is more of a teaser for his articles than an informative statement .
Is there value in readers in the United States and Europe knowing that a particular store in downtown Port - au - Prince had been ransacked or a particular building in Jacmel had collapsed rather than waiting for a more comprehensive roundup of these events in the Times or on CNN ?
In the past two decades , the news cycle has gone from the daily updates of newspapers to the up - to - the - minute coverage of cable news and the blogosphere to the up - to - the second updates of Twitter .
It ’s possible that we may have reached a point where information is being provided faster than users can process it , and the " news " ceases to inform at all .

Let ’s Try Everything – Local Autonomy And Innovation In Government
Here at Let A Thousand Nations Bloom , we have a different way of thinking about politics which we believe greatly simplifies a number of issues .
Instead of fighting about what policy should govern a nation of 300,000,000 people , we believe in promoting an ecosystem of competing nations .
Instead of uniformity in political goals , culture , and implementation , we believe in diversity .
Instead of solving problems , we believe in setting up a system where problems solve themselves .
Sounds impossible ?
Let me explain .
As I wrote in my Cato essay Beyond Folk Activism , we can look at politics at three different levels :
Policies : Specific sets of laws .
Institutions :
An entire country and its legal and political systems .
Ecosystem :
All nations and the environment in which they compete and evolve .
Most political discussion occurs at level ( 1 ) – argument about what the best policy is .
Protection or free trade ?
Socialized medicine or our current vaguely - private - ish system ?
Private retirement accounts or Social Security ?
The revolution of public choice theory was to point out the importance of level ( 2 ) , the institutions of a society , in determining what policies get passed .
For example , while a democracy will tend to pass policies that are broadly beneficial compared to what monarchs and one - party states implement , it also tends to pass policies which appear to reflect the will of the electorate , but whose details benefit special interests .
To keep debating about what the perfect policy would be , and ignore the fact that perfect policies never get passed , is to ignore the last half - century of economic research showing that level ( 2 ) matters , and that policies are an emergent behavior of institutions .
But that ’s not the end of the story , because national governments are not the highest level system .
They emerge from and compete in the global ecosystem of nations , and we think that the future of economic research and political activism lie in understanding and changing this ecosystem .
Currently , there are less than 200 governments for almost seven billion people , and it is very difficult to start a new country .
All land is claimed , and countries are reluctant to allow secession or local autonomy .
Why would they ?
The governing industry is an oligopoly , and current nations are like any cartel which tries to restrict the entrance of new firms in order to keep selling a bad product ( government ) at a high price ( taxes ) .
What if we somehow changed this , by restoring American Federalism , increasing support for secession , or opening a new frontier for colonization , like the high seas – and thus Letting A Thousand Nations Bloom ?
Any change to the ecosystem of governments which allows creation of new governments will make government more diverse and innovative by allowing for small - scale experimentation with many new ideas .
And it will make the market for government more competitive , which will lead to it providing a better product at a lower price .
In other words , the governing industry is just like any other industry – restrict it to a few big firms , and it stagnates , but allow small ones to enter , and they will innovate .
No wonder politics has so few new ideas – it has no startups !
For those who doubt that governments compete , look at the tax rates on capital ( corporate tax ) vs. labor ( income tax ) .
Capital is taxed less because it is more mobile , and so countries must compete for it .
Which they do n’t like – which is why they are trying to form a cartel to keep taxes up .
Imagine a world where instead of debating furiously about what policies to impose on everyone , we debate just enough to establish the top contenders – and then go try all of them .
For example , socialized medicine ( or radical free - market medicine ) could be implemented on a state - by - state ( or city - by - city ) basis .
Some experiments will work and be universally adopted , others will fail and be universally loathed , while many will fall in - between and be or attractive or unattractive based on individual preference .
But in every case , our judgements will be based on trials and real - world experience – not hot air from pundits or politicians advancing their own agenda .
There are many ways to get such a system .
Secession obviously increases the number of polities , and even the threat of secession should enable local governments such as US states to reclaim a large amount of local autonomy ( ie move the United States back towards its founding principle of federalism ) .
Opening a new frontier , where social entrepreneurs can go try experimental systems of governance also does the trick .
I ’m sure there are more that I have n’t thought of .
The important thing is that we try to make the industry of government more competitive , rather than pushing our favored specific policies .
This solution is glorious because it lets everyone dissatisfied with the performance of the current government industry ( which is pretty much everyone ) work together to make the world better for all of us .
Republicans , Democrats , Greens , Libertarians – we may not agree on what policies work best , but we can all agree that a world of small governments trying new things will teach us far more about what does and does n’t work than continuing our endless debates .
Let ’s all get behind this global goal of local autonomy : To Let A Thousand Nations Bloom .
WASHINGTON  Summoned to Capitol Hill to explain their companies ’ roles in the worst economic downturn since the Depression , leaders of four big Wall Street banks offered a largely clinical take on the financial crisis on Wednesday , pointing to lapses in risk management and government regulation but offering little sense of the turmoil ’s human toll .
Testifying to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission , the body established by Congress to determine the causes of the Wall Street debacle , Lloyd C. Blankfein , the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs , drew most of the fire .
Mr. Blankfein parried repeated questions over his bank ’s extraordinary profits and salaries .
At one point , when he likened aspects of the financial crisis to a “ hurricane ” and similar acts of God , the commission ’s chairman , Phil Angelides , a Democrat and former California state treasurer , cut in to say , “ Acts of God , we ’ll exempt .
These were acts of men and women . ”
Mr. Angelides and the other commission members challenged the bankers on executive pay and reckless underwriting and trading , often in withering terms .
A common household chemical found in everything from sofas and carpets to pots and pans has been linked to an increased risk of thyroid disease , in the first major study carried out on its effect upon health .
The substance , used to make nonstick cookware , stain - resistant furnishings and greaseproof wrappers , is believed to get into the body through contaminated food or household dust .
Once in the body it accumulates in organs and other tissues .
People with high levels of the chemical in their blood were found to be twice as likely to have thyroid problems as those with the lowest levels , according to a survey of medical records of nearly 4,000 otherwise healthy US adults .
The study is published in the journal , Environmental Health Perspectives .
Scientists said they cannot be certain the chemical is directly responsible for the rise in thyroid disease but called for a full investigation to assess its safety .
Studies in animals have found that the chemical , PFOA ( perfluorooctanoic acid ) , and a sister substance called PFOS ( perfluorooctane sulfonate ) , can cause thyroid problems and a variety of other medical conditions , including hormone imbalances , liver disease and cancer .
" It 's been thought that because they 're inert they do n't cause any health problems , but we 're starting to see some evidence that is suggesting that 's not true , " said Tamara Galloway , professor of ecotoxicology at Exeter University .
" Because these chemicals are inert they are persistent and they build up in the environment and also in human and animal tissues . "
We all have trace levels of PFOA in our bodies that we pick up from the environment .
The substance is so stable that it persists for years .
It has been detected in people around the world and in wildlife as diverse as birds , fish and polar bears .
The thyroid gland produces hormones that control the body 's metabolism and are vital for regulating heart rate and temperature .
Thyroid disease can make the gland produce too much or too little hormone .
An underactive thyroid can cause exhaustion , depression and weight gain .
If the gland is overactive , it can cause weight loss and a rapid heartbeat .
Women are 10 times more likely to have thyroid problems than men .
The Exeter researchers trawled medical records on the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , a database representative of the country 's adult population .
They found 3,966 people aged 20 and older whose blood had been tested for PFOA and PFOS between 1999 and 2006 .
The scientists put the patients into four groups depending on the concentration of PFOA in their blood .
The records showed that 16 % of women in the top group had thyroid problems , compared with 8 % in the lowest group .
A similar trend was seen in men , though the number who had thyroid disease was small .
Co-author David Melzer , professor of epidemiology and public health at the Peninsula Medical School in Exeter , said : " There have long been suspicions that PFOA concentrations might be linked to changes in thyroid hormone levels .
Our analysis shows that in the ordinary adult population there is a solid statistical link between higher concentrations of PFOA in blood and thyroid disease . "
The scientists concede that their study does not confirm PFOA is causing thyroid disease .
One alternative explanation is that thyroid disease makes PFOA accumulate more quickly in the body .
An investigation into the health effects of PFOA is underway in West Virginia , where thousands of people have been exposed over decades after the chemical was released from an industrial plant owned by the US manufacturer , DuPont .
Tony Fletcher , a scientist working on the investigation and an environmental epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , said a full report is due next year .
The US Food and Drug Administration has a voluntary agreement with several companies to phase out PFOA production over the next few years .
Ashley Grossman , professor of neuroendocrinology at Queen Mary , University of London , said : " We also do n't know whether this chemical is directly affecting the thyroid .
Thyroid disease is often caused by the body 's own immune system attacking the thyroid gland , so perhaps this chemical is having some effect on the immune system , rather than directly on the thyroid .
" We 'd need to do a lot more research to verify this link and to understand how the two are linked .
In the meantime , it 's important to remember that thyroid disease can be successfully treated . "
A spokesman for the Health Protection Agency said : " A study like this cannot establish cause and effect .
An independent scientific advisory committee has looked at the published evidence and found no reason to suspect the chemical causes thyroid problems . "
Much used chemical
Perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) is a manmade chemical known for its heat resistance and water , grease and stain repelling properties .
Manufacturers use PFOA to make fluoropolymers , used in thousands of products .
It is turned into non -stick coatings for cookware , flame retardants in furnishings , stain protection treatments for carpets , wire coatings and waterproof clothing such as Gore - Tex .

An oldie but a goodie :
Once upon a time , a young man at the tender age of 20 came up with a life plan which consisted of 13 guidelines .
He kept a daily chart of these 13 goals , and placed a dot next to the ones he failed to abide by each day for the rest of his life .

His name was Benjamin Franklin .
His 13 guidelines included :
