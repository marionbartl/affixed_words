If you have been injured because of someone else ’s negligence , you have two battles ahead :
The battle to recover health and the battle to recover financial stability .
While you have likely already enlisted doctors to help you win the first battle , you may be struggling with the second .
The good news is you do not have to fight that battle alone .
You do not have to take on the healthcare provider and their insurance company by yourself .
You can enlist an advocate who will fight to get you the money you need to recover financially .
At Winckler & Harvey , L.L.P. , our Austin attorneys have more than 95 years of combined experience winning full compensation from insurance companies .
Our goal is to win you maximum compensation for medical expenses , lost wages and other costs .
We have an impressive track record of achieving that goal .
The building materials company James Hardie has announced it has lodged an appeal against rulings made in the Supreme Court of New South Wales last month .
In August the court imposed hefty fines on former board members and banned them from managing a company for various lengths of time over misleading statements about a compensation fund for asbestos victims .
In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange , James Hardie says it is appealing against the declarations and orders made against it by Justice Gzell .
On August 27 , six former James Hardie directors including disgraced chairman Meredith Hellicar were granted a stay on five - year bans meted out in the NSW Supreme Court .
In a brief hearing in the NSW Supreme Court at the time , lawyers for six of the non-executive directors successfully applied for a 28 - day stay on the bans .
Earlier in August , former Hardie chief executive Peter Macdonald , two former James Hardie executives and seven non-executive directors were fined and banned from directing a company .
All were found guilty of breaching the Corporations
Act when making misleading statements about the adequacy of an asbestos compensation fund , and a corporate restructure in 2003 .
Macdonald suffered the harshest penalty , banned from managing a company for 15 years and fined $ 350,000 .
The nine other executives were banned for a period between five and seven years , and fined between $ 30,000 and $ 75,000 .
Hellicar , Michael Brown , Michael Gillfillan , Martin Koffel , Geoffrey O'Brien and Gregory Terry had the disqualifications put off until 5:00 pm AEST on September 24 .
All had been slapped with five - year bans .
All except O'Brien also applied for a September 24 stay on the financial penalty of $ 30,000 - an application granted by Justice Gzell .
The six applications were opposed by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission ( ASIC ) .
Penalties meted out to the disgraced directors came under fire last month , with asbestos victims and their families complaining the fines were too light .
ASIC had called for fines ranging from $ 120,000 for non-executive directors and a fine of between $ 1.48 million and $ 1.87 million against MacDonald .
James Hardie itself was only fined $ 80,000 by Justice Gzell , much less than the $ 200,000 called for by ASIC .

Have your tomato plants been producing like crazy ?
Are your cucumbers and green beans blowing up ?
If you ’re producing more than you can eat , it ’s a great time to preserve some of your summer bounty for winter !
Here are some home canning tips , along with a great five - part series of videos on the topic !
Canning Tips and Tricks
While canning is not exactly rocket science , you do want to take precautions to keep things sterile and ensure that your food is safe .
Make sure you ’re using jars made specifically for canning .
Reusing jars is great for things that you ’re storing short term , but for canned goods , you want the sort of mason jar with a 2 piece lid , like in the picture at the top of this post .
It ’s easiest to can acidic foods , like tomatoes , since the jars just need to be boiled in a regular pots .
The acidity of the contents will do the rest of the work and keep things bacteria free .
If you ’re canning low acid foods , like green beans , you ’ll need a pressure canner .
A good workaround for this is pickling your low acidity vegetables before you can them .
The vinegar adds the acid necessary to use the boiling method and still keep it safe .
Finally , make sure that , if you ’re pouring hot food into your canning jars , that the jars themselves are warm .
Pour hot food into a cold jar , and you might just be spending your afternoon cleaning up broken glass instead of preserving your harvest !
Boo !

Nato aircraft opened fire on hijacked fuel trucks in Afghanistan before dawn today , killing as many as 90 people in an incident that could trigger a backlash against Western troops .
Nato said it believed the dead were all Taliban fighters , but it was investigating reports civilians were also killed .
Villagers said their relatives were collecting fuel from the hijacked trucks and were burned alive in a giant fireball .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
President Hamid Karzai's office gave a death toll of 90 and said an investigation team had gone to the scene .
" No civilians must be harmed during military operations , " Karzai said in a statement .
" Targeting civilians under no circumstances is acceptable . "
The incident , which took place in the northern province of Kunduz , could reignite outrage against foreign troops two months after the new US and Nato commander in the country announced measures to stop civilian deaths he said were undermining the war .
Lieutenant - Commander Christine Sidenstricker , press officer for the US and Nato - led International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) , said Afghan authorities had reported two fuel trucks hijacked .
Nato aircraft spotted them on a river bank .
" After observing that only insurgents were in the area , the local ISAF commander ordered air strikes which destroyed the fuel trucks and killed a large number of insurgents , " she said .
" The strike was against insurgents .
That 's who we believe was killed .
But we are absolutely investigating " reports of civilian deaths , she said .
Asked how pilots could know whether a crowd around the trucks included civilians , she said : " Based on information available at the scene , the commanders believed they were insurgents . "

The incident took place near the border with Tajikistan , in a part the country once seen as safe but where Taliban attacks have become increasingly frequent and fighters have asserted control of remote areas .
The Taliban consider fuel shipments a strategic target because Nato forces depend on them .
The Kunduz area is patrolled mainly by Nato's German contingent , barred by Berlin from operating in combat zones further south .
The incident could add to controversy about Germany 's participation in the war , which is unpopular back home .
Germany confirmed that its commander in the area gave approval for the aircraft to open fire .
A Defence Ministry spokesman in Berlin said it believed more than 50 fighters were killed and had no information about deaths of civilians .
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband called for a " prompt and urgent investigation " .
" It is a vital time for Nato and Afghanistan 's people to come together , " he told SKY news .
" We have a very strong Nato commitment , we need a strong Afghan commitment and obviously incidents like this can only undermine that . "
Preventing civilian deaths has been one of the main themes of the new ISAF commander , US Army General Stanley McChrystal , who took command in June and says the main goal of the war is to defend Afghan civilians , not hunt down insurgents .
Under orders he issued in July , aircraft are not supposed to fire unless they are sure there is no chance civilians can be hurt or are responding to an immediate threat .
Provincial officials , who themselves could face a backlash over civilian deaths , said fighters were killed as well as civilians .
Provincial Governor Mohammad
Omar said he believed half of those killed were militants , while provincial police chief Abdul Razzaq Yaqubi said 55 of the 90 dead were fighters .
" My brother was burnt when the aircraft bombed the fuel tankers .
I do n't know whether he is dead or alive , " said weeping villager Ghulam Yahya , one of dozens of relatives gathered outside Kunduz Central Hospital in the provincial capital .
Mohammad Sarwar , a tribal elder in the province , said Taliban fighters had hijacked the tankers and were offering fuel to a crowd of villagers when the tankers were bombed .
" We blame both the Taliban and the government , " he said .
Mohammad Humayun Khamosh , a doctor at the Kunduz hospital , said 13 people arrived there for treatment .
Reuters reporters saw several young men with severe burns arrive by ambulance .
A Taliban spokesman , Zabihullah Mujahid , said fighters had captured the two fuel tankers .
One had become stuck in mud by a village , and the fighters went to try to tow it when residents gathered to take the fuel and the crowd was struck .
US President Barack Obama has made stabilising Afghanistan a foreign policy priority although public support for the war has eroded as US combat deaths have risen to record levels .
Obama has ordered 21,000 extra troops to Afghanistan this year , continuing an escalation begun under former President George W. Bush .
More than 103,000 Western troops are in Afghanistan , including 63,000 Americans .
TAIPEI ( Reuters ) - Researchers in Taiwan have discovered what the believe is the island ’s oldest civilization , dating back about 20,000 years and belonging to a pygmy - like people that came from China , Southeast Asia or beyond , the team leader said on Friday .
Taiwan ’s government - run Academia Sinica , which found more than 200 stone tools at the Ba Hsien Cave excavation site on the island ’s east coast , will return next year to seek clues on who was living there , leader Tsang Chen - hua said .
The civilization was probably a dark - skinned people similar to Negritos , a term that covers several ethnic groups of short stature in isolated parts of Southeast Asia , Tsang said .
Their exact origin and migration route in Asia remain a mystery .
“ Where they ’re from is a good question .
We propose saying they ’re Negritos , but we have n’t found a human skull yet , ” Tsang said .
“ We need to go back to see if they ’re from China or the Indochinese peninsula . ”
Taiwan ’s Negritos , who once numbered as many as 90,000 but are now extinct , may have reached Taiwan from Madagascar via the islands of Southeast Asia , some scholars say .
Others believe they came via China , 160 km ( 100 miles ) away across the Taiwan Strait .
Ethnic Chinese people are Taiwan ’s racial majority today .
An 11 - person Academia Sinica team , funded by central and local government departments , spent 10 months digging up the tools , Tsang said .
They will continue the search next year .
The report offered several possible explanations for the disparity between the private and public sectors .
It noted that there can be a short lag between an economic downturn and the time it hits states in the form of lower tax collections , and an even longer delay before the problems hit local governments in the form of reduced state aid and lower property tax collections .
It pointed to the slow pace of decision - making in many states , and the power yielded by politically influential unions .
But it also noted that the demand for many government services rises in a recession , and said that billions of dollars of federal stimulus money sent to states helped them avert layoffs .
The expansion , coming as many states and localities are raising taxes , troubled Tad DeHaven , a budget analyst for the Cato Institute , a libertarian research group in Washington .
“ That is disturbing , ” Mr. DeHaven said .
“ Basically what you have is your producers in society losing their jobs and looking for work , and their tax burden is n’t necessarily going down  and as a matter of fact they are likely to face tax increases going forward  and government growing . ”
States are likely to cut more jobs this year .
Many have already imposed furloughs on their workers , reducing their pay , and with states facing record declines in tax collections , several are planning to cut their work forces .
The report noted that some hard - hit states had already made deep cuts , led by Arizona , which cut its state government employment by 8.6 percent from the spring of 2008 to this spring .
The disparity between the public and private sector job market is striking in places like Boise , Idaho .
Since the recession began , the area ’s unemployment rate has more than doubled , to over 10.1 percent in June , as big employers , especially in the technology sector , shed workers .
The Boise area lost 20,000 jobs in the year ending in June , the Idaho Labor Department said , and saw real gains only in government , which had an increase of 1,400 jobs , mostly in the public schools .
A descendant of the language that Charles Moore developed was , at one time , the most widely implemented of all computer languages ; it was not so much the language of commercial applications but of process control , instrumentation , and of computer peripherals .
Forth was extraordinarily advanced for its time , and is still being developed .
It spawned other languages such as STOIC and PostScript , and proved so versatile that even a commercial spreadsheet was written in it .
In a sense , if you use a PostScript printer , or send .psf or .eps files , you ’re using a software technology that Charles Moore first developed .
“ I despair .
Technology , and
our very civilization , will get
more and more complex until
it collapses .
There is no
opposing pressure to limit
this growth . ”
It may sound hard to believe but four decades ago , when computing was almost exclusively the province of a handful of scientists , giant corporations , and the military , it was the Governments that were the chief funders of personal computing research .
They bought the machines on which the early researchers worked and were visionary advocates who imagined that technology held far - reaching economic implications , way beyond the immediate military uses .
It was the era in which ideas being pursued at two laboratories located on opposite sides of Stanford University would re-shape the way we communicate .
At one end of the Stanford campus was Doug Englebart ’s Augmented Human Intellect Research Institute , dedicated to the concept that powerful computing machines would be able to substantially increase ( augment ) the power of the human mind .
In contrast John McCarthy ’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the other end of the university began with the goal of creating a simulated human intelligence .
Charles ‘ Chuck ’ Moore , best known for the work in developing the Forth software language , was a disciple of McCarthy and his development of simple but powerful languages and applications owes a lot to his tutor ’s clear mind .
Born in McKeesport Pennsylvania , near Pittsburgh , in 1938 , Moore grew up in Flint Michigan he was granted a National Merit scholarship to MIT where he joined Kappa Sigma fraternity .
Awarded a degree in physics he arrived at Stanford where he studied mathematics for 2 years from 1961 .
He then worked on Fortran II for the IBM 704 to predict Moonwatch satellite observations at Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory .
Around this time he began learning Algol for the Burroughs B5500 to optimize and as Charles H Moore and Associates , he wrote a Fortran - Algol translator to support a timesharing service .
“ Get a bare - bones application running quickly .
Demonstrate it and get feedback from users .
Then modify and expand capability : much
more satisfactory than planning in advance ”
Moore co-founded Forth Inc. in 1971 with Elizabeth Rather , after which he developed the Forth - based chip that was taken to market in the mid 1980s by Harris Corporation as the RTX2000 , derivatives of which are still being widely used by NASA .
At Computer Cowboys , he designed the wonderfully named Sh - Boom microprocessor , and then co-founded iTV , an Internet Appliance manufacturer .
During the1990s , Moore used his own CAD software to design several custom VLSI chips , including the F21 processor with a network interface .
More recently , he invented ColorForth and ported his VLSI design tools to it .
His software is still in widespread use today .

In the name of Allah , the Merciful , the Compassionate
The decisive and complete boycott of the Afghan people with the August 20 election showed once again that the Afghans could not be trapped through conspiracies and wiles of the invaders and their surrogates .
Contrarily , they have been continuing their legitimate struggle to establish an Islamic system and regain national independence .
The gallant Mujahideen staged incessant attacks in the east , west , north and south of the country which frustrated the organizers of the election in the White House and turned their hopes into despondency .
The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan appreciates the stance of the Afghans to completely boycott the American drama .
The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan assures them that the martyrdom - seeking youth affiliated with the Islamic Emirate will continue to protect your honour by shedding their blood and will keep up the current momentum of the lawful and legitimate struggle until the last soldier of the invaders leave our country .
Similarly , the Islamic Emirate will not allow the invaders and their surrogates to play with your destiny .
Dear Country men :
Yesterday , the Russians had launched their self - same nefarious scheme in our country under the well - known slogan of bread , cloth and shelter and was trying to create division among the different ethnicities and the north and south of the country by applying the notorious formula of divide them and subjugate them .
They martyred , injured , imprisoned and made homeless millions of Afghans in order to implement their wicked and ambitious ideology .
Today America and its allies are busy strafing , detaining , torturing and killing the Afghans under the empty slogans of democracy , reconstruction and philanthropy .
They want to start the flames of racial prejudices in our country .
However , the menace of racial bigotry had been dispelled from our country because of wisdom and sagacity of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan .
Thus , the enemy wants to revive the wicked perceptions and notions of disintegration of Afghanistan .
The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has worked out plans aimed at targeting the enemies of Islam , humanity , peace and freedom .
We are sure , we will have the blessing of freedom in the near future with the help of Allah ( swt ) and the support of the people of Afghanistan .
We will have an independent , progressive and pure Islamic regime in the prideful Afghanistan .
Being the embodiment of the aspirations of the people of Afghanistan , the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan declares categorically that the election of August 20 has no legitimacy whatsoever .
This was a superficial parody to trick the Afghans and the public of the world by showing to them that the Afghans have no problems with the deployment and existence of foreign troops on their soil .
Moreover , to show that the Afghans are free to elect their future president by ballots .
But it is clear as the broad day light that the Afghans have been opposing the existence of the foreign troops on their soil and the installation of the stooge regime from day one .
They have resorted to the current armed jihad to defend the territorial sovereignty of our country and the Islamic and national values of our people .
- Down with the enemy of Islam and the country .
- Victorious be the freedom - loving fighters .
Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan
‘ WHITEHOUSE , TX ( KLTV ) –
The school year is almost here , and if literature of the Bible is not already offered in your child ’s school , it will be this fall . ’
‘ Books are a common sight in classrooms around the nation , but the Bible is one book that is not .
Come this fall , a Texas law says all public schools must offer information relating to the Bible in their curriculum . ’
The law was actually passed in 2007 but first goes into effect for the 2009 - 2010 school year .
Here you can find a copy of it to read over yourself .
Take special notice of the part that lays out the required curriculum :
Of course they have the obligatory ‘ a course offered under this law shall not endorse , favor , or promote , or disfavor or show hostility toward any particular religion or nonreligious faith or religious perspective . ’
But I imagine Texas schools wont be requiring classes on the Talmud , Q’uran , Tao Te Ching , LaVey ’s Satanic Bible , Dianetics , Eastern Orthodox Bible , Wicca , or Militant Atheist texts any time soon .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
And now , the rejects .
The photographs show the Boeing VC - 25 making a steep bank not usually seen with passenger aircraft more photos »
Three months after the White House released a single photograph taken during a photo op of " Air Force One " flying over New York -- a flight that caused panic on the streets below -- the U.S. Air Force on Friday released the remaining 145 photos taken during the flight .
The photographs show the Boeing VC - 25 -- a military version of a 747 -- making three passes by the Statue of Liberty , at one point accompanied by an F - 16 fighter jet and at another point making a steep bank not usually seen with passenger aircraft .
That latter move may have contributed to the chaos below .
The photographs and several lengthy government e-mail chains were released in response to Freedom of Information Act requests by CNN and other news organizations .
The e-mail chains show that the flight 's government organizers were aware of many New Yorkers ' fears of low - flying aircraft before the April 27 flight , and show a flurry of second - guessing , finger - pointing , damage control and occasional expressions of regret in the hours immediately after the flight .
Watch a compilation of still images of the flyover »
" Thanks for the heads up on sensitivities in the New York area , " an Air Force colonel wrote in an e-mail two days before the flight .
" This is an issue that PAG [ the Presidential Airlift Group ] has also been concerned with .
As a result , their coordination has been substantial . "
But while the White House , the military and numerous federal and local government agencies coordinated the flight , the federal government demanded secrecy , preparing a news release that was to be distributed only if there were media inquiries .
Those inquiries came during the morning flight , triggering a quick chain of e-mails among government officials .
" We ... need to construct some sort of timeline on when folks became aware of it if that is possible , " one Air Force official wrote , responding to the public interest .
" I agree we ... need to accomplish damage control , but we are n't the POC [ point of contact ] , " the response reads .
" Nor do I want to become a belly button for NORAD to push on this one . "
Wrote one top Pentagon spokeswoman : " Nothing like having everyone point the finger at someone else so we ALL look like a big bunch of buffoons ... can you say Moe , Larry & Curly !??!?! "
In addition to the informal e-mail banter , the documents show the regimented system the Pentagon uses to monitor and respond to breaking news stories .
A U.S. Northern Command document offers this " assessment " of the story : " Last 4 hours : Story reported quickly .
Covered by AP , CNN , FOX major news outlets .
Local reporting very critical , highlighting ' scare ' factor .
Local populace very critical of event , due to 9 - 11 sensitivities . "
It continues : " Web site blog comments ' furious ' at best .
Twitter search reveals ' tweets ' regarding two F - 16's chasing commercial airliner .
Rate of 1 tweet per minute and growing . "
" No positive spin is possible .
Admit mistake , " it concludes .
In another e-mail , USAF Col.
Scott M. Turner , commander of the Presidential Airlift Group , was doing just that .
" Again , my apologies sir .
Real intent here was to honor NYC , not cause mass chaos , " it reads .
The next day , the Northern Command 's internal memo included depictions of New York 's three major tabloids featuring the headlines , " Scare Force One , " " Just Plane Stupid ! " and " How Dumb Was This ! "
The photographs released Friday , meanwhile , show the presidential aircraft making a steep bank , seemingly well beyond the 30 - degree maximum for Boeing 747s carrying passengers , according to one airline pilot consulted by CNN .
That may have contributed to the anxiety on the ground .
The Pentagon estimated the cost of the flight at $ 328,835 , which includes the Boeing aircraft and the two fighter jets that accompanied it .
But , they said , " the hours would have been flown regardless , and the expenses would have been accrued on a different mission . "
The VC - 25 aircraft is designated " Air Force One " only when the president is aboard .
President Obama was not on the plane during the photo op .
After the incident , Louis Caldera , the director of the White House Military Office responsible for the flyover , resigned .
" I have concluded that the controversy surrounding the Presidential Airlift Group 's aerial photo shoot over New York City has made it impossible for me to effectively lead the White House Military Office , " Caldera said in a letter to Obama .
" Moreover , it has become a distraction to the important work you are doing as president .
After much reflection , I believe it is incumbent on me to tender my resignation and step down as director of the White House Military Office . "

Salmon Bay Sand & Gravel has been fined $ 12,000 by the Department of Ecology for clean water violations in the Ship Canal .
The Department of Ecology says violations by Salmon Bay Sand & Gravel include “ ongoing spills of aggregate — a sand and gravel mixture — from shore - side bunkers ” at their facility at 5231 Shilshole Avenue NW into the Lake Washington Ship Canal .
State law outlaws the discharge of foreign material to state waters .
Other violations cited by the department include lack of a spill - response plan at the facility and not having records of required twice - yearly stormwater inspections .
The Department of Ecology says the company did not respond to repeated attempts made last year to discuss the water - quality problem .
After a “ Notice of Violation ” was issued this last February , the company had 30 days to respond .
“ This case escalated into a penalty because Salmon Bay did not respond , ” said Kevin Fitzpatrick , the Department of Ecology ’s regional water quality supervisor .
“ Most of the violations themselves require fairly straightforward corrections . ”
Salmon Bay Sand & Gravel has the option to seek an Ecology review of the penalty or file an appeal within 30 days with the Washington State Pollution Control Hearings Board .

The Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission has approved a request by Bell Canada to implement usage - based billing for its wholesale internet customers .
The decision , made on an interim basis , could result in lower download limits for customers of smaller companies such as Teksavvy and Acanac that rent portions of Bell 's network to provide their own internet services .
Smaller ISPs , which typically allow customers to download hundreds of gigabytes a month , may be forced to lower their limits to Bell levels .
Bell 's most popular plan allows customers to download 50 gigabytes a month .
The CRTC on Wednesday also approved a request from Bell that will allow the company to charge small ISPs 75 cents for every gigabyte over 300 that their customers use .
Smaller ISPs had fought the requests and said if granted , their services would become indistinguishable from Bell's .
The CRTC last year also allowed Bell to extend its traffic management practices , where certain uses of the internet such as peer - to - peer file - sharing are slowed or " throttled , " to smaller ISPs .
Independent companies are therefore required to throttle their own customers as well .
Although the CRTC ruled in favour of Bell during the throttling dispute , it also launched an inquiry into the larger issue of net neutrality , or how much control internet providers should have over the connections they provide to customers .
The regulator is expected to make a ruling on net neutrality by the end of the year .
Consumer concern
Internet experts said that with usage - based billing , the CRTC has once again ruled in favour of Bell at the expense of consumers .
" It raises significant competition concerns since it suggests that independent ISPs will further lose their ability to differentiate their services , " University of Ottawa internet law professor Michael Geist said .
" It also calls into question Bell 's claims during the traffic management hearing that they can't differentiate between providers since the implementation of [ usage - based billing ] would mean much more detailed info about end users . "
Mirko Bibic , head of regulatory affairs for Bell , said the company 's network - management technology is capable of differentiating between wholesale customers for accounting and usage - based billing purposes but not for traffic shaping , a fact that was made clear in its filings during the CRTC hearing .
" Our statements to the CRTC were and have always been accurate , " he said .
Bell stopped offering unlimited downloading to its own retail customers a few years ago .
Throttling and usage - based billing are key parts of its strategy to fight congestion on its network .
Critics , however , have said that Bell has so far failed to prove its network is congested .
Rocky Gaudrault , head of Teksavvy , was angry with the CRTC 's decision and said it will limit his company 's ability to offer new services such as television over the internet and could see an increase to customers ' bills of $ 10 to $ 20 .
" Today 's decision has to send a clear picture to those the CRTC have to answer to , " he said .
" Someone needs to step in and audit how these lawmakers come to their conclusions as predatory tactics , which last I checked were not allowed in Canada , are being allowed to march through the regulatory gates without any resistance , all while laughing in the face of both Joe competitor and Joe public . "
The CRTC has given small ISPs 90 days to prepare for the implementation of Bell 's usage - based billing .

Economic History and the Recession
If you ask a modern economic historian — like , say , me — if I know why the world is currently in the grips of a financial crisis and a deep downturn , I will say that I do know and I will give you this answer :
This is the latest episode in a long history of similar episodes of bubble — crash — crisis — recession , episodes that date back at least to the canal bubble of the early 1820s , the 1825 - 6 failure of Pole , Thornton , and company , and the subsequent first industrial recession in Britain .
We have seen this process at work in many other historical episodes as well — 1870 , 1890 , 1929 , and 2000 , for example .
For some reason asset prices get way out of whack and rise to unsustainable levels .
Sometimes the culprit is lousy internal controls in financial firms that overreward subordinates for taking risk ; sometimes it is government guarantees ; sometimes it is the selection of the market as a long run of good fortune leaves the financial market dominated by cockeyed unrealistic overoptimists .
Then the crash comes .
And when the crash comes the risk tolerance of the market collapses : everybody knows that there are immense unrealized losses in financial assets and nobody is sure that they know where they are .
The crash is followed by a flight to safety .
The flight to safety is followed by a steep fall in the velocity of money as investors everywhere hoard cash .
And the fall in monetary velocity brings on a recession .
I will not say that this is the pattern of all recessions : it is n’t .
But I will say that this is the pattern of this recessions — that we have been here before .
Macroeconomic Theory and the Recession
If you ask the same question of a modern macroeconomist — like , say , the extremely sharp Narayana Kocherlakota of the University of Minnesota — you will find that he says that he does not know :
Why do we have business cycles ?
Why do asset prices move around so much ?...
[ M ] acroeconomics has little to offer by way of answer to these questions ...
He will say that there are models that attribute economic downturns to various causes :
[ M]ost models in macroeconomics rely on some form of large quarterly movements in the technological frontier .
Some have collective shocks to the marginal utility of leisure .
Other models have large quarterly shocks to the depreciation rate in the capital stock ( in order to generate high asset price volatilities ) ...
That is , downturns are either the result of a great forgetting of technological and organizational knowledge , a great vacation as workers develop a sudden extra taste for leisure , or a great rusting as the speed with which oxygen in the air corrodes speeds up and so reduces the value of large things made out of metal .
But he will say that all these strike him as implausible just - so stories that do not illuminate : not to be taken seriously :
The sources of disturbances in macroeconomic models are ( to my taste ) patently unrealistic ....
None of these disturbances seem compelling , to put it mildly ...
And so nobody really believes them :
Macroeconomists use them only as convenient short - cuts to generate the requisite levels of volatility in endogenous variables ...
Just What Is Going on Here ?
This leads me to ask two questions :
First , it does not seem to me that it is the case that nobody really believes these just - so stories .
Ed Prescott of Arizona State University really does believe that large - scale recessions are caused by economy - wide episodes of the forgetting of the technological and organizational knowledge that underpins total factor productivity — with the exception of episodes like the Great Depression , which Prescott says was caused by the extraordinary pro-labor pro-union policies of Herbert Hoover that pushed real wages far above equilibrium values .
Casey Mulligan of the University of Chicago really does appear to believe that large falls in the employment - to- population ratio are best seen as “ great vacations ” — and as the side - effects of destructive government policies like those in place today , which are leading workers to quit their jobs so they can get higher government subsidies to refinance their mortgages .
( I know ; I find it incredible too . )
Things that strike Kocherlakota as “ patently unrealistic ” are not viewed as such by many of his modern macroeconomic peers and colleagues .
Why not ?
Why do they find these just - so stories satisfactory ?
Second , whether modern macroeconomics attributes our current difficulties either to causes that I agree with Kocherlakota are “ patently unrealistic ” or simply confesses ignorance , why do they have such a different view than we economic historians do ?
Whether they have rejected our interpretations and understandings or simply have built up or failed to build up their own in ignorance of what we have done , why have they not taken and used our work ?
The second question is particularly disturbing to me .
There is , after all , no place for economic theory of any flavor to come from than from economic history .
Someone observes some instructive case or some anecdotal or empirical regularity , says “ this is interesting ; let 's build a model of this , ” and economic theory is off and running .
Theory is crystalized history — it can be nothing more .
After the initial crystalization it does develop on its own according to its own intellectual imperatives and processes , true , but the seed is still there .
What happened to the seed ?
This situation is personally and professionally dismaying .
I do not say that the macroeconomic model - building of the past generation has been pointless .
I do n’t think that it has been pointless .
But I do think that the assembled modern macroeconomists need to be rounded up , on pain of loss of tenure , and sent to a year - long boot camp with the assembled monetary historians of the world as their drill sergeants .
They need to listen to and learn from Dick Sylla about Cornelius Buller ’s bank rescue of 1825 and Charlie Calomiris about the Overend , Gurney crisis and Michael Bordo about the first bankruptcy of Baring brothers and Barry Eichengreen and Christy Romer and Ben Bernanke about the Great Depression .
If modern macreconomics does not reconnect — if they do not realize just what their theories are crystallized out of , and what the point of the enterprise is — then they will indeed wither and die .

From rock star engineers like Mark Lucovsky to whiz entrepreneurs like Dick Costolo , Google ( GOOG ) seems to lose a top tier employee every week .
Click here to scroll through the Google Brain Drain →
Why are so many talented people fleeing such a successful company ?
After speaking with a few of former Googlers , we can say it basically boils down to four reasons .
Google does n't feel as entrepreneurial as it used to .
It was n't so long ago that Google was a startup and it took every employee 's full resources to keep the thing thriving .
Now Google is a company that knows what it 's good at -- search advertising -- and is focused on making that business more efficient .
For a lot of employees who joined Google at the beginning or through acquisitions -- among others , we 're thinking of early Googler Tim Armstrong and former DoubleClick CEO David Rosenblatt here -- solving a big company 's problems of efficiency is kind of boring .
There are only so many top spots at Google .
Through its own recruiting and through the acquisition of hot startups , Google hires only the best -- lots and lots of " type - a " achievement - focused people .
But there 's only so many top jobs at any company .
Talented people like Dick Costolo , the former CEO of FeedBurner , who came over when Google bought his company , sometimes have to leave to get a title that suits their ambitions .
Dick is now Twitter 's chief operating officer .
He was n't going to get that job at Google .
Other companies try really hard to hire Googlers , so they offer them lots of money and great titles .
Former VP of ad sales Tim Armstrong had a great , comfortable gig at Google .
But then Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes asked him to become CEO of AOL , and offered up to $ 50 million in stock options .
He had to jump at it .
Google is a huge company now , so turnover could be very light percentage - wise , but it will still look like a lot of people are quitting .
Once a tiny startup , Google now has almost 30,000 employees .
The company with smallest turnover in Fortune 's " 100 best companies to work for " loses 2 % of its employees every year .
At Google , that would be almost 600 people a year -- about the same size as Facebook 's entire headcount at the end of 2008 .
Still , it 's always shocking to hear that a company so successful and so famously pleasant to work for has lost top - tier employees like the following 17 that quit over the past few years :
Kai-Fu Lee , President of Google Inc.'s China operations
Michael Rubenstein , General Manager of Google Ad Exchange
Dick Costolo , CEO of Google - acquired FeedBurner
Mark Lucovsky , Engineering director
Alexander Macgillivray , Deputy general counsel
Jeff Levick , Vice president of sales
Erin Clift , Director of agency relations
Greg Badros , Senior Director of Engineering
David Rosenblatt , President of display advertising
Tim Armstrong , VP of ad sales
Larry Brilliant , Director of Google.org
Suhkinder Singh Cassidy , President for Asia - Pacific & Latin America operations
Steve Horowitz , Engineering Director , Android
Elliot Schrage , VP , global communications and public affairs
Sheryl Sandberg , Vice president , Global Online Sales and Operations
Gonzalo Alonso , Latin America director
Doug Merrill , Chief information officer , VP of engineering

As companies continue to lay off workers , here 's another reason for people to worry about joining the ranks of the unemployed :
They may find a smaller severance package than they expect .
The unemployment rate fell to 9.4 % last month , but 247,000 jobs were still lost in that period .
And the more people laid off by companies , the larger the chunk of change being paid out in the form of severance pay , continued health benefits , retraining and other services .
So companies are beginning to put such payments under the microscope .

One way the United States could slash its electricity use , dependence on fossil fuels and emissions of heat - trapping gases is really quite simple : better light bulbs .
The Department of Energy is backing research and development aimed at getting light - emitting diodes into common use in homes and businesses at a price that saves money .
Hurdles remain : Costs are still high , the quality of what 's on the market varies and not all the technical issues have been worked out .
Energy experts are confident , however , that this new lighting is the future and that energy savings will be enormous .
Lighting consumes 22 percent of electricity in the United States .
The DOE predicts that solid - state lighting -- which uses semiconducting materials to convert electricity into light , and includes LEDs -- has the potential to reduce energy use for lighting by one - third by 2030 .
That 's the equivalent of saving the output of 40 large ( 1,000 - megawatt ) power plants , the greenhouse gas emissions of 47 million cars and $ 30 billion .
LEDs already light universities from Miami to Anchorage , Alaska , streets in many cities and an increasing number of businesses that need lights on all the time .
" In your home , lighting may be 10 percent of your bill .
But in an office building it 's probably 40 percent , and so if you reduce your lighting energy consumption by a large fraction , the savings will be huge , " said James Brodrick , who leads the DOE 's solid - state lighting program .
A fact sheet from Brodrick 's office says this about LEDs : " In the coming decade , they will become a key to affordable net - zero energy buildings , buildings that produce at least as much energy annually as they use from the grid . "
The technology is advancing quickly , and costs will continue to drop , Brodrick said .
The DOE tests LEDs and sets performance and efficiency guidelines under its Energy Star program .
LEDs are directional lights , used in recessed lighting and under - counter lights , for example .
They 're not yet available as bulbs that cast light all around and fit in ordinary sockets .
" There 's an enormous and exciting potential , but we have a long way to go before we see anything besides directional lighting , " said Jeffrey P. Harris , the vice president for programs at the Alliance to Save Energy , a nonprofit group that promotes energy efficiency .
Even so , LEDs already are used to light offices , hotels , restaurants and other businesses .
The DOE predicts that LEDs will have better performance capability than fluorescent lighting in the next few years , and that they 'll continue to improve after that .
They 're now comparable with fluorescent fixtures in efficiency , and the DOE says its Energy Star LEDs last two to five times longer .
Cost is the biggest reason that LEDs are n't used more widely , Brodrick said .
A common PAR 38 floodlight at Home Depot , for example , costs about $ 35 online as an LED , about $ 3.70 apiece in a pack of 15 as a halogen floodlight and about $ 11 for a compact fluorescent .
Chuck Swoboda , the chairman and chief executive officer of Cree Inc. of Durham , N.C. , a leading company in LED lighting , said that commercial use of LEDs would drive down costs , and that a lower initial cost plus the value of energy savings would make them attractive .
" It 's not that different from the argument of why you should put insulation in a home , " he said .
LEDs have other advantages :
They can be dimmed , do n't emit heat , do n't contain mercury -- unlike compact fluorescents -- and can produce warm - toned light .
Swoboda said that Cree was focusing on commercial sales now because that market was bigger than the residential market and commercial users got quicker paybacks from reduced energy and maintenance costs .
In April , Cree announced that it had a new LED PAR 38 bulb designed for stores and museums that uses 12 watts of power instead of 50 to 90 watts for a halogen bulb .
" What happens with LEDs is people think of them as things that go in your cell phone or things you put in the car dashboard , but they do n't think of it as truly a lighting product , " Swoboda said .
" And so this was the latest innovation to kind of go out and show people you can pretty much do anything you can do in an incandescent bulb technology or in fluorescents with LEDs . "
Home Depot , the world 's biggest retailer of light bulbs , is starting to stock LED bulbs this summer and plans to have 10 kinds by September , said Jorge Fernandez , who 's in charge of light bulb purchases for the company .
" There 's definitely a lot of interest , but the price is high , and a lot of people say they 're waiting to see when the price drops , " he said .
Felicia Spagnoli , a spokeswoman for Philips Lighting Electronics North America , said commercial users could make up for the higher costs of LEDs in as little as a year or two .
" We can address environmental concerns at the same time we improve the quality and use of light , " she said .
" Many people when they think of doing good for the environment think it means going without or having lesser quality , but that 's absolutely not the case with LEDs . "
Philips is working on many kinds of LEDs , including one to replace a 40 - watt incandescent bulb that 's scheduled to be available next year , she said .
Derrick Hall of RE / Construct Inc. in Asheville , N.C. , said that residential customers were n't asking for LEDs because of the high upfront cost .
Still , he 's hearing of some nonresidential customers who are looking into LEDs for the energy savings .
LEDs are much better than other lighting options , Hall said .
The quality of the light is " far superior , " they offer big energy savings and there 's no cost to society for dealing with mercury , he said .
Mercury , a neurotoxin , is found in small amounts in compact fluorescent bulbs .
Swoboda said that some of the biggest commercial users for LEDs now were fast - food restaurants , because LEDs ' light makes food look appealing .
A McDonald 's that opened in July in Cary , N.C. , is lit almost entirely with daylight and LED lights .
Ric Richards , the franchise owner , said the restaurant used 78 percent less electricity than a traditional one .
And the quality of the light ?
" Awesome , " he said .
" The restaurant has great ambience . "
Richards estimated that the upfront costs of the lighting would be paid back in two to four years with lower electricity bills .
In Washington , the Pentagon is installing LED lights in a large renovation .
Mark Buffler , an official in charge of technology in the Office of the Secretary of Defense , said in a report that switching from conventional fluorescents to LEDs would conserve large amounts of energy _ 240,000 kilowatt hours annually _ and save money on maintenance and mercury disposal .
Buffler also wrote that the project was meant to demonstrate the energy savings potential of LEDs for the rest of the federal government .

Monkey magic at the rodeo as primate rounds up sheep riding a border collie
Dogs can be darned tricky critters .
So when you 're in the saddle hold tight , keep your hat on and above all , let him know who 's boss .
This , at least , is how this tiny cowboy has stayed king of the rodeo for 18 years .
That and his fabulous outfit of course .
From the moment he rides into the rodeo ring on the back of his border collie , Whiplash the capuchin monkey is the star of the show .
Whiplash , riding a trusty border collie for a steed , concentrates on the job in hand - rounding up sheep
With the help of his trusty steed , he rounds up a flock of startled sheep .
Then there 's the crowd 's favourite ' hi - ho silver ' moment when the collie becomes a bucking bronco and Whiplash rides tall in the saddle .
Well , as tall as a 12in cowboy can .
His owner , Tommy Lucia , 67 , dismisses claims from animal campaigners that Whiplash would be better off in the rainforests of Central or South America , his native habitat .
' I rescued him from a stinking cage in Florida when he was just a baby and I can assure you he'd let me know if life was n't good , ' he declared .
Mr Lucia and Whiplash are regulars at the rodeo in Big Spring , Texas .
Monkey magic : Whiplash the Cowboy Monkey was the star of this year 's rodeo
But their fan base is rapidly growing .
Like most 21 - year - olds , Whiplash is on Facebook .
And after starring in a TV ad for a taco restaurant chain , he is also an Internet hit , being seen by millions on YouTube .
Mr Lucia says Whiplash keeps his collies on a short rein .
' The sheepdogs know their place and he curses them like he does me if they are not doing what he says , ' he said .
' He 's got such a strong will you never quite know what he 's going to do - there 's always a surprise .
But he 's a natural in the saddle .
' When he 's done for the day he goes to our motor home for dinner .
His favourite foods are pears , apples , bananas and especially strawberries . '

A process that cleans wastewater and generates electricity can also remove 90 percent of salt from brackish water or seawater , according to an international team of researchers from China and the U.S .
Clean water for drinking , washing and industrial uses is a scarce resource in some parts of the world .
Its availability in the future will be even more problematic .
Many locations already desalinate water using either a reverse osmosis process -- one that pushes water under high pressure through membranes that allow water to pass but not salt -- or an electrodialysis process that uses electricity to draw salt ions out of water through a membrane .
Both methods require large amounts of energy .
" Water desalination can be accomplished without electrical energy input or high water pressure by using a source of organic matter as the fuel to desalinate water , " the researchers report in a recent online issue of Environmental Science and Technology .
" The big selling point is that it currently takes a lot of electricity to desalinate water and using the microbial desalination cells , we could actually desalinate water and produce electricity while removing organic material from wastewater , " said Bruce Logan , Kappe Professor of Environmental Engineering , Penn State
The team modified a microbial fuel cell -- a device that uses naturally occurring bacteria to convert wastewater into clean water producing electricity -- so it could desalinate salty water .
" Our main intent was to show that using bacteria we can produce sufficient current to do this , " said Logan .
" However , it took 200 milliliters of an artificial wastewater -- acetic acid in water -- to desalinate 3 milliliters of salty water .
This is not a practical system yet as it is not optimized , but it is proof of concept . "
A typical microbial fuel cell consists of two chambers , one filled with wastewater or other nutrients and the other with water , each containing an electrode .
Naturally occurring bacteria in the wastewater consume the organic material and produce electricity .
The researchers , who also included Xiaoxin Cao , Xia Huang , Peng Liang , Kang Xiao , Yinjun Zhou and Xiaoyuan Zhang , at Tsinghua University , Beijing , changed the microbial fuel cell by adding a third chamber between the two existing chambers and placing certain ion specific membranes -- membranes that allow either positive or negative ions through , but not both -- between the central chamber and the positive and negative electrodes .
Salty water to be desalinated is placed in the central chamber .
Seawater contains about 35 grams of salt per liter and brackish water contains 5 grams per liter .
Salt not only dissolves in water , it dissociates into positive and negative ions .
When the bacteria in the cell consume the wastewater it releases charged ions -- protons -- into the water .
These protons cannot pass the anion membrane , so negative ions move from the salty water into the wastewater chamber .
At the other electrode protons are consumed , so positively charged ions move from the salty water to the other electrode chamber , desalinating the water in the middle chamber .
The desalination cell releases ions into the outer chambers that help to improve the efficiency of electricity generation compared to microbial fuel cells .
" When we try to use microbial fuel cells to generate electricity , the conductivity of the wastewater is very low , " said Logan .
" If we could add salt it would work better .
Rather than just add in salt , however in places where brackish or salt water is already abundant , we could use the process to additionally desalinate salty water , clean the wastewater and dump it and the resulting salt back into the ocean . "
Because the salt in the water helps the cell generate electricity , as the central chamber becomes less salty , the conductivity decreases and the desalination and electrical production decreases , which is why only 90 percent of the salt is removed .
However , a 90 percent decrease in salt in seawater would produce water with 3.5 grams of salt per liter , which is less than brackish water .
Brackish water would contain only 0.5 grams of salt per liter .
Another problem with the current cell is that as protons are produced at one electrode and consumed at the other electrode , these chambers become more acidic and alkaline .
Mixing water from the two chambers together when they are discharged would once again produce neutral , salty water , so the acidity and alkalinity are not an environmental problem assuming the cleaned wastewater is dumped into brackish water or seawater .
However , the bacteria that run the cell might have a problem living in highly acidic environments .
For this experiment , the researchers periodically added a pH buffer avoiding the acid problem , but this problem will need to be considered if the system is to produce reasonable amounts of desalinized water .

Want to launch something into space ?
You can now do just that for only $ 8,000 USD .
The rocket company Interorbital Services ( IOS ) is offering their “ TubeSat Personal Satellite Kit ” that can carry 0.75 - kg into orbit .
The price includes a launch into low Earth orbit on an IOS NEPTUNE 30 launch vehicle to 310 kilometers ( 192 miles ) above the Earth .
TubeSats are designed to be orbit - friendly , and not contribute to orbital debris by being in a self - decaying orbit .
Launches are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2010 .
Interorbital says a TubeSat is designed to function as a basic satellite bus or as a simple stand - alone satellite .
Each TubeSat kit includes the satellite ’s structural components , safety hardware , solar panels , batteries , power management hardware and software , transceiver , antennas , microcomputer , and the required programming tools .
With these components alone , the builder can construct a satellite that puts out enough power to be picked up on the ground by a hand - held HAM radio receiver .
Simple applications include broadcasting a repeating message from orbit or programming the satellite to function as a private orbital HAM radio relay station .
These are just two examples .
The TubeSat also allows the builder to add his or her own experiment or function to the basic TubeSat kit .
Possible experiments include Earth imagery , measuring the orbital environment , tracking something like migratory animals , testing hardware or software in the space environment , or doing on - orbit advertising .
There are two different payment options .
If you pay the full cost upfront , you will be placed immediately placed on a launch manifest according to the order in which the payment was received .
If you pay half the cost upfront , and then pay the other half of the cost at a later date , you will be placed on a launch manifest according to the time when full payment is received .
Good news : Interorbital takes Paypal .

Imitation , the old saying goes , is the sincerest form of flattery .
It also appears to be an ancient interpersonal mechanism that promotes social bonding and , presumably , sets the stage for relative strangers to coalesce into groups of friends , according to a study by a team of scientists at the National Institutes of Health and two Italian research institutions .
The study authors found that capuchin monkeys preferred the company of researchers who imitated them to that of researchers who did not imitate them .
The monkeys not only spent more time with their imitators , but also preferred to engage in a simple task with them even when provided with the option of performing the same task with a non-imitator .
" Researchers have known that human beings prefer the behavior of other people who subtly imitate their gestures and other affects , " said Duane Alexander , M.D. , Director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development , where the NIH portion of the study was conducted .
" Observing how imitation promotes bonding in primates may lead to insights in disorders in which imitation and bonding is impaired , such as certain forms of autism . "
The study appears in the Aug.14 issue of Science .
The study was conducted by Annika Paukner and Stephen J. Suomi of the NICHD , Elisabetta Visalberghi of the Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies of the National Research Council in Rome , and Pier F. Ferrari of the University of Parma .
Human beings often will take on body postures , make gestures , and display the mannerisms of people they encounter , the study authors wrote .
For the most part , this behavior is unconscious , with both the imitator and the person being imitated unaware that the behavior is taking place .
The authors added that people who are not aware they are being imitated often feel affection and empathy for their imitators .
In fact , studies have shown that people are more likely to help their imitators , and under appropriate circumstances , even leave them more generous tips .
Such imitation is thought to provide the basis by which human beings ultimately form lasting social groups .
Before the current study , however , no one had ever determined if nonhuman primates were also predisposed to bond with individuals who imitated them .
The researchers chose capuchins because they are a highly social species that forms strong social groups .
For the study , each monkey was given a wiffle ball .
Dr. Paukner explained that the monkeys commonly displayed three behaviors : poking the ball with their fingers , putting it in their mouths , or pounding it on a surface .
In sequence , each monkey was paired with two human investigators , each of which also had a wiffle ball .
One investigator would mimic the monkey 's behavior , poking , mouthing , or pounding the ball , as appropriate .
The other investigator would adopt a different behavior , for example , pounding the ball when the monkey poked it .
After the imitation sequence , the monkeys consistently spent more time near the investigator who imitated them than with the investigator who did not — which the researchers interpreted as a sign that the monkeys felt a sense of affiliation toward their imitator .
In addition , the monkeys were given a simple task : taking a small trinket from the investigator 's hand , and then returning it to the investigator , in exchange for a small food reward .
Although the imitator and the non imitator each had identical rewards , the monkeys consistently chose the imitator to execute the task .
The study authors wrote that wild capuchin monkeys have been observed to match each other 's behaviors when feeding , traveling , or avoiding predators .
Such behavior matching , they theorized , may provide the basis for the formation of social groups .
Individuals who match each others ' behaviors feel a sense of affinity for each other , making conflicts less likely , and cooperation more likely .
Eventually , such connections extend throughout the group .
" It has been argued that the link between behavior matching and increases in affiliation might have played an important role in human evolution by helping to maintain harmonious relationships between individuals , " the study authors wrote .
" We propose that the same principle also holds for other group - living primates . "

St Bernards and puppies were among those found at the farm
Polish police are questioning a woman suspected of fattening up dogs and slaughtering them to sell the lard as a health supplement , reports say .
The police said 28 well - fed dogs , including St Bernards and puppies , were found in cages on a farm , along with bottles of lard , AFP news agency said .
An animal welfare group tipped off the police after buying some lard at the farm near Czestochowa , southern Poland .
It said some dogs " were overfed to the point of no longer being able to walk " .
New homes
The For Animals group 's undercover inspector , Renata Mizera , said the farmer had stressed the health benefits of the lard and told her that she herself added a spoonful to her daughter 's evening meal , Agence France - Presse reported .
" Half a litre of fat was being sold for 37 euros ( $ 53 , £ 31 ) , " said Ms Mizera .
The police are checking whether the lard - which was found in bottles in a refrigerator at the woman 's farm - comes from dogs .
The 37 - year - old farmer could face up to two years in jail for animal cruelty and distributing an unsafe substance , Poland 's TVN24 reported .
The dogs are being cared for by the For Animals group , which is looking for new homes for them .
What House and Senate leaders do n’t agree on , necessarily , is how to get the legislation done .
Waxman and Rangel are more than happy to shove a bill down the throats of their Republican colleagues , if need be .
That ’s why the House forced Senate leaders to accept a provision in the budget that allows health care to pass by “ reconciliation ” — an arcane budgeting maneuver that would enable Senate Democrats to force through a bill with a simple majority , rather than with the 60 votes needed to forestall a filibuster .
But in the Senate , Baucus remains determined to send to the floor a bill with bipartisan support ; passing health care reform by reconciliation , he says , would make the new law unsustainable in the long term .
This is why Baucus has n’t yet committed to the idea of a public plan to compete with private insurers .
It ’s not that he particularly dislikes the policy or that he can’t find enough centrist Democrats who might vote for it .
It ’s more that Baucus fears the provision will drive away Republicans , making it far less likely that Democrats can pass a bill without resorting to reconciliation .
During our conversation in his office , Baucus told me his main goal is to keep Senate Republicans at the negotiating table for as long as he can .
“ Everything is on the table , ” Baucus told me more than once , which is the same theme he ’s been hammering home to his Republican colleagues .
When I asked Baucus what he needed from the White House in order to help pass a viable health care plan , his answer , more or less , was nothing — as in , the most helpful thing they can do is butt out and let the Senate worry about the details .
No doubt this has something to do with the traditional turf battles among the branches ; Baucus has been a legislator now for 35 years , and he does n’t need another Democratic president telling him how to do his job .
But there is a more practical reason for his wariness , as well .
So far , he has managed to keep the parties talking largely because neither Democrats nor Republicans have any clear idea of which specific provisions Obama will accept — and that ’s exactly the way Baucus wants to keep it .
If the president were to shed his reticence and set out his terms for a bill , Republicans would focus on their differences with Obama and would most likely end up abandoning the process , either because they would n’t believe a compromise was possible or because they would want to seize on any excuse to derail his agenda .
“ Right now , the president sort of keeps them guessing as to what he might be supportive of , ” says John Breaux , the former Democratic senator who is now a corporate lobbyist .
“ I think that ’s why you still see Republicans actually trying to work on it . ”
As it happens , this arrangement — whereby Baucus negotiates the bill and Obama keeps his distance — is politically advantageous to the president too .
During his campaign last year , Obama took at least two positions on health care that he may soon find hard to maintain .
First , in the primaries , he differentiated his plan from Hillary Clinton ’s by refusing to back an “ individual mandate ” — that is , the provision that would require every American to obtain insurance .
Then , during the fall campaign , Obama criticized John McCain for proposing to tax employer - based health benefits .
If he were to offer a detailed proposal of his own right now , Obama might have to walk out into the Rose Garden and reverse himself on one or both positions .
But with Baucus urging him to leave the details to his committee , Obama can instead wait for a plan to emerge from the Senate and then , if need be , reluctantly change his mind in the interest of compromise .
Thus he preserves the option of backing away from his previous anti-big - government stances , and he gets to appear statesmanlike and pragmatic in the process .
THE NETTLESOME THING about leaving the details of the health care plan to Congress , though , is that this Congress , like most every other Congress , does n’t appear inclined to pay for much of anything .
And it is this part of the health care debate — where to find the money — that seems most likely to derail the process .
Most discussions of America ’s health care woes begin with talk of the uninsured — some 46 million of them at last count .
How much a new health care system will cost depends primarily on how close to universal coverage you really want to get .
On the high end of the scale , insuring every American might well cost as much as $ 1.5 trillion over the next decade at a time when deficits are gobbling up a greater share of the nation ’s income than at any time since World War II .
The White House has focused mostly on new efficiencies in health care , insisting that lowering the costs of medical care could easily save $ 2 trillion in public money over the next decade .
A coalition of providers , drug makers and insurance companies — no doubt looking for the best possible deal in health care legislation — helpfully vowed in a White House photo - op last month to institute changes that would lead to such savings , but their promise was maddeningly vague and utterly unenforceable ( and in any event , the industry groups almost immediately distanced themselves from it ) .
Short of realizing these projected savings , there are only so many ways to pay for health care — and , not surprisingly , congressmen and senators are n’t exactly lining up to embrace them .
One way , as McCain proposed , is to rescind the tax exemption for some workers who receive health care benefits from their employers ;
Baucus is open to at least capping the exemption , but labor unions are adamantly opposed , and Rangel has publicly renounced it ( though he and other House Democrats appear to be re-evaluating that stance ) .
Another way is to slap new taxes on some of the products that cause health problems in the first place , like soft drinks , but industry lobbyists are already spending satchels of cash to head that off .
Congress can always choose to slash Medicare benefits or the payments that doctors receive , but that idea generates about as much enthusiasm as you might find for putting George W. Bush ’s face on the $ 5 bill .
In a larger sense , this may be the nagging flaw in Obama ’s notion of the Congressional presidency , this strategy that leaves the lawmaking to Congress , even as it enables him to claim credit for one legislative success after another .
Professional legislators can be great at devising complex language and finding creative ways to get a deal .
What they are not especially good at — at least not in the current era — is making the difficult decisions that governing responsibly often requires .
Left to their own devices , legislators rarely seem to ask the voters to sacrifice anything by way of taxes or entitlements or services , if only because voters do n’t find the entreaties of legislators all that persuasive .
And so , absent his own engagement , Obama ’s vow to reverse our “ collective failure to make hard choices , ” as he put it in his inaugural address , may well be pushed aside for another day .
At critical times in his young political life , and several times already in his presidency , Obama has fallen back on his gift for explanation and oratory to try to change the dynamic of a national debate .
He did it on race relations , delivering a historic and bracingly candid speech in Philadelphia during the Democratic primaries .
On two consecutive days last month , he undertook to lay out his thinking on national security and civil liberties in twin speeches at the National Archives and the Naval Academy .
In a recent speech at Georgetown University , he tried to tell the larger story of the nation ’s economic crisis and his response to it , riffing on the Biblical image of a house built on shifting sand .
It seems likely that Obama , who has to this point focused on a sophisticated legislative strategy for achieving health care reform , will at some point soon have to take his case to the public instead — this time asking Americans not just to support an ambitious expansion of government but to accept the sacrifices necessary to do it .
Only a president will make that case , and only a president can .
Cuando lleguéis a viejos , respetaréis la piedra ,
si es que llegáis a viejos ,
si es que entonces quedó alguna piedra .
Vuestros hijos amarán al viejo cobre ,
al hierro fiel .
Recibiréis a los antiguos metales en el seno de vuestras familias ,
trataréis al noble plomo con la decencia que corresponde a su carácter dulce ;
os reconciliaréis con el zinc dándole un suave nombre ;
con el bronce considerándolo como hermano del oro ,
porque el oro no fue a la guerra por vosotros ,
el oro se quedó , por vosotros , haciendo el papel de niño mimado ,
vestido de terciopelo , arropado , protegido por el resentido acero …
Cuando lleguéis a viejos , respetaréis al oro ,
si es que llegáis a viejos ,
si es que entonces quedó algún oro .
El agua es la única eternidad de la sangre .
Su fuerza , hecha sangre .
Su inquietud , hecha sangre .
Su violento anhelo de viento y cielo ,
hecho sangre .
Mañana dirán que la sangre se hizo polvo ,
mañana estará seca la sangre .
Ni sudor , ni lágrimas , ni orina
podrán llenar el hueco del corazón vacío .
Mañana envidiarán la bomba hidráulica de un inodoro palpitante ,
la constancia viva de un grifo ,
el grueso líquido .
El río se encargará de los riñones destrozados
y en medio del desierto los huesos en cruz pedirán en vano que regrese el
agua a los cuerpos de los hombres .
Dadme un motor más fuerte que un corazón de hombre .
Dadme un cerebro de máquina que pueda ser agujereado sin dolor .
Dadme por fuera un cuerpo de metal y por dentro otro cuerpo de metal
igual al del soldado de plomo que no muere ,
que no te pide , Señor , la gracia de no ser humillado por tus obras ,
como el soldado de carne blanducha , nuestro débil orgullo ,
que por tu día ofrecerá la luz de sus ojos ,
que por tu metal admitirá una bala en su pecho ,
que por tu agua devolverá su sangre .
Y que quiere ser como un cuchillo , al que no puede herir otro cuchillo .
Esta cal de mi sangre incorporada a mi vida
será la cal de mi tumba incorporada a mi muerte ,
porque aquí está el futuro envuelto en papel de estaño ,
aquí está la ración humana en forma de pequeños ataúdes ,
y la ametralladora sigue ardiendo de deseos
y a través de los siglos sigue fiel el amor del cuchillo a la carne .
Y luego , decid si no ha sido abundante la cosecha de balas ,
si los campos no están sembrados de bayonetas ,
si no han reventado a su tiempo las granadas … dado el pecho de los vivos ,
somos la selva que avanza .
Somos la tierra presente .
Vegetal y podrida .
Pantano corrompido que burbujea mariposas y arco-iris .
Donde tu cáscara se levanta están nuestros huesos llorosos ,
nuestro dolor brillante en carne viva ,
oh santa y hedionda tierra nuestra ,
humus humanos .
Desde mi gris sube mi ávida mirada ,
mi ojo viejo y tardo , ya encanecido ,
desde el fondo de un vértigo lamoso
sin negro y sin color completamente ciego .
Asciendo como topo hacia el aire
que huele mi vista ,
el ojo de mi olfato , y el murciélago
todo hecho de sonido .
Aqui la piedra es piedra , pero ni el tacto sordo
puede imaginar si vamos o venimos ,
pero venimos , sí , desde mi fondo espeso ,
pero vamos , ya lo sentimos , en los dedos podridos
y en esta cruel mudez que quiere cantar .
Como un súbito amanecer que la sangre dibuja
irrumpe el violento deseo de sufrir ,
y luego el llanto fluyendo como la uña de la carne
y el rabioso corazón ladrando en la puerta .
Y en la puerta un cubo que se palpa
y un camino verde bajo los pies hasta el pozo ,
hasta más hondo aún , hasta el agua ,
y en el agua una palabra samaritana
hasta más hondo aún , hasta el beso ,
Del mar opaco que me empuja
llevo en mi sangre el hueco de su ola ,
el hueco de su huida ,
un precipicio de sal aposentada .
Si algo traigo para decir , dispensadme ,
en el bello camino lo he olvidado .
Por un descuido me comí la espuma ,
perdonadme , que vengo enamorado .
Detrás de ti quedan ahora cosas despreocupadas , dulces .
Pájaros muertos , árboles sin riego .
Una hiedra marchita .
Un olor de recuerdo .
No hay nada exacto , no hay nada malo ni bueno ,
y parece que la vida se ha marchado hacia el país del trueno .
Tú , que vista en un jarrón de flores el golpe de esta fuerza ,
tú , la invitada al viento en fiesta .
tu , la due ña de una cotorra y un coche de ágiles ruedas , sobre la verja
tú que miraste a un caballo del tiovivo
y quedar sobre la grama como esperando que lo montasen los niños de la escuela ,
asiste ahora , con ojos pálidos , a esta naturaleza muerta .
Los frutos no maduran en este aire dormido
sino lentamente , de tal suerte que parecen marchitos ,
y hasta los insectos se equivocan en esta primavera sonámbula , sin sentido .
La naturaleza tiene ausente a su marido .
No tienen ni fuerzas suficientes para morir las semillas del cultivo
y su muerte se oye como el hilito de sangre que sale de la boca del hombre herido .
Rosas solteronas , flores que parecen usadas en la fiesta del olvido ,
débil olor de tumbas , de hierbas que mueren sobre mármoles inscritos .
Ni un solo grito .
Ni siquiera la voz de un pájaro o de un niño
o el ruido de un bravo asesino con su cuchillo .
¡ Qué dieras hoy por tener manchado de sangre el vestido !
¡ Qué dieras por encontrar habitado algún nido !
¡ Qué dieras porque sembraran en tu carne un hijo !
Por fin , Señor de los Ejércitos , he aquí el dolor supremo .
He aquí , sin lástimas , sin subterfugios , sin versos ,
el dolor verdadero .
Por fin , Señor , he aquí frente a nosotros el dolor parado en seco .
No es un dolor por los heridos ni por los muertos ,
ni por la sangre derramada ni por la tierra llena de lamentos
ni por las ciudades vacías de casas ni por los campos llenos de huérfanos .
Es el dolor entero .
No puede haber lágrimas ni duelo
ni palabras ni recuerdos ,
pues nada cabe ya dentro del pecho .
Todos los ruidos del mundo forman un gran silencio .
Todos los hombres del mundo forman un solo espectro .
En medio de este dolor , ¡ soldado ! , queda tu puesto
vacío o lleno .
Las vidas de los que quedan están con huecos ,
tienen vacíos completos ,
como si se hubieran sacado bocados de carne de sus cuerpos .
Asómate a este boquete , a éste que tengo en el pecho ,
para ver cielos e infiernos .
Mira mi cabeza hendida por millares de agujeros :
a través brilla un sol blanco , a través un astro negro .
Toca mi mano , esta mano que ayer sostuvo un acero :
¡puedes pasar en el aire , a través de ella , tus dedos !
He aquí la ausencia del hombre , fuga de carne , de miedo ,
días , cosas , almas , fuego .
Todo se quedó en el tiempo .
Todo se quemó allá lejos .
It is no wonder that the BART Board of Directors would rush to finalize their police oversight draft and vote unanimously to approve it in the same week that this report hit their desks .
[ Actually , it appears that they officially approved the plan before the draft was actually finalized .
]
Likewise , the sudden announcement of the resignation of BART Police Chief Gary Gee this past weekend is hardly surprising , even after he had resisted months of community demands that he step down for his incompetent and corrupt response to the murder of Oscar Grant .
For Chief Gee , it was finally the weight of the Meyers Nave criticism and the unanimous Board vote for a new level of police oversight , both coming last week -- and perhaps a cordial ( or stern ) push from the BART Board -- that proved too much to bare .
Rather than being fired as he should have been , BART is allowing Gary Gee to " retire " and just walk away before the end of this year .
The public version of the Meyers Nave report clearly refutes statements made by Gary Gee in a January 12th press conference at the conclusion of his whitewash internal affairs investigation .
With General Manager Dorothy Dugger and BART spokesperson Linton Johnson at his side , Chief Gee unequivocally declared at the time that his officers had followed BART police protocol and acted professionally , yet Meyers Nave now completely contradicts Gee and starkly states that " officers did not follow recommended procedures " on the Fruitvale platform , as anyone who has been following the case closely already knew .
The summary of the report describes the tactics of officers on the scene as " seriously deficient .
"
In a testiment to Gee 's laziness , or laisse - faire attitude toward improving his police force , Meyers Nave points out that the " BART Policy manual [ has ] not been updated in some areas since the 1970s , 1980s or 1990s . "
Remember that BART police murdered another unarmed African American man since Gee has been Chief , Bruce Edward Seward in 2001 . " [ L]apses in tactical communication and leadership " are cited as a critical misstep on the morning of the murder of Oscar Grant .
Why supervisors were unavailable on a such a big night for BART as New Year 's Eve is not addressed in the report , only that their lack of supervision was a contributing factor to the escalation of events that led to the murder of Oscar Grant .
Meyers
Nave writes : " In this case , an experienced supervisor would have proven invaluable in controlling the scene , managing resources , directing use of force actions by officers , etc .
" Another slap at Gary Gee , and his BART police internal affairs unit , is when the report declares that BART needs a " more thorough investigation of any incident in which force is used . "
Calling out the unacceptable behavior of officers on the platform , who apparently felt they could be as racist and violent as they pleased without accountability , Meyers Nave writes : " If all BART PD officers knew that BART PD would relentlessly investigate use of force incidents , including pulling of video and canvassing the scene , it is doubtful that BART PD officers would use force when it was not reasonable to so do . "
It almost reads as facetious snark when Meyers Nave , discussing internal investigations , dryly reports that " it is unknown when the last UNjustifiable use of force occurred within BART PD . "
[ Emphasis added . ]
Meyers
Nave cites inadequate reporting from BART police on use of force incidents , hinting that there are major issues with the reports BART officers filed after Oscar Grant was shot .
Judging by their dishonest testimony during Johanne 's Mehserle 's preliminary hearing , and the general history of police in America lying after shooting unarmed people of color , it is not hard to imagine what some of the problems are in the incident reports .
Meyers
Nave frankly declares that " in the future , arrest reports should be more closely scrutinized . "
In case anyone reading the report still does n't get it , the report adds that " Use of force must be investigated more thoroughly " by supervisors .
As for the detainment of Oscar Grant 's friends after he was murdered , the report cites numerous problems there as well .
His friends were all inappropriately handcuffed for up to six hours while they were being detained by BART police , even though none of them were actually under arrest .
Meyers
Nave points out that it remains " unclear if the right persons were detained " that night in the first place .
The report echoes what community activists have been demanding since day one : " Enhance [d ] transparency and accountability " are sorely needed in the BART Police Department .
Perhaps the new police oversight proposal the Board has approved will help in this area , if the state legislature can overcome statewide police resistance and pass a strong oversight model for BART .
Meyers
Nave notes that " the public will have a greater sense of comfort in the BART PD " should the agency become subject to regular audits of its police force .
The public report , not surprisingly , makes no mention of inaccurate or offensive statements made by BART itself since the murder .
BART , as a public agency , has yet to make amends for statements it has made that have distressed Oscar Grant 's family and the community , such as in April when they virtually claimed it was Oscar Grant 's fault that he was shot in the back .
In a response to a civil suit brought against the public agency by the family of Oscar Grant , BART claimed that the use of force by BART police on the Fruitvale platform was appropriate and that it prevented Oscar Grant from physically beating the well - armed police officers .
Now that Meyers Nave has released their report , it remains to be seen what disciplinary actions will be taken by BART against the officers involved on January 1st , all of whom have been on paid vacation ( i.e. paid leave ) for the last seven months .
Until the new police oversight proposal is possibly approved by the state legislature , against the will of cops statewide , then disciplinary authority for police officers continues to remain in the hands of Chief Gee , whose incompetent and non-credible internal affairs investigation of the matter motivated BART to approve hiring Meyers Nave in the first place .
General Manager Dorothy Dugger , who herself has not seen fit to demand accountability for the outrageous behavior of BART police on New Year 's Day , is not likely to fire Gee for inaction since he has already been given the easy out of retirement .
Will the overdue firing or disciplining of corrupt police officers be one of Gary Gee 's last acts as Chief ?
At this point , that remains unknown to the public .
Public pressure likely will continue to be required to push the BART Board to hold Dorothy Dugger and the BART police accountable for their actions related to the murder of Oscar Grant , including officers on the platform and their supervisors .
Meyers
Nave clearly noted that BART should require " more thorough investigation of any incident in which force is used " which would imply honestly calling out police misconduct where it it is found and firmly holding those responsible accountable .
To date , not a single officer has been held to account by BART .
Now that BART has been relieved of conducting a thorough investigation itself , having left it to Meyers Nave to do for them for $ 250,000 , it is high time that BART begin to rid itself of the most obvious bad actors in its midst and recommend criminal charges where warranted for those who assaulted Oscar Grant and his friends on January 1st such as BART police officer Tony Pirone and Marysol Domenici .
Bad actors at BART include not just the officers on the Fruitvale platform but General Manager Dorothy Dugger who , just like Gary Gee , chose to be an apologist for the disturbing actions of officers ultimately under her supervision .
Finally , a full accounting of the actual events of January 1st must be made public .
Such an account should include events on the platform as well as communications between officers and supervisors that night , and communications in the aftermath between supervisors and Chief Gee and those between Gee and Dugger .
The Meyers Nave report appears to be a step in the right direction , but it does not yet represent having reached the ultimate goals of full transparency and accountability .
Ron Paul ’s Army Complicates GOP 2010 Hopes
Created : August 13 , 2009 06:07 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Rand Paul and Peter Schiff ( YouTube )
He ’s had a sympathetic CNN interview , a Fox News radio hit , a write - up in U.S. News & World Report , stories from The Associated Press and stories in all the local papers .
The first week of Rand Paul ’s campaign for a U.S. Senate seat from Kentucky — he announced his bid Aug. 5 — has drawn the sort of coverage most first - time candidates would n’t dream of .
“ I do n’t think I could have scripted it better than it ’s gone so far , ” said Paul , speaking to TWI from his home in Bowling Green .
“ It helps being related to somebody famous .
I do n’t hide that fact .
I also think that this will be one of the top two or three Senate races in the country , and people are going to keep on paying attention . ”
Image by : Matt Mahurin
The “ famous person ” who ’s gotten the press interested in Paul ’s campaign is his father , Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) , whose gadfly libertarian - themed campaign for the 2008 Republican nomination garnered $ 35 million in campaign contributions won him more than one million votes , and elevated his critiques of the welfare state and the post - Bretton Woods monetary system from late - night speeches on C - SPAN to regular appearances on cable news .
One year after Paul bowed out of the 2008 presidential race , his network of supporters , without having to waste their time on the impossible goal of winning a presidential nomination , are picking smaller targets .
By showing up at town halls , they ’re getting more attention as health care critics than they did as supporters of a quixotic White House candidate .
And they ’re backing candidates like Rand Paul , whose quest for a Senate seat , in a conservative state , with a now - established political brand , is more plausible .
On Aug. 20 , thousands of people — 1,700 have already committed — are being encouraged to donate to the younger Paul ’s campaign in a “ moneybomb ” modeled after the single - day events that raised $ 5 million and $ 6 million for his father during the 2008 campaign .
On Aug. 7 , Connecticut investor Peter Schiff , a libertarian who manages Euro Pacific Capital , who advised Paul in his presidential bid , and has never run for office , raised $ 350,000 with a similar , web - driven campaign , pushing his total since launching an exploratory committee to $ 800,000 .
The effort got a boost from the Texas congressman himself , who told the members of his massive e-mail list that “ our country needs Peter Schiff in Washington , ” and that they could “ go to www.Schiffathon.com right now and make a contribution . ”
The day that Rand Paul launched his campaign with a New York fundraiser , both candidates appeared on the Fox Business Channel ; hours later , Schiff stopped by the fundraiser to make a donation .
“ People got to know Rand during his father ’s campaign , ” explained Trevor Lyman , a web programmer who helped launch the Ron Paul campaign moneybombs and is working on the August 20 effort .
“ Peter Schiff and Rand Paul are both capable of attracting national media attention , and people think we have a chance to win in both races . ”
The support of Ron Paul ’s army for these two candidates puts Republicans in a potentially difficult spot .
Kentucky , where Sen. Jim Bunning ( R - Ky. ) is retiring , and Connecticut , where Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) is dogged by ethics scandals , are seen as must - hold and must - win seats for the GOP , respectively .
The party has favored candidates in both races , both of whom have held elective office — Secretary of State Trey Grayson in Kentucky , and former congressman Rob Simmons in Connecticut .
So far , Grayson has raised more than $ 600,000 for his campaign , and Simmons has raised $ 754,000 .
Both candidates face the likely possibility of spending heavily to defeat libertarian - leaning candidates before they can go on to their general elections .
Some Republicans are dismissive of the Paul - backed Senate candidates .
“ Yes , Schiff is going to raise a ton of money , just like Ron Paul , ” said one Connecticut Republican strategist .
“ He has a cultish following based on one video of him , like a broken clock , saying something gloomy about the economy that was later proven right .
But how many of the people who ’ll give him money live in Connecticut ? ”
The same criticism came from Roy Occhiogrosso , a Democratic consultant .
“ He has one claim to fame , that he said some things that happened to come true , ” said Occhiogrosso .
“ That does n’t make a U.S. senator . ”
The video in question is a YouTube clip titled “ Peter Schiff was right ! ” which went online days before the 2008 election and has clocked nearly 1.5 million views .
The video spliced together clips of Schiff pessimistically talking about “ sky - high real estate prices coming back to earth , ” and predicting that “ most of the profits people have in real estate are going to vanish , ” recorded during the height of the housing boom .
Andrew Schiff , the candidate ’s brother and his media manager until an official campaign decision comes “ in about two weeks , ” argued that the video , and all of his brother ’s economic commentary , is just proof that he ’s closer to the Republican base than the party ’s leadership .
“ Peter wants to make the race about economics , ” said Schiff .
“ The issues that he talked about then are going get a lot of lip service from the other Republicans in the race .
They ’ll say they agree with him , but they ’re not as ‘ extreme . ’
Most Republicans talk a good game , and then they get into office and spend like Democrats . ”
Early polling has not shown any support for Schiff , who would have to get through a state party convention and a primary open to independent voters to claim the Republican nomination .
Rand Paul , who has closer political ties to Kentucky that Schiff does in Connecticut — Paul founded an anti-tax group , Kentucky Taxpayers United , in 1994 — is seen as more likely to drive the debate in his state ’s primary , and more likely to upset the party ’s preferred candidate .
Jesse Benton , who is doubling as a spokesman for Ron and Rand Paul , suggested that Grayson had the weaker Republican credentials in the race , because as a college student in 1996 he ’d been a delegate for President Bill Clinton .
“ There are a lot of Kentuckyans who voted for Bill Clinton twice and then turned around and voted for George W. Bush and John McCain , ” said Scott Jennings , a Kentucky Republican strategist .
“ As long as Grayson ’s core message is lower taxes , limited government , opposition to cap and trade , opposition to the Democrats ’ health care reform ; as long as he jibes with the GOP primary voting bloc he ’ll be fine . ”
Democrats are n’t so sure that a more ideologically conservative campaign would help Grayson in the long run .
Some hope that a well - funded Paul campaign , even if it did n’t upset Grayson , would weaken the nominee in the general election .
“ You ’re going to see Grayson trying to get to the right of Rand Paul , and I do n’t think he can do that , ” said Mark Guilfoyle , a Kentucky Democratic strategist .
“ That ’s a nightmare scenario for them .
Whoever comes out of the primary is going to be very , very far to the right .
I would n’t say Rand Paul would be easier to beat — either situation is going to be good for us . ”
Back at home , making the first real hiring decisions of the campaign , Rand Paul dismissed all of that , and dismissed the idea that support from out - of - state members of Ron Paul ’s army will hurt him as “ jealousy ” from the party elite .
“ There ’s a disconnect between primary voters and the party ’s leadership , ” said the younger Paul .
“ I do n’t think Trey Grayson has a clue as to what that disconnect is .
We hear that there are people who control the reins of power , and that they ’ve got the party workers locked up , but I see so many new friends and faces wherever we go .
We ’re peeling them off in droves . ”
If you 're gonna hang out on the beaches of Rio , you wanna look your best , because everyone there is basically a model .
The Museum of Image and Sound , designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro looks like it just rolled out of bed .

Luckily , this is a building and not a person ( in case you did n't notice ) .
As such , the frumpy , wrinkled , bed - headed look is pretty awesome , even if it seems a bit out of place next to slightly less modern apartment buildings .
Dezeen says the Museum of Image and Sound is expected to have seven levels more or less , with space for galleries , conference rooms , auditorium and food + drink .
Oh yeah , there will also be an outdoor movie theater on the ROOF .
Yes .
Construction will be finished sometime in 2011 — at which time I will be purchasing a flight direct to Rio .

I do n’t usually express my personal viewpoint of political debates on this blog , but there is one subject I would like to chime in on : national health care .
Employer - provided health insurance is one of the main reasons that having a standard , full - time job is still viewed as “ safe . ”
Watching how companies responded to the economic meltdown by conducting layoffs and requiring furloughs has shown there is no such thing as a steady paycheck .
When you work for someone else , you have placed the financial security of your family and yourself in the hands of that company .
But primarily because of health benefits , we still view working for someone else as a conservative decision .
Walking Away From “ Safe ”
Taking the leap into self - employment and launching a small business can be scary .
For many people , walking away from employer - provided health insurance is the hardest thing to do .
Even young people just starting out fall into this trap .
When you are graduating college and will no longer be covered under your parents ’ insurance , you feel the need to go and find a job right away to get your own insurance .
A study done by Harvard University a few years back showed that almost 50 % of all personal bankruptcy filings were partly the result of medical expenses .
So it ’s not an unfounded fear .
One major health incident while uninsured can quickly lead to financial ruin .
But what if we had national health care ?
What if the fear of not having health insurance were removed from the equation ?
Dan Gillmor posted his thoughts on the debate on BoingBoing and sums it up with this quote :
The day we have national health care is the day that we unleash a wave of entrepreneurship the likes of which we ’ve never seen before .
That ’s one of the best reasons for moving toward such a system .
Providing national health care would allow this nation ’s best and brightest citizens to pursue their ideas without the fear of getting sick and ruining their lives .
It would spark a new revolution of entrepreneurship that would help this country remain a global leader of innovation .
Ideas Don’t Require Money , They Require Time
While the Industrial Revolution required capital to buy land , build factories and hire large amounts of workers , the current situation is much different .
In our world today , such capital is n’t required to launch an idea .
Anyone can start a business at a much lower cost , taking advantage of our flat , connected globe .
What we do n’t have is the freedom to spark this new wave of small businesses because everyone is spending their time working for someone else .
National health care would be an incredible leap towards providing that freedom .
It is unfortunate that this issue has become , like everything else , so politicized .
I do n’t view this as a Red vs. Blue , Liberal vs. Conservative issue .
Politicians on both sides of the aisle say they are concerned with supporting small businesses .
Establishing a national health care system would be one of the greatest benefits you could provide to entrepreneurs and small businesses across the country .
As the debate rages on , people remain behind a desk , working for someone else , dreaming of some game - changing idea .
Let ’s hope Washington is ready to help these people bring those ideas to life .
Who is this man we elected to the highest office in the land ?
Is he a change - bringer , or just more of the same ?
We ’re about to find out .
The New York Times informs us that there is a battle shaping up for hearts and minds – not in the wilds of Afghanistan , but in the White House .
And the one heart and mind that matters the most is , of course , the President ’s .
On one side of the barricades stand Hillary Clinton and her ally Richard Holbrooke , the butcher of the Balkans .
It was Hillary , you ’ll recall , who demanded of her husband , then - President Bill Clinton , to stop shilly - shallying and begin the bombing of Belgrade .
That she ’s living up to her reputation as the Democratic Valkyrie of the War Party when it comes to Afghanistan was all too predictable .
On the other side – Vice President Joe Biden , who wants to implement what is essentially the George Will plan for the Afghan front : position our troops somewhere else in the region and send the special forces in as necessary to take out al - Qaeda .
But where does Barack Obama stand ?
During the election , he took the Clinton - Holbrooke " nation - building " position , attacking the Bush administration for " neglecting " the " real " war on the Afghan front and framing his opposition to the Iraq invasion in hawkish terms .
That was then , however , when politics was in command : now that he ’s President , he ’s having second thoughts , according to press reports .
The Times avers that many in the Pentagon are worried their commander - in - chief has " buyer ’s remorse " over sending those 20,000 reinforcements to Afghanistan – like those home - buyers who got in at the top of the market , and are now several feet underwater , which is where he ’s heading in the polls .
Obama ’s top general on the Afghan front , Stanley McChrystal , is asking for some 40,000 more troops , but that has been put on hold pending the outcome of the internal battle over policy – a battle that will be won or lost in the arena of public opinion .
This defining moment in Obama ’s presidency illustrates quite nicely my own thesis that all foreign policy decisions – especially the decision to go to war – are the result and outgrowth of domestic political considerations .
Since the primary – indeed , the sole – aim of those in power is to retain ( and if possible expand ) their hegemonic position – a principle , I might add , that applies to all societies , whether democracies or dictatorships – our rulers will invariably make decisions about US actions overseas in accordance with what effect it has on their standing at home .
President Obama is clearly balking due to the unpopularity of this war .
Can he afford to alienate the clear majority of Americans who now think the battle for Afghanistan is n’t worth the price – or will he listen to Hillary and her government - in - exile ?
Hillary is clearly the Dick Cheney of this administration in two senses : she ’s the chief hawk in the president ’s inner councils , and her State Department is taking on all the accouterments of War Party HQ , just as the Office of the Vice President did during the Bush era .
Her chief consigliere , AIG board member Holbrooke , would probably have been in Hillary ’s position if the Clintons had retained control of the Democratic party in 2008 .
He is an unmitigated interventionist , who supported the Iraq war and could fairly be described as the architect of the Clintons ’ war in the Balkans .
He ’s the " closest thing the party has to a Kissinger , " as Ari Berman , citing an anonymous foreign policy analyst , put it .
Holbrooke was gung - ho on the Iraq misadventure , averring , in 2003 , that failure to invade would amount to a violation of international law by the US !
Perhaps with an eye to the Democratic base , Holbrooke , as chief foreign policy advisor to presidential candidate John Kerry , tempered his views somewhat , urging the Democratic standard - bearer to keep his rhetoric " deliberately vague " on Iraq .
He is , in short , the examplar of what Berman calls the " strategic class " – the professional managers and guardians of America ’s overseas domain , our empire of bases , colonies , and protectorates that provides a good living for a growing class of Americans .
Since their incomes and social standing are enhanced by the empire ’s global scale , they are constantly seeking not only to defend it but also to expand it whenever possible .
All debates within this stratgegic class are over the practicality of whatever new war is on the agenda – never over the legitimacy of our role as global hegemon .
Holbrooke has been given a very broad mandate by the President as plenipotentiary in charge of the " Af - Pak " portfolio , and the role he ’s playing was made clear when , at a meeting with our European allies , he hailed the recent Afghan election , so brazenly stolen by " President " Hamid Karzai .
In pursuing his portfolio Holbrooke is very likely to reflect the views of his capo di tutti capi , who took the unusual step of going public with the internal debate over Afghanistan policy .
In a recent interview with PBS , Hillary came out against the Biden option guns blazing :
" Some people say , ‘ Well , Al Qaeda ’s no longer in Afghanistan .
If Afghanistan were taken over by the Taliban , I ca n’t tell you how fast Al Qaeda would be back in Afghanistan . "
To listen to this kind of talk , you ’d think there had n’t been a Democratic primary and a subsequent election .
Or maybe she thinks she won both .
So much for that " cabinet of equals " : what we have here is Hillary ’s shadow government , which is openly trying to run the foreign policy show .
And where is the President ?
This is the big question in the minds of " progressives , " and the left in general , these days .
The decision he makes about Afghanistan will give us an answer .
It will be the test of their Great Leader concept of the man they put in the White House , in whose success they ’ve invested so much .
Their reverence for Obama has an almost North Korean edge to it : his shining visage illuminates their vision of a " progressive " America at peace with the world .
They overlooked his promise during the campaign that he would escalate the war on the Afghan front : he has to do that , they thought , to prove he ’s not " soft " on national security issues and is tough enough to be commander - in - chief .
But we know what he really thinks and wants , the lefties averred : he ’s really one of us ( that ’s what the Rush Limbaugh types , say , too ) .
But is he ?
We ’ll soon see .
This plastic moment is the perfect time for the antiwar movement to gear up for a major campaign – so where are they ?
A series of disconnected local events are scheduled for October 7 : but no nationally - coordinated action is planned in Washington , DC .
Instead , various groups are independently putting on events , such as a " Peace for Afghanistan House party " suggested by Peace Action , which clearly ought to change its name to Peace Inaction .
Yes , you can " protest " the war holding a glass of white wine in one hand and that wonderful sushi your friend Tiffany whipped up in the other .
Forget those tired protest signs !
What ’s wrong with these wimps ?
I ’ve seen this kind of thing happen time and again on the left .
As a disinterested and somewhat bemused observer on the sidelines , I ’ve been continually astonished at the almost masochistic willingness of the so - called progressives to be pushed around by the " centrist , " " moderate " wing .
On every issue , from healthcare to gay rights , they have conceded in the name of " unity " : just give in this one time , the Mod Squad argues , and you ’ll get what you want in the end .
Just not now .
I wonder if the left will ever run out of patience .
For the moment , at least , they ’ve put their complete trust in the Dear Leader .
Which raises the question : will they follow him wherever he wants to go – even if it ’s into the wilds of Waziristan ?
Some will , some wo n’t , with the former , I fear , outnumbering the latter .
What ’s especially troubling , however , is that at the very moment when maximum pressure on the President to get out of Afghanistan would do the most good , the antiwar movement has gone A.W.O.L .
When the shameful history of this rotten war is written , their craven passivity will make for an especially shameful little footnote .

It ’s the weekend – which means it ’s time to go shopping , right ?
Well , maybe not , given the bad economic times we ’re living through .
Which means lots of people are taking advantage of the savings made possible by shopping online .

Both right - libertarians ( anarcho - capitalists , minarchists , ‘ The Libertarian Party ’ in various countries ) and left - libertarians ( anarchists of every other variety , libertarian socialists / communists , etc. ) are ‘ anti- state ’ .
But notice :
Right - libertarians are generally least hostile to the state when it ’s performing its ‘ core functions ’ ( defending property rights , upholding the law , etc ) , and most hostile to it when it extends its activities to include providing public goods ( like social security , safety regulations , healthcare , etc. )
Left - libertarians are generally least hostile to the state when it ’s providing such public goods , and most hostile to it when it ’s performing its ‘ core functions ’ .
You 're playing Ragdoll Zombie Slayer
Description
This games a bit different .
You get to shoot flying zombies with a shotgun to metal .
The only problem is its really easy m and your finger may get tired of clicking before you actually die .
From the Author ,
This game was originally developed for a Danish rapper - but in this version skinned with a more zombie slaying stereotype .
Waimea , Hawaii , resident Kimberly Reyes died July 27 at Hilo Medical Center , 10 days after her insurance provider denied the liver transplant she needed because she had tested positive for marijuana in a series of toxicology tests .
Reyes was not a registered medical marijuana user , but her family told the Honolulu Advertiser she had used it to deal with nausea , pain , and disorientation caused by the hepatitis that killed her .
Reyes ' attorney , Ted Herhold of San Francisco , told the Observer that the diagnostic test results were the sole basis for Hawaii Medical Service Association 's ( HMSA ) denial of transplant coverage .
Reyes ' husband Robin , and her mother , Noni Kuhns , said the decision was based on failure to comply with HMSA 's policy forbidding drug use , but that neither HMSA nor her doctors had told her just what that policy was .
" Just because someone takes a hit off of a joint does n't mean that it should be the end of their life -- this is not a reason to deny life , " said Kuhns .
HMSA has refused to comment or provide its policies on drug use and transplant approval .
Denial of transplants to marijuana users has happened before .
Last year , Seattle - area musician Timothy Garon died after being refused a transplant because of doctor - recommended medical marijuana use .
In 2003 , Oregon resident Dave Myers was removed from a transplant list merely for Marinol , a prescription medicine related to marijuana .

Yesterday at AltNetUK Openspace Coding Days we repeated the TDD as if you meant it exercise , originally organised by Keith Braithwaite at the Software Craftsmanship 2009 conference .
This gave me a chance to once again go back to the problem , but from a completely different perspective .
The exercise involves developing a very simple piece of code strictly adhering to the TDD rules , so much so that participants are n’t allowed to create domain methods or classes other than extracting them from test code .
The goal of the exercise is to demonstrate factoring out just what you really need from the test code into domain design rather than starting with a pre-set design structure .
Although this is in general taken as a goal of TDD , many programmers ( me included ) do n’t realise how much their assumptions make them jump ahead too quickly .
By making it very painful to add new domain code , this exercise slows participants down to a point where people have to spend a considerable amount of time actually focusing code on exactly what is required and no more .
Even on a very simple problem such as tic - tac - toe , differences from a pre-conceived design and the one that emerges from code are considerable , the latter being a lot more elegant and better suited to describe a problem .
The exercise
The original exercise involved stones and the Go game .
As I ’ve never played that before and we had a lot less time than in the original one , I suggested tic - tac - toe .
This turned out to be a very good idea as we spent less time explaining what the domain but it still proved the point of the exercise .
The requirements on the flip - chart were the following :
a game is over when all fields are taken
a game is over when all fields in a column are taken by a player
a game is over when all fields in a row are taken by a player
a game is over when all fields in a diagonal are taken by a player
a player can take a field if not already taken
players take turns taking fields until the game is over
The dynamics
All the participants worked in pairs .
Most of the teams started by building a 3x3 board and describing requirements that were not given at all ( eg first player won , tics or noughts being placed ) and took three or four attempts at describing the problem to really go down to basics .
As predicted , people were annoyed by this but I did make an effort to explain that the start of the exercise feels silly and annoying so this went much better than I expected .
After the first requirement was done correctly , the next three followed easily as they are fairly related .
The fifth one though posed a problem again and this is where things got really interesting , some teams falling back on the grid idea ( and getting their code deleted ) and some teams starting to flesh out the concepts of players and the actual dynamics of fields being taken .
By the end of the exercise , almost half the teams were coding towards something that was not a 3x3 char / int grid .
We did not have the time to finish the whole thing , but some interesting solutions in making were :
a bag of fields that are literally taken by players - field objects start in the collection belonging to the game and move to collections belonging to players , which simply avoids edge cases such as taking an already taken field and makes checking for game end criteria very easy .
fields that have logic whether they are taken or not and by whom
game with a current state field that was recalculated as the actions were performed on it and methods that could set this externally to make it easy to test
Most of the game classes had very nice explicit methods for checking different game end criteria .
During a short retrospective at the end , some participants said that their code was very nicely isolated and encapsulated , with “ less leakage than normal ” , and that very explicit specifications ended up in the code making it easy to understand .
Multiple models
This exercise reminded me again about Eric Evans ’ introductory presentation to domain modeling .
One of the basic ideas there is that the best models are not the most realistic ones but the ones that allow us to describe a particular problem efficiently .
The best models are good because they serve a particular purpose in a particular context , so a bag of fields might be a better model of the tic - tac - toe game than a 3x3 board even if the latter feels much more realistic and natural .
Conclusions
In my view , this exercise worked really well .
It was interesting to observe it from a different perspective ( this time I got the role of the annoying git who went around the room and deleted code that people wrote and did not need ) .
Tic - tac - toe was a good choice as it did not require spending time on explaining and comes with an almost guaranteed 3x3 pre-conceived model .
Some participants suggested that we should have done requirements 5 and 6 first and then moved to 1 - 4 .
Although this would take away the big refactoring moment , it might actually work better to allow people to factor out a very different model straight from the start .
Introducing that the exercise is a bit annoying at the start was also a good idea , as I think that it went smoother than the original one with less opposition to dropping unnecessary code .
You can see some of the code examples on the openspacecode repository .
For more information on the original exercise and the rules , see my earlier post about it .
Mark Needham repeated the exercise earlier as well , building a message interceptor - something much more technical and practical than a tic - tac - toe or Go game .

" We set a new record in 2008 .
We 're the party in Canada that 's got the largest number of votes without electing anyone , " Green Party leader Elizabeth May grumbled .
Saanich - Gulf Islands divide too strong for May : expert read more
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners Hurrah !
Tyee Reporter Katie Hyslop Celebrates 10 - Year Tyeeversary
She ’s covered education , youth and housing issues for a decade now , and we ’re lucky to have her .
" And we could do that again , " she added , " unless we do something differently . "
What the Green Party of Canada plans to differently , May told The Tyee , will be to focus a disproportionate share of its resources on her election as the next member of Parliament in the Saanich - Gulf Islands electoral district .
The Maritimer announced on Tuesday that she has moved to British Columbia , will challenge activist Stuart Hertzog for the Green Party nomination on Sept. 19 in Sidney , and expects to face off against incumbent MP Gary Lunn in the next federal election -- which Ottawa insiders anticipate could come as soon as Nov. 9 .
May explained her decision in an interview with The Tyee .
" We never identified it as a priority for the leader to win a seat .
That was n't even in the campaign plan as a goal in the last election , " May said .
" This year will be different . "
2008 strategy :
Throw spaghetti at the wall
" We got almost the same number of votes as the Bloc Quebecois in 2008 .
They got 49 seats and we have none , " May said .
She blamed her own party 's lack of strategy .
" We did n't have an election strategy .
Our strategy was like , ' Throw more spaghetti at the wall .
Something 's got to stick . ' "
Nothing stuck .
" We had a face - to - face meeting in Quebec City in early November .
We started discussing what we should do differently ...
We realized that even if we were to increase our vote base 50 per cent above 2008 , if it was evenly distributed we would still be denied seats -- thanks to the perversity of the first - past - the - post system . "
So the Greens decided that , whenever the next election was , they would focus more effort on winning a seat .
Surprisingly , she compared her party 's position to that of the Reform Party in 1989 .
" In fact , you could make the case that the current governing party was struggling to win its first seat when it was Reform , and got a seat when Deborah Grey won in a bye - election .
But they had the benefit , as a new party , of a strong regional base . "
The next question fell to May , who as recently as a year ago boasted that she would not relocate from her Nova Scotia home for the sake of political expediency .
" That process resulted in me coming to terms with the fact that as leader of the party I do have obligations beyond personal druthers , " she explained .
" Also , I have that old empty nest syndrome happening , " said May , whose daughter recently left home for university .
" Last year I would n't have been able to imagine doing this .
This year I 'm in a very different position . "
' Died and gone to heaven '
Once May decided she was willing to move , the Saanich - Gulf Islands riding quickly made its way to the top of her list .
" This is the riding where we hit our first 17 per cent result back in 2004 .
And this is the riding where both the Liberals and the NDP recruited Green Party people to be their candidates in 2008 , " May said .
" I did n't want to make a decision about my life based on polling results , though I do n't have to tell you that the polling results were very favorable to Saanich - Gulf Islands , " she added .
She spent much of last summer touring the region .
" I had this died - and - gone - to - heaven feeling at the Salt Spring Island Saturday farmers ' market , where there are , you know , three or four different local cheese makers , and a local winery and all this amazing organic local food .
It is quite extraordinary , as a place to live . "
She said that as a newcomer , she felt welcomed to the fast - growing coastal region that 's become home to a mix of affluent hippies and mainstream retirees .
" That 's one of the traits of the area that attracts me so much .
A lot of people have moved here from somewhere else , " May said .
" Coming from Nova Scotia , where the initials CFA are well known , and if you are a ' Come From Away ' it 's a big deal , I do n't think Saanich - Gulf Islands thinks it 's as big a deal . "
May would not say whether she will remain a British Columbian in the event she fails to win a seat in Parliament .
" I 'm quite confident that I can and will win . "
But her Green party opponent for the nomination told Tyee reporter Andrew MacLeod that it would take a miracle for May to win the seat after losing in her Nova Scotia hometown last year .
" If she lived here she 'd know she only has an outside chance of being elected here , " said Stuart Hertzog , who claims May 's move undermines the grassroots nature of the Green Party .
" She 's turned this into an Elizabeth May Party and not a Green Party , " Hertzog said in a Hook article written by MacLeod .
May to court crossover voters
In addition to her status as an outsider , May faces the same problem that has vexed every Liberal , NDP and Green candidate in the Saanich - Gulf Islands since 1993 : Like Groundhog Day , the riding repeatedly pits a field of center - left candidates against one right - wing candidate .
MP Gary Lunn was elected as a Reform Party candidate in 1997 , under the Canadian Alliance flag in 2000 , and as a Conservative in 2004 , 2006 and 2008 .
In three of his five victories , he won 43 per cent of the vote -- a sufficient margin to carry almost any riding .
Presented with these facts , May was undeterred .
" I think that analysis would be quire correct if I were running as a Green Party candidate , without also being leader , " she said .
" But the impact of my participation in the debates last year is just amazing .
There 's a sense that people would like to see me in the House of Commons .
This extends well beyond the Green vote . "
She sited a recent poll finding that 40 per cent of voters wanted a Green MP .
" Now you could say there 's an auxiliary thing that says that 40 per cent want me in the House of Commons -- just not in their riding , " she quipped .
" But I think Saanich - Gulf Islands is the place where people will say , yeah , we 're going to be the ones to make history . "
May said she would run a less partisan campaign , looking for crossover votes .
" I 'm not going to be asking voters to abandon their traditional political affiliations .
I 'm not going to ask anyone to burn their NDP membership card or to cut up their Liberal card , " May said .
" I 'll be asking progressive voters voter to think about doing something different -- not necessarily voting Green for the rest of their lives -- but giving me a chance as leader of the Greens to be their voice in the House of Commons .
I think on that basis we are very competitive and Mr. Lunn will lose . "
' A substantial operation '
May expects to win the Saanich - Gulf Islands nomination on Sept. 19 , and plans to begin pouring Green Party resources into the riding immediately .
" We 'll be building as quickly as we can as soon as the nomination caucus on the 19th is over , " she said .
" We expect to bring in a lot of volunteers ...
We 'll be looking at happening at least a couple hundred volunteers on the ground , many from here of course , from local universities . "
May said she employed " about six " staffers on her 2008 campaign , and expects " at least " than many this year .
She said she spent about $ 55,000 on her Central Nova contest , and expects to spend much more in Saanich - Gulf Islands .
" This is the first time the Greens decided it 's a priority that the leader be elected .
We ’ll have a fully funded campaign . "
In addition to the full $ 80,000 spending limit , she also anticipates some pre-writ spending , " to make sure we 're ready ...
We 'll have a substantial operation . "
Minority Leader holds up vote on key climate legislation
Invoking a custom of the House which allows party leaders as much time as they should need to discuss a bill or amendment , House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) wrapped - up the Republican Party ’s case in opposition to the Waxman - Markey climate bill by busting - out a filibuster , of sorts ; poring through an amendment to the bill that was delivered late the night before .
[ social_buttons ]
Repeatedly highlighting the fact that it was submitted at 3:09 A.M. , Boehner read aloud portions of what he called , “ Speaker Pelosi ’s National Energy Tax ” , often pulling bits and pieces completely out of context to launch into the Republican talking points about how the bill will kill the American economy .
When asked why he read portions of the cap - and - trade bill on the floor Friday night , Boehner told The Hill , “ Hey , people deserve to know what ’s in this pile of sh*t . ”
Boehner also busted - out a chart that looked something 100 - or so bad PowerPoint presentations all pasted onto a single poster .
Of course , that was all part of Boehner ’s strategy , to make the bill seem like some incomprehensible , behemoth piece of legislation that Americans could n’t possibly understand and that would undoubtedly bring the federal government and the U.S. economy to its knees .
“ I ’ve been here a while and I ’ve seen a lot of crazy things , but I ’ve never seen anything this ridiculous , ” said Boehner , pointing to the poster during his weekly on - camera press briefing .

And if Minority Leader Boehner did n’t get enough face - time on Friday night , he also gave the weekly Republican address , explaining his ( party ’s ) opposition to the climate and health care proposals put forth by the Democrats .
Watch it :

Demi Lovato Leaks Her Own Song About Split , Team Scrambles to Get it On Streaming
" All good things have endings , " sang The Get Up Kids , many moons ago .
And so it came to pass : in the midst of a tumultuous European tour four years into this millennia the band made the decision to call it a day , finally bowing out with a sold - out show in their hometown of Kansas City the following year .
Though a slew of other projects followed , hearts were broken across the land , and the group 's influence is widely acknowledged amongst the many acts who fall under the ' emo ' banner of today .
As you ’re no doubt well aware by this point however , their story is n’t quite finished yet .
Come September 7th , Something To Write Home About will be given the tenth anniversary reissue treatment courtesy of long - time label Vagrant , and in celebration of this milestone release the band are hitting the road for a series of dates in Europe and the US .
Excited ?
We most definitely , definitely are .
In this age of reunions big and small , The Get Up Kids ' decision to get back together is one that warms the cockles of this writer 's heart .
We caught up with founding member Jim Suptic for the lowdown …
These dates and the reissue of Something To Write Home About have been on the cards for a while now – since around a year ago , I think ?
So , the glaringly obvious first question is : why now ?
It all started with a few band meetings .
We really needed to get our band 's finances in order .
During these meetings everyone was getting along really well and the idea of a tour came up .
I think we all decided it would be fun .
So far so good …we feel like the reasons we broke up in the first place do n't matter anymore .
If we can tour , why should n't we ?
How do you feel about going back on the road proper – are you looking forward to it ?
From what I understand you guys were fairly burnt out when you made the decision to disband back in 2004 ...
Everyone is in a totally different place than we were five years ago .
Better places .
It 's more about having fun than running a business , which I think is what happened before .
And yes , I am very excited .
Every member of the band has remained active in some capacity since the split .
Have you been keeping up with each other 's projects and activities – and with each other , in general ?
It was hard when everyone lived all across America .
I also have a two - year - old daughter which takes up most of my time .
Since we have been practicing it's been great to hang out with everyone [ but ] when we split up we really needed a break from each other .
How do you feel about the ' emo ' tag that Something To Write Home About led to ?
And what about that word , ' emo ' – the connotations have certainly changed some over the years , pre and post - Get Up Kids .
Honestly , I do n't often think about the state of ' emo ' .
The punk scene we came out of and the punk scene now are completely different .
It 's like glam rock now .
We played the Bamboozle fests this year and we felt really out of place .
I could name maybe three bands we played with .
It was just a sea of neon shirts to us .
If this is the world we helped create , then I apologise .
And what do you think of the myriad bands who have sprung up in your wake , often to far greater commercial success ?
Certain acts have been particularly vocal in acknowledging the debt they owe you ...
I think I summed it up in the last question .
If a band gets huge and they say we inspired them , great .
The problem is most of them are n't very good .
What does that say about us ?
I do n't know .
Maybe we sucked .
We at least can play our instruments .
What music have you been listening to of late – has anything really jumped out at you ?
Pains of Being Pure at Heart , Phoenix , Grizzly Bear , the new Sonic Youth record .
And taking things back a step or two , who were the bands you consider pivotal in helping form The Get Up Kids ' sound ?
Fugazi is the reason I am in a band today .
When I was 14 I heard Fugazi and started a band the next day .
We grew up on indie rock .
Superchunk , Rocket from the Crypt , Sunny Day Real Estate , Cap'n Jazz .
That 's the kind of stuff we were listening to when we started .
In broad terms ( as it 's something of a huge question ) , what 's your feeling about the music industry in 2009 compared to how it was when you formed , in 1995 ?
As someone who started a new band after The Get Up Kids I can tell you it is a lot harder in some ways .
There are so many bands out there , how do you find what 's good ?
On the other hand there are so many outlets for you to be heard .
I also think digital recording is killing live music .
Bands that suck can make themselves sound decent with things like autotune .
Then they play live and it's a train wreck .
I 'm keen to get your seven years ' hence take on On A Wire .
( Much like The Promise Ring 's Wood / Water LP , it feels like that album never really got its dues . )
We have always been a band that is not afraid to change .
That 's one problem I have with the punk scene .
Punk is an attitude and an ethic , not a sound , yet some people in the scene want white bread all the time .
What 's wrong with trying a new flavour ?
I think the songs from On A Wire are strong .
I am proud of that album .
What sort of sets can we expect from the dates ?
Is ' Campfire Kansas ' likely to get an airing ?
We will play ' Campfire Kansas ' .
We are going to try to play a good mix of all the records , with an emphasis on STWHA .
And finally , I know a lot of people are wondering if plans extend any further than the reissue and tour ...?
I hope so .
Ask me again in about 50 shows …
---
We hope so too .
Something To Write Home About is reissued through Vagrant on September 7th with a bonus DVD featuring a live show recorded in the band 's hometown of Kansas City ( expect a review on DiS nearer the time ) .
Until then , feel free to scope the European tour dates below while coming over all dewy - eyed at ' Action And Action ' ( rest assured , that half - speed drop - in near the end sounds as sweet as ever ) .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - California “ IOU ” recipients can turn to credit unions and check - cashing storefronts if a state budget deal does not appear by Friday and if three major banks refuse to accepting the notes beyond Friday as planned , analysts said on Tuesday .
Registered warrants , or IOUs , are printed at the State Controller 's office in Sacramento , July 2 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Max Whittaker
The willingness of the smaller institutions to take IOUs from the cash - strapped state should also stop the development of a secondary market for trading them , although individuals could end up paying hefty fees to get their hands on cash .
The state government of California , the world ’s eighth largest economy , is experiencing a severe revenue slump brought on by recession , rising unemployment and the lengthy housing downturn , forcing it to issue IOUs in lieu of some payments .
The government of the most populous U.S. state began its fiscal year on July 1 with a $ 26.3 billion budget gap and risks burning through its cash unless Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and lawmakers quickly balance the state ’s books .
Most U.S. states are not permitted to run budget deficits .
Three major banks are currently accepting the IOUs , but only through Friday .
After that recipients may turn to credit unions to cash them or , perhaps , to check - cashing storefronts .
Their cashiers could see more than $ 3 billion of the IOUs at their windows this month should the state budget crisis persist and big banks hold to their Friday cut - off for processing them .
Check - cashing storefronts are especially well poised to score IOUs , said Daniel Penrod , a senior industry analyst at the California Credit Union League .
“ I could see a lot of bank customers turning to a third - party source and losing a lot of their paycheck , ” Penrod said .
BEYOND FRIDAY ’S DEADLINE
Friday ’s deadline at Bank of America Corp , Wells Fargo & Co and JPMorgan Chase &
Co has raised questions about what recipients , including taxpayers owed refunds and vendors to the state government , would do with IOUs received after the end of the week .
State Controller John Chiang began issuing the IOUs , technically registered warrants , last week to help the state government manage its dwindling cash to pay priority bills , including payments to investors holding the state ’s debt .
To help the state , the three banks said they would take the IOUs through July 10 .
The banks would pay the face value of the warrants and become their official holders .
The warrants carry a 3.75 percent interest rate and are payable October 2 .
A Bank of America spokeswoman said Friday ’s deadline allows the bank to help clients and customers and the state ’s short - term needs .
Friday is a “ firm ” deadline for Wells Fargo , a spokeswoman said , declining further comment .
A JPMorgan Chase spokesman said the company ’s banking operations , which include 712 Chase retail banking branches in California formerly operated by Washington Mutual , are reviewing Friday ’s deadline .
The three banks likely set a Friday deadline to press for a resolution to the state ’s budget crisis , said Beth Mills , a spokeswoman for the California Bankers Association .
“ Putting a deadline on there might encourage the legislature to act , ” Mills said , adding that the cut - off may also have been set because processing the IOUs imposes “ operations costs ” offsetting their hefty interest rate .
“ Banks even beyond July 10 are willing to step forward to help their customers .
They just may not be willing to accept IOUs .
They may extend them a line of credit or do bridge loans , ” Mills added .
By contrast , credit unions will accept the IOUs after Friday , which would require non-members to join local credit unions to cash the warrants , said Penrod ,
Addressing speculation of a secondary market emerging for the warrants , Penrod said that would be unlikely .
Even so , California Treasurer Bill Lockyer ’s office said on Monday it would redeem IOUs sold through eBay Inc , Craigslist or other means , if accompanied by a notarized bill of sale signed by their recipient .
Some have wondered how the IOUs will be regulated in the secondary market .
If they are deemed securities by the Securities and Exchange Commission , then those buying and selling them could be subject to federal law on broker - dealers .
Currently , SEC officials are analyzing the issues involved .
Penrod said the banking industry will more likely face competition for California ’s IOU business from storefronts that cash checks for a fee .
“ You ’d add the fee into the 3.75 percent for a less - than - one - year note , which is essentially what it is , and that ’s a great rate , ” Penrod said .

In mid-September , a visiting Palestinian - American academic told a Melbourne lecture that Israel is an apartheid state , more extreme in its policy against Palestinians than South Africa had been against its Black population .
Professor Saree Makdisi is one of a growing number who make such a comparison – usually provoking an outraged response from pro-Israel commentators .
Israel ’s apologists point to the 1.2 million Palestinians living inside the 1948 borders of Israel , who are allowed to vote – unlike Black South Africans under the apartheid regime .
There is no equivalent in Israeli law , they say , to the hated Group Areas Act and the Pass Laws that regulated where Black South Africans lived and worked .
And you can travel the length and breadth of Israel without seeing any of the “ whites only ” signs on buses , beaches and public amenities that helped make South Africa ’s apartheid system one of the most notorious examples of organised , institutional racism in the 20th century .
It is true that Palestinians living inside Israel have the right to vote – but their parties are always on the edge of illegality , required to pledge allegiance to a purely Jewish state of Israel .
The 2.5 million Palestinians living under Israeli military occupation in the West Bank have not even this right ; nor do the 1.5 million living under Israel ’s punishing military blockade of Gaza .
And the Palestinians expelled from Israel by murder and terror in 1948 , together with their descendents – some five million people altogether – also have no right to vote .
Israel refuses to allow these people to vote in order to engineer a Jewish , pro-Zionist majority .
In a similar way , Blacks in apartheid South Africa were not counted as citizens of South Africa , but could vote for powerless Black - only “ bantustans ” .
It is true that you will look in vain through Israeli law books for the sort of sweeping laws that limited the life opportunities of Blacks – from where they could live to the segregation of public amenities – during the apartheid years .
Nevertheless , there are more than 20 laws that discriminate against the Palestinian minority inside Israel , and a range of systematic practices that reinforce this .
Discrimination in property laws , for instance , contributes to a situation where although 20 per cent of the population of Israel is Palestinian , they own or control only 3 per cent of the land .
On the other hand there is no law specifying that the average Jewish student inside Israel receives nine times as much funding as the average Palestinian student but , according to journalist Jonathon Cook , this is the case .
In employment there is systematic discrimination .
Of the 10,000 who work for the Israeli phone company Bezeq , Jonathon Cook believes that no more than 12 are Palestinian .
In 2004 Nachman Tal , a former deputy head of the Israeli security service Shin Bet , stated that of the 13,000 workers employed by the Israeli Electricity Corporation , only six were Palestinian .
This systematic discrimination extends to civic services .
In October 1990 the long - serving Mayor of Jerusalem , Teddy Kollek , gave a candid interview to the Tel Aviv newspaper Ma’ariv .
According to Kollek :
“ We said over and over that we would equalise the rights of the Arabs to the rights of the Jews in the city – empty talk .
Never have we given them a feeling of being equal before the law .
They were and remain second - and third - class citizens . ”
[ Question : ]
“ And this is said by a mayor of Jerusalem who did so much for the city ’s Arabs , who built and paved roads and developed their quarters ? ”
[ Kollek : ]
“ Nonsense !
Fairy tales ! …
For Jewish Jerusalem
I did something in the past twenty - five years .
For East Jerusalem ?
Nothing ! …
Sidewalks ?
Nothing .
Cultural institutions ?
Not one .
Yes , we installed a sewerage system for them and improved the water supply . …
Do you think it was for their good , for their welfare ?
Forget it !
There were some cases of cholera there , and the Jews were afraid that they would catch it … ”
Palestinians in the West Bank are subject to a range of restrictions familiar to anyone with experience of South Africa ’s apartheid regime .
Indeed , many who have visited Palestine from South Africa have been struck by the comparison .
Archbishop Desmond Tutu , a prominent activist against apartheid in South Africa , commented in 2002 :
“ Yesterday ’s township dwellers can tell you about today ’s life in the occupied Palestinian territories .
To travel only a few blocks in his own homeland , an elderly grandfather waits to beg for the whim of a teenage soldier .
More than an emergency is required to get to a hospital ; less than a crime earns a trip to jail .
“ The lucky ones have a permit to leave their squalor to work in the cities , but luck runs out when security closes all checkpoints , paralysing an entire people .
The indignities , dependence and anger are all too familiar . ”
And in 2006 Willie Madisha , the Secretary of COSATU ( the main union federation in South Africa ) commented : “ As someone who lived in apartheid South Africa and who has visited Palestine , I say with confidence that Israel is an apartheid state .
In fact , I believe that some of the atrocities committed by the erstwhile apartheid regime in South Africa pale in comparison to those committed against the Palestinians . ”
The ruling elite of both Israel and apartheid South Africa have themselves been struck by the similarity of their repressive political systems .
In 1978 the South African government yearbook commented : “ Israel and South Africa have one thing above all else in common : they are both situated in a predominantly hostile world inhabited by dark peoples . ”
More lately , the rulers of Israel have been haunted by the fate of apartheid in South Africa .
Under siege from within ( from an increasingly militant and well - organised Black working class ) and from without ( thanks to an escalating campaign of boycott and sanctions around the world ) , the South African ruling class was forced to end the apartheid system in the early 1990s .
In 2003 the then Israeli deputy Prime Minister , Ehud Olmert , commented : “ More and more Palestinians are uninterested in a negotiated , two - state solution , because they want to change the essence of the conflict from an Algerian paradigm to a South African one .
From a struggle against ‘ occupation ’ , in their parlance , to a struggle for one - man - one - vote .
That is , of course , a much cleaner struggle , a much more popular struggle – and ultimately , a much more powerful one .
For us , it would mean the end of the Jewish state . ”
Last November , as Prime Minister , Olmert repeated that if Israel was unable to implement a “ two - state solution ” , it would “ face a South African - style struggle for equal voting rights , and as soon as that happens , the state of Israel is finished . ”
Olmert is exaggerating .
South African apartheid was backed by the British and US ruling classes for many years as a bulwark against nationalist and left - wing movements in southern Africa .
But Israel , with its proximity to the vast reserves of Middle Eastern oil , is a much more valuable strategic asset for the West – they will not let it go easily .
While apartheid was crippled by the Black working class in the 1980s , in Israel the Palestinian people have been pushed to the margins of the labour force .
It is up to the working class in the neighbouring Arab countries such as Egypt , and the rest of us around the world , to make support for Israel a no - win game for the imperialist powers .
But Olmert knows that , just because apartheid Israel is powerful , this does not make it all - powerful .
The Palestinian people show no sign of ending their resistance to Israeli apartheid – just check out bilin - village.org for one of many examples of their ongoing struggle .
And for a new generation of activists in countries like the UK , the US and Australia , support for Palestine can play a role similar to the struggle against South African apartheid in decades past .
When I first became involved in left - wing activism in the mid-1980s , the struggle against apartheid in South Africa was a touchstone .
The racism and brutality of the regime , and the craven support given to it by Thatcher in Britain and Reagan in the US , summed up everything that was wrong with the system .
Over decades , many thousands of us sat on picket lines , marched , boycotted and spoke up in a huge array of forums against apartheid South Africa .
We were often told we were wasting our time .
But we succeeded then .
And we can succeed again .

The bodies of two Canadian soldiers — including the highest - ranking officer killed in combat in Afghanistan — were on their final journey home to Canada Tuesday .
Maj . Yannick Pepin , 36 , and Cpl. Jean - François Drouin , 31 , were killed Sunday by a roadside bomb while on patrol southwest of Kandahar .
Flag - draped coffins carrying their bodies were loaded onto a military aircraft at Kandahar Airfield after a ramp ceremony Monday attended by more than 1,000 Canadian , U.S. , Dutch and British soldiers .
Pepin and Drouin were members of the 5 Combat Engineer Regiment based in Valcartier , Que . Pepin was a native of Victoriaville , Que. , and Drouin was born in Quebec City .
Since 2002 , 129 Canadian soldiers have died as part of the Afghan mission .
Author and democracy activist Frances Moore Lappé says we already know how to solve the pressing issues of our time , such as climate change and world hunger .
But she says our own pre-conceived ideas about how things should work - our mental map of the world - is actually preventing us from taking action .
In a speech at Ottawa 's Carleton University as part of the 78th Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences , Lappé called for a wholesale revamping of the way we view government , the economy and democracy .
If we manage to do it , she says , we can save ourselves from our own demise .
Lappé , made famous in the 1970s by her bestselling vegetarian cookbook Diet for a Small Planet , is an activist , author and co-founder with her daughter Anna Lappé of The Small Planet Institute .
She says many people today are frightened by the potential for disaster , ecological and otherwise , and fearful that nothing can be done to prevent it .
Lappé says we can do something - if we challenge five assumptions about the way the world works .
The first is that going green means " powering down , " or reducing our consumption of energy .
Lappé says all we have to do is stop getting energy from fossil fuels and start getting it from renewable sources like the sun .
" Every day the sun supplies us with 15,000 times the amount of energy we 're now using in fossil fuels , " she says .
If everyone had a solar panel or windmill on their roof , we would n't be dependent on oil companies - and as individuals we 'd feel more in control of our own destiny .
The second idea to dispense with , she says , is that going green means an end to economic growth .
What we have to do , she says , is change our idea of what growth is .
Right now , she says , the Walton family - owners of Wal - Mart - controls as much wealth as the bottom 40 per cent of the U.S. population .
Is it growth if the wealthy families just get wealthier ?
There 's plenty of room for growth , she says , if we learn to do things more efficiently .
For example , she says various estimates show that between 25 and 50 per cent of all food produced in the United States is wasted .
And that every year , Americans throw out some 300 pounds of packaging material .
The third idea she wants to challenge is the notion that humans are by nature greedy , self - centred and materialistic .
Under certain conditions , she said , we can be monsters .
But there would n't be 6.8 billion of us on the planet today if we did n't also have positive qualities such as empathy , cooperation and fairness .
As a society , she said we should simply try to make sure our rules try to bring out the best , not the worst in us .
The fourth idea she disputes is that we dislike rules .
She says humans crave structure , particularly rules that make sense to us as individuals and which foster a sense of inclusion .
We will accept the right rules , she says , citing as an example a German law that enables individual citizens to sell power they produce at home , through renewable sources such windmills or solar panels for example , to utilities at a guaranteed price .
People there have embraced the idea , she says .
The final concept she wants to challenge is the idea that our problems are so pressing there 's no time for democracy , and only an authoritarian regime can save us .
She believes the only hope for the planet is to trust in people and set rules that bring out the best in us .
" The mother of all issues is who makes the decisions , " she says , adding that if decisions are taken by people with the most money , we all suffer .
Lappé says she 's not against a market economy - just the idea that there 's only one way to run the economy .
She also wants to challenge the idea , she says , that change is impossible .
Recent history has shown that seemingly insoluble problems have in fact been solved .
" It 's not possible to know what 's possible . "

Intel has announced Threading Building Blocks 2.2 ( TBB ) , a high - level C++ library that abstracts threads to tasks to create portable and scalable parallel applications .
Version 2.2 is available in both the commercial and open source releases .
These are built from identical sources -- the only real difference is the license and support offerings .
TBB 2.2 maintains the functionality and platform support of previous versions and adds feature and performance improvements , including full support for the lambda capabilities of the new C++ draft standard ( C++0 x ) and more flexibility for developers to redistribute with their applications .
Among the new 2.2 features are :
Automatic memory allocator replacement available .
The memory allocator is one of the most popular features of Intel TBB .
However , it can be time consuming to replace your own memory allocator calls .
Version 2.2 uses a dynamic instrumentation method on Windows and the LD_PRELOAD function on Linux to offer automatic memory allocator replacement throughout applications .
Version 2.2 extends TBB 's memory allocator 's performance by delivering large - block ( over 8 K in size ) allocation performance .

Scaling of scheduler enhanced .
Version 2.2 features a reworked task scheduler to behave more like an ideal Cilk - style scheduler , yielding scalable behavior .
Version 2.2 also has improvements to the affinity partitioner , and changes the default for loop templates from the simple_partitioner to the easier to use and adaptive auto_partitioner .

Version 2.2 also has improvements to the affinity partitioner , and changes the default loop templates from the to the easier to use and adaptive .
Automatic initialization available .
Version 2.2 no longer requires an explicit initialization .
Users of prior versions have told us that in a large application it is not easy to initialize in the right place .
Version 2.2 takes care of automatically initializing the scheduler when it is first needed .
Additionally , 2.2 includes enhancements to parallel algorithms :
Version 2.2 has a new parallel_invoke for running a group of functors simultaneously in parallel .
for running a group of functors simultaneously in parallel .
Version 2.2 has a new parallel_for_each and a simplified parallel_for interface to make writing some common for loops easier .
parallel_for_each( first , last , f ) is like parallel_do( first , last , body ) but without the feeder functionality that allows adding more work items .
In other words , tbb:: parallel_for_each is the parallel equivalent of std:: for_each .
The new overload parallel_for ( first , last , step , f ) lets you pass an integer first ( auto i=first ) , last ( i , and step ( i+=step ) for a given function f( i ) , handles simple cases easily , especially with the use of lambdas .
The original interface parallel_for ( range , body , partitioner ) has been retained .
It 's more general but also more complicated to write , even with the use of lambdas .
and a simplified interface to make writing some common for loops easier .
Intel TBB 's pipeline can now perform DirectX , OpenGL , and I/O parallelization by using the new thread_bound_filter feature .
There are certain types of operations that require that they are used from the same thread every time and by using a filter bound to a thread , you can guarantee that the final stage of the pipeline will always use the same thread .

Exception safety support has been expanded significantly .
Prior versions had support for exception propagation only in parallel_for , parallel_reduce , and parallel_sort .
Support is expanded to include parallel_do , the new parallel_invoke , and parallel_for_each as well as the new forms of parallel_for and parallel_reduce .
, , and .
Support is expanded to include , the new , and as well as the new forms of and .
Lambda support has been extended to cover not only parallel_for , but also parallel_reduce , parallel_sort , and the new parallel_for_each and parallel_invoke algorithms .
In addition , the new combinable and enumerable_thread_specific classes for thread local storage can accept lambdas .
The documentation and code examples are expanded to show lambdas in action .
The Intel Compiler 11.0 and Intel Parallel Studio offer lambda support today , and Microsoft will support it in Visual Studio 2010 ( it is in the beta currently ) .
Concurrent container enhancements include :
Thread local storage , which is portable across platforms , is now possible with the new enumerable_thread_specific and combinable classes .
This can be useful for algorithms that reduce shared memory contention by creating local copies and then combining results later through something like a reduce operation .
and combinable classes .
This can be useful for algorithms that reduce shared memory contention by creating local copies and then combining results later through something like a reduce operation .
Unbounded non-blocking interface for concurrent_queue and new blocking concurrent_bounded_queue .
Some operations require synchronization and may or may not block depending on whether or not the queue is bounded .
To get the best behavior , use the unbounded form if you need only basic non-blocking push / try_pop operations to modify the queue .
Otherwise use the bounded form which supports both blocking and non-blocking push / pop operations .

Improved interfaces for concurrent_vector that removes a common extra step needed to use the vector output .
There are some changes programmers may need to do to move from prior versions of Intel TBB to the Version 2.2 .
Developers can simply add #define TBB_DEPRECATED 1 to their code , and the old interfaces remain available ( at least for now ) adjust to the following changes :
At around 14:20 , after Devon hangs her soiled socks on the tree limb , a crew member can be seen laying on the ground , presumably holding the visible monofilament wire connected to the cookie bag that falls from her wagon .

Alternate Versions
For showing on US television , all of the profanity was dubbed over with less extreme words , the sex scene between Trent and Pam ( at around 20 minutes in ) used an alternate take where they are wearing clothes as opposed to them being nude in the original , and the scene where Trent dives off the bridge completely naked ( at around 10 minutes in ) used an alternate take with him ( actually a stunt man ) wearing underwear .
The alternate takes were filmed with the intention of this being shown on TV in the US .
The version streaming on several internet services ( Amazon , Tubi , etc. ) is this censored TV version .

Defcon 17 Experience
Description :
Noah writes : " This is a bunch of photos and some video clips from DefCon 17 in Las Vegas .
I took almost all of these , but owe a tip of the hat to Dan Spisak as well as Axel Taferner & Amber Baldet for some of these , because they captured some things at DefCon I missed .
Check out their photo streams as well .
This was my 6th time going to DefCon in the last 11 years .
I tried to capture the spirit of DefCon with this .
I feel this video represents the things you can expect to see there . "

Editor 's note : Alex Wellen 's debut novel , " Lovesick , " follows a young man on his quest to get married and defeat a crime ring of geriatric gangsters .
Wellen is an award - winning producer for CNN .
For this article , he interviewed men on how they approached marriage .
Brian Lohse feeds his wife , Alana , cake at their wedding in June .
( CNN ) -- " Well , what do you think ? " his dad asked .
Brian Lohse knew exactly what his father was getting at .
His father had never pressed him about marriage before .
But the question had its intended effect : a light switch flipped on .
" I 'd never really thought about it .
But that was the point right there when I said to myself : ' Oh my gosh , you know what , this is the girl I 'm going to marry , ' " Brian said .
" I can't picture myself spending the rest of my life with any other person than Alana . "
Brian , 34 , had indeed made the psychological leap .
It was time to get this party started .
Six months later , he proposed .
They married in June .
If you believe the conventional wisdom , Brian 's story is the exception .
" Real men " are perceived as committing " till death do us part " for the wrong reasons -- they marry out of convenience or under duress , and they acquiesce , kicking and screaming all the way to the altar .
Watch the author talk about his research »
Somewhere along the way , marriage and masculinity became mutually exclusive .
But that stands in stark contrast to the dozens of men I spoke with , who admitted -- no , insisted -- they 've fantasized about popping the question , getting married , even having a wedding .
The circumstances surrounding those light - switch moments varied .
For one man who lost his father , it was the extraordinary outpouring of love and support from his future bride that changed everything ; another guy came to the realization when he caught himself balling up his fists in anger the moment someone made a pass at his then - girlfriend ; yet another described the emotion of seeing his long - distance girlfriend for the first time after spending months cooped up in a nuclear submarine .
For me , the light bulb popped on at a penny arcade , playing classic ' 80s arcade games with my girlfriend .
Kris destroyed asteroids and hopped barrels with impressive dexterity .
But it was the grace with which she obliterated insects that sealed the deal .
Spinning that roller ball , wiping out that quickly descending centipede with master firepower -- I had to marry this girl .
iReport.com : C'mon guys , tell us YOUR light bulb marriage moment
Here are four more modern - day men who privately disclose that " kick - in - the - pants " moment when each of them determined " this is it " :
Tyler Harris added up the numbers
" If you can't afford the ring , you should n't be moving toward the wedding right now , " said Tyler Harris , 24 .
It took him seven years to get the ring .
The Virginia couple will marry next May .
As a lead underwriter for a bank card processor , Tyler is in the business of assessing risk .
Not that Heather was ever a gamble .
" I knew for a very long time that Heather was the girl I wanted to spend the rest of my life with , " said Tyler . " [ But ]
I am of the opinion that you should n't rush off to get married when you 're not really ready ; when you do n't really have a foundation established ; when you can't really support starting to build a life together , " he said , looking back at those unstable financial years when he and his fiancée were in school .
Novel excerpt : Engagement formula called ' hooha '
For Tyler , once they had jobs and an established income , only then could he give Heather everything she deserved .
" It was an ' aha ' moment that this thing I wanted to do for so many years , I could actually make it happen .
So I did , " Tyler laughed .
Craig Wilson made his list
He titled the wish list " Future Wife Qualities , " and Craig Wilson , 47 , of Portland , Oregon , composed it fresh off a failed marriage of 14 years .
Among the 12 desired traits , he wrote : " Glows with happiness and a great sense of humor . "
Craig was n't sure he'd ever marry again , but if he did , he had this list .
With six kids and only two miles between them , Craig and Tracy should have crossed paths , but it would take a pregnant , matchmaking local first - grade teacher to bring them together .
Neonatal nurse Tracy provided the teacher with tips on newborns , and Molly tipped Tracy off to a newly available bachelor named Craig .
" This was the person of my dreams , " Craig said .
" I remember after dating Tracy into the second or third month , I went back and looked at this thing I 'd written , and thought : ' Wow , she hits everything . ' "
Craig proposed two months later .
Tracy and Craig married last July .
Rabin Nabizadeh found love soberly
" She essentially hated me , " recalled Rabin Nabizadeh , 35 , of his new bride .
I can hear his newborn cooing in the background .
" I never stopped loving her . "
The couple dated as students in law school , but then Deepti had to leave .
" We had a very difficult time at the whole dating thing , " Rabin said , looking back .
" I had a pretty debilitating drug addiction . "
Rabin said he 's been sober since the day she left in 2003 .
Three years went by before a chance encounter brought them face - to - face again .
The couple wed last February .
Rabin describes the driving force that prompted him to start engagement ring shopping as " a spiritual experience of the educational variety . "
Read excerpt from Wellen 's novel " Lovesick "
" ' Whatever the difficulties are , eventually if I do n't take this step , she 'll just leave , ' " he recalled .
" It was n't a big thunderous sense of love that got me .
It was more like : ' I know I love this woman , she is my equal , and it 's time . ' "
Chris Parks liked sound of 'us '
" I always knew that I wanted to spend my life with Melanie .
Once we got really serious , I knew we were a good team , " said Chris Parks , 28 .
" I wanted to make that serious commitment , and I wanted her to make that commitment to me . "
The two met at CNN .
A year later , they moved in together and started talking about buying a house .
Marriage was an eventuality , but the couple was in no rush .
Then came " The Talk . "
But not some heart - to - heart ultimatum .
In fact , it was a series of talks that flipped the switch for Chris .
" There were a couple of times where we went to dinner , just sitting there , talking to her , just the way we were conversing with one another , and we were talking about our futures : ' I want to do this with our lives , or that with our lives .
Can you picture us when we have a house , kids , a dog ? '
That really resonated with me .
She was n't just thinking about herself .
She was thinking about us , " Chris said .
" I liked the thought of that .
What am I really waiting for ? " he reflected .
" I felt like I was a part of something . "

Peeing in the shower is shameful no more .
In fact , it 's encouraged and even celebrated in this colorful , animated PSA from F / Nazca Saatchi & Saatchi in Brazil .
The " Xixi no banho " ( " Pee in the bath " ) campaign is all about water conservation .
Brazil hopes its multitasking citizens will save thousands of liters of water a year by flushing the toilet less .

Newspaper 's urinal mirrors deliver ' the truth '
Around 10 years ago I did a life planning exercise with my brother to set some long term goals .
It 's a great idea to do this , you'd be surprised how many life goals you can achieve if you just actually take the time to set them .
One of the exercises that came out of this was to give my life a brand and work toward making that my true brand by working toward being who I want to be .
Like BMW is " The Ultimate Driving Machine " , this particular task was to set a brand for yourself .
This was really difficult imagery to narrow down - something that you truly desire and can hopefully accomplish .
So what did / do I want my brand to be you ask ?
What I came up with then is now still something I think about regularly and work for in my life .
I wanted and still want to be : " A deep well to draw from . "
There 's a selflessness in this that appeals to me .
It ties in with my upbringing as a Christian and also my current love of the Tao and most of the people I really admire in life .
Those like my friends
Howard Potratz and Ed Cox who devote their life to help others reach their potential .
But I 've been thinking lately on how there needs to be more specifics now to this brand I desire to be .
A deep well of what ?
I 've come to some conclusions : 1. A Deep Well of Wisdom .
Wisdom is the ability to apply your life lessons and learning to current situations .
This is n't some pie in the sky , etherial quality , it comes from a life long desire to learn and a focus on introspection - " what did I learn ? "
I 've had a lot of failures in my life and will have more , but I 've learned from most of them what not to do in similar situations .
My gray hair is proof of this !
Mostly though , I want to be able to help others through applying the knowledge I 've gained in life and learning in a wise manner and when it 's wanted .
This also spurs me on to keep learning through living and study .
Ghandi said : " Live as if you were to die tomorrow , learn as if you were to live forever .
" 2. A Deep Well of Love .
I want the people around me to know that I love them .
Not for what they can do for me or even for what they can do for themselves , but for who they are .
This does n't mean I do n't have expectations for those I interact with , it just means my love for them does n't depend on those expectations .
Unconditional is how it 's put in a lot of circles .
I also want people to be able to dip in and draw love when they do n't feel it themselves .
It 's why I care about the plight of the hungry and homeless .
most of whom have a serious love deficit .
Again , there is a personal responsibility for me to make sure I have a love surplus .
Letting people love me .
Honestly , that 's been one of the hardest lessons in my life and something I still struggle with .
You can't love others without letting others show their love to you .
It 's how you learn to love and it's also how you build up a surplus .
3 . A Deep Well of Joy .
I think Joy is a combination of two things : Contentment and Simplicity .
Being peaceful and content in where you are and who you are is a life long journey .
This does n't mean you do n't have goals and desires , it just means you do n't let them rule your attitude .
If you fail , learn from it .
The Tao teaches this best .
Think of your life as water ; though water is soft and compliant , there are no obstacles that it will not eventually conquer .
Visualize the Grand Canyon .
There is nothing in your way that you cannot eventually master .
In this , you can be truly happy , for without contentment , joy is unatainable .
Also , getting your life to it 's simplest form creates joy .
Your life may be complex compared to others , but reducing complexity always leads to happiness and joy .
Building up a surplus of joy , being so content on simply where I am at and who I am that joy spills over ; this is how I want to live .
This is a bit of a life manifesto for me , a passion to keep me going , for at times my well runs dry .
It 's then that I am so thankful for my family and friends .
I could recount how each one at times has let me draw from their own well when I am parched .
I hope to be that person for you when you need it .simply , Tim
The Stonewall riots in 1969 changed almost everything about gay life in New York City , and that famous event is now , in one respect , like Woodstock : far more people claim to have been there than actually were .
In all of the gonzo testimony about Stonewall , however , no reaction to the rioting has struck me as being so painfully honest ( or so funny ) as the novelist Edmund White’s .
He was there at the Stonewall Inn when it erupted , he writes in his new memoir , “ City Boy : My Life in New York During the 1960s and ’ 70s . ”
And when all hell broke loose , his initial response was to sit and stew and cluck .
“ I thought we should n’t create a fuss , ” he admits .
“ This was bad for our image .
I said out loud , ‘ Oh , come on , guys . ’ ”
That “ Oh , come on , guys ” moment is put into painful and complicated perspective in “ City Boy . ”
Mr. White had arrived in Manhattan from the Midwest seven years earlier , in 1962 , spurning a chance at a Harvard Ph.D. to follow a lover .
One of the most common Christian beliefs , and the one most often appealed to in order to explain why evil exists , is that human beings have free will to make choices that are not in God ’s control .
God does n’t want robots , the argument goes , nor mindless puppets programmed to sing his praises .
He desires genuine fellowship with real , independent beings , and giving us free will is the only way to achieve that , though some people may misuse the gift and cause evil and sin that harm others .
But if you look at the Bible , this reasoning is n’t so easy to support .
In fact , there ’s strong evidence that , in the world of Christian theology , human beings are not free to make their own choices – as we see from some little - known bible verses .
“ According as [ Christ ] hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world , that we should be holy and without blame before him in love : having predestinated [ Greek proorizo , to predetermine , to decide beforehand ] us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself , according to the good pleasure of his will …. ”
— Ephesians 1:4,5 ( KJV )
This verse from Ephesians arguably is n’t even the strongest predestination verse in the Bible , but I chose it because it easily disposes of the usual counterargument : that God does not predestine , but with his omniscience , he sees in advance who will freely choose him .
This verse refutes that interpretation by using the Greek word proorizo , which specifically means “ predestinate ” .
If the author of this verse had instead wanted to say that God would foresee who would choose him , there ’s a perfectly good Greek word for that – proginosko .
That word is not used here .
However , it is used in another verse which puts the nail in the coffin of the foreknowledge argument :
“ For whom [ God ] did foreknow [ proginosko ] , he also did predestinate [ proorizo ] to be conformed to the image of his Son , that he might be the firstborn among many brethren .
Moreover whom he did predestinate , them he also called : and whom he called , them he also justified : and whom he justified , them he also glorified .
What shall we then say to these things ? ….
Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God ’s elect ?
It is God that justifieth . ”
— Romans 8:29 - 33 ( KJV )
This verse uses both the words for “ foreknow ” and “ predestinate ” , and it specifically says that God does both .
But there ’s one more predestination verse in the Bible that ’s the most compelling of all :
“ Is there unrighteousness with God ?
God forbid .
For he saith to Moses , I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy , and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion .
So then it is not of him that willeth , nor of him that runneth , but of God that sheweth mercy .
For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh , Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up , that I might shew my power in thee , and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth .
Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy , and whom he will he hardeneth .
Thou wilt say then unto me , Why doth he yet find fault ?
For who hath resisted his will ?
Nay but , O man , who art thou that repliest against God ?
Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it , Why hast thou made me thus ?
Hath not the potter power over the clay , of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour , and another unto dishonour ? ” — Romans 9:14 - 21 ( KJV )
This long verse makes it clear what Paul ’s views on free will are .
Salvation is “ not of him that willeth ” , but the choice of God , who selects some people and shows mercy to them .
The rest , like Pharaoh , he “ hardens ” so that they will reject him and be condemned .
But the most incontrovertible proof that this passage teaches predestination is that Paul anticipates the obvious counterargument – that it would be unjust for God to punish people for being as he made them to be – and responds to it !
His argument is that since God is the maker , he can do whatever he wants with us – just as a potter shapes clay into different vessels to suit his purposes – and we have no right to lay a charge of injustice against him .
Verses like these may disturb Christians who ’ve always believed that God gave us free will .
But the truth is that such a concept finds little support in the Bible .
By contrast , the pro-predestination verses are numerous and specific in their wording :
God makes us as he chooses , rewards the people whom he made to be good , and punishes the ones whom he made to be evil , even though neither group had any choice in how they would turn out .
Many influential historical Christian thinkers , including Augustine , Martin Luther and John Calvin , accepted these verses for what they say .
Today this view is much less popular , probably because of its unsettling moral implications for God ’s goodness .
As mentioned earlier , even most Christians now seem to accept that a god who was directly responsible for evil , and who condemns people for being as he made them to be , would not be worthy of worship .
But this ca n’t change the fact that it is still what the Bible clearly says .

My seventh - grade English teacher exhorted us to study vocabulary with the following : " We think in words .
The more words you know , the more thoughts you can have . "
This compound notion that language allows you to have ideas otherwise un-haveable , and that by extension people who own different words live in different conceptual worlds -- called " Whorfianism " after its academic evangelist , Benjamin Lee Whorf -- is so pervasive in modern thought as to be unremarkable .
Eskimos , as is commonly reported , have myriads of words for snow , affecting how they perceive frozen percipitation .
A popular book on English notes that , unlike English , " French and German can distinguish between knowledge that results from recognition ... and knowledge that results from understanding . "
Politicians try to win the rhetorical battle ( " pro-life " vs. " anti-abortion " ; " estate tax " vs. " death tax " ) in order to gain the political advantage .
For all its social success , Whorfianism has fared less well scientifically .
Careful consideration of the examples above shows why .
Try calling dry snow " dax " and wet snow " blicket , " and see if you notice a change in how you think about snow .
I did n't .
The English book 's statement assumes that if you do n't have a word for something , you can't talk about it ... a claim that the sentence proves false .
Finally , calling the law of October 26 , 2001 the " USA Patriot Act " may have done as much to stain the word " patriot " as increase enthusiasm for the law .
Oh , and Eskimos do n't have all that many words for snow .
In fact , scientists have had so much difficulty demonstrating that language affects thought that in 1994 renown psychologist Steven Pinker called Whorfianism dead .
Since then , Whorfianism has undergone a small resurgence .
For instance , Lera Boroditsky and colleagues found that speakers of Russian , which treats light blue and dark blue as primary colors , are faster to categorize shades of blue .
While fascinating and important work , these and other similar results are a bit short of showing that " the more words you know , the more thoughts you can have . "
The recent study that comes closest is an investigation of number .
Although number words and counting are a fixture of life in most cultures from the time we are old enough to play hide - and - go - seek , some languages have only a handful of number words .
In a paper published in 2008 , MIT cognitive neuroscientist Michael Frank and colleagues demonstrated that Pirahã , a language spoken by a small Amazonian community , has no number words at all .
The research team simply asked Pirahã speakers to count different numbers of batteries , nuts and other common objects .
Rather than having a word consistently used to describe " one X " a different word for " two Xs " and yet another word for " three Xs , " the Pirah ã used hói to describe a small number of objects , hoí to describe a slightly larger number , and baágiso for an even larger number .
Basically , these words mean " around one , " " some " and " many . "
The lack of number words had a profound and surprising effect on what the Pirahã could do .
In a series of experiments , the researchers presented Pirahã participants with some number of spools of thread .
The participants ' task was simply to give the researcher the same number of balloons .
If the participants were allowed to line up the balloons next to the spools of thread one - by - one , they did fine .
But if they were n't allowed this crutch -- for instance , if the spools of thread were dropped into a bucket one at a time , and then the participant had to produce the same number of balloons -- they failed .
Although they were generally able to stay in the ballpark -- if a lot of spools went into the bucket , they produced a lot of balloons ; a small number of spools , a small number of balloons -- their responses were basically educated guesses .
Could it be that the Pirah ã not understand the concept of " same amount " ?
That 's unlikely .
When allowed to match the balloons to spools one - by - one , they succeeded in the task .
Instead , it seems that they failed to give the same number of balloons only when they had to rely on memory .
This actually makes a lot of sense .
Try to imagine exactly seventeen balloons in your head , but without counting them .
It 's impossible .
Decades of research have shown that people can tell the difference between one object and two or between three objects and four without counting , but such fine distinctions with larger numbers like seventeen versus eighteen requires counting .
You would n't match seventeen balloons to seventeen spools by sight alone .
You would count the spools and then count out the same number of balloons .
But the Pirahã can't count .
They do n't have number words .
This suggests a different way of thinking about the influence of language on thought : words are very handy mnemonics .
We may not be able to remember what seventeen spools looks like , but we can remember the word seventeen .
In his landmark The Language of Thought , philosopher Jerry Fodor argued that many words work like acronyms .
French students use the acronym bans to remember which adjectives go before nouns ( " Beauty , Age , Number , Goodneess , and Size " ) .
Similarly , sometimes its easier to remember a word ( calculus , Estonia ) than what the word stands for .
We use the word , knowing that should it becomes necessary , we can search through our minds -- or an encyclopedia -- and pull up the relevant information ( how to calculate an integral ; Estonia 's population , capital and location on a map ) .
Numbers , it seems , work the same way .
I do n't know whether my seventh - grade English teacher would be disappointed .
Do more words mean more thoughts ?
Probably not .
But more words do make it easier to remember those thoughts -- and sometimes that 's just as important .
I awake this morning to a more frightening world .
Yesterday blasphemy became a crime in Ireland , one element of a bill supposedly focused on defamation .
Today in Ireland , certain categories of ideas gain for the first time a special status ; a protection normally reserved for human beings .
Yesterday , in the final moments before the hammer fell , facing a Seanad rebellion the government found a Green party TD wandering the halls to swing the vote .
They succeeded in enacting the worst and most pernicious piece of legislation in this countries history .
This is our response .
[ Note : This article is an editorial – if you ’d like more information on the legislation itself , and how it will be enforced , please read our original piece , published in June : Proposed Irish Blasphemy Legislation ]
When the Founding Fathers of the United States framed the Bill of Rights , drafting their amendments to the American constitution , they made sure to enshrine both the freedom to worship and freedom to critique .
Indeed , not only are these rights protected in the foremost amendment to the US constitution , both rights are stated in a single paragraph .
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances .
The framers of the American constitution recognised implicitly that freedom of speech and the plurality of religious worship necessitate one another .
Despite the many abrogations of individual freedom and privacy that have occurred since , this right has remained effectively inviolate .
Opinion , especially factually true opinion , may usually be expressed .
The framers of the second Irish constitution had less noble motivations , in publishing the document which persists ( necessitating frequent amendment ) to this day .
In consultation with the hierarchy of the Catholic Church in Ireland , they enshrined the ‘ special place ‘ of that religion , the importance of a woman ’s role as home - maker , and the pre-eminent sanctity of monogamous heterosexual marriage .
Dermot Ahern , Ireland ’s current minister for Justice , Equality and Law Reform , claims that this flawed and outdated document compelled him to create legislation prohibiting blasphemy , and further that it would be against the spirit of the constitution for such legislation to be toothless .
Thus he has created a bill , passed without debate during a session attended by , on average only six TDs at a time , which foists a € 25,000 euro ( $ 34,900 USD , or £ 21,439 Sterling ) fine on anyone who “ publishes or utters matter ” …
“ grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion , thereby causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion ; and he or she intends , by the publication of the matter concerned , to cause such outrage . ”
Perhaps the minister , in claiming to be compelled to legislation is being honest .
After all , article 40 of the flawed and outdated Irish constitution states …
“ The State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion , such as the radio , the press , the cinema , while preserving their rightful liberty of expression , including criticism of Government policy , shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State .
The publication or utterance of blasphemous , seditious , or indecent material is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law . ”
So , while the Irish supreme court had ruled that deciding “ of what the offence of blasphemy consists ” was impossible ; and despite recent recommendations from an Oireachtas ( parliamentary ) committee that references to sedition and blasphemy be removed from the bill , national and international criticism from journalists , and lawyers alike , and frequent suggestions that the constitution as a whole should be replaced , Dermot Ahern may honestly have seen it as his duty to create a heavily penalised crime of blasphemy .
Perhaps this legislation will be struck down at a European level .
Perhaps it will prove unenforceable in practice , as the conflicting and competing claims of religious doctrine make prosecution more trouble than it ’s worth .
These outcomes would be wonderful , and they seem reasonable , but they are in no sense guaranteed .
Irish Attorney Generals and Directors of Public Prosecutions have in the past shown little hesitation in bringing manifestly unfair and unnecessary cases to trial , based on bad legislation and the demands of religious special interest groups .
What is less ambiguous is the likely effect of this legislation , whether effectively enforced or not .
Without any significant outcry to bolster their indignation , the Irish news media are certain to reduce their coverage of contentious religious issues .
Lets take the infamous Muhammad caricature controversy , as an example .
Perhaps it was unnecessary for the Irish media to republish the cartoons that were the source of such outrage four years ago , but in today ’s new legislative climate , it would be unwise even to report on the debate .
Books which take issue with religious convention are this morning more difficult to publish , plays , radio progammes and television shows mocking or challenging the veracity of religious claims more difficult to commission and to broadcast .
Domestic Irish comedy has long been a deceased , decaying creature , lumbering on in blissful disregard of its own death , but we can say goodbye to any hopes of a native broadcaster producing the next Life of Brian , or a foreign broadcaster choosing Ireland as the location for another Father Ted .
A friend ( who shares my opposition to the blasphemy legislation ) has spoken of his distaste in siding with folks like Bill Maher , Sarah Silverman , and “ Richard bloody Dawkins ” .
It ’s easy to forget that almost every influential post war satirist from Spike Milligan , to Peter Cook , Chris Morris and the Pythons , would have also have faced prosecution under this legislation .
Ireland seems fond of its dead writers , we name bridges after Samuel Beckett and erect statues of James Joyce and Oscar Wilde , we build writers museums and interpretive centres , and opine grandiloquently on their literary significance .
Dead writers are more likeable .
Lest we forget , all of these men were in their day accused of blasphemy .
All wrote controversial , critically acclaimed works which could have faced prosecution under this bill .
Indeed , it is no exaggeration to say that had Dermot Ahern been in a position to enact his censorious legislation at the turn of the century , much of our great literature , from Salome , to Waiting for Godot , to Ulysses might not have been published .
More recently , the Irish comedian Abie Philbin Bowman performed a critically acclaimed comedy show ‘ Jesus the Guantanamo Years ‘ , reimagining the father of Christianity as an imprisoned Middle Eastern terror suspect .
Could such an act get a booking in this country today ?
Advocates of civil liberties refer to such ‘ soft censorship ’ as chilling effects .
The chilling effect here may influence more than a few edgy comedies and current affairs pieces .
Ireland is inarguably recovering from decades of unhealthy religious influence in public life .
We know now that the amount and extent of sexual abuse at the hands of the religious orders – who still by the way control 92 % of our primary schools , extended to monstrous proportions .
The influence of religious interest groups in delaying the legalisation of contraception , homosexuality , and access to sexual health information – all prohibited until the 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s , were and continue to be readily apparent .
We are a nation coming to terms with multiculturalism , while at the same time dealing with our liturgical demons .
Freedom of speech is not merely important at the current moment , it is vital to the recovery of our society from decades of the abuse of the influence of religion over every aspect of civil life .
Ironically the defamation bill of which the blasphemy amendment is a part , creates new protections for Irish journalists from accusations of libel .
Timely protections , as Ireland has historically had some of the most egrigeous slander and libel legislation in the world .
Legislation that prevented the reporting in the 1980’s of endemic political corruption which siphoned untold amounts from the nations coffers ( see previous article ) .
A culture of institutionalised corruption which continues today .
A legislative climate which for example , protects the anonymity of investors personally loaned hundreds of millions of euros by the ‘ troubled ’ Anglo Irish Bank .
What place then , in this or any defamation bill , for the protection of special categories of belief from offence ?
Blasphemy is of course , not the same thing as defamation .
And neither are accurate definitions of what this new legislation prohibits .
What it makes illegal is broadly , intentionally offending religious people .
But why , one might ask , is it necessary to intentionally offend ?
Ignoring for the moment the reversal of the the fundamental legal principle of the Presumption of Innocence ( under the new legislation a defendant must prove the “ genuine literary , artistic , political , scientific or academic value ” of their speech ) , and the impact on the great literary and satirical works already referenced :
The freedom to reason necessitates the freedom to articulate .
Language is the tool of thought , framing and to some extent delimiting possible conceptualisations .
This is why the freedom to criticise and yes intentionally offend , is vital .
Tolerance requires not silence but active plurality , the intolerance of intolerance .
What Isaiah Berlin called the difference between positive and negative liberty , the distinction between freedom from and the freedom to .
Healthy , positive social change of the kind Ireland desperately needs , only ever occurs though reasoned debate – protest alone is rarely sufficient , but the freedom to freely discuss , to complain , to offend and to upset the status quo , is a necessary prerequisite .
These are subtle points , but ones with unsubtle practical consequences .
This legislation bring religion right into the heart of issues like gay marriage and adoption – areas of law and civil life that demonstably conflict with matters held sacred by all of the Abrahamic religions .
Areas of law that appear to conflict too with opinions held by Mr. Ahern himself .
During the dail debate on the decriminalisation of homosexuality in 1993 , Fine Gael TD Brendan McGahon stated …
“ I regard homosexuals as being in a sad category , but I believe homosexuality to be an abnormality , some type of psycho-sexual problem that has defied explanation over the years .
I do not believe that the Irish people desire this normalisation of what is clearly an abnormality .
. .
Homosexuality is a departure from normality and while homosexuals deserve our compassion they do not deserve our tolerance .
That is how the man in the street thinks .
I know of no homosexual who has been discriminated against .
Such people have a persecution complex because they know they are different from the masses or normal society . ”
At the time Ahern , who as Minister for Justice , Equality and Law Reform has rejected proposals for Irish Civil Partnership legislation , not only indicated his agreement with McGahon ’s bigotry , but added …
“ Will we eventually see the day in this country when , as has happened in the USA , homosexuals will seek the right to adopt children ?
We should think seriously about this possibility . ”
We ca n’t know that Dermot Ahern intends to use his position to do everything in his power to limit the rights of those he believes to be ‘ abnormal ’ and unworthy of tolerance , but his own statements do imply that he would not be unhappy if that was one side effect of the new legislation .
Not only is this law unnecessary , dangerous and the result of dubious motivations , to call it poorly worded is a mealy understatement .
It is possessed of the self evident ‘ truthiness ‘ of a Jeremy Carkson rant , or a Daily Mail editorial .
This new law places the beliefs of Scientologists , preachers the Church of the Subgenius and worshippers of the Flying Spaghetti Monster on the same footing as the dogma of major world religions .
It provides for the “ seizure and removal by any member of the Garda Siochana of all copies of the statement to which the offence related that are in the possession of any person “ .
In practice this wording could refer to anything from the pulping of magazines to the purloining of computers containing browser caches of pages repeating the offence .
That , I need hardly point out , might include your computer , since you are currently reading an unquestionably blasphemous website .
Much as been made of the Mr Aherns ‘ generous ’ last minute climb down on the original wording of the bill – which provided for imprisonment in addition to a € 100,000 euro fine , for spoken or published ‘ blasphemy ’ .
No one seems to have mentioned that this aspect of the bill directly contravened the 60 year old United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
Article 12 of which reads …
Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defence .
Good thing they caught that , on the day the bill was passed .
Religion has many uses , notably as a consolation or hermeneutic device .
It provides for some a map of our affective world .
Its allegories , be they biblical or koranic , may like Aesop ’s fables promote ethical behaver and self reflection .
As the writer Alan Moore is fond of saying magic becomes really interesting once you realise it ’s reality is an internal one .
Secular philosophers have all but abandoned the effort to deduce or advocate a poetic ethics , let alone a pragmatic ideology of purpose .
In it ’s place have arisen life coaches , new religious movements , ala carte Catholicism , and secular humanism .
All of which are worthwhile if individuals find them personally meaningful .
It is when we begin to mistake religious belief for concrete reality , protecting doctrine as a special category of privileged knowledge , that we find ourselves in trouble .
Meaning is non exclusive , it is the domain of the purely relative .
Belief can hold no absolute claim on truth .
By enshrining dogma into law , we necessarily make ourselves slaves to outdated traditions that like our constitution , were invented by men now dead , to suit conditions that no longer apply .
The response of my peers to this legislation has been characteristically Irish – variations on ‘ Is n’t it terrible ’ , ‘ there ’s nothing we can do ’ , ‘ ah sure it ’ll all blow over ’ .
One friend has already withdrawn a piece written for this website , afraid of its ramifications for his future career .
Another seems genuinely scared even to even read articles discussing blasphemy , given “ the current climate ” .
As for myself , I have no € 25,000 to give the criminal justice system .
I own no property and am , to be brutally honest the proud possessor of student loans of the type mathematicians refer to as ‘ non trivial ’ .
That said , to quote the ever succinct Twenty Major , I shall continue to “ blaspheme who I want , you God fearing cunt Ahern “ .
Steal My Ideas

* Obama gives Calderon 's crackdown vote of confidence
* Mexican army accused of rights abuses in drug war
* Calderon says he 's committed to protecting human rights
GUADALAJARA , Mexico , Aug 10 ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Monday that drug cartels are Mexico 's main human rights abusers and not the army , which has come under criticism for heavy - handed treatment in a drug war .
President Felipe Calderon has come under fire for using the Mexican army to police states plagued by drug violence , as rights groups have reported random arrests , torture and a few cases of civilians being shot .
Concern about abuses by soldiers could hold up millions of dollars in U.S. equipment pledged as aid for Mexico 's drug war , but Mexico insists any violations are isolated incidents .
Obama , in Mexico for talks with Calderon and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper , defended Mexico 's army crackdown .
" The biggest by far violators of human rights right now are the cartels themselves that are kidnapping people , extorting people and encouraging corruption .
That 's what needs to be stopped , " Obama told a news conference in the western city of Guadalajara .
" I have great confidence in President Calderon 's administration applying the law enforcement techniques that are necessary to curb the power of the cartels but doing so in a way that 's consistent with human rights , " Obama said .
Since coming to power in December 2006 Calderon has deployed thousands of troops to fight drug smugglers .
The onslaught has failed to curb cartel violence , with about 4,000 people killed this year , most of them rival drug smugglers or police .
Mexico 's human rights commission has documented cases of the army arbitrarily detaining drug suspects , beating them or torturing them with electric shocks .
Soldiers suspected of abuse are tried in military courts , which tend to be too lenient on violations like rape or murder , Human Rights Watch says .
U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy , a Democrat and chairman of a subcommittee that oversees foreign aid spending , has said Mexico has not met human rights requirements for the release of 15 percent of a $ 1.4 billion drug aid package agreed in 2007 .
Mexico , which is working to train its police and improve coordination with the army , insists there is no problem .
Calderon said his government was committed to human rights and noted his drug war was about people 's right to security .
" In every case there has been a scrupulous effort to protect human rights , " he told the same news conference .
" Anyone suggesting the contrary should prove a case , one single case , where the authority did not act , where it violated human rights or the authorities did not punish whoever abused their legal power , " he said .

I frequent the Art of Problem Solving forum ( also knows as MathLinks ) where at some point I stumbled across the following problem ( advertised ( .pdf ) as appearing on the 1996 Iranian Mathematical Olympiad , a claim I have no reason to doubt but no way to verify ) :
Consider a chessboard in which the opposite edges have been identified to yield a torus .
What is the maximal number of knights that can be placed on this board so that no two attack each other ?
There are several ways to attack this problem .
If you ’ve spent some time thinking about chess - related mathematics , you ’re probably familiar with the existence of a knight ’s tour on a ( regular ) chessboard : it ’s possible to start with a knight on any square of the chessboard and make a sequence of 64 moves so that it visits every square exactly once before returning to its original position .
It follows that we can place at most 32 knights on the board so that no two attack each other : no two squares visited consecutively in the knight ’s tour may both be occupied , so at most half of the board may be covered .
Moreover , it ’s easy to find a set of 32 squares on which we can place the knights — for example , the 32 black squares do nicely , since a knight on a black square attacks only white squares .
( In fact , one can extend this argument to show that this and the 32 white squares are the only sets of 32 squares on which we can place nonattacking knights . )
That was a regular chessboard — we still have n’t dealt with the torus .
Note that when we identify edges , we can’t possibly increase the number of knights that fit on the board .
Also , it is still true on the torus that knights on black squares attack only black squares .
Thus 32 squares are still maximal , and we ’ve answered our question .
To summarize what we ’ve done using the terminology of graph theory , we ’ve used the Hamiltonicity of the knight ’s graph on an chessboard , the fact that the knight ’s graph is bipartite , and the fact that adding extra edges to a graph can only decrease its independence number .
This Hamiltonicity result is reasonably high - powered , though .
Let ’s try to avoid using it .
One way to do this might be to start with a non-Hamiltonian board , for example , the board .
Consider a chessboard in which the opposite edges have been identified to yield a torus .
What is the maximal number of knights that can be placed on this board so that no two attack each other ?
( Showing that this board is non-Hamiltonian is perhaps nontrivial — one way to do this is by using the contrapositive of the parenthetical statement two paragraphs back . )
What do we do now ?
One way to proceed is by a clever counting argument : on the toroidal knight ’s graph , every vertex has degree four .
Thus , each knight attacks four squares while each non -knight square is attacked by at most four knights .
It follows that the number of knights can be no more than the number of non -knight squares and so eight squares is maximal .
Once again , the toroidal board is bipartite and we can fill all the white squares with knights to achieve our bound .
( By the way , for those who are interested , the toroidal knight ’s graph is isomorphic to the skeleton of the four - dimensional hypercube .
I guess there just are n’t that many four - regular symmetric bipartite graphs on sixteen vertices . )
This latter argument is very elegant .
It also has a lot of power : we can use it to show that we can always fit nonattacking knights on a toroidal board .
Note , however , that if the side - length of the board is odd , bad things start to happen : the square in the upper - left corner attacks squares along the bottom and right edges of the board that are ( under the usual chessboard coloring ) the same color , so we ca n’t achieve the same maximum that we can with a regular board .
In general , it seems difficult to nail down precisely what the largest number of knights is for such a board .
However , some cases are still amenable to our methods .
In particular , the following question allows a quite beautiful solution :
Consider a chessboard in which the opposite edges have been identified to yield a torus .
What is the maximal number of knights that can be placed on this board so that no two attack each other ?
Note that this graph is very much nonbipartite .
For example , the vertices in positions and form a triangle .
So , we have to lower our expectations for the size of the independent set we ’re looking for — maybe we can only fit eight knights on the board , instead of thirteen .
But a little experimenting shows that this is overly optimistic — while it ’s easy to fit five knights on the board ( any row or column will do ) , even putting a sixth down is quite difficult .
A little more experimentation yields the following remarkable fact : not only does our graph contain triangles , but it actually contains a large number of five - cliques !
For example , if we place a knight at the center of the board and choose “ every other ” square from those it attacks ( so , the squares and ) we have five mutually - attacking squares .
This leads immediately to two possible solution methods ( one found by my student K. Cordwell , the other by this blog ’s proprietor ) : we can either note that each knight attacks eight squares while each non-knight square may be attacked by at most two knights ( since the eight squares potentially attacking the given square decompose into two copies of , and we may have at most one knight on each copy ) so at most one fifth of the board may be occupied by knights , or we may note that we can cover the board by five disjoint shifts of the mentioned above and so choose at most one knight from each copy .
For those who are interested in this sort of thing , Noam Elkies and Richard Stanley have a nice paper titled The Mathematical Knight ( . pdf ) that ’s worth a read .
Also , there ’s John J. Watkins ’ extremely readable Across the Board ( the first chapter is available free there ) which is , I guess , a textbook for a course on graph theory viewed completely through the lens of chess problems .
Also , I gather that some people actually enjoying playing chess , rather than solving math problems motivated by it .
This website proposes a starting position to play toroidal chess on a conventional board .

After taking the prize of internet villain of the year for worst internet blocking proposal on the planet , the Australian Government appears determined to do the double , with what has already been described as the world ’s worst comms interception scheme .
This time , the issue is copyright protection , as the government touts proposals to get all Australian ISP ’s to spy on their citizens in order to monitor for copyright compliance .
The Attorney - General ’s Department has just closed its request for comments on its draft of " computer network protection " amendments to the Telecommunications ( Interception and Access ) Act 1979 .
In their submission , Electronic Frontiers Australia ( EFA ) have expressed concern that " the proposed legislation provides a very broad exception to the prohibition on interception of network communications for the purposes of ensuring that a network is " appropriately used " " .
They claim that this is a very broad category , and means that " all network operators in Australia will be able to monitor the substance of communications that pass over their network for compliance with their Acceptable Use Policies – the terms of which could include nearly anything " .
The motivation behind this proposal appears to arise from a recent piracy trial , in which ISP iiNet defended itself in the NSW Federal Court against allegations that it breached intellectual property rights of 34 major music and movie companies .
iiNet have argued quite simply that they have no idea who is downloading what over their network – and further , that under existing Australian law , they have no justification for probing further .
Communications Minister Stephen Conroy has already created a stir by using a CommsDay Summit in May of this year to publicly describe this stance as " stunning " and " a classic " .
However , iiNet may yet cause further embarrassment for the government by summoning the Australian state censors into court to provide evidence that , as the law stands , their interpretation of it is correct .
This is why , according to file - sharing portal , ZeroPaid , Australia is now mulling the concept of " boldly going where no other country has gone before in terms of mass communication interception " .
They argue that the proposed new law would place Australia in a category more extreme , from the perspective of copyright protection than even the US or France , with its continuing proposals for a three - strikes law .
They add : " One wonders if the government has any idea what kind of task it would be to force ISPs to patrol their own networks on a packet - by - packet basis . "
This law is to be debated in the Australian parliament in December of this year – so there is still plenty of time for anyone opposed to it to make their opposition public . ®
The AP has reported that the Police said that the ACORN worker did in fact report the couple who had visited him to set him up .
It is beyond me how irresponsible the media has been all along with ACORN , as well as Congress , and ACORN itself in trying to respond to this mess .
No doubt , that the organization has some issues , but we all can see what is happening here ...
Yeah , we were right about the U.S. Attorney firings .
( See above video , which is ten months old . )
Even Karl Rove and Harriet Miers admit it now :
The dismissal of New Mexico U.S. Attorney David C. Iglesias in December 2006 followed extensive communication among lawyers and political aides in the White House who hashed over complaints about his work on public corruption cases against Democrats , according to newly released e-mails and transcripts of closed - door House testimony by former Bush counsel Harriet Miers and political chief Karl Rove .
A campaign to oust Iglesias intensified after state party officials and GOP members of the congressional delegation apparently concluded he was not pursuing the cases against Democrats in a way that would help then - Rep.
Heather Wilson in a tight releection race , according to interviews and Bush White House e-mails released Tuesday by congressional investigators .
The documents place the genesis of Iglesias 's dismissal earlier than previously known .
The disclosures mark the end of a two - and - a - half year investigation by the House Judiciary Committee , which sued to gain access to Bush White House documents in a dispute that struck at the heart of a president 's executive power .
House members have reserved the right to hold a public hearing at which Rove , Miers , and other aides could appear this fall .
House Judiciary Chairman John M. Conyers Jr. ( D - Mich . )
Tuesday characterized the role of Bush White House figures in the firing episode as improper and inappropriate .

Among other things , the appearance of the German Volkswagen on American highways has stirred the imagination of the friends of free enterprise .
Here , apparently , is another visual proof of the superiority of capitalism over socialism , another demonstration of West Germany 's abandonment of economic controls , another evidence that Germans have embraced the philosophy of the free market .
Hence , it may come as a shock to libertarians to learn that the " miracle " of Germany 's revival was not the result of a conscious rejection of socialism , but was rather an accident of political and social conditions .
There is evidence , too , that the current market economy of Germany is in grave danger of being destroyed by the very people who built it up .
In 1947 , when millions of Germans were starving and living in incredible poverty , and when the full threat of the Morgenthau Plan was upon it , there certainly was no general demand for the free market .
Rather , the popular majority was for what its principal advocate , a socialist party leader by the name of Dr. Agartz , called the " new kind of socialism . "
This called for the ownership and operation of the tools of production by workers under the supervision of government .
It amounted to politically controlled producers ' cooperatives .
But economic control is not possible without political power , and the " new kind of socialism " had to be deferred .
Throughout the postwar period the German political parties concentrated on attacking the occupation powers for the severity of their controls .
To libertarians in this country the German call for freedom sounded like a demand for a free market .
This was not so .
What most Germans meant by freedom was liberation from foreign occupation and , above all , freedom to impose their own controls .
Three Factors
How , then , did Germany happen to stumble on the market economy ?
The answer lies in the political and economic situation of Germany after the war .
Three factors , none of which is ideological , contributed to the establishment of a sort of market system .
The first was the fact that Germany had reached the end of the socialist road .
The socialist system of distribution had completely collapsed and production was almost at a standstill .
There was nothing left to distribute , nothing to be rationed .
The hundreds of thousands of officials who enforced the mass of economic laws — all enacted by the former Reichstag — were perplexed and helpless .
Millions , of whom I was one , depended upon and actually lived by the " black market . "
More and more people became convinced that socialism had to be retracted a step in order to increase production ; the wicked capitalist incentives of profit and ownership had to be temporarily reinstated .
Just as Lenin's New Economic Policy had given Russia a breathing spell for about seven years , so Germany was to have a rest period on her way to the " higher social order . "
The second factor that led to the emergence of a market economy was the presence of a few very astute politicians who molded a new political party — the Christian Democratic Union .
Under the brilliant leadership of Dr. Konrad Adenauer they created a political counterweight to the socialist organization , the Social Democratic Party , which openly advocated Marxian doctrines .
Drawing heavily on the support of the hierarchy of the Catholic Church , they united the opponents of Marxian socialism in a new organization .
They shrewdly opposed the socialists on every major issue .
For instance , they favored decentralization , orientation to the West and , above all , a " social market economy . "
This planned opposition to an old Marxian party paid off in victory at the polls .
But having opposed socialist economic planning for diplomatic reasons they saw no way but partly to realize the campaign promises when they formed the government .
Thus the collapse of the socialist economy and the political maneuvers of a new party fighting for power contributed to the emergence of the market economy .
But the most important causative factor was still another .
The German clamor for freedom was solely directed at the occupation powers .
German freedom meant freedom from foreigners .
To oppose the Allied occupation policies and to criticize Allied actions was a matter of national pride .
But what brand of economic policies did the American , British and French military governments actually conduct ?
In the first place they continued to enforce the existing German legislation and economic controls .
To these they added their own socialistic supplements or interpretations .
For a German politician to oppose the American administration , therefore , meant opposition to American Fair - Dealism in Germany .
To oppose British policies meant opposition to British socialism .
For the German opposition there was no choice but to fight socialism and Fair - Dealism .
And so they bickered and struggled , the Allies for continued economic controls , the Germans for their abolition .
In enumerating the reasons for the existence of a market economy in Germany we must pay homage to a small group of scholars who raised their voices for freedom and free enterprise .
Professor Walter Eucken in Freiburg and three scholars in Geneva , Mainz and Cologne wrote and spoke on the desirability of individual liberty and capitalism .
But their voices were almost drowned out by the thunder of nationalist and socialist slogans .
Only when the market economy was established because of the reasons just described , and when economic freedom was beginning to shower its rich benefits on everybody , did recognition come to them .
Professor Wilhelm Röpke of Geneva became the intellectual spokesman of the new era .
It was mainly through him that the German public became aware of the fundamental changes of policy .
His interpretation of the economic comeback as the inevitable outcome of capitalist policies found increasing acceptance .
Today there exists a German school of political and economic thought for freedom and free enterprise which has its roots in the writings of Professors Röpke , Eucken and others .
Results — without Planning
When the German market economy showed its first miraculous effects nobody could have been more surprised than the Germans themselves .
What a short time ago was merely a dream for the remote future or a difficult project for a five - or ten - year plan was now realized overnight without any government planning at all .
Of course , the socialist politicians immediately began to reinterpret the economic facts .
They hailed as the true reason for recovery the monetary reform which confiscated 95 percent of every citizen 's cash holdings and bank deposits , or the genius of German labor and intellect or many other irrelevant factors .
But they never laid it to capitalism .
The lack of an ideological foundation of capitalism in Germany can clearly be recognized in the procedure by which the economy was finally freed from many of its socialist shackles .
If a libertarian were to face a similar situation he would take great pains to see that the production and distribution of vital necessities were freed from controls first .
In Germany , however , the economic liberation proceeded backwards .
Unessential commodities and services were released first , such as paintings , stamp collections and ashtrays .
Then followed other unessential goods that had vanished from the market .
The consequence of this procedure was the immediate reappearance of nonessential commodities , while all necessities continued to be very scarce .
The Paradox
In the following stage of economic decontrol more and more goods were freed in sequence of their unimportance .
But this process was halted long before the most essential things were reached .
Today the German government still regulates rents , basic raw materials , the distribution of foreign exchange and many agricultural products .
Needless to say , the products still under government control are scarce .
Because of social considerations , for instance , the German government continued to control rents and the allocation of housing while it released stores and other business space on the grounds that businessmen need no protection .
The libertarian can easily guess what happened .
Stores were rebuilt at a rapid rate while houses remained in rubble .
Thus , because the government aimed to " protect " the worker from exploitation , many still dwell in basements .
A typical example of the government welfare paradox !
I do not want to belittle the economic achievements of the German market economy .
No matter how they stumbled upon capitalism , its fruits are real .
But the German economic comeback in spite of the remaining shackles gives us reason to contemplate on what the recovery would have been if the policies had been libertarian throughout .
It is my belief that a libertarian Germany would be well on her way now to becoming the most prosperous nation in the world , next to America .
And even in this comparison a libertarian Germany in the long run would fare well against a Fair - Deal United States .
It is customary to compare the economic prosperity of Germany with that of her European neighbors .
Our yardstick of comparison is the socialist postwar economy of Great Britain , or the present economy of France where 40 percent of the means of production is nationalized outright , and another 30 percent indirectly through the nationalization of the large banks which were the majority stockholders of French industry .
Certainly the German market economy with all its mutilations outpaces its socialist neighbors ; but what could it be if utterly freed ?
Every seventh German is employed by the government or one of its numerous agencies and subsidiaries .
That is to say , the economic welfare of every seventh citizen depends on higher taxation and an ever - increasing sphere of government power .
In recent weeks the union of public servants demanded a 20 percent increase of salaries , on top of several such increases within the past few years .
The new costs to the taxpayer will amount to several billion marks .
More than 30 percent of private consumption is now financed out of means that have gone through public treasuries either in the form of taxes or other levies .
Secretary of Economy , Ludwig Erhard , the world famous inventor of " Professor Erhard 's social market economy , " is about to introduce a new economic bill of his liking , one that would give him power to regulate prices wherever he deems them " unreasonable . "
The bill is to replace a similar provision in the German Police Order which the Bundestag recently revoked against the ardent opposition of Professor Erhard .
This brilliant politician , who certainly is no champion of capitalism , stubbornly clings to foreign exchange control , the most formidable means of government control over the economy .
In a country like Germany , in which a large part of raw materials is imported , every such import and the allocation of the necessary means of exchange must still be authorized by a government office .
And the penal code of West Germany still contains severe penalties for unauthorized trade and foreign exchange dealings .
It appears logical to Professor Erhard to threaten businessmen with severe penalties for " unjustified " price increases and simultaneously to raise the price of agricultural products by way of government restrictions on imports .
In cooperation with the powerful farm pressure group he raised the prices of butter by seven to 10 percent and is about to raise milk prices by 10 to 20 percent .
Sugar prices have been increased until they now exceed world market prices by 40 percent .
Although 380,000 tons of surplus sugar are now stored away , the federal government , according to the International Sugar Agreement , must import 140,000 tons from Cuba and 60,000 tons from Poland .
Egg prices in Germany are 20 to 25 percent higher than in neighboring countries ; those of rye and rye bread , a mere 80 percent .
To raise the prices of provender for cattle and thus benefit the grain farmer , importation has been severely curtailed .
All this for the benefit of the " Bauer . "
The economic mistakes that led to the rise of Hitler during the late twenties and early thirties are being repeated .
It is significant that this kind of policy is ardently defended by the Institute for Trade Cycle Research at the Berlin University , which has been rebuilt largely with American funds .
According to this institute , " it has been established empirically that exports further the national economic growth , but imports impede and curtail it severely . "
Any criticism of this incredible confusion of mind by a few libertarian voices is labeled and disposed of as " ultraliberal . "
Strength of the Unions
Last but not least , we must mention the vast labor union as a powerful task force of socialism .
Out of a total of about 18,000,000 workers and employees , more than 12,000,000 are organized in the Labor Union Federation , which holds a monopolistic position on the labor market .
On all political issues it closely cooperates with the socialist party .
When the government raised the ceiling prices of some rents , dozens of strikes were called and hundreds of rallies and protest demonstrations were organized .
Many German factories were idle during this past summer .
Now the union demands a 12 percent across - the - board increase of wages and many other benefits .
Furthermore , it is clamoring for expansion of the system of " industrial codetermination . "
In West Germany labor union representatives sit on the boards of directors and participate in the management of industrial concerns ; not because of property rights but because of recent " progressive " legislation .
Will the partially free market economy of Germany be allowed to expand ?
Will the handful of libertarian scholars and writers succeed in building a sounder ideological foundation for individual liberty and a free economy ?
The struggle between the forces of liberty and those of socialism continues .
Right now , the libertarian forces seem to be in full retreat , and West Germany is advancing to familiar ground — to socialism .

What ’s this I hear about Republicans tryin ’ to kill progress ?
Have n’t they heard that progress is now a verb , ala Sarah Palin ?
Do n’t they want to progress this great continent ?
Sadly , it seems the Republicans got off the progress bus and onto the propaganda bus .
And we all know that propaganda is n’t American and it most certainly is n’t Republican / Fox News .
A leaked memo reveals what ’s behind the crazies claiming “ they do n’t want no socialized medicine ” at recent Town Halls .
Republicans are coordinating an assault and harassment campaign of Democratic leaders ’
Town
Hall meetings in an effort to kill Health Care Reform and fool lawmakers into believing there is wide - spread opposition to the notion of human beings in a civilized nation being given access to health care .
The right wing is working ( paid for by your tax dollars ) with lobbyist - run groups Freedom Works ( of Teabagging Infamy ) and Americans for Prosperity ( Orwellian names , no ? ) in their national socialist style effort to kill health care reform .
Yes , they ’re even busing people in to the Town Hall meetings , giving them Machiavellian War Tactics to follow .
Heck , maybe the C - Street guys were right about Hitler being a good role model , ‘ cuz this crap would surely do Hitler proud , and we all know what a great proponent of democracy Hitler was :

“ – Artificially Inflate Your Numbers : “ Spread out in the hall and try to be in the front half .
The objective is to put the Rep on the defensive with your questions and follow - up .
The Rep should be made to feel that a majority , and if not , a significant portion of at least the audience , opposes the socialist agenda of Washington . ”
– Be Disruptive Early And Often : “ You need to rock - the - boat early in the Rep ’s presentation , Watch for an opportunity to yell out and challenge the Rep ’s statements early . ”
- Try To “ Rattle Him , ” Not Have An Intelligent Debate : “ The goal is to rattle him , get him off his prepared script and agenda .
If he says something outrageous , stand up and shout out and sit right back down .
Look for these opportunities before he even takes questions ”
NRCC , National Republican Congressional Committee , has endorsed these tactics and proudly crowed the days of civil town halls are now “ over . ” ”
I can only assume the NRCC also endorses the use of the pronoun “ him ” in reference to all of our representatives .
I ’m sure we can forgive the good old boys who brought us glass shoe breaking Sarah Palin as the New Face of Patriarchal Power ( er , “ Feminism ” ) for this teeny , tiny oversight in what amounts to a gross misuse of their power .
Why did the Republicans feel a need to draft a memo telling their paid workers that they should rattle the Democrats to “ make sure there is no intelligent debate ” ?
I should think by now the Democrats , indeed , the nation , are well aware of the inability of the Republicans to engage in an intelligent debate .
No need to rattle us , peeps .
We done plenty rattled after 8 years of the synthetic cowboy and his posse .
While the days of civilized town hall meetings are over , the days of the Republican Clown Show are clearly not even close to over .
Get thee patriotic self to a town hall near theeself soon , take pictures of the Propaganda People , and speak up for your rights .

Jusy sayin’ .
A few LTTE about the Republicans adoration for the good old days , you know , before the Revolutionary War , would n’t hurt , either .
Oh how the Republicans long for the good old days , back when you and I did n’t have – and were n’t even entitled to complain about it — representation .
When the privileged could just do whatever they wanted and tax us without even listening to how we think our tax dollars should be spent .
Sometimes , when you love someone , you just have to say no ; we would n’t want another WMD on the Republican ’s already blood - stained hands and I doubt the MSM will be reporting any of these distasteful facts .

A good American ’s work is never done , it seems .
Michael Jackson , who has been memorialized around the country in events lavish and little , will not be sculptured in butter at the Iowa State Fair next month after all , despite plans announced earlier by the fair ’s leaders .
“ We started hearing concerns from the public that he was n’t an Iowan and did n’t have a connection to the fair , ” said Lori Chappell , the fair ’s marketing director , explaining why organizers ultimately put the question to a public vote .
No such concerns were raised about Tiger Woods or Harry Potter , previous honorees .
And in truth , Ms. Chappell said , the King of Pop and his four brothers did perform at the fair in 1971 .
But apparently the link was too tenuous ( or discomforting ) to a majority of those who cast votes last week in the fair ’s admittedly “ unscientific online poll . ”

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A collection of Andy Warhol paintings valued in the millions of dollars has been stolen from the home of a Los Angeles businessman , police said on Friday .
The stolen works included 10 well - known paintings produced by Warhol in the late 1970s depicting famous athletes .
Among them were boxing great Muhammad Ali , tennis champion Chris Evert , Los Angeles Lakers basketball star Kareem Abdul - Jabbar , Olympic skater Dorothy Hamill and former football star turned “ Trial of the Century ” defendant O.J. Simpson .
The paintings were commissioned by businessman and art collector Richard Weisman and were stolen from his West Los Angeles home , along with a Warhol portrait of Weisman , a Los Angeles Police spokeswoman said .
The spokeswoman said the silk - screen works , which each measure 40 inches square , had been hanging on Weisman ’s dining room walls and that a housekeeper who noticed them missing on September 3 notified police .
Weisman was not home at the time of the burglary and there was no sign of forced entry at the home , police said .
Nothing else was taken by the thieves , who left behind several other Warhol paintings .
A $ 1 million reward has been offered by an anonymous donor for the return of the stolen art .
The Los Angeles Times reported that Weisman , who was friends with Warhol , sometimes lent out the collection , and it was shown in the spring at a benefit exhibit .
Warhol , a leading figure in the pop art movement , died in 1987 .

An Atlanta - based rapper was fatally shot in the valet waiting area of the Beverly Center mall Monday by a suspect who fled in a silver Mercedes SUV , according to police .
Officers later detained a “ person of interest ” as he approached the ticketing area at Los Angeles International Airport armed with a gun .
The shooting occurred about 3:10 p.m. in the parking garage of the popular Westside mall , sending diners in nearby restaurants diving for cover .
Dolla , a rapper whose real name is Roderick Anthony Burton II , was shot in the head as he and several other people stood near the center ’s La Cienega Boulevard entrance , according to police , witnesses and Dolla ’s publicist , Sue Vannasing .
A friend of the rapper ’s who was at the Beverly Center and a Los Angeles Police Department official also confirmed the victim ’s identity to The Times .
Burton , 21 , arrived at LAX from Atlanta earlier in the day and went to the Beverly Center to shop , Vannasing said .
After the shooting , Burton was taken to Cedars - Sinai Medical Center a few blocks from the mall , where he died , police said .

The LAPD has not announced a motive for the attack or identified any suspects .
Detectives are questioning a woman they detained at the scene and a man who allegedly drove from the mall to LAX in a rented silver Mercedes SUV .
About an hour after the shooting , the LAPD issued a bulletin for a 20 - year - old man considered a “ person of interest ” in the shooting .
Los Angeles Airport Police officers spotted a man fitting the description in the ticketing lobby of Terminal 1 .
“ The suspect was detained without incident [ and ] discovered to be armed , ” said Los Angeles World Airports spokeswoman Nancy Castles .
Police later found the Mercedes in an airport parking lot .
LAPD officials , who spoke on the condition that they not be named because of the continuing inquiry , said they are investigating whether the man was trying to get a flight out of L.A .

Burton was an up - and - coming rapper who had recorded several singles .
He was in town to work on his first album , slated to be released this summer on Jive Records , Vannasing said .
His first single , released in 2007 , was “ Who the . . .
Is That ? ”
The killing comes 12 years after another shooting in Los Angeles threw the rap music business into turmoil .
In that case , the rapper Notorious B.I.G. was shot to death outside the Petersen Automotive Museum , about two miles from the scene of Monday ’s killing .
Theories over the motivation for that killing have caused controversy ever since .
The LAPD has not released a narrative of what happened in the mall garage .

But Vannasing said Burton apparently had a dispute with some people , perhaps at the airport .
“ They followed him to the mall because they knew he was coming , ” Vannasing said .
She added that Burton was at the mall with another rapper , D.J. Shabbazz .
Police officials said they could not confirm or deny that account .
Burton was born in Chicago in 1988 and moved with his family to the Los Angeles area and then to Atlanta , according to a biography on his MySpace.com page .
The biography said he witnessed his father commit suicide at age 5 and turned to crime to support his family at 10 .
He began rapping at 12 and formed a group called Da Razkals Cru , according to the biography .

The group impressed rappers P. Diddy and Missy Elliot .
They signed a record contract in 2001 .
But within two years , Burton -- who was modeling for P. Diddy ’s clothing line , Sean John -- began a solo career .
A song of his was included on the soundtrack for the 2006 dance movie “ Step Up . ”
The shooting rattled shoppers and diners .
At a Chipotle restaurant near the valet area , 10 people were eating when the shots rang out .
“ The customers were yelling , ‘ Close the store , close the store , because somebody is shooting !’ ” said Elsa Hernandez , general manager of the restaurant .
The center is normally quite peaceful , said Hernandez , who has worked at the restaurant for six years .

“ This is the first time this has happened here , ” she said .
Newton Cacho , 31 , who works across the street from the Beverly Center , was stunned by the violence .
“ I ’m very surprised something like this happened here .
You come to a nicer part of town and you do n’t expect this , ” Cacho said .
Del Vaughn Walker , 44 , had just left his car with valets and was heading to P.F.
Chang ’s for lunch when he walked by a woman and three men , one of whom was Burton .

There was no sign of an argument .
But moments later he heard two gunshots , then three more .
He ducked and ran into the restaurant .
“ I never would have expected this , ” he said .
“ You would have expected some kind of verbal confrontation . ”

System configuration management is a notoriously difficult task .
Upgrading packages , editing configuration files , and so on ; there will always come a time that it goes wrong .
To mitigate this problem , Eelco Dolstra of Delft University of Technology invented another approach .
He implemented a purely functional package manager called Nix , which means " nothing " in Dutch .
Dolstra began his work on the Nix package manager as a part of his PhD research [ PDF ] at Utrecht University :
We ran the Nix package manager on existing Linux distributions , such as SUSE and Red Hat , parallel to the native package manager of these systems .
Later we implemented a Linux distribution called NixOS on top of it to see if we could manage not only software but a complete system configuration in a functional way .
NixOS was the ultimate empirical validation of a purely functional approach .
This operating system NixOS was the work of Armijn Hemel , who wrote a prototype for his Master 's thesis .
After this success , other developers joined .
There are no official statistics of the number of users , but according to Dolstra the latest release of the Nix Packages collection had 19 contributors .
Imperative versus functional systems
To be able to grasp the basics of NixOS , we first have to distinguish between imperative systems and functional systems .
Traditionally , software packages and configuration data ( / bin and /etc , respectively ) are imperative data structures .
System administrators update them in - place with various administration commands , e.g. a RPM or APT package manager or a configuration tool such as Cfengine .
This is analogous to how imperative programming languages such as C work .
Each configuration action is stateful : it depends on the current state of the system and transforms this state .
This has some fundamental consequences , including :
No traceability : a specific configuration can generally not be recreated from scratch on a pristine system .
That is , there may not be a record of the sequence of configuration actions over time .
So it 's not easy to reproduce a configuration .
No predictability : if a configuration action acts upon an ill - defined state , the end result may be equally ill - defined and thus unpredictable .
No rollbacks : if the user upgrades his system configuration ( e.g. by upgrading a set of packages ) , this is a destructive process and undoing this is hard .
Possible solutions are reverting to a backup or installing previous versions of the packages , but both solutions are error - prone .
In contrast , NixOS uses a functional approach , analogous to functional programming languages like Haskell .
As Dolstra and Hemel state in their paper Purely Functional System Configuration Management [ PDF ] :
In this approach , the static parts of a configuration — software packages , configuration files , control scripts — are built from pure functions , i.e. , the results depend solely on the specified inputs of the function and are immutable .
As a result , realising a system configuration becomes deterministic and reproducible .
Upgrading to a new configuration is mostly atomic and does n't overwrite anything of the old configuration , thus enabling rollbacks .
The functional approach has several advantages :
Traceability : a configuration can be realised deterministically from a formal description and reproduced easily on another machine .
Predictability : realisations of a configuration are not stateful , and hence upgrading a configuration is as safe as installing from scratch .
Rollbacks : configuration changes are not destructive .
As a result , the user is always able to roll back to a previous configuration .
How does NixOS work ?
All this sounds exciting , but is it more than an academic exercise ?
How does NixOS work in practice ?
To put this to the test , your author downloaded the latest ISO of the installation CD .
This CD contains a basic NixOS installation and does n't do any installation preparation .
So the user has to partition and format the drives himself and mount it on the target file system .
The installation procedure is explained in an online manual .
The installation itself is uncommon , already showing signs of the functional nature of the operating system .
The user has to write a description of the configuration to a file on the target file system .
This file contains a ' Nix expression ' that defines the root file system , kernel modules and services .
Fortunately , the user can generate an initial configuration with the command nixos - hardware - scan .
The nixos - install command reads this file and installs the system .
The result is a bare bones Linux distribution with the Nix package management system and the Upstart init system .
The Nix package collection contains about 2200 software packages .
That makes it a rather small distribution , but it is usable , as it contains server software such as Apache and SSH , and desktop software such as X.org 7.4 , KDE 4.2 , parts of Gnome , Firefox and more .
However , the curious user will soon find other signs of the strangeness of this distribution .
In the filesystem layout , for example : there 's no / sbin , /usr / or / lib in the filesystem .
There 's only one symlink in / bin , / bin/sh , because Glibc 's system ( ) function hard codes the location of the shell , as many other programs do .
Even most files in /etc are symlinks .
All this is by design : to be able to work in a purely functional way , all static parts of the NixOS operating system are stored as immutable files in directories under / nix / store .
Each package has a ' Nix expression ' , which is a function that builds and installs this package from source .
The build scripts store the built packages in the Nix store .
Each package is stored in a directory with a name that begins with a 160 - bit cryptographic hash of all inputs involved in building the package , for example 22bharrqlcisnwa11a5qr0xazgvv64hk - firefox - 3.5b4 .
This means that any change to an input value causes the package to be rebuilt in a different path , which has as a side effect that previous versions of the package are left untouched .
Input values include the sources of the package , the build script , any arguments or environment variables passed to the build script , and build time dependencies .
Each package directory contains bin , lib , man , and other sub - directories for the package and is read - only .
The same scheme works for system configuration files and control scripts .
So the system has Nix expressions for sshd_config , to build the Linux kernel , to build initrd , for boot scripts , etc .
There 's also a top - level Nix expression , system.nix , that builds the entire system configuration by calling all expressions .
The output is an activation script that can be executed to make this configuration the current configuration of the system .
For example , it modifies the GRUB boot menu to boot the system with the new configuration .
Previous configurations are retained in the boot menu to roll back .
The nixos - rebuild switch command builds system.nix , makes it the default configuration in the GRUB boot menu and calls the activation script .
By not storing components such as libraries , header files or programs in global locations , all packages are forced at build time to use a specific version of their dependencies , located in the Nix store .
To make this happen , the developers have patched Glibc , GCC and the dynamic linker ld to not search files in any default locations .
So if a dynamic library is not explicitly declared with its full path in an executable , the dynamic linker will not find it .
This also means that if the developer fails to specify a dependency explicitly in the Nix expression language , the package will fail deterministically , even if the dependency already happens to be available in the Nix store .
Advantages and disadvantages
Fortunately the user does n't have to know about the Nix store .
The user does n't have to type / nix / store/22bharrqlcisnwa11a5qr0xazgvv64hk-firefox-3.5b4/bin/ firefox to start their favorite browser .
Nix creates directory trees of symlinks to all activated components and calls them user environments , which also reside in the Nix store .
After each
Nix package action , such as an install or a rollback , a new generation is made , which is a symlink outside the store that points to a user environment in the store .
All generations of a user are grouped together in a profile .
The user 's current profile is pointed to by the symlink ~/.nix - profile .
Putting the directory ~/.nix - profile / bin in the user 's PATH environment variable completes the picture .
As a consequence , non-privileged users can also securely install software .
If a user installs a package that another user has already installed previously , the package wo n't be built or downloaded a second time .
Apart from the obvious advantages of predictability and rollbacks , it 's even possible to copy a package from one machine to another in NixOS .
The command nix - copy - closure copies a Nix store path along with all its dependencies to or from another machine via the ssh protocol .
It does this efficiently , because it does n't copy store paths that are already present on the target machine .
This makes Linux packages literally " portable " .
One major drawback to the functional model is that it requires significant disk space .
This is understandable as each time the user makes a change to his configuration a new package will be added without overwriting the older one .
In the worst case disk space doubles , for example when the C library or compiler is changed , propagating to all other packages .
Even if the user removes a component , Nix does n't actually remove the component from the Nix store , because it might still be in use by another user 's environment or be a dependency of another component .
Moreover , if the component were removed , it would no longer be possible to perform a rollback .
However , the user can always remove any old generations of his profile by nix - env -- remove - generations old and then he can execute a garbage collection of all unneeded components with nix - store -- gc .
If your hardware is not supported out - of - the box , it can be a challenge to write the correct Nix expression to load the firmware .
There 's also no distinction between a stable and an unstable branch , so things tend to break now and then .
Fortunately , a broken system can be rolled back easily .
One final apparent drawback is that the NixOS directory structure does n't comply with the Linux Standard Base .
However , according to Dolstra this is not such a big problem as it seems :
We try to adhere to the LSB as much as possible with respect to /var and /etc and so on .
But the disappearance of / bin , / sbin , / lib and so on is inherent to our system : if we would follow the LSB there , then it would be much more difficult to support multiple software versions and rollbacks .
NixOS was an experiment to see how many difficulties there would be in practice .
It seems that most Unix packages do n't have many hardcoded references to specific paths because they are not identical between different Unix platforms anyway .
And most hardcoded paths can be fixed easily in a Makefile .
The future : declarative specifications of networks
Of course the work on NixOS is ongoing .
The developers are currently working on a branch named modular - nixos to make it easier to extend NixOS with hardware support or system services .
There 's also a research project about distributed deployment .
Dolstra explains this :
As the configuration .nix file in NixOS is essentially a declarative specification of one machine , it would be natural to extend this to networks of machines .
The user would describe then for example that machine X has to run a PostgreSQL database and machine Y an Apache web server .
Based on this specification the user then should be able to automatically install all these machines , or generate virtual machines to test this network locally .
Conclusion
The purely functional model of Nix and the cryptographic hashing scheme of the Nix store give the user some important features that are lacking in most Linux distributions .
It makes one wonder why enterprise Linux distributions have n't picked up this approach ( or a more LSB - compliant version of it ) .
A drawback is the amount of disk space and bandwidth used when upgrading a fundamental dependency .
Perhaps the most pressing issue is that it requires a radically different mindset from the user .
Considering that Wikipedia has reached Top Five world status among Web sites – with more than 330 million users – its annual Wikimania conference , which ended Friday night in Buenos Aires , featured a lot of hand - wringing about all the problems the project faces .
After emerging on the scene less than a decade ago , Wikipedia is facing a slowdown in growth .
Why ?
Are new contributors being scared away ?
Are there too many rules ?
Why are the biggest players in the community overwhelmingly men ?
And white ?
And will Wikipedia ever become a true global phenomenon , as relevant to the lives of people in the third world as it is in the developed world ?
Like a freelancer suddenly overwhelmed with assignments , Wikipedians often found themselves looking back at the sleepy days when they were largely left alone .
Scratch that .
Maybe the better comparison is to the successful journalists who look back to the time when they were so busy they never had time to reflect .
One of the focal points for these questions was a talk by Andrew Lih , author of “ The Wikipedia Revolution , ” on Wikipedia ’s demographic decline and its implications for “ an emergent community . ”
“ Why now ? ” he asked .
“ Because we now have statistics , ” was his answer .
For years , he said , there was so much information about all the changes to Wikipedia articles that it could not be collected , let alone analyzed .
Not any more .
Mr. Lih , who is a professor at the University of Southern California ’s journalism school , shared his talk with Erick Zachte , the Wikimedia Foundation ’s data analyst .
The two proceeded to offer various plots for how the English Wikipedia story could end .
“ We had been saying the sky ’s the limit – infinite growth , ” Mr. Lih said .
“ That ’s kind of silly . ”
Other projected growth patterns , such as no more new articles in a matter of years , he concluded , also may be too severe .
One thing was sure about English - language Wikipedia , he said : the summer of 2007 was its high point in growth in articles and contributors .
After running through a range of projections , including something called the Gartner Hype Cycle , he then offered his own hypothesis .
Growth of English - language Wikipedia would be slowing sharply over the next few years .
He made an analogy to an orchard .
There were the articles that were like fruit on the ground ( say , “ apple ” or “ Africa ” ) that were tackled early in the project .
Slightly more specialized articles quickly followed ( so - called “ low - hanging fruit ” ) .
Finally there are the fruit at the top of the trees , which , after three million articles , are also largely in the bushel basket .
What looked like sharp growth at the start was really Wikipedia collecting all that material , he said .
It could n’t last .
Growth will come from specialized articles , maintenance and news , both events and ideas and products .
“ Human knowledge is always expanding , but not at the same steep rate , ” he said .
The question , he said , was how English Wikipedia dealt with these new circumstances .
It could be , he and others observed , that rules and advice have proliferated as much as the articles without the same benefits .
That as the project matures , it is harder for newcomers to join .
The old methods may no longer be the best .
“ What works for a hamlet or village may not work for a metropolis , ” he said .
While Mr. Lih questioned what lack of growth in contributors and articles says about the long - term viability of the project , Matthew Curinga , a doctoral candidate in the program in Communication , Computing , and Technology in Education at Columbia University , asked what these changes mean for Wikipedia ’s vision of “ radical equality . ”
Looking at the writings of the philosopher Jacques Rancière , Mr. Curinga spoke about how Wikipedia takes concrete steps to “ institute equality . ”
It ’s not simply that anyone is allowed to edit articles , he said , but there are tabs that invite anyone who shows up to edit — its motto is “ the encyclopedia anyone can edit . ”
Recent changes focused on improving the quality may work against equality , he said .
“ Bots , ” programs that make changes on a mass scale , are not accessible to all , since they require programming skills .
As articles include complex tables , people are discouraged from making changes .
And then there are the rules and bureaucracy .
“ What would happen , ” he asked a room of about 20 people , “ if there were no administrators or bureaucrats ?
Would Wikipedia collapse ? ”
“ I think most people think it is important that it be a fine encyclopedia , with high - quality articles , ” he said .
But , he asked , “ would we be willing to live with a little less successful encyclopedia for more freedom ? ”
At Mr. Lih ’s numbers - heavy talk , one woman stood up and said she answered mail to Wikipedia and was struck that people “ have an emotional connection to Wikipedia – we need to sustain it and reproduce it . ”
“ Why do n’t women feel comfortable to contribute ? ” she asked .
Could it be , she asked in Spanish - accented English , “ less women is connected to the fact we are very cold and not as emotionally connected ? ”
Everyone agreed she had a good point and moved on to the next question .

Do n’t know the difference between a beer geek and a beer snob ?
It ’s easy to predict ( think Comic Book Guy ) , but Sam Calagione , founder of Dogfish Head Brewery , gave a pretty good explanation during his salon at Savor this year :
There ’s beer geeks and there ’s beer snobs , and I ’m a card - carrying , dyed - in - the - wool member of the beer geek community .
How I differentiate between a beer geek and a beer snob is this : they could have an equal amount of knowledge about beer ; they could have equally awesome palates ; [ they ] can articulate everything about the qualities of beer ; [ and they can ] tell you the history of brewing styles .
Their knowledge might be the same .
But a beer geek loves beer because he or she loves beer , and they want to learn more always , try new beers , and share that with the people they love .
Whereas beer snobs try to know as much as they can about beer as a power point and to lord it over people , or to stick out as an expert in a field of neophytes .
Later that very night , our “ neophyte ” friend Beth was insulted for mistakenly calling the beer she was trying a “ Malbec . ”
The snob rudely commented , “ That ’s a maibock .
It ’s beer , not wine . ”
The Lagerheads have seen this kind of disdain before and call it The Beer Snob Paradox .
We do n’t get why some beer enthusiasts try to be so exclusive when 97 % of the brewing operations in the United States are small , independent craft breweries , but those breweries ’ combined beer sales only account for about 5 % of the total market share .
It is essential to the livelihood of craft beer that more and more people get turned on to it , and this can only happen with a more welcoming , inclusive attitude from those who claim to be most enthusiastic about the stuff .
It ’s likely that with all the beer happenings in DC this week , you are bound to be unfortuante enough to run into a beer snob or two , depending on whether or not they deem the event worthy of their attendance .
Whether it ’s a story from this week or the past , we hope you will post some first - hand examples of beer elitism in the comments section .
One way to arm yourself against snobbery is to do some cramming .
A little knolwedge goes a long way in the narrow , beady eyes of a beer snob .
The Danish Beer Academy has a beer appreciation guide which serves as an excellent 101 course .
The Lagerheads will be posting useful tips all week and we hope all our fellow beer geeks out there will share some good advice as well .
Original review : March 21 , 2018
Our first visit to the store May 23 , 2016 .
Advertised Memorial Day Sale .
Store associate helpful .
Explained that new customers lay on a series of mattresses to determine a comfort level .
Took us 45 mins to go through the series ... ultimately found our type .
We then spent time with associate determining what mattress brand was suited for us based on need comfort and price .
Decided on BeautyRest Pillowtop $ 1849.00 .
Suckered into buying a $ 249 mattress protector after being told by store associate without one it would void warranty of mattress .
( FYI spoke with manufacturer 10/2017 directly and a cover is not necessary to keep the manufacturer ’s warranty valid ) .
1st mattress delivered promptly on date and time .
However only one delivery person carrying mattress so it was bent in a V coming down my driveway .
Was n’t sure if this was proper and thought odd .
Was n’t going to question delivery man .
I refused the mattress after 1 night of laying in it , ABSOLUTELY DID NOT represent the mattress we laid on in store and it was totally bent in middle with no support .
It feels like a giant marshmallow you ca n’t get out of !
If it felt like that in the store I would n’t have purchased .
Went into store we purchased from , explained how it was delivered , and how it felt like a hammock .
A 2nd mattress was sent immediately .
No questions asked .
Still feels like the 1st mattress .
Absolutely no support in middle despite proper bed frame and supports .
Giant marshmallow .
Was mislead in understanding store 's terms .
Was told by store associate we had a 365 day return period based on mattress style .
When in fact only 21 days in store returns and 120 days for manufacturer returns .
Store would allow us to return despite confusion on time limit however we now had to pay a restock / return fee of $ 149.95 and could only exchange for equal or greater value .
Decided we did n’t want to return junk and get more junk .
Spoke with Simmons / BeautyRest customer service about warranty issues .
Referred me to my warranty booklet , which I never received with my “ new ” mattress .
Customer service said it should have been attached to my new mattress in a plastic cover .
Nope .
They clarified warranty class and ultimately any warranty issues would be done through the retailer , Sleepy's .
No thank you !
Feel likes we got a used mattress .
Now after only 22 months of owning mattress , it has many humps and bumps on both sides .
Have rotated mattress 3 x now , cannot flip .
We sleep head to toe ... not by choice but out of necessity .
Both of our backs are now sore in the morning .
Arms go to sleep and are numb through the night .
We both have gained weight due to lack of sleep and tossing and turning .
Unfortunately it is our only bed and have no other options but to sleep in it ...
I would n’t even give this away !
The White House described Baitullah Mehsud as " a murderous thug "
There are growing indications that Pakistan 's most wanted man , Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud , has been killed by a US missile .
A Mehsud aide reportedly confirmed that he had died when a drone attacked the house where he was staying .
Pakistan 's foreign minister said he was " pretty certain " he was dead , adding that he would be hard to replace .
Taliban leaders have gathered in South Waziristan to choose a successor , local sources have told the BBC .
See a map of the region
Three names are under consideration , says Abdul Hai Kakar , a BBC reporter based in Peshawar .
Hakimullah Mehsud , Maulana Azmatullah and Wali-ur - Rehman were all mentioned as possible successors .
ANALYSIS M Ilyas Khan , BBC News , Islamabad Speculation about whether Baitullah Mehsud is dead or alive is rife across Pakistan - from the mountainous tribal territory of South Waziristan to the capital Islamabad .
But the ambiguity surrounding his reported death may well persist .
Nobody has as yet been willing or able to confirm his demise .
The Taliban have a strategy of blocking traffic to any area where missiles hit , so that the number of casualties and the identities of the dead remain unknown .
They often bury the dead immediately to remove evidence .
Whether he is dead or alive , there are three possible ways of getting some clarity .
Communication intercepts may well pick up some news from key sources ; ground intelligence might yield clues , although the government denies it has sources on the ground ; or the Taliban may announce his death and could even announce his successor .
Where now for Pakistan 's Taliban ?
People living close to the scene of the missile attack in South Waziristan told the BBC Baitullah Mehsud had been killed with his wife early on Wednesday .
The remoteness of the location is contributing to the delay in establishing the facts , the BBC's Orla Guerin reports from Islamabad .
But Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Quresh told the BBC : " I think it 's pretty certain now he 's dead .
" Various government agencies have reported so , his own followers have said so , there are people who 've been to the funeral and are witness to the burial . "
He said Baitullah Mehsud 's apparent death was a " significant development " .
" He had quite a firm grip on various factions ... and there is no other personality who could replace him . "
A spokesman for US President Barack Obama said the US could not confirm the death , but added that " there seems to be a growing consensus among credible observers that he is indeed dead " .
The White House spokesman , Robert Gibbs , described Baitullah Mehsud as " a murderous thug " , and said Pakistani people would be safer if he was dead .
Previous reports of Baitullah Mehsud 's death have proved to be unfounded .
He was said to be suffering from an illness for which he was taking medication .
South Waziristan is a stronghold of the Taliban chief , who has been blamed by Pakistan for a series of suicide bomb attacks in the country .
' Hit on the roof ' Kafayat Ullah , described as an aide to Baitullah Mehsud , told the Associated Press by telephone on Friday that his leader had been killed along with his second wife by a US missile .
He gave no further details .

Tea with Mehsud Profile : Baitullah Mehsud Long war against the Taliban
The missile fired by the US drone hit the home of the Taliban chief 's father - in - law , Malik Ikramuddin , in the Zangarha area , 15 km ( 9 miles ) north - east of Ladha , at around 0100 on Wednesday ( 1900 GMT Tuesday ) .
At the time of the attack , the Taliban leader was said to be on the roof , local people told our Peshawar reporter .
Some who had reportedly seen his body said that it had been half - destroyed by the blast .
Baitullah Mehsud was buried in the nearby village of Nardusai , the witnesses told our reporter .
Several of Baitullah Mehsud 's relatives were also injured , local people told the BBC earlier .
One factor complicating verification of his death is the lack of photographs of the Taliban leader .
When the BBC's Syed Shoaib Hasan went to interview him in South Waziristan in May 2008 , he found himself sitting down before a short , plump , bearded man , reluctant to allow his picture to be taken .
Pakistan 's interior minister , Rehman Malik , told the BBC that even if DNA could be recovered at the scene , the authorities did not have a sample from a male relative of the Taliban leader to compare it with .

No more Leverage until next year . :(
No worries , there are 6 more episodes left and TNT renewed the show for 15 episodes .
Hopefully Sophie will be back by then , but then again , the new character played by Jeri Ryan seems to be a fill - in.
Gina Bellman is / was pregnant , I can't find any relevant information , but I 'm sure that 's why the writers started to phase Sophie out as the season progressed .
She appears once in the beginning where Nate appeals for her to come back .
She does n't come back so we 'll have Tara Carlyle until then .
The development of the episode was very interesting starting from the almost babying of the client by Tara who is posing as a lawyer .
We don ' know she is another grifter until the end , so this is perplexing and a little naive is start with .
The client wanted money some old guy promised for her charity and his lawyer stole it all .
Nate also poses as a lawyer which was fun to watch .
The other characters were in supporting roles as Nate and Tara carried the weight .
The thing I love about this show is that even if certain people are n't feature as much , they also have a moment to shine , and we definitely get that with this episode .
I loved the dialogue between Nate and Tara and I 'm really looking forward to seeing Jeri Ryan again .
Score : 9.3/10
Complexity is insecurity
As I 've been writing code for my Tarsnap online backup service over the past three years , I 've gone out of my way to make it as secure as possible .
I 've written previously about the importance of carefully designing security systems before writing any code , thinking about mathematical proofs - of - correctness while writing code , cryptographic research concerning key derivation functions , and recommendations for using cryptography , all of which have informed my work on tarsnap ; and I 've made the tarsnap client source code available for public review -- after all , I refer to tarsnap as being " Online backups for the truly paranoid " , and nobody who isparanoid would want to download and run code without inspecting the source code and compiling it themselves .
However , there is a very important aspect of tarsnap 's security which I have n't discussed previously : Complexity -- or rather , a lack thereof .
Complexity can be thought of as a type of code smell :
It does n't necessarily imply that there is a problem , but the presence of complexity is very strongly correlated with the presence of security vulnerabilities .
In the design and construction of secure systems , it is important to not only consider mistakes which are guaranteed to cause problems , but to also consider factors which make it more likely that problems will arise -- or , put another way , factors which make it harder to get things right .
The notion of " complexity " is largely subjective , but our intuition serves us well ; as I 'll discuss , there are many factors which can be intuitively seen as constituting " software complexity " and have consequences for software security .
The most obvious such factor is code size .
If you have a fixed rate of bugs per line of code -- and evidence suggests that this is a reasonably accurate approximation -- then a project with twice as many lines of code will have twice as many bugs .
Now , some bugs are harmless , and many harmful bugs are not security flaws ; but there is still a general correlation between code size and security flaws .
Considering adding a new feature to your application ?
Ask yourself not just whether it's worth the time required to implement the feature , but also whether it 's worth the risk of introducing new bugs and security flaws .
A less obvious factor is the number of authors .
One of the most common sources of bugs -- and security flaws -- is miscommunication between developers .
When function A calls function B , which function is responsible for sanity - checking function B's inputs ?
If an object encounters an internal error , should its deconstructor be called during cleanup ?
Are strings NUL - terminated ASCII , or NUL - terminated UTF - 8 ?
Formal methods of software development , wherein functions ' preconditions and postconditions are explicitly spelled out ( in some cases , explicitly enough to be used by machine proof systems ) , are in many cases advantageous more because they avoid such miscommunications than for any other reason .
One oft - cited measure of software complexity is the cyclomatic complexity -- that is , the number of linearly independent cycles in the control flow graph , or roughly speaking , the number of conditional branches in the program .
Where security is concened , there is a slightly more nuanced metric which is more important -- the number of rarely taken conditional branches -- because in any program , the place where bugs are most likely to be hidden is in code which is almost never executed .
There are two reasons for this :
First , having a large number of users provides , in effect , a great deal of fuzz testing , which is likely to uncover bugs in those code paths which are commonly invoked ; and second , as software is continually developed , regions of code which are rarely executed tend to receive far fewer eyeball - hours of attention , with the result that bugs in those regions are also far less likely to be uncovered by code inspection .
It is no coincidence that so many of the security flaws in widely used software such as OpenSSL concern obscure and rarely - used functionality -- the bugs in well - known and widely - used functionality were fixed a long time ago .
( But note that often an attacker can force rarely - used functionality to be invoked , e.g. , by negotiating an obsolete version of a protocol . )
Finally , sometimes people add complexity in the form of deliberate obfuscation .
This too is dangerous :
While it has a slight benefit in slowing down an attacker ( Kerckhoff 's principle aside , disassembling a system and figuring out how it works will always take a non -zero amount of time ) , it has the far larger disadvantage of impeding testing and auditing .
Robert H. Morris once stated that the # 1 rule of cryptanalysis is " look for plaintext " -- because the easiest mistake to make when encrypting something is to accidentally not encrypt it ( or , equivalently , to encrypt data and then use the wrong buffer in the next step ) .
Morris ' rule applies just as much to testing as it does to cryptanalysis :
When you 're testing your code , you 're likely to notice if there is plaintext where there ought to be ciphertext ... but if you decide to " strengthen " a system by adding some extra obfuscation after encrypting , such an error would likely escape unnoticed .
The same applies to other situations where obfuscation might be applied :
In general , if you make it harder for an attacker to figure out what your code is doing , you also make it harder for yourself ( or anyone who is auditing your code ) to notice if your code is n't doing what it is supposed to be doing .
Now , a certain amount of complexity is unavoidable :
Few people will use a program which has absolutely no functionality , no matter how securely it does nothing .
However , being aware of these pitfalls , some steps can be taken to reduce the risk of security flaws :
Keep the amount of code which is heavily exposed to attackers to a minimum .
For example , if you 're going to have a service which works with cryptographically signed requests , sign the request as it appears " on the wire " rather than constructing a signature from a parsed representation -- this way , inauthentic requests can be discarded before they reach your request - parsing code .
In tarsnap , I at one point use a cryptologically " useless " MAC in order to prevent attackers from passing evil data to zlib 's decompression code .

In tarsnap , I at one point use a cryptologically " useless " MAC in order to prevent attackers from passing evil data to zlib 's decompression code .
Design systems which do not use complex data structures on external interfaces .
Two data structures which are notoriously complex -- and consequently difficult to parse securely -- are ASN.1 and XML ; OpenSSL's ASN.1 code has had no less than 8 security vulnerabilities in as many years , and libxml has a similarly poor track record -- not due to any incompetence on the part of the OpenSSL and libxml authors , but simply because both ASN.1 and XML require very complex parsing code .
In tarsnap , when I found that I had to parse XML in order to use Amazon SimpleDB , I ended up writing a parser for a " simplified XML " ; which , while not able to parse all of the complexities of XML , is adequate to parse the XML returned by SimpleDB .
If several people need to work together on the same project , divide the project into independent parts and carefully define -- and document -- the interfaces between them .
Put another way : Conway 's law -- that the design of software systems tends to mirror the communication structures of the organizations producing them -- is not merely descriptive ; it 's also good advice .
In tarsnap , I build heavily on the excellent libarchive archive handling library ; but aside from some very small ( and unavoidable ) modifications to the library , the code I 've written interfaces with the libarchive code only though very clear and well - documented APIs .
When designing protocols , provide as few run-time options as possible .
SSL supports three MAC algorithms , four encryption algorithms , and six key exchange algorithms ... and supports falling back to previous SSL versions .
Of these , only one or two of each are commonly used , while the rest sit unused and largely untested -- yet exposed to any attacker who can find a security flaw .
In tarsnap 's client - server protocol transport layer , there is one MAC algorithm , one encryption algorithm , and one key exchange algorithm -- and every time a tarsnap client connects to the server , every single line of code gets tested .
MAC algorithm , encryption algorithm , and key exchange algorithm -- and every time a tarsnap client connects to the server , every single line of code gets tested .
Eschew obfuscation .
Even if you 're not willing to make your source code public , write your code as if there 's going to be thousands of people reading it and pestering you with emails if anything is unclear .
As far as I am aware , nobody has found any security vulnerabilities in tarsnap .
That 's not saying very much :
There is lots of wildly insecure software in which nobody has found any vulnerabilities , simply because nobody has bothered looking yet .
( I know some people have looked at the tarsnap client source code -- I 've received emails from several tarsnap users commenting on the code structure , the quality of comments in the code , the elegance of certain components , etc. -- but I am not aware of anyone looking at the tarsnap source code specifically with an eye towards finding vulnerabilities . )
Moreover , I 'm not so naive as to believe that I did n't make any mistakes while writing the tarsnap code -- I took my time and worked carefully , but even given that I 'd be surprised if I managed to write 15000 lines of bug - free code .
But whether security vulnerabilities have been found , and whether there are bugs , are the wrong questions to ask .
The right questions to ask are these :
How many bugs are there ; and what is the probability that any one bug would result in a security vulnerability ?
By avoiding complexity when possible , and containing it when it is unavoidable , we can make the answers to those two questions " not many " , and " very low " -- and thereby maximize the probability that the number of security vulnerabilities found remains zero in the future .

The FDIC is struggling mightily to stay solvent .
Given that there are bank failures every Friday , it 's no easy feat for the FDIC to stay ahead of the game .
Please consider Bank of America , Major Banks ’ FDIC Premiums May Top $ 10 Billion .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .’s plan to rebuild its reserves may cost Bank of America Corp. and three of the largest U.S. banks more than $ 10 billion .
Bank of America , the biggest U.S. lender by deposits , may owe $ 3.5 billion under an FDIC proposal that banks prepay three years of premiums , based on the lowest assessment rate multiplied by the bank ’s $ 900 billion in June 30 U.S. deposits .
“ This seems like a very hefty amount , ” said Tim Yeager , a finance professor at the University of Arkansas and former economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis .
“ The FDIC ’s projections of future losses are pretty severe , and they are trying everything they can to avoid tapping the Treasury . ”
U.S. bank premiums range from 12 cents per $ 100 in deposits for the safest lenders to 45 cents for banks the U.S. considers risky , said Chris Cole , senior regulatory counsel for the Independent Community Bankers of America .
The FDIC yesterday proposed asking banks to pay premiums for the fourth quarter and next three years on Dec. 30 .
The fees will raise $ 45 billion .
Based on the current assessment and each bank ’s deposits , Wells Fargo & Co. ’s fee may be $ 3.2 billion based on its $ 814 billion in deposits , JPMorgan Chase & Co. may pay $ 2.4 billion and Citigroup Inc. $ 1.2 billion .
The estimates exclude the FDIC ’s plan to boost the assessment rate by 3 cents per $ 100 in deposits in 2011 or the agency ’s assumption that bank deposits will increase by 5 percent annually .
FDIC Is Bankrupt
Emails from a Bank Owner regarding FDIC
ABO , who as been in the business 30 years , writes :
This will certainly mark the end of the banking model using wholesale funding and aggressive deposits to fund commercial real estate projects .
In other words this is going to come down hard on the FIRE economy .
I have been in banking for over 30 years and from my perspective this is much worse than anything I have seen .
God help us if cap and trade passes !

Is the system fair ?
CHARLOTTE , N.C. -- Carl Edwards may have to forgo a backflip if he wins this weekend at Atlanta Motor Speedway .
The three - time winner at AMS fractured his right foot playing Frisbee on Wednesday .
FoxSports.com first reported the story .
" I know this probably sounds ridiculous to a lot of people and I could hardly believe it myself , " Edwards said in statement .
" I was playing frisbee with a couple of buddies and we both went for the Frisbee at the same time .
I put my foot on it , my friend dove for it , and the next thing you know ... we all heard a pop .
" I knew it was broken and we all kind of looked at each other in disbelief that of all things , I would break my foot playing frisbee . "
Officials at Roush Fenway Racing said Edwards may have to be on crutches this weekend , but that the medical report indicated he would have no problem participating in Saturday night 's Nationwide race or Sunday 's Sprint Cup race .
He said doctors told him he 'll have no problems using the accelerator .
Edwards , who celebrates wins with a backflip from the door of his car , was scheduled to see a specialist in his hometown of Columbia , Mo. , late Thursday afternoon .
Atlanta has been one of Edwards ' best tracks .
He has three wins , six top - 5 and eight top - 10 finishes in 10 starts .
Edwards is winless in 24 Cup starts this season and ranked fifth in points with two races remaining before the Chase field is set .
Meanwhile , he 's turned it up a notch in the Nationwide Series .
His win last weekend in Montreal helped him slice Kyle Busch 's lead in the standings , and Edwards now trails by 192 points .

HAMILTON , Ohio --
A standout Ohio athlete has been ordered
to stay on the sidelines after pleading guilty to felonious assault .
Dwayne " Deejay " Hunter , 19 , was sentenced Thursday to 180
days in jail , 500 hours of community service and five years of
probation .
Among terms of his probation , Hunter cannot play
organized sports -- not even intramurals .
" We 're going to see who Dwayne Hunter the person is , not who Dwayne Hunter the star athlete is , " Butler County Common Pleas Judge Andrew Nastoff said , according to the Cincinnati Enquirer .
" You 're 19 years old .
And you are standing right here , six inches away from a prison number and the potential to go away to prison for eight years -- that 's two presidential terms . "
With credit for time served , Hunter will be released from jail just before Thanksgiving .
He will not serve additional jail time unless he violates any aspect of the conditions of his probation , Nastoff said .
The former Middletown High School football and track star pleaded guilty in July to felonious assault for shooting a 15 - year - old boy twice in the face with a BB gun .
Hunter fired the gun from a vehicle , with one projectile striking the victim 's eyelid , according to the Enquirer .
" You were probably an inch away from blinding someone , " Nastoff told Hunter , according to the newspaper .
Nastoff told Hunter he must get either a full - time job or enroll in full - time schooling within 30 days upon his release from jail .
Hunter had been recruited by the University of Tennessee and Big Ten and Big East schools , but they backed away after Hunter 's legal problems surfaced , according to The Associated Press .
" Virtually every Division I school was interested in him , " Hunter 's attorney , Frank Schiavone , told the Enquirer .
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .
It 's not easy to explain , as an Italian woman , why so many of us continue to admire Silvio Berlusconi .
Why some of us justify his brazen womanising , his appointments of beautiful girls to political office , his absurd macho posturing .
And why others hate him but do n't speak up .
Today 's average Italian woman is a hybrid incomprehensible to foreigners : she 's overdressed , overworked and has the lowest self - esteem in the western world .
If she has a job , she has to work overtime inside and outside the home ( Italian men rarely clean or cook , and spend less time looking after the children ) .
Unwritten laws demand that she is cute , thin , elegant and well made - up .
For Italian men it 's normal to have a wife and a lover , which is why many have been amused by the adventures of the prime minister .
The number of women in positions of power is small ; in politics , almost all owe their status to men .
The fear of being caricatured as a bitter feminist ( who probably has n't got a sex life ) is always strong .
Women who overcome that fear are often ridiculed .
At Corriere della Sera we 've experienced this at first hand .
Last week I wrote an open letter to Italian women .
The paper received an avalanche of comments online .
Virtually all the women shared my anger .
" Finally we 're talking about this , " they wrote .
" We must organise and act . "
But the men , including those on the left , responded differently : " What a lot of hysteria and poison . "
So we are beginning to understand that the battle is not only against Berlusconi .
It 's against our friends , partners , colleagues and bosses .
And if they are sexist , who can blame them ?
For the Italian male , it 's not going too badly .
They can be family men as well as serial playboys ; they can work hard and return to splendidly kept houses ; they can be anti-Berlusconi , yet make jokes about women Berlusconi - style , and whoever gets offended is just a silly woman .
And to enjoy a spectacle of serried ranks of starlets , they can watch the half - naked silent TV showgirls invented by Berlusconi 's channels .
Some 80 % of Italians receive most of their information from Rai and Mediaset which , indirectly or directly , are controlled by the prime minister .
But gradually a small number of women are beginning to ask whether it is time to act and how to do it .
Some , like the political scientist Nadia Urbinati , warn that " the condition and treatment of women holds the mirror up to a country " and want to organise street demonstrations .
Against Silvio and his escort girls ?
It would look ridiculous .
Many women doubt anything can be done , but others see a new awakening .
Perhaps Italian women should use one of their best characteristics : the ability to be real ball - breakers .
If we used this skill in a targeted and determined way , Italian men who have made themselves in Berlusconi 's image would have to change their ways .
So please do n't consider us the sick women of Europe .
At least not yet .
We can do something .
Maria Laura Rodotà is the former editor of Italian women 's magazine Amica and a columnist with Corriere della Sera .
Move over Donovan , here comes Michael .
Michael Vick has signed a 2 year agreement with the Philadelphia Eagles , according to ESPN's Chris Mortensen .
All the speculation has finally come to an end .
Over the past few weeks ,
Vick has been linked to a number of NFL teams including the Bills , the Packers , and the Patriots .
All indications are that he 'll be playing backup to McNabb .
" I pretty much lobbied to get him here , " McNabb said .
" Because everybody deserves a second chance . "
Michael Vick has spent 2 years away from the NFL including 21 months in prison .
He will be able to participate in the last 2 preseason games but will not be able to play in the regular season until at least Week 6 .
For fantasy owners , this raises the question : What to do about Michael Vick .

Norway 's Alexander Rybak won this year 's contest
Eurovision Song Contest organisers say they may ban countries from the competition if broadcasters disclose information about voters ' identities .
It comes after a number of people in Azerbaijan were questioned by police after voting for a song by neighbouring Armenia in this year 's contest .
Phone companies had been responsible for protecting voters ' details , but now broadcasters will shoulder the burden .
Sanctions against offending countries could be a ban of up to three years .
The European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) said the rule change was to ensure the protection of voters ' privacy .
Last month , an Azerbaijani man told the BBC he had been accused of being unpatriotic and a " potential security threat " , after he sent a text backing Armenia 's song , Jan Jan .
' Totally unacceptable '
The country 's authorities said people had merely been invited to explain why they voted for Armenia .
The two states fought over the disputed Nagorno - Karabakh region in the 1990s .
Armenia 's Inga and Anush perform at the Eurovision Song Contest
The EBU 's director general , Jean Reveillon , said violating the privacy of voters " or interrogation of individuals ... is totally unacceptable " .
As it does not have the ability to penalise telephone companies , the body said it would impose sanctions against broadcasters " for any disclosure of information which could be used to identify voters " .
Banning a broadcaster would effectively stop a country from being able to take part .
Norway 's Alexander Rybak won the contest this year , smashing the record for the most points awarded during the competition with 387 .

There 's No Flu Shot for the Thrift Bug
You wanna know what is going on ?
David Rosenberg explains …
“ US consumers are cutting back , and where they are not cutting back , they are scaling down .
This new cycle is all about ‘ getting small ’ and it is deflationary .
For yet another in the litany of signs pointing in the direction of social change towards thrift , have a look at what is transpiring at the upper echelons of the income strata – Now Even Millionaires See the Benefits of Budgeting on page B5 of the Saturday NYT is a must read .
“ Not only are the rich trading down , but the article quotes a high net worth financial advisor who said ‘ many of our clients are very happy to be sitting on bond portfolios and cash reserves . ’
And see the article on page 2 of the Sunday NYT – Beauty Products Lose Some Appeal During Recession .
According to the NPD Research Group , total sales of department store beauty products are down 7 % from year - ago levels .
Women are apparently opting for the ‘ natural look ’ – “ some people are selectively replacing higher - priced items with cheaper products from drug stores and discount stores . ”
Right on , David !
And here ’s the CEO of Pepsico :
“ The age of thrift is here . ”
Even in Japan , after 20 years of coughing and sneezing , people have caught “ the thrift bug , ” says The New York Times .
What ’s a consumer economy need in order to keep growing ?
Uh…it ’s needs consumer spending .
What do consumers need in order to boost spending ?
Uh …they need more money !
Oh , there ’s where it all starts to come apart , does n’t it ?
Where do they get more money ?
They either earn it …or they borrow it .
And right now , they ca n’t earn it – not with 12 % unemployment in California !
Workers have no bargaining power .
And they ca n’t borrow it either .
The banks wo n’t lend – not with the value of their collateral still falling .
Word comes this morning that mortgage delinquencies have hit a new record .
And here ’s a headline warning of worse to come :
“ $ 30 billion home loan time bomb set for 2010 . ”
Even solvent homeowners who are n’t forced into foreclosure still find it beneficial to walk away from their houses .
“ Strategic defaults , ’ says The Los Angeles Times , are becoming a problem for mortgage lenders .
We did n’t read the article .
Instead , we began to think .
What if we owned a house worth $ 200,000 with a $ 300,000 mortgage ?
What would be the smart thing to do ?
Easy … walk away from it .
Then , buy it back at auction !
Desperate consumers do what they have to do .
Canny consumers do what ’s smart .
And now it ’s smart to walk away from any debt that you do n’t actually have to pay .
As for adding more debt , you can gage yourself from the comments above , consumers are not eager to borrow .
They ’ve seen what happens when they go too far into debt .
They ’re older and wiser than they were in the bubble years .
It ’s been 10 years since the tech bubble exploded .
Since then , stock market investors have made nothing – zero .
And now houses are falling too .
So , if a fellow needs money for his retirement , where is he going to get it ?
Not from his house .
Not from a pay raise .
And not from his stocks either .
He needs savings .
He needs real money .
Americans are n’t so stupid after all .
When they need to stop spending , they stop spending .
When they need to save , they save .
Too bad about the economy .
Yes , what is good for individuals seems to be bad for the economy .
When people save instead of spend , the consumer economy stalls .
And then economists think there is something wrong .
They think an economy needs to expand constantly .
And so , they try to find ‘ solutions ’ to the ‘ problem . ’
Actually , there is no problem at all .
It ’s just the way capitalism works .
There are booms .
And there are busts .
Periods of growth … and periods when the mistakes made during the boom are corrected .
There ’s a time for every purpose under heaven .
That ’s the way it works .
The economy breathes in and it breathes out .
And there ’s always some dumb economist trying to smother it with a pillow !
A report from the world ’s biggest bank , HSBC , tells us the dollar ’s days are numbered .
“ The dollar looks awfully like sterling after the First World War , ” said David Bloom , the bank ’s currency chief .
“ The whole picture of risk - reward for emerging market currencies has changed .
It is not so much that they have risen to our standards , it is that we have fallen to theirs .
It used to be that sovereign risk was mainly an emerging market issue but the events of the last year have shown that this is no longer the case .
Look at the UK – debt is racing up to 100 pc of GDP , ” he said
The Telegraph reports :
“ Crucially , China and rising Asia have reached the point where they can no longer keep holding down their currencies to boost exports because this is causing mayhem to their own economies , stoking asset bubbles .
Asia ’s ‘ mercantilist mindset ’ of recent decades is about to be broken by the spectre of an inflation spiral .
“ The policy headache was already becoming clear in the final phase of the global credit boom but the financial crisis temporarily masked the effect .
The pressures will return with a vengeance as these countries roar back to life , leaving the US and other laggards of the old world far behind .
“ A monetary policy of near zero rates – further juiced by quantitative easing – is completely incompatible with circumstances in most of Asia , the Middle East , Latin America , and Africa .
Divorce is inevitable .
The US is expected to hold rates near zero through 2010 to tackle its own crisis .
“ What is occurring is an epochal loss in the relative wealth and economic power of the old G10 bloc of rich countries compared to rising regions of the world .
The euro , yen , sterling , Swiss franc and other mature currencies will be relegated along with the dollar in this great process of rebalancing , but the Greenback will bear the brunt . ”
That said , we repeat a headline from Seeking Alpha :
“ Dollar shorts should look out . ”
We agree with HSBC and the Telegraph : the dollar will probably slide – especially against Asian currencies – for the next few decades .
But that ’s the long term .
In the relatively short term we still face the shock of another leg down of the credit contraction crisis .
Risk is likely to make a comeback .
When that happens – and it could happen in a ‘ Red October ’ – the dollar will seem like a relatively solid refuge .
This is what happened last year .
We would n’t be surprised by a replay of that ‘ flight to safety ’ we saw at the end of last year .
But we know what you ’re thinking : what ?
When did the dollar become a ‘ safe currency ? ’
Of course , it ’s not safe .
But when the end of the world approaches , it will seem safe .
For a while .
Until tomorrow ,

The Daily Reckoning
ONE alleged terrorist charged with planning suicide attacks on Sydney Holsworthy Army Base has refused to stand in court , while another has been granted time to rest after their dramatic arrest this morning .
Nayef El Sayed , 25 , appeared in Melbourne Magistrates '
Court charged with conspiring with others to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act between February 1 and August 4 this year .
El Sayed , who sat behind bullet - proof glass in the dock , refused to stand when asked by Magistrate Peter Reardon , saying through his lawyer that he stood for no man and only to his God .
Earlier , the court heard that an alleged Melbourne terror cell planned to enter a Sydney army base and open fire .
Four men , including El Sayed , have been arrested in Melbourne in relation to the alleged plot .
Another suspect , Saney Aweys , who represented himself in court , said he needed time to rest after being arrested early this morning .
" They put me in a small room , " he said , adding he was told to have a nap with the lights on and federal agents around him .
" I told them I could n’t do it .
I want to put a stop to it now , I want to have a rest . "
In granting an eight - hour extension , Mr Reardon said there was sufficient evidence of an alleged terrorism conspiracy .
The men allegedly planned to use weapons to fire on personnel and bystanders until they themselves were either killed or taken into custody , the court was told .
During a police application for an extension of time to investigate and interview arrested Aweys , Mr Reardon questioned whether the alleged plot was a plan by those involved to become self - proclaimed martyrs .
Prosecutor Nick Robinson SC said that was a correct suggestion .
Mr Reardon said recent terror attacks in Mumbai , Madrid and London had struck at the heart of democratic society and AFP investigators should be allowed to fully investigate such serious allegations .
He said Mr Aweys should be allowed to rest until 6 pm before the investigation into him could continue .
Police are also interviewing a fifth man , 33 , who was already in police custody in relation to other offences .
A 35 - year - old Lakemba man is also helping police with inquiries .
NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione revealed the man was picked up in Sydney this morning .
He has not been charged , is not in custody and his house has not been searched .

He added police had to move this morning because the alleged attack on the base was " imminent " .
" It was likely imminent and that was part of the reason behind moving as we have , " Mr Scipione said .

Mr Scipione said that had the alleged terrorists gained entry to the army base , they would likely have killed many soldiers .
" It was supposed that a number of men would enter into the barracks with automatic weapons to kill as many soldiers as possible , " he said .
Mr Scipione warned the terrorism threat to NSW remained real .
" It would be wrong for us to do anything else but accept that , " he said .
" Complacency is our greatest threat at this time . "
NSW Premier Nathan Rees said police had alerted him and Police Minister Tony Kelly in April about the planned attack .
During the application this afternoon , Australian Federal Police agent David Kinton said investigators had intercepted phone calls and text messages between several men regarding the alleged planned attack on the Holsworthy army base .
Mr Kinton said text messages seized by police involving other people discussed the address of the base and the name of a train station .
The court heard the group had shown a desire to attempt to find a sheik willing to authorise such a violent attack in Australia .
Mr Aweys , who was self - represented , said he needed time to rest after being arrested early this morning .
" They put me in a small room , " he said , adding he was told to have a nap with the lights on and federal agents around him .
" I told them I could n’t do it .
I want to put a stop to it now , I want to have a rest . "
In granting an eight - hour extension , Mr Reardon said there was sufficient evidence of an alleged terrorism conspiracy .
He said recent terror attacks in Mumbai , Madrid and London had struck at the heart of democratic society and AFP investigators should be allowed to fully investigate such serious allegations .
He said Mr Aweys should be allowed to rest until 6 pm before the investigation into him could continue .
Mr Aweys was one of four people arrested this morning after police executed 19 warrants on homes in Melbourne and Colac .
Earlier , Australian Federal Police Acting Chief Commissioner Tony Negus said : " Police will allege that the men were planning to carry out a suicide terrorist attack on a defence establishment within Australia involving an armed assault with automatic weapons .
" The men 's intention was to actually go into the army barracks and to kill as many soldiers as they could before themselves , they were killed .
" Potentially this would have been , if it had been able to be carried out , the most serious terrorist attack on Australian soil . "
About 400 AFP , NSW and Victorian police launched raids at 4.30 am on properties in suburbs in Melbourne 's north , inner-city Carlton and Colac in Victoria 's southwest .
They arrested four men - all Australian citizens aged between 22 and 26 - and are interviewing several others .
Mr Negus said the investigation involved a massive seven - month electronic and physical surveillance operation .
Further investigations were being conducted both in Australia and overseas and more arrests have not been ruled out .
He said the men were seeking a fatwa , or religious ruling , to justify their plot , and it is alleged some of them had travelled to Somalia .
Mr Negus said police believe the men were linked to a group called Al - Shabaab in Somalia and had been supporting the Islamic insurgency there .
Al - Shabaab has been declared a terrorist organisation by the United States .
The counter - terrorism operation , dubbed Operation Neath , involved officers from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation , AFP , Victoria Police , NSW Police and the NSW Crime Commission .
Al - Shabaab , which is using suicide bombers and jihadist fighters in an attempt to overthrow the Somali government , seeks to impose a pure , hardline form of Islam and sees the West as its enemy .
The organisation controls much of southern Somalia , excluding the capital Mogadishu .
The group is led by Sheikh Mohamed Mukhtar Abdirahman " Abu Zubeyr " , but it is believed a core group of senior leaders is responsible for plotting the group 's actions .
Al - Shabaab been declared a terrorist organisation by the US and it has close links with al - Qaeda leaders including Fazul Abdullah Mohammed , an architect of the 1998 attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in which 223 people died .

The U.S. Creeps Closer To A Police State
By Shamus Cooke
29 October , 2009
Countercurrents.org
When word first arrived that the G - 20 would be meeting in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania , activists began organizing protest demonstrations .
Events like this are what freedom of speech is made for .
What better occasion to protest than a meeting of the world ’s 20 top leaders — most of them deservedly hated — where they will be imposing policy on billions of people worldwide ?
The majority of protesters consisted of labor and community groups ; they encountered an army of police … literally .
The New York Times paints an intimidating picture :
“ … the police were out in force , patrolling on bicycles , foot and horseback , by river and by air … protesters trying to march toward the convention center … encountered roaming squads of police officers carrying plastic shields and batons .
The police fired a sound cannon ( a new weapon ) that emitted shrill beeps … then threw tear gas canisters that released clouds of white smoke and stun grenades that exploded with sharp flashes of light . ”
Rubber bullets were used in a separate incident .
And :
“ Riot fences lined the sidewalks .
Police helicopters , gunboats and Humvees darted to and fro .
City officials announced they had up to 1,000 jail cells ready after county officials freed up additional space last week by releasing 300 people who had been arrested on minor probation violations . ” ( September 25 , 2009 ) .
What threat required such a military - like response ?
None was given .
The New York Times article and many like it imply that the mere existence of marching protesters warrants a colossal reaction .
Of course the presence of “ anarchists ” is used to further scare readers into accepting such foolishness , as if this breed of protester is especially lethal ( the vast majority of anarchists are like all protesters — they do not attack the police or anybody else , though some protesters respond aggressively when being confronted with the above mentioned police weapons ) .
The G - 20 police presence is not a terrible surprise to anyone who has attended a legitimate , community - organized protest over the years .
Non-provoked usage of brutal weaponry is becoming commonplace ; the police - enforced use of “ free speech zones ” at protests — small areas surrounded by fences in some cases — is nothing new .
But the staggering police presence at the G - 20 confirms that the stakes have been raised .
Two turning points that deserve special attention — since the mainstream media continues to ignore them — are last years Democratic and Republican National Conventions .
In both cases incredible abuses of police powers were witnessed , with the Republican Convention ( RNC ) showcasing the most extreme cases of state repression .
At the RNC the unlawful tactic of mass arrests were used when , in separate incidents , a public park and bridge were surrounded by police , trapping everyone in the dragnet .
The documentary , Terrorizing Dissent , has excellent footage of both episodes ( www.terrorizingdissent.org).
Police brutality was also a regular occurrence at the RNC — including much unnecessary usage of pepper spray and tasers — while occurring alongside an even more troubling episode .
The group now referred to as the RNC 8 consists of eight community organizers potentially facing years in jail for helping organize protests at the RNC .
The original charge was the Orwellian Conspiracy to Riot in the second degree in Furtherance of Terrorism ( other terrorism - related charges were later added ) .
These terrorism charges were the first ever usage of the Patriot Act toward political activists .
And although the terrorism provisions of the charges have since been dropped , due to public pressure , the attempt to equate terrorism with activism has incredible , non-accidental implications for the future .
When the Patriot Act was first enacted , there was no shortage of writers and activists warning about the potential of misuse .
These predictions have been fully confirmed .
Both the Military Commissions Act and the Patriot Act have created what many believe to be the framework for a full - fledged police state , with the initial flurry of abuses creating a series of dangerous precedents .
One famous precedent is the so - called Telecom scandal , where tele - communication corporations colluded with the Bush - controlled National Security Agency to illegally spy on an unknown number of innocent people .
No one has gone to jail for this .
Indeed , as a Senator , Obama was one of many Democrats who supported Bush ’s telecom immunity bill , which excuses those who broke the law while creating new powers to make spying on Americans legal .
Equally outrageous is the Military Commissions Act , created under Bush to destroy a fundamental democratic right : habeas corpus , or due process .
This right says that the government cannot jail a person unless there is proof of crimes committed , while also giving that person a chance to challenge these charges in a legal court with a jury .
Bush created a separate category of person called an “ enemy combatant , ” which he claimed was too dangerous to be treated constitutionally .
An “ enemy combatant ” can be tried in a military court with secret or no evidence ; or they can be jailed forever without even the symbolic military trial .
Of course , it is only a hop and a skip away for political activists charged with terrorist crimes to be considered “ enemy combatants ” or “ domestic terrorists . ”
Obama continues to uphold Bush ’s destruction of due process .
Obama has said publicly that many so - called enemy combatants held at Guantanamo Bay will be held “ indefinitely ” without being tried for their alleged crimes .
Supposedly , they are “ the worst of the worst . ”
If this is true then evidence should be produced to prove it , since anyone can accuse anybody of the most heinous crimes .
Without evidence , however , such accusations correctly fall on deaf ears .
But no more .
Now , accusations of " terrorist activities " warrant life sentences .
No crime need be committed , only a vague intention — even if such intentions were formed by the suggestions of an FBI informant and are impossible to implement .
The media blares these absurd “ terrorist plots ” as facts , and the rationale behind the destruction of civil liberties is re-enforced .
It must not be forgotten that many of the “ crimes ” Guantanamo Bay inmates are being accused of are merely acts of resistance to the military occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan , something they have every right to do .
The grossly illegal Guantanamo Bay is not being closed down like Obama promised , but moved .
The equally illegal Bagram air base in Afghanistan is getting an upgrade , this according to the Independent :
“ The air base is about to undergo a $ 60 [ million ] ( £ 42 m ) expansion that will double its size , meaning it can house five times as many prisoners as remain at Guantanamo . ” ( February 22 , 2009 ) .
Not only will Bagram continue to be an institution of terror , but also some analysts estimate that there remain 18,000 people held worldwide in foreign U.S. facilities — so - called black sites — with no legal rights .
The absence of even Red Cross observation at these prisons insures that “ harsh interrogations ” ( torture ) will remain a regular habit .
The above abuses of the Patriot Act have trickled down from high - profile terrorism cases ( some who have made confessions under torture ) , to regular usage against alleged gang members , drug dealers and immigrants .
For example , one section of the Patriot Act gives police the power to search people ’s home secretly without notifying the homeowner — called “ sneak and peeks , ” a blatant violation of the Fourth Amendment .
The logic again was that “ special powers ” were needed to track down “ terrorists . ”
The Huffington Post reported , “ Only three of the 763 " sneak - and - peek " requests in fiscal year 2008 involved terrorism cases …
Sixty - five percent were drug cases . ” ( September 23 , 2009 ) .
The illegal entry and searching of immigrant ’s homes — or anyone suspected of being an immigrant -- is widely known by the Latino community and continues to include the terror - inducing tactics of pre-dawn raids with guns drawn .
Once anti-constitutional behavior is applied to alleged terrorists , and extended to immigrants and people suspected of being gang members or drug dealers , such police behavior becomes normalized , and can then be easily expanded to all people accused of being “ criminals . ”
Police are widely known to consider political activists , protesters , and striking workers as criminal types , beliefs encouraged by the mainstream media .
Which brings us to why ?
Why does the destruction of democratic rights that accelerated under Bush continue with Obama ?
With every political " why " question one must first answer : who benefits ?
In this case the benefiting parties are the giant corporations that dominate politics in the U.S.
The people steering these companies had good foresight : they saw that the global capitalist economy necessitated a race to the bottom for workers ' living standards .
As U.S. corporations faced stiffer competition abroad for international markets , wages and benefits for U.S. workers would have to shrink , especially when U.S. corporations were investing heavily in emerging economies — China , India , etc. , — for their slave wages .
U.S. corporate executives also understood that China became a police state out of necessity , so that its dollar - a- day workers could be brought into line ( U.S. corporate investment rose sharply after the Tiananmen Square massacre ) .
The trend of U.S. workers ' wages leads logically to similar conclusions .
The creation of NAFTA to extend the dominance of U.S. corporations to Mexico and Canada would also have predictably negative effects on workers ' living standards .
Now , with two unpopular wars taking place and a third on the way ( Pakistan ) to further extend the profit margins of U.S. corporations , a breaking point is nearing .
Public money is being used to bail out banks and wage foreign wars while the recession continues to destroy jobs and drive down wages .
This unpopular policy is viewed as a necessity for U.S. corporations , and Obama has no intention of reversing course .
The police - state foundation created by Bush and continued under Obama is a stern warning to the U.S. working class to accept our fate or face dire consequences .
It is already a fact that many people are too afraid of police repression to attend a protest , just as some workers are too afraid to be on a picket line during a strike .
Ultimately , a real democracy cannot function where there exists tremendous inequalities in wealth , where large sections of the population are in poverty .
This is why democracies are not viable in poor countries : the super - rich use their power over the state — including dictatorships and mass repression — to crush social movements that challenge the status quo , as we are witnessing today in Honduras .
The same dynamic is being created in the United States , where the vast majority of people are clamoring for real change , while those in the two - party system are using all means available to keep their rotten system in place .

Everyone knows that global variables are bad and should be avoided wherever possible .
Why ?
Because each global variable is , in effect , an implicit argument to every function that can see the global variable .
The same thing is true of any non-local state .
And the presence of non-local state means that you ca n’t reason locally about your code .
That makes your code more complex , and complex code is likely to have more defects .
And the thing I hate about C++ ( and other object - oriented languages ) is that it vigorously encourages non-local state .
Non-local state within classes
First , of all , C++ encourages ( nay , forces ) non-local state within classes , because all class methods have access to all fields within a class , even the ones they do n’t need to .
In other words , every class field is an implicit argument to every class method .
This can work well for , let ’s say , a “ Date ” class , because the number of fields is small , and most class methods will access most fields .
But problems appear when classes grow larger , when they start to look like what would be a whole module in a non-OO language like C .
For example , Nanojit , the compiler core in TraceMonkey , contains a class called Assembler , which encapsulates the translation of Nanojit ’s low - level intermediate representation ( called “ LIR ” ) to assembly code .
If you exclude members that are only included when debugging is enabled , there are 18 data fields and 102 methods .
And some of those 18 data fields are pointers to objects that are themselves complex .
Let ’s consider a single field , _thisfrag , which holds a fragment of LIR code .
It gets set via an argument passed into the method beginAssembly ( ) .
It then gets overwritten — but with the same value ! — via an argument passed into the method assemble ( ) .
It is accessed directly in only 7 of those 103 methods :
assemble ( ) : which increments _thisfrag->compileNbr
gen ( ) , printActivationState ( ) , asmspilli ( ) : which use _ thisfrag -> lirbuf -> names , but only when verbose output is asked - for
assignSavedRegs ( ) , reserveSavedRegs ( ) , assignParamRegs ( ) : where parts of _thisfrag -> lirbuf are read
And that ’s just one example , which I chose because I ’d been thinking about this problem and then just this morning I had to hunt down all those uses of _thisfrag in order to understand its purpose and whether I could change some related code safely .
I ’m sure a similar story will hold for a lot of the fields in this class .
Just imagine , if you were writing Assembler as a C module , would you make _thisfrag a ( module - level ) global variable ?
Almost certainly not , you ’d pass it only to the functions that need it ; actually you ’d probably only pass parts of _thisfrag around .
But C++ encourages you to make everything a class , and stick everything a class ever needs in as a data field , creating lots of non-local state that complicates everything .
( An aside : Assembler probably also is n’t a very good basis for a class because it ’s a * process * .
I figure that if you ’d write something as a struct in C , then it makes for a good class in C ++.
But I need to think about that some more . )
Non-local state beyond classes
But it gets even worse .
Good C++ practice encourages everyone to create private fields and use public get / set methods to access class data fields from outside the class .
But get / set methods are just lipstick on a pig ; all too often you end up with something like this example , again from the Assembler class :
private : AssmError _err ; public : void setError( AssmError e ) { _err = e ; } AssmError error ( ) { return _err ; }
Oh great , I feel much safer now .
It would be better to just make _err public and avoid the get / set obfuscation ; at least then it would be obvious how exposed _err is .
It also saves you from having to check the definitions of error ( ) and setError ( ) .
Even better , in this case _err gets set from various places within class Assembler , but also from various places outside class Assembler .
I ’ve tried twice to simplify this , by passing error codes around explicitly instead of implicitly through this quasi- global variable , but both times I was defeated by the complexity of the control flow governing how _err is accessed , in particular the fact that ’s it ’s set on some control paths but not others .
This is a big part of the reason why out - of - memory handling in Nanojit is a total nightmare .
The end result
Currently Nanojit has a number of large , complex classes , and many of them link to other large complex classes .
At many points in the code there is a bewildering amount of accessible non-local state .
( And I have n’t even mentioned how this can complicate memory management , if you end up with multiple pointers to objects . )
The complexity caused by this is a tax on development that we are all paying daily .
A better way
Before joining Mozilla , I spent three years programming in a functional language called Mercury .
Mercury entirely lacks global variables ( except for some very restricted cases which are rarely used ) .
This means that you have to pass more data around as arguments than you do in C ++.
But it also means that when you look at a function , you know exactly what its inputs and outputs are , and so you can use purely local reasoning to understand what it does .
This is an * enormous * help , and one that ’s easy to underestimate if you have n’t experienced it .
Obviously we ’re not going to rewrite Firefox in a functional language any time soon .
And of course non-local state is necessary sometimes .
But even C is better than C++ in this respect , because at least in C global variables are obvious and everyone knows that you should minimise their use — the language does n’t actively encourage you to put non-local state everywhere and let you feel good about it .
Information hiding is one of the fundamental principles of programming , and object - oriented programming is meant to promote it , but unless you are very disciplined it tends to do the opposite .
So next time you are thinking about adding a field to a class , ask yourself : is it really necessary ?
Could it be passed in as an argument instead , or something else ?
Can you make your life easier by avoiding some non-local state ?
Very rarely does something completely disconnected from my day - to - day existence annoy me so much that I feel the need to say something , but this is something I feel very strongly about .
Robert Fischer wrote a post titled �� �Dear User of My� �Open Source Project��� and many of the� �proggit comments were quite��vicious .
I noticed that some of these commentators seemed to have the same understanding of ���open source��� : that an� �open source project is a product , like any other product , that is simply distributed with its��source code .
Therefore , Robert is clearly creating and releasing ���inferior��� products and this behaviour should be punished .
Being ��open source is not an excuse .
If this is your understanding of ��open source , you have missed the point .
Entirely .
Yes , there are ��open source projects out there that are very well - documented , quite reliable , and have attracted large communities of contributors that tirelessly work to improve every aspect of the software .
But by my count , that seems to be the exception rather than the rule .
Most ��open source projects out there are maintained by just one person who scratched an itch and thought the solution might be useful to others .
Some of these projects might be lucky enough to have a few passionate contributors .
These projects may have some rough edges in their code or their documentation , and perhaps the contributors might be too busy to put on the appropriate polish .
You might think that irresponsible , or even reprehensible .
How dare this person release this garbage and pollute the ��open source community !
News flash : it is these people who drive ��open source software .
Those large , reliable ��open source projects with all of the sparkle and polish ?
They became that way because large groups of people found them useful enough that they decided to invest their time in making the project even better .
But in all cases , for ��open source software to progress , people have to be willing to give up their time and energy for free and with no expectation of reward .�� Open source is driven by pure altruism .
And yes , as a programmer using ��open source software , you may sometimes have to roll up your sleeves , get into the code , and make the changes that you need .
Or perhaps you can find other ways to contribute .
But complaining like a petulant child that it doesn���t serve your particular purpose is , frankly , incredibly rude considering that you were given this software entirely for free and given the power to inspect its��source code and change it to suit your needs .
If that is the way that you ���re going to approach these projects , go use something else .
Like Christmas , the � �true spirit of ��open source is giving .
Edit :
Some one on proggit��rightly pointed out that I ���ve made a common mistake of grouping ���open source��� software with ���free��� software , a subtle distinction that � �this pagefrom the� �FSF makes very clear .
However , I believe that Robert Fischer���s post and his complaints also referred more to ���free��� software than ���open source��� software .
Consider , for example , that he prefers to use the� �WTFPL for his projects , the� �spirit of which is �� �I ���ve decided to put this out here , and you guys can do whatever you ���d like with it .���
This is not to say that all ���open source��� software doesn���t adhere to the values of ���free��� software or that all ���open source��� software necessarily follows the values of ���free��� software .
Windows 7 RC1 does n't expire until June 1 , but we found a catch , and it's a pretty horrible one .
Starting March 1 , it 'll shut down every two hours .

Watch the calendar .
The RC will expire on June 1 , 2010 .
Starting on March 1 , 2010 , your PC will begin shutting down every two hours .
Windows will notify you two weeks before the bi-hourly shutdowns start .
To avoid interruption , you 'll need to install a non-expired version of Windows before March 1 , 2010 .
You 'll also need to install the programs and data that you want to use .

Really ?
Really guys ?
You know , if you wanted us to stop using RC1 on March 1 , it'd be totally fine to just have it expire .
That 's cool .
The trial 's over , time to move on people .
But turning the entire OS into a crippling piece of harassmentware ?
Way to turn something awesome into a huge douchebomb moment for yourselves .
Anybody feeling brave enough to move their clocks up to March 1 to see what happens ?

Can marketers really get inside a consumer 's head to influence the choice they will make ?
For market researcher Clotaire Rapaille , the answer is yes .
He believes all purchasing decisions really lie beyond conscious thinking and emotion and reside at a primal core in human beings .
As chairman of Archetype Discoveries Worldwide , he helps Fortune 500 companies discover the unconscious associations for their products -- the simple " code " -- that will help them sell to consumers : " When you learn a word , whatever it is , ' coffee , ' ' love , ' ' mother , ' there is always a first time .
There 's a first time to learn everything .
The first time you understand , you imprint the meaning of this word ; you create a mental connection that you 're going to keep using the rest of your life . …
So actually every word has a mental highway .
I call that a code , an unconscious code in the brain . "
This interview was conducted on December 15 , 2003 .
Part of my work was in Switzerland , and I was working with children trying to learn French , Italian or German .
And my second discovery at the time was that there 's a different imprint for these different cultures .
What I discovered was that the code for each culture was different .
" Coffee " in Italy does n't mean " coffee " in America .
I mean , if you drink American coffee the way you do , and [ then ] you switch , and instead of American coffee you drink that much coffee , but it 's Italian coffee , you 're dead at the end of the day .
So obviously with the same word , we have a completely different relationship with what the word means , what is behind this word , and so on .
One of my discoveries was that in order to create the first imprint of a word -- when you learn a word , whatever it is , " coffee , " " love , " " mother , " there is always a first time .
There 's a first time to learn everything .
The first time you understand , you imprint the meaning of this word ; you create a mental connection that you 're going to keep using the rest of your life .
And to create this mental connection , you need some emotions .
Without emotion , there is no production of neurotransmitters in the brain , and you do n't create the connection .
So actually every word has a mental highway .
I call that a code , an unconscious code in the brain .
Originally I 'm a child psychiatrist .
I used to work with autistic children , children that do n't speak , and I was just trying to find a cure .
I made several little discoveries of the way the brain functions at the time .
For example , these children are usually quite intelligent -- some kind of " intelligent . "

Washington , D.C. , August 20 , 2009 - As Mexicans debate last week ’s Supreme Court ruling vacating the conviction of 20 men for the Acteal massacre , newly declassified documents from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency describe the Army ’s role in backing paramilitary groups in Chiapas at the time of the killings .
The secret cables confirm reporting about military support for indigenous armed groups carrying out attacks on pro-Zapatista communities in the region and add important new details .
They also revive a question that has lingered for almost 12 years : when will the Army come clean about its role in Acteal ?
Since the brutal attack of December 22 , 1997 , the Mexican government has offered multiple versions of the military ’s involvement in the conflictive Chiapas zone around Acteal .
The problem is the accounts have been incomplete or untrue .
The most important of the DIA documents directly contradicts the official story told about the massacre by the government of then - President Ernesto Zedillo .
In the report issued by the nation ’s Attorney General Jorge Madrazo in 1998 , Libro Blanco Sobre Acteal , the government asserted that “ The Attorney General ’s office has documented the existence of groups of armed civilians in the municipality of Chenalhó , neither organized , created , trained , nor financed by the Mexican Army nor by any other government entity , but whose management and organization respond to an internal logic determined by the confrontation , between and within the communities , with the Zapatista bases of support . ” ( p. 32 , emphasis added )
But in a telegram sent to DIA headquarters in Washington on May 4 , 1999 , the U.S. Defense Attaché Office in Mexico points to “ direct support ” by the Army to armed groups in the highland areas of Chiapas , where the killings took place .
The document describes a clandestine network of “ human intelligence teams , ” created in mid-1994 with approval from then - President Carlos Salinas , working inside Indian communities to gather intelligence information on Zapatista “ sympathizers . ”
In order to promote anti-Zapatista armed groups , the teams provided “ training and protection from arrests by law enforcement agencies and military units patrolling the region . ”
Although the cable was written in 1999 , the attaché took care to point out that Army intelligence officers were overseeing the armed groups in December 1997 .
The document provides details never mentioned in the many declarations of the Mexican Army following the attack .
The human intelligence teams , explains the Defense Attaché Office , “ were composed primarily of young officers in the rank of second and first captain , as well as select sergeants who spoke the regional dialects .
The HUMINT teams were composed of three to four persons , who were assigned to cover select communities for a period of three to four months .
After three months the teams ’ officer members were rotated to a different community in Chiapas .
Concern over the teams ’ safety and security were paramount reasons for the rotations every three months . ”
The Defense Intelligence Agency released the excised documents to the National Security Archive in 2008 in response to a Freedom Information Act request .
( An appeal for additional records is pending . )
The information was compiled by the agency ’s representatives in Mexico , defense attaché officers whose primary task is to gather intelligence on the Mexican armed forces and send it to headquarters in Washington for analysis .
The analysis is then used by the government to assist in crafting national security policy in Mexico .
The agency is the eyes and ears of the U.S. Secretary of Defense abroad : think of it as the Pentagon ’s CIA .
So the “ internal logic ” turns out to be the military ’s , in the form of a carefully planned counterinsurgency strategy that combined civic action programs – frequently trumpeted by the Defense Secretariat in statements to the press – with secret intelligence operations designed to strengthen the paramilitaries and provoke conflict against EZLN supporters .
In the almost twelve years since the massacre human rights groups , journalists and investigators have been able to unearth a smattering of true facts about the slaughter at Acteal , but without the help of official transparency .
Requests for government information made through the Mexican freedom of information law - - such as the ones filed by the National Security Archive last year -- meet a resounding silence .
The Attorney General ’s office helpfully steers the requester to the library to find its 1998 report .
The Interior Ministry responds with a copy of a public communiqué the agency issued five days after the massacre summarizing “ Actions Taken ” in the Acteal case .
The nation ’s intelligence center replies that it has no control over what should be military files , and therefore no documents .
And the Army ?
“ After a meticulous search in the archives of this Secretariat , ” writes the institution to the National Security Archive , emphasis added , “ the requested information was not located . ”
Perhaps even more unsettling than the supposed non-existence of documents in the Defense Secretariat is the response of the Office of the President to requests about Acteal .
The staff of President Felipe Calderón told this requester to look in the Presidential Archives of the General Archive of the Nation for files relevant to the massacre .
We did .
We found many .
They are all located in the section “ Unprocessed Files , ” where letters , telegrams and other forms of complaints from Mexican citizens have languished for years without reply .
The communications that poured in after December 22 , 1997 , from every state in Mexico as well as from international human rights groups and academic institutions contain expressions of anger , despair , and condemnation for the attack .
They also include specific charges made by residents of Chiapas about instances of violence , energy blackouts , and land seizures : potential leads for further investigation by the government into the conflict destroying the region .
The cries for attention sent to the highest mandate in the land went unanswered .
They were routinely tagged as unprocessed files and can be perused today by any researcher who cares to look in the national archives .
Until the current administration decides to honor its obligations to inform its citizens about the truth of the 1997 massacre , the people ’s call for facts will remain lost in the unprocessed files .
And we will be left to rely on the United States for information about the Mexican Army and Acteal .

" You have to behave properly .
And you must n't conceal yourself too well .
If you suddenly appeared close to them and took them by surprise , then they would almost certainly charge . "
A few moments after television viewers heard these words , they saw Sir David Attenborough being cuddled by the very group of mountain gorillas he had just described , lying alongside a huge male silverback , as two young infants inquisitively attempted to remove his shoes .
The iconic sequence , filmed more than 30 years ago in the forests of Rwanda , helped reshape our perceptions of this great ape , and has become a television classic .
It now ranks among Sir David 's most favourite moments making wildlife documentaries , which are being made available to audiences online via the BBC Wildlife Finder .
In the last 30 years things have changed out of all recognition .
We can now film everything
Sir David Attenborough
Other sequences include filming Darwin 's frog in the forests of southern Chile .
A number of males , just a few centimetres long , gather before apparently eating newly fertilised eggs laid by a female .
The males do n't swallow the eggs , however , but store them in their vocal pouches , where the eggs develop into wriggling tadpoles .
The males are effectively " struck dumb " by their own offspring .
Sir David has also chosen his film of the coelacanth , the extremely rare fish that is often described as a living fossil , in part because it was thought to have died out tens of millions of years ago .
He also marks the huge surprises found filming deep under the world 's oceans and even among communities of bacteria .
" The natural world is the greatest source of excitement of visual beauty and intellectual interest of so much that makes life worth living .
" And that 's why I got involved in wildlife film - making in the first place , " Sir David told the BBC .
" When I first started out , there was so much of the natural world we were unable to film .
The cameras , the lighting , the size of the equipment all meant that the extremely small , the very large , the ultra fast , or the infinitesimally slow , were beyond our reach .
" In the last 30 years things have changed out of all recognition .
We can now film everything .
From the giants of the world 's oceans , to the small invertebrates .
" State of the art high - speed cameras let us demonstrate exactly what goes on in some of the natural world 's most dramatic events , lightning fast action that just can't be perceived by the human eye .
" At the other end of the scale , sophisticated time lapse helps us make sense of events that would take too long to show in film .
We are now able to find out and show more about the world 's species , their habitats and how they are adapted to life on our planet than ever before . "
This embrace of new technologies has now been taken a step further , by harnessing the power of the internet to make these iconic sequences available to online audiences , says Sir David .
" And who knows where the lastest HD and 3D technologies will take us .
" It has always been my hope that through filmmaking I can bring the wonder of the natural world into people 's sitting rooms , inspire people to find out more and to care about the world we share . "

Before eating the forbidden fruit , Adam and Eve either knew that disobeying God was evil or they did n’t .
If they did n’t , then they ca n’t be blamed for disobeying him .
If they did , then they already possessed the knowledge that God had forbidden .
Either way , God could not justly banish them from Eden .

The Times published an article explaining that the Orwell books were unauthorized editions that Amazon removed from its Kindle store .
However , Amazon said it would not automatically remove purchased copies of Kindle books if a similar situation arose in the future .
This morning , hundreds of Amazon Kindle owners awoke to discover that books by a certain famous author had mysteriously disappeared from their e-book readers .
These were books that they had bought and paid for — thought they owned .
A screen shot from Amazon.com
But no , apparently the publisher changed its mind about offering an electronic edition , and apparently Amazon , whose business lives and dies by publisher happiness , caved .
It electronically deleted all books by this author from people ’s Kindles and credited their accounts for the price .
This is ugly for all kinds of reasons .
Amazon says that this sort of thing is “ rare , ” but that it can happen at all is unsettling ; we ’ve been taught to believe that e-books are , you know , just like books , only better .
Already , we ’ve learned that they ’re not really like books , in that once we ’re finished reading them , we ca n’t resell or even donate them .
But now we learn that all sales may not even be final .
As one of my readers noted , it ’s like Barnes & Noble sneaking into our homes in the middle of the night , taking some books that we ’ve been reading off our nightstands , and leaving us a check on the coffee table .
You want to know the best part ?
The juicy , plump , dripping irony ?
The author who was the victim of this Big Brotherish plot was none other than George Orwell .
And the books were “ 1984 ” and “ Animal Farm . ”
Scary .
Getting caught file sharing in Finland apparently carries far fewer financial repercussions than in the US .
A man who was found sharing 164 albums ' worth of music ( 768MB ) and had illegally downloaded 1,850 tracks will be forced to pay fines of � 3,000 , or about US $ 4,230 .
Needless to say , that 's a far cry from the penalties handed to American file sharers as of late .
A district court had ruled in February of 2008 that the unnamed man was guilty of various copyright violations and would have to fork over the cash for damages .
During his appeal , the man argued that while he was aware the file sharing took place on his machine , it was n't him who did it ( was it the cat ? ) .
The appeals court in Helsinki , however , did n't buy this excuse and upheld the lower court 's ruling .
� 3,000 is a not - inconsiderable sum , but it 's nothing compared to the $ 675,000 — $ 22,500 per song — a
Boston federal jury recently ordered Joel Tenenbaum to fork over to the RIAA for his piddly 30 songs .
" I 'm thankful that it was n't much bigger , that it was n't millions , " Tenenbaum told Ars after the verdict was announced .
Indeed , it could have been much worse ; Tenenbaum could have been Jammie Thomas - Rasset with her $ 1.92 million fine for sharing 24 songs .
Even the minimum damages in Thomas - Rasset 's case would have run $ 18,000 - - more than four times the fine awarded in Finland for sharing exponentially more music .
Clearly , Finnish copyright law is not set up in a way to severely punish P2P users in the same way that it is in the US .
In fact , the US Department of Justice recently argued that Thomas - Rasset 's damages were not only perfectly constitutional , the law was set up for exactly this purpose — to deter other file sharers with massive , crippling damages so long as they 're not " so severe and oppressive as to be wholly disproportioned to the offense and obviously unreasonable . "
Apparently , $ 1.92 million for sharing 24 songs fails to reach this threshold .
Desalination is a popular source of potable water in Middle Eastern countries , where large energy reserves and the relative scarcity of water suitable for drinking led to desalination in the region accounting for close to 75 % of total world capacity in 2007 .
If that figure has n’t already dropped it almost certainly will as access to clean water becomes an issue for many places around the globe .
And the shortage is n’t just limited to developing countries , with places like California and parts of Australia facing their worst droughts in recorded history .
A new mini-mobile - modular ( M3 ) “ smart ” water desalination and filtration system could help determine the feasibility of desalination in areas that may be considering it for the first time .
Designing and constructing new desalination plants involves the expensive and time - consuming step of creating and testing pilot facilities .
Traditionally , small yet very expensive stationary pilot plants are constructed to determine the feasibility of using available water as a source for a large - scale desalination plant .
The M3 system developed by researchers at the University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science helps cut both the cost and time of desalination plant design and construction by providing an all - in - one mobile testing plant that can be used to test almost any water source .
" The advantages of this type of system are that it can cut costs , and because it is mobile , only one M3 system needs to be built to test multiple sources .
Also , it will give an extensive amount of information that can be used to design the larger - scale desalination plant , " said Alex Bartman , a graduate student on the M3 team .
The system measures water pH , temperature , turbidity and salinity in real - time so it can control a variety or process variables , including the precise measure of chemical additives to condition the water , autonomously .
All the valves are computer - controlled , so the system can adjust itself automatically .
Also , the system ’s software keeps track of how much energy is used and employs various techniques to optimize the system so that it can run with minimum energy consumption .
Although the system is compact enough to be transported in the back of a van , it can generate 6,000 gallons of drinking water per day from the sea or 8,000 to 9,000 gallons per day from brackish groundwater .
This makes the M3 an ideal candidate to be deployed to disaster - ravaged locations to produce fresh water in emergency situations .
The M3 system can also be monitored and operated remotely with the research team envisaging a future where many of these systems are deployed all around the world and their operation monitored from a central location .
The M3 demonstrated its effectiveness in a recent field study in the San Joaquin Valley where agricultural drainage water was nearly saturated with calcium sulfate salts .
With just one reverse osmosis ( RO ) stage the M3 was able to recover 65 percent of the water as drinking water .
This was the first field study of the M3 and the team claims they could potentially recover up to 95 percent using an accelerated chemical demineralization process that was also developed at UCLA .
Currently in Southern California the energy cost of water desalination of seawater remains the most expensive source of potable water , with treatment forming the bulk and conveyance of the water the remainder of the overall energy cost .
This is reversed for the next most expensive source in terms of energy use , water from Northern California .
Although desalination is often seen as energy intensive , desalination of water from brackish groundwater and reclaimed water ends up requiring less than half as much energy than either of these sources .
The UCLA research team hopes to reduce the energy cost of desalination even further and believes systems such as the M3 can help achieve this by helping to accelerate water technology development as well as its adoption .
Check out the vid below to see UCLA ’s Prof. Yoram Cohen discussing the M3 system .

Conservatives long for the world of Leave it to Beaver , Christmas Story , and Babe Ruth .
A world of everyone looking the same , talking the same , eating the same foods , and enjoying the same sports .
Everyone loves Jesus , America , Baseball , and tries to work hard so he can be rich and enjoy well - deserved luxury .
A core belief of this group is that those who are successful and rich deserve to live luxuriously because they are individually and personally responsible , through the making of good choices , for their own prosperity .
And conversely , those who are not successful deserve , to some significant degree , their lower station because they failed to make the correct choices .
Liberals long for the world of Star Trek .
This is a world of equality and exotic diversity , where there ’s no repulsion to being surrounded by people , foods , or ideas that are different than their own .
It ’s a world where money has less value , and where art , science , and exploration are placed as the highest of cultural priorities .
Those who hold this ideal tend to believe that one ’s success or failure , wealth or poverty , depends more on circumstances outside of their control , and thus see the elevation of the underprivileged to be a communal effort that should be willingly funded by those in society who have been fortunate enough to be successful .

Creative Brain : Gene Therapy Trial For Blindness Yields Unexpected Surprise
Even in adults born with extremely impaired sight , the brain can rewire itself to recognize sections of the retina that have been restored by gene therapy .
This surprising adaptability comes a year after three blind volunteers received doses of corrective genes to selected areas of their retinas at Shands at the University of Florida medical center .
More than a year later , tiny portions of the patients ' retinas that have received gene therapy have kept their restored function , as much as 1,000 - fold increases for day vision and 63,000 - fold for night vision .
But in an unexpected finding , scientists writing in the New England Journal of Medicine say the treated parts of the retinas may have acquired enough image - processing strength to rival the retina 's normal center for visual perception , called the fovea , for the brain 's attention .
The discovery suggests that even in adults with mature visual circuitry , the brain can find new ways to process optical information , say researchers with the UF Powell Gene Therapy Center and the Scheie Eye Institute at the University of Pennsylvania .
" When one patient came back for her 12 - month visit , she said she could read the digital clock in her parents ' car with her treated eye — something she was never able to do before , " said William W. Hauswirth , Ph.D. , a professor in the ophthalmology department at the UF College of Medicine .
" That prompted us to measure where her gaze was fixed while looking at a variety of dim targets .
This showed that she now has two preferred centers of vision rather than one , depending on the brightness of the object . "
The new region is more sensitive to light , but it is not as precise as the fovea for making bright images sharp .
" Her brain tells her to use the best part of retina she can , depending on the situation , so she automatically shifts back and forth between the usual region and the region we supplied to her , " said Hauswirth , who is associated with the Powell Gene Therapy Center and the UF Genetics Institute .
The patients have a rare , incurable form of blindness called Leber congenital amaurosis type 2 , the most common cause of blindness in infants and children .
In the type 2 form , photoreceptor cells cannot respond to light because a gene called RPE65 does not properly produce a protein necessary for healthy vision .
In the study led by Samuel G. Jacobson , M.D. , Ph.D. , a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Pennsylvania , and supported by the National Eye Institute , researchers used an apparently harmless virus that already exists in most people to deliver RPE65 to a small area of the retina .
In October 2008 , researchers reported that the study volunteers — one woman and two men ranging from 21 to 24 years old — could see brighter areas and perhaps some images .
In the current New England Journal of Medicine report , scientists say vision in volunteers ' treated eyes remains slightly improved in dim lighting conditions .
But the " excursions of fixation " from the usual focal point of the retina to the treated area nearby in one of the patients was a welcome surprise .
" This finding required her to tell us she was seeing these objects , " Hauswirth said .
" What 's truly astounding is the brain even in an adult is still adaptable enough to learn to use these regions of the retina . "
The viral vectors used to deliver the gene therapy were manufactured by the Powell Gene Therapy Center , directed by Barry J. Byrne , M.D. , Ph.D. , a professor of molecular genetics and the principal investigator for the trial at UF .
" What 's truly been remarkable so far , beyond the gene therapy to the retina , is how well the visual parts of the brain are adapting to the treated eye , " said John G. Flannery , Ph.D. , a professor of vision science , and neurobiology at the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute at the University of California , Berkeley , who did not participate in the research .
" You could almost say the patients ' brains are getting better at paying attention to the gene - therapy treated area , because it is functioning at a higher level . "

I am going to start with re-charging an otherwise working A/C system .
– It has started to short cycle , meaning you can hear the A/C compressor under the hood clicking on for 3 seconds , and then off for 3 or 4 seconds repeatedly .
– It is not cooling well at all .
I have to leave the A/C on full blast for a good 5 minutes on an 80 degree day to get any real cooling in the cabin .
– It is NOT my Porsche , but the process and theory are exactly the same .
Repair and certain diagnostics are a different matter , as this has a capilary tube and accumulator where our cars have an expansion valve and receiver / dryer .
– It is R134a .
If you re still on R - 12 , things are n’t much different other than the refrigerant costing 3 x as much and you need an EPA cert ( $ 20 online ) to purchase it .
It is 83 degrees F outside , with 70 % relative humidity .

It is 83 degrees F outside , with 70 % relative humidity .
The Equipment
# 1 – A manifold gauge set and hoses .
Let ’s not get fancy here – we ’ll just say that your manifold gauges MUST say they are made for the kind of refrigerant your car uses ( you can get away with others if you know what you are doing – we ’re going to cover basics here only ) .
This is an R-134a/R404a/R507 gauge set .
It does NOT have R134a hoses on it .
If it did , they would be the same colors , but have black stripes down them .
# 2 – Hose adapter set .
If you have R134a hoses , you do not need this .
If you do , the set will come with 3 pieces , one for each hose .
All 3 are different ( we ’ll get to that ) .
# 3 – Refrigerant valve for the type of refrigerant you are using ( all refrigerants have different thread types to keep things from getting mixed up )
# 4 – Refrigerant !
HOOKING UP
First you need to determine whether you need adapters or not .
R134a fittings look like this :
They SHOULD have a plastic cover on them that screws on like on a tire valve stem .
The threads are actually INSIDE the R134a fitting , and are not used for service , only to retain the cap .
The outside of the fitting is a snap lock .
The hose end that fits on it looks like this :
There ’s only a few more things you need to know to hook up .
First of all : MAKE SURE THE VALVES ON YOUR MANIFOLD GAUGE ARE CLOSED
The blue hose should be on the left side of your gauge set .
It is attached to the lower pressure “ compound ” gauge which reads both pressure in PSI and vacuum .
The red hose should be attached to the right side of your gauge set .
It reads only PSI , and goes much higher than the low side gauge .
The yellow hose is for charging and vacuuming the system , and will not be used yet .
You need to find the high side service port of your car .
This is easy – it ’s right in front of your face when you open the hood .
( edit for the repost : this is the service port location on an 85/2 and ’ 86 model Porsche 944 )
Optimally , your car is off , and has been sitting long enough to be completely cooled off .
Remove the caps , and attach the red line to the high port , and the blue line to the low port .
For R134a , this is just a matter of pushing them on until they snap , just like an air tool fitting .
If you still have R12 , you will be screwing them on .
Make sure they are hand tight , but do n’t overdo it .
With R134a , you CAN ’T screw this up .
The high side only fits on the high side , and the low side only fits on the low side .
This is NOT the case with R12 , so be sure .
It is also possible to put R134a adapters on the wrong hoses , so if you are using them take care that the high adapter goes on the red hose , and the low adapter goes on the blue hose .
THE STATIC READING
Go check the temperature .
As previously mentioned , it ’s 83 degrees F today .
So that ’s what we ’ll be using .
Both gauges should be showing some kind of pressure if your system was doing any cooling or cycling at all .
If you see nothing , you are totally empty .
There is no need to open either valve on the manifold gauge .
They are not in line between the high pressure host and gauge nor the low pressure hose and gauge .
Here ’s what mine looked like :
That ’s pretty ugly , but at least both the high and low sides show about the same pressure .
If they ’re not close to each other , just stop .
You have another issue and wo n’t be re-charging today .
In my case they are both showing about 80 PSI , and this explains why I ’m not cooling much and why the compressor cycles on and off .
Here ’s why : at 83 degrees , liquid R134a has a static pressure of about 88 PSI .
If I have less than that for a static pressure , it means that there is NO LIQUID REFRIGERANT in the system .
Just enough to be in there as a gas , which is NOT enough to do its job .
How do I know R134a should be at about 88 PSI if its 83 degrees out ?
I could look it up on a chart , or I could just look here :
Yeah …THAT ’s why there ’s all that stuff on the gauge .
The best part is you can use the temperatures for even more stuff than just that .
Now , some other possibilities that could have happened here ( most of which would make me angry ) :
– If the static pressure was 88 PSI :
All that tells me is that there is SOME amount of liquid refrigerant in the system .
Not how much .
A 3000 gallon tanker truck full of R134a will read 88 PSI at 83 degrees , as will a 14 ounce can that you ’ve taken all but 1 / 2 an ounce or so out of .
As long as there is still LIQUID refrigerant , the PSI will have a linear relationship with its temperature .
– If the low side pressure was significantly higher than the high side : I ’d be angry , and not making this post .
There are plenty of things that can do that .
On the truck I ’m charging , it would likely be a clogged capillary tube .
For it to get clogged , there obviously must be something in there to clog it .
There ’s the fun part .
Figuring out what ELSE is broken besides needing to replace the capillary tube .
– The static pressure was the same on both sides , but significantly HIGHER than 88 PSI : Again , mad .
This means your refrigerant is contaminated with something else , generically referred to as “ uncompressible gas ” .
This likely means your in for a full system evacuation and a receiver dryer replacement at a minimum .
CHECKING THE RUNNING PRESSURES
OK , here ’s the fun part .
Make sure you hoses , tools , body parts , cans of refrigerant , etc are all out of the way of anything that will be moving .
Start the car .
Listen for bad noises ( like hissing ) .
None ?
OK … good .
Roll up the windows , close the sunroof , put the A/C on high and the blower on high .
Close the doors .
Go look at your gauges .
In my case , they are swinging wildly as the compressor kicks on and off – but it all makes sense when you look at it .
– When the compressor kicks on , the low side starts dropping ( the compressor is drawing refrigerant into it , compressing it and pushing it out the other side ) , and the high side goes up .
As you can see , our 80 PSI static pressure is now 23 PSI on the low side and over 100 on the high side .
This drop on the low side and increase on the high side continues until the low pressure cut off switch decides its had enough .
The the compressor turns off , and the gauges swing back in the other direction .
Then it turns back on , and this repeats and repeats every 3 to 4 seconds .
Why ?
Because without enough refrigerant in the system , it does n’t make it back to the compressor fast enough to keep it fed full of refrigerant .
And to keep the compressor for burning itself up do to lack of lubrication ( there is oil mixed with the refrigerant ) and cooling ( the refrigerant carries heat away from the compressor ) , the low pressure switch turns it off to protect it .
SETTING UP TO CHARGE
So this system is a good candidate for charging , and we ’re going to do that .
I ’m not going to use a pure R134a , as it just was n’t convenient to pick up .
I grabbed the NAPA brand stuff that includes oil , which is fine by me and pretty convenient for a quickie recharge .
It just changes the process a bit .
So we ’ll go through what needs to be done for this , and discuss the difference later .
– First thing first .
Shake the hell out of the can .
You need to mix the refrigerant and oil .
– Then , get your refrigerant valve .
When it is screwed all the way in , it will be closed , BUT it has a pin sticking down that is used to break the seal on the can , so you need to OPEN the valve almost all of the way .
You do NOT want this pin getting anywhere close to that can seal right now .
– Connect your refrigerant valve to the service line ( yellow hose ) of your manifold gauge set .
If you needed hose adapters for R134a , you will have one that goes on the service line .
– Screw the can of refrigerant onto the valve .
At this point , the valve you are screwing the can on should be open , and both valves on your manifold gauges should still be closed .
– Once everything is all set , CLOSE the valve you put on the can .
All the way .
You will feel some resistance , and you will hear it hiss .
Once it ’s been closed all the way , the seal is all the way punctured , and you can re-open that valve all the way .
At this point , your service line is charged from the can , your high and low lines are charged from your system , and the only thing between the two are the valves on your manifold gauge .
CHARGE !
So with our refrigerant so low ( no liquid refrigerant in the system ) and the types of mix I ’m using ( oil and R134a ) , we need to be slow and careful to start .
The car should still be running , and you should still have the AC on high , fan on high , and the car closed .
Why ?
Just do it .
Stop asking so many questions .
Now SLOWLY open the low side manifold gauge valve .
You ’ll see the pressure shoot up to 80 something , the compressor will kick on , it will get dragged back down , it will happen again , etc .
Let it go SLOWLY ( valve barely open ) for 30 seconds or so .
Now close the valve .
What do you hear ?
Probably still a compressor that is short cycling , but it ’s cycling longer now .
Open up the low side valve a little bit again .
Let in some more .
Slowly .
I like to stop every 20 or 30 seconds and just let it go for 30 seconds or so at this point in the process .
If you do n’t , you might freeze your evaporator .
Also , while I ’m doing this , I ’m rocking the refrigerant can between 12 o’clock and 3 o’clock , favoring the 12 o’clock position .
When I tun off the valve , I ’m giving it a couple of good shakes .
I am NEVER putting the can in a position where liquid refrigerant is going into the line consistently .
You ca n’t compress liquids very much , and your compressor will hate you for making it try to do that .
It ’s called “ slugging ” and it ’s bad , mmmmkay ?
( there will be exceptions to this later , of course )
Keep on going .
Pretty soon – magic – the compressor will turn on and stay on .
You ’re getting there .
Keep on going slowly and watch your low side pressure gauge .
It ’s no longer spiking up to 80 diving back down …. it should be steady in the high 20s or so ( depending on where you low pressure cut off switch is set ) .
We ’re going to keep on going slowly , shaking the can ( you ’ll be feeling it get really cold by now ) , watching the gauges .
You might even need more than one can .
If you do , just close the manifold gauge , close the refrigerant valve , remove the refrigerant can and valve from the service hose , CAREFULLY open the refrigerant valve to release the residual pressure , and follow the original procedure for attaching a can of refrigerant .
You want to be charging at about 30 PSI on the low side at this point .
If you get over that , slow down .
I mentioned the relative humidity before , because here ’s where it matters – I ’m charging slowly because the humidity is so high .
Go faster than this , and you ’ll start getting your evaporator down to 32 degrees F .
When its humid , it ’s going to freeze pretty easily .
This is also why we closed up the doors and windows – we want to let the condensate drain do it job and get as much water out of the air inside the car as possible to avoid freezing up the evaporator .
If either of these things happens , it ’s not the ned of the word , but you ’re going to have to stop and wait for things to thaw before your proceed .
You ’re going to keep on going until you see your low pressure gauge right around 35 PSI , and the high side right around 235 .
For R12 , you ’re looking at about the same on the low side , and about 220 on the high side .
These are n’t exact numbers , but they will get you close .
It ’s beyond the scope of what I can reasonably explain here how you arrive at these and how they change , but , suffice it to say , if its between 70 and 90 degrees outside , this is about right on .
– If your low side pressure goes above 40 ( once you have enough refrigerant in the system to stop cycling ) STOP
– If your high side goes about 250 STOP
– If compressor does n’t stop cycling after putting in about a half a can STOP
THE EXCEPTIONS
Refrigerants are different .
The come packaged pure , or with different things in them .
Read the container .
It will tell you how to use it , but here are some basics you ’ll find .
Pure R134a or R12 : No need for shaking .
No need for tilting .
Can upright at all times .
It gets charged as a gas .
R134a or R12 with oil / sealers / etc : I do n’t like sealers .
It ’s like putting the gunk in your cooling system when your radiator leaks .
It ’s a quick fix , but it ’s not a good idea .
Refrigerant with oil pre-mixed I ’m OK with .
Most tell you to shake the can frequently , and rock is back and forth .
This allows it to be charged primarily as a gas , but with little bits of liquid ( to make sure the oil and sealer gets in there ) .
Go slow with these .
No need to give your compressor a big gulp all at once .
Non-azeotropic blends , mostly R - 12 replacements :
Please just do n’t use these .
Yes , I ’m talking about Freeze - 12 and the like .
Freeze 12 has absolutely no R - 12 in it at all .
“ Non-azeotropic ” basically means that its a blend of different gases that all have different boiling points .
They somewhat mimic what they are supposed to be replacing , in this case R - 12 , but they have things in them like propane .
Yes , propane .
They are charged as a liquid , with the can upside down .
If you charge them as a gas the ratios will be off .
So , you have to be VERY CAREFUL not to slug your compressor while you do this .
And the biggest problem is that they are a one - shot deal .
You can NOT top them off like you can with real R134a or R - 12 .
Because they are a mix of gases with different boiling points , they leak out of the system at different rates .
If you tried to top the system off after using one of these blends , your gas ratios would be all off .
You need to vac the system and start all over again .
So , please …. just do n’t do this .
It ’s a waste of time , a waste of resources , and you wo n’t be happy with the results .
Page Six , which can be found here , completes the first chapter of Automata .
The project itself directly expresses a fairly narrow band of the universe , hopefully enough to make you curious about the rest of it , and how this came to be the state of play .
Usually when we ’re making things here , it ’s about something we like - something we are genuinely interested in investigating .
Automata is n’t really like that .
I do n’t really want to know what their awful world is like , but it is always revealing itself , and it ’s always worse than I would have thought .
One of the worst things is on Page Three , hiding up in an advertisement for the Swangee Corporation : that there are lobotomized robots ( lobotoma ? ) who look just like Carl , but possess none of the higher functions , no personhood , and when he passes them on the street he might not know which is which .
For Lookouts and Automata both , I ’m starting to wonder if I ’m satisfied with the amount of time we can devote to them .
I have devised a few scenarios for their perpetuation , because - to be frank - they deserve more than we ’re prepared to give them .
You may recall that we were invited to co-host an episode of 1 vs 100 Live last Friday , and seeing how they put together an episode was completely fascinating .
If you ’ve ever been out driving on 148th in Redmond , you know that Microsoft has a prodigious number of buildings there , but they are n’t especially demonstrative regarding their purpose , and the mind quickly fills in the gaps .
One building might house illegal birds .
Another feeds a batch of hermetic cryopods , there to ensure corporate continuity .
One building is devoted to exclusively to vats .
The building we went to was very much like ( which is to say , it is ) a fully functioning studio for the manufacture of audio and video .
It was radically unlike any place I have ever been to with a connection to software development - it shares some similarities with a mo-cap studio , but it ’s purpose is much more pure .
There is a widescreen monitor of the game proceedings above the main board , which really cements just how strange the affair of humans producing a digital show is .
When you are there playing at home , pressing one of four buttons to assert yourself on the game system , know that there are at least five people working in real time to make that possible .
They leap and caper in a frenzied state for our amusement .
Chris Cashman , the host , has a different version of the game than players do : it has everything in the base version , but communicates a much broader range of data : number of players ( thirty - two thousand ! ) , full gamercard information for The One , count - downs for his segments , and count - ins to ensure everything is coming together correctly .
There was an issue with the countdown clock later in the show , but even that was exciting , because we had to take it into account on our own .
It was a “ live performance , ” but because it ’s a live performance for digital people who represent real people , there ’s a series of weird disconnects that your consciousness must navigate .
I loved it .
I get fascinated by sparkling things sometimes , things I want to incorporate into my nest , and it cinches a noose around my mind which locks me into a kind of inexorable “ information accrual ” mode .
Scientology is a perennial in this regard , to the extent that I actively avoid information about it because it ’s too fascinating and I do n’t want to join the “ church ” in a moment of weakness .
I recently had the misfortune of being exposed to some propaganda from the “ seduction community , ” and I ’ve spent the weekend on a kind of data bender that has left me psychologically gutted .
I ’ve been trying to navigate away from this page for about an hour now , and I ca n’t do it .
That these people are base manipulators should be apparent to any literate person ; they ’ve made a cage of language that I ca n’t escape from .
( CW ) TB out .
she stirred her straw
The point of this history lesson , of course , is to recall that if you are bogged down in a stalemate , a surprise counterattack can be an overwhelmingly successful tactic to gain the upper hand .
The forces of the status quo continue their fight to prevent real health care reform from taking place , and we pro-reform advocates remain hunkered down trying to defend the public option -- our last tattered shred of hope for change -- from annihilation .
This seems like a good time to see where the opportunities are to counterattack : to throw our foes off balance , hit them where they 're lightly defended and cut off the main thrust of their attack .
To do this , I suggest that we focus not so much on the public option : that defensive line where little movement is occurring .
As it is , health insurers have no disincentive to keep stalling and chipping away , because doing so gives them nothing but upside .
The way to shut them down is to show that stalling the process could hurt them more than it helps them .
We should attack other important strategic targets which have already been neutralized by the forces of the corporatist status quo : health insurance reform , and cost reductions .
The following are some specific ideas about how to counterattack .
1. Remove health insurers ' tort immunity .
A 1974 law called the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ) governs employee benefits in the United States .
An infamous clause in that law referred to as " pre-emption " removes any state law jurisdiction from services covered under ERISA , such as health , life and disability insurance .
Consequently , insurers in these areas are almost entirely immunized from any state regulatory practices .
Lawsuits can still be filed in Federal court , but Federal regulatory laws are utterly inadequate and punitive damages are unavailable .
Thus , a bill designed to codify and protect workers ' benefits became the largest abrogation of civil liability law in American history .
Needless to say , SCOTUS has interpreted these protections for corporations exceedingly broadly .
This protection from lawsuits can be cancelled in two ways .
One , Congress could simply cancel the pre-emption clause in ERISA , opening up insurers to liability under state consumer protection laws again .
This could easily find its way into " medical malpractice reform " being discussed in Congress under the health care bill now .
Two , Congress could institute national consumer protections under which insurers could be sued in Federal courts .
The first option is much easier , and has the advantage that suits in state courts tend to be far cheaper and quicker .
The second would protect people nationwide , and would avoid the phenomenon of insurers picking off state legislatures one by one .
Battle cry : Kill off the private insurance death panels .
2. Cancel the insurers ' anti-trust exemption .
DailyKos ( and Hullabaloo ) writer dday wrote an important diary two days ago informing us of a new bill introduced by John Conyers and Pat Leahy , which would end insurance company exemption from anti-trust enforcement ( originally granted by the McCarran - Ferguson Act of 1945 . )
This is critical , as dday 's diary explains , because insurance company collusion called " market allocation " has allowed them to divide up state markets so that most of them have only one or two dominant insurers in the market .
This plainly anti-competitive practice violates the essence of anti-trust laws , but has been made legal .
It should be made illegal .
Battle cry :
If the opponents of reform insist that competition among private insurers will fix health care , let 's give it to them .
3 . Make health insurers spend our premiums on health care .
The medical loss ratio is the proportion of health insurance company revenue that is spent on providing health care .
It may be regulated by states , which tend to favor this regulatory mechanism because it is easy to measure and administer .
Wall Street also closely watches medical loss ratios , and a company 's stock price depends heavily upon it .
Wendell Potter described , in testimony to Congress , how this works for insurance company executives and their customers ( see heading 2 . )
In 2005 , medical loss ratios for six of the largest health insurers ranged from 77 - 84 % .
Ten years earlier , they were in the high 80's or 90's .
By contrast , Medicare 's administrative costs are reported by the government as 3.6 % ( though conservative critics often cite 5 - 6 % ) and costs under Canada 's single - payer program are 1.3 % ( same link ) .
By contrast , the Bush administration 's effort to privatize Medicare called Medicare Advantage pays between 12 - 17 % more than standard Medicare rates to private insurers to administer a Medicare - plus program .
The pluses are sometimes substantial , sometimes illusory .
An essential feature of reform , both to further cost containment and health insurance regulation , is to limit the money health insurers skim off the top .
I would propose that any private health insurer taking Federal funds maintain a medical loss ratio of at least 90 % , rising to 96 % over ten years .
96 % corresponds to the Medicare administrative overhead , which is slated to diminish in upcoming years as Medicare outlays increase .
Any ownership interest in qualifying companies by non-qualifying insurers would have to be prohibited , to stop the shell company scam .
If private insurers are going to finance care , why should we accept greater inefficiency than government shows ?
Battle cry : Spend health care money on health care .
4 . Give all government sponsored health insurance programs access to the VA drug formulary .
The VA Health System drug formulary is the main source of prescription coverage for veterans using the VA .
It covers many commonly used drugs in all drug classes , but not all of them .
By negotiating aggressively on price , the VA can buy drugs at prices that compare with Canadian provincial systems , which are much lower than other sources in the US .
While any provider or patient in the VA system will complain about the drug formulary , it provides the most benefit for the least cost of any drug program in America .
Dramatic cost savings could be achieved by allowing participating insurers meeting government guidelines to buy drugs from the VA or at VA prices .
While the VA makes its formulary mandatory with defined exceptions , other buyers would not have to follow their practice .
This would strongly incentivize drug manufacturers to compete with each other on price to get on the formulary , and it would further strengthen the VA 's bargaining position to get even lower prices .
This measure would obviously cancel the White House 's agreement with PhRMA not to negotiate on price , but let 's remember that Congress is not bound by that agreement .
Battle cry : Let 's get the best value we can .
***************
Congress is including some important health insurance regulations in the current health care reform bill , such as making pre-existing conditions and rescission illegal .
Some versions also cap out - of - pocket expenses for individuals and families , a critically - important measure .
But these measures are not nearly enough .
The reason we fight so hard for a public option is out of a belief that health insurers are out of control , and need competition .
This is of course true , but they also need more regulation .
A public option is an important ingredient in reform , but I believe we are counting on it too much .
It needs help from other measures that more directly control the private insurers .
The question of how these measures should be incorporated is an open one .
Some can still be included in the health reform bill currently before Congress .
Others should be brought forward in follow - up legislation , perhaps in the next Congress .
The minutiae of tactics around these questions I leave to those much more knowledgeable in the ways of government than I am .
But the idea of advancing the cause by including new , more stringent regulations and more aggressive cost containment measures is IMHO a good one , one we should be pushing on our representatives .
Finally , let 's remember : MacArthur 's brilliant tactical move at Incheon was followed by an over - aggressive push north , which brought in a far more capable and dangerous enemy , China 's People 's Liberation Army .
There followed a bloody stalemate lasting for years , leading to a restoration of the status quo ante with millions of deaths as a bill .
Overreach can be as dangerous as premature capitulation , so we must be smart in how we deploy our resources .

Hoped to make a better way to deal with , eg , reachability analysis .
Question :
Is not - not of this equivalent to standard ?
- not answered yet .
Patrik : Talking with ppl , a little hacking .
Phillip : Trying on Agsy .
Agsy as Test case generator .

Final evaluation discussion about this meeting .
( EDIT room -> moved to 6128 )
Common agreement :
It is better to concentrate the code sprints to the final part of the meeting .
It is difficult to mix lectures and code sprints in the way we did .
Next Meeting 24-30 March ( Wed - Tue ) AWAJI Yumebutai Conference Centre ( http://www.yumebutai.org/english/index.html)
Westin Hotel ( http://www.yumebutai.org/english/guide/stay.html) preliminarily booked .
Will do Announcement to Agda mailing list
Individual summary Makoto : Moved 3 files to one place ....
Maybe CodeSprint should have been topics fixed beforehand .
< Thorsten , Ulf :
The main thing is to talk to ppl .
Get things done is not . >
< Andreas : More contiguous time should be allocated to CodeSprint , like concentrating talks . >
< CodeSprint in the morning ?>
< Talk - day and Sprint - day organization is better .>
Thierry :
Talks were interesting .
Talk - day should come first .
More work on Finite Sets. ( all x0 x1 ... exist i < j . R xi xj ) Noetherian < === > equality is well quasi-order Weak def suited for TT .
Darin : More cabal stuff .
Wouter : Comparison page ( vs Coq ) .
Bruno gave reaction .
Andreas : Implementing Eta-expansion for Mini -Agda , not finished .
Anton : Nealy finishing packaging up interactive IO library .
< Thierry : Mahlo universe ? -> can be put up .>
Thorsten : Worked with Thierry .

Ana : Axiomatization of odd - even adder ( ? ) .
Had the misfortune of talking with Thorsten .
Figuring out how to use using Std library .
< busy with Chalmers business >
< Bengt : going outside Chalmers would be better >
Bengt : Looked at coinduction .
Everyone talks about bisimulation in describing coinduction .
Is it necessary to explain coinduction ?
< Thorsten : No . >
Do n't want final coalgebra , a more naive meaning is wanted .
< Thorsten : bisimulation is simple in Agda . >

11/08/2009 - Finland , the Netherlands and Sweden have the lowest prices for mobile phone calls among OECD countries , according to the latest OECD Communications Outlook .
The highest were found in Canada , Spain and the United States .
Comparing prices on a medium - use basis for a package of 780 voice calls , 600 short texts ( SMS ) , and eight multimedia ( MMS ) messages , the survey found monthly prices ranged from 11 to 53 US dollars across countries as of August 2008 .
The OECD Communications Outlook compares domestic prices across countries for low - , medium - and high - use mobile phone users .
The following tables show annual prices in US dollars broken down by fixed subscription costs , calls and messages :
• Low use ( 360 calls per year of voice calls , 396 SMS ; eight MMS ) :
http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/622303805401
• Medium use : http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/622318882036
• High use ( 1680 calls per year of voice calls : 660 SMS ; 12 MMS ) :
http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/622320081807
The OECD Communications Outlook says between 2006 and 2008 mobile phone call prices fell on average by 21 % for low usage consumers , 28 % for medium usage and by 32 % for subscribers with the highest consumption patterns .
The report adds that text messaging continues to be a particularly lucrative market for operators and that recent marketing developments are increasingly offering SMS - based packages targeted at young subscribers .
The Communications Outlook says the share of telecommunications sector revenue from mobile phone use had reached 41 % in OECD countries by 2008 .
The decline in operators ’ revenue from fixed telephone lines has , however , been slowed by the expansion of high - speed broadband Internet as subscribers usually keep a fixed line to receive the service .
It adds that the agility shown by those telecommunication companies which survived the bursting of the dot - com bubble in 2000 is again serving them well in the current global downturn .
Revenues continue to grow while capital investment is being reduced .

Advertisement Damaged flight recorders have been recovered from a Caspian Airlines plane that crashed in Iran with the loss of all 168 people on board , say officials .
Investigators who scoured scattered body parts and metal fragments for the data recorders hope they will salvage a clue as to the cause of the crash .
The wreckage was spread over a large area of farmland in Qazvin province , 120 km ( 75 miles ) north - west of Tehran .
The Tupolev plane was flying from the Iranian capital to Yerevan in Armenia .
In pictures : Iran plane crash Witnesses said the 22 - year - old Russian - made aircraft , which had 153 passengers and 15 crew , nose - dived from the sky with its tail on fire .
Flight 7908 crashed 16 minutes after take - off from Imam Khomeini International Airport in Tehran , officials said .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad offered his condolences to the bereaved families and ordered a transport ministry investigation into the tragedy .
' Heads , fingers , passports ' Farsi Majidi , head of the investigating committee , told Associated Press TV News : " Thank God , we succeeded in finding two of the three flight data recorders or black boxes .
ANALYSIS
Jon Leyne , BBC News Iran has a notoriously bad air safety record .
Because of sanctions imposed by the United States , Iran relies on an increasingly ageing fleet of airliners , and has trouble buying spares .
There are tales of aircrew buying spare parts on flights to Europe , then sneaking them back to Iran in the cockpit .
While those sanctions do n't apply to aircraft from Russia and Ukraine , many planes from those countries in the Iranian fleet also appear well past their best .
For some people , flying in Iran can be a nerve - wracking experience .
Stepping on board , it often becomes quickly apparent you are in a plane that has done many years service .
There are also frequent delays because of the shortage of aircraft .
Iranian engineers and aircrew do their best to keep their fleets in service .
" Although they are damaged we are hopeful that we can extract information from them . "
Eight members of Iran 's national junior judo team and two coaches were on the flight , heading for training with the Armenian team .
Among the mainly Iranian passengers were about five Armenian citizens and two Georgians .
Search teams picked through an area 200 m ( 660 ft ) wide in a field at Jannatabad village , where the plane gouged out a huge smoking crater .
A relief worker , standing next to a body bag of human flesh , told AFP news agency : " There is not a single piece which can be identified . "
Mostafa Babashahverdi , a local farmer , told Reuters news agency : " We found severed heads , fingers and passports of the passengers . "
Witnesses said the Tu-154 had circled briefly looking for an emergency landing site .
One man described it exploding on impact .
" I saw the plane crashing nose - down .
It hit the ground causing a big explosion .
The impact shook the ground like an earthquake , " Ali Akbar Hashemi told AP news agency .
IRANIAN PLANE CRASHES Feb 2006 : Tupolev crashes in Tehran , kills 29 people Dec 2005 : C - 130 military plane crashes near Tehran , kills 110 Feb 2003 : Iranian military plane crashes , kills all 276 on board Feb 2002 : Tupolev crashes in west Iran , kills all 199 on board
Air disasters timeline At Yerevan 's airport , one woman wept as she said her sister and two nephews , aged six and 11 , had been on the flight .
" What will I do without them ? " said Tina Karapetian , 45 , before collapsing .
It was the third deadly crash of a Tupolev Tu-154 in Iran since 2002 .
The BBC's Jon Leyne says Iran 's civil and military air fleets are made up of elderly aircraft , in poor condition due to their age and lack of maintenance .
Since the Islamic revolution of 1979 , trade embargoes by Western nations have forced Iran to buy mainly Russian - built planes to supplement an existing fleet of Boeings and other American and European models .

The parent companies declined to comment directly on the details of the cease - fire , which was orchestrated in part by Jeff Zucker , the chief executive of NBC Universal , and Gary Ginsberg , an executive vice president who oversees corporate affairs at the News Corporation .
Mr. Olbermann , who is on vacation , said by e-mail message , “ I am party to no deal , ” adding that he would not have been included in any conversations between G.E. and the News Corporation .
Fox News said it would not comment .
Civility was not always the aim of Mr. Olbermann and Mr. O’Reilly , men who , in an industry of thin skins , are both famous for reacting to verbal pinpricks .
Both host 8 p.m. programs on cable news in studios a few blocks apart in Midtown Manhattan .
The conservative - leaning Mr. O’Reilly has turned “ The O’Reilly Factor ” into a profit center for the News Corporation by blitzing his opponents and espousing his opinions unapologetically .
He found his bête noire in the liberal - leaning Mr. Olbermann , the host of MSNBC ’s “ Countdown , ” who saw in Mr. O’Reilly a regenerating target he nicknamed the “ Bill - o the Clown . ”
The 6 - foot - 4 Mr. Olbermann started sniping regularly at the also 6 - foot - 4 Mr. O’Reilly in late 2005 , sometimes making him the subject of the “ Countdown ” segment , the “ Worst Person in the World . ” Mr. O’Reilly was also a stand - in for the perceived offenses of the top-rated Fox News .
By punching up at his higher - rated prey , Mr. Olbermann helped his own third - place cable news show .
“ Honestly , I should send him a check each week , ” he remarked to a reporter three years ago .
Fox noticed .
Mr. Murdoch remarked to Esquire last year that “ Keith Olbermann is trying to make a business out of destroying Bill O’Reilly . ”
Mr. O’Reilly refused to mention his critic by name on the “ Factor , ” deeming him a “ vicious smear merchant , ” but he regularly blamed Mr. Zucker for “ ruining a once - great brand , ” NBC .
In late 2007 , Mr. O’Reilly had a young producer , Jesse Watters , ambush Mr. Immelt and ask about G.E. ’s business in Iran , which is legal , and which includes sales of energy and medical technology .
G.E. says it no longer does business in Iran .

You used to be such a source of innovation !

I am a straight , 71 - year - old grandma who just does n't get the fight against gay marriage !
Sept. 26 — To the Editor :
I am a straight , 71 - year - old grandma who just does n't get the fight against gay marriage !
I have enjoyed the benefits ( and burdens ) of being married nearly 50 years .
For 90 percent of us , it 's been easy .
Fall in love , get a license , find a religious or lay official to say the magic words and ba - da - boom !
For better or worse .
So why can't the gay community enjoy the same process guaranteed them by the Fourteenth Amendment ?
Who does it hurt ?
What does it cost ?
Why deny anyone the right to a legal life together ?
Thus , wise lawmakers of Maine recognized that all of its residents deserved equal , civil rights to marriage .
There is no basis in fact or fairness to deny these rights .
When religion cannot be used as a defense because of the prudent church and state separation , opponents resort to making stuff up to maximize baseless fear and rage among the homophobic .
Kids cannot be hurt learning equal rights , but can be irreparably harmed and permanently tainted by parents preaching prejudice and hate while denying constitutional rights .
My Maine neighbors are good people .
If their family members were attacked for being different , they 'd fight hard for lawful rights for their own .
Gay Americans are our own .
Neighbors , friends , family , coworkers are 10 percent of us .
No vote against them will change that fact , no matter how big the bigotry .
Every voter who opposes gay marriage must ask themselves what they would do if it was their child or aunt or parent or cousin or fellow employee or good friend who was denied the right to marry a loved one .
It 's almost 2010 .
How many more decades and lives do we have to waste before we can all reject intolerance and embrace human rights ?

A 13 - year - old girl who was arrested on suspicion of shoplifting was held in the Dallas County Jail for nearly two weeks without anyone realizing she was underage , the Dallas Morning News reported .
The girl , who Dallas police say gave a false name and birthday , was released on probation before her true age was discovered , the newspaper reported .
" That 's no place for a juvenile to be , " Lt. Andy Harvey said .
" There are adults in there ; that 's why we have places set aside for juveniles . "
The girl told police she was 17 - year - old Michelle Washington and pleaded guilty to the theft charge before a magistrate judge .
But the arresting officer , Senior Cpl. Roberto Garcia , said the girl initially told him she was 14 .
" It is challenging at times , because we speak to so many people out here , and a lot of them do n't have IDs and those kinds of things , and so we have to find ways and be creative a lot of times ( to ) try to get people 's true identities , " Harvey said .
But Assistant Chief Ron Waldrop told the Dallas Morning
News there are " unanswered questions " about why officers did not verify her identity after she gave different ages .
" Everybody believes that should have required an intense level of checking before incarceration , " he said .
An inmate who is an acquaintance of the girl 's family recognized her and contacted the 13 - year - old 's father .
He provided police with a birth certificate and other records that verified her real identity and age .
Her father told the Dallas Morning News that a 13 - year - old does n't belong in jail alongside adults .
" They could have killed her , " he said .
" Something bad could have happened .
She does n't look 17 .
She looks 13 , and I wonder why they did n't see that . "
Dallas police have launched an internal affairs investigation to review the incident .
The girl , who had run away from home , was arrested July 10 at a Target in Old East Dallas .
She and a 20 - year - old woman were allegedly caught smuggling clothes , candy and lingerie out of the North Haskell Street store , according to a police report .
She was released from custody July 23 and is again listed as a runaway .
Sgt. Warren Mitchell told The Associated Press that investigators want to find out if Garcia followed policy and what can be done to prevent the situation from happening again .
Campus Atheist Groups Double in Size in Two Years Share Tweet
September 18 , 2009
( RNS ) --
The number of atheist or agnostic student groups on U.S. campuses has more than doubled in the past two years -- from 80 to 162 -- according to the Secular Student Alliance ( SSA ) , the national organization for the secular student movement .
PZ Myers , an outspoken atheist and associate professor of biology at the University of Minnesota , Morris , suggested the growth could be related to authors saying that it is okay to be " godless . "
Myers , who last year angered Catholics when he publicly tried to desecrate consecrated Communion wafers , writes a blog and often speaks at SSA affiliate group meetings , where he urges students to go public about their unbelief and foster a positive image .
Although SSA has four high school affiliates , most of the groups are on college campuses .
Lyz Liddell , the alliance 's senior campus organizer , noted that college is a time when many people question their beliefs and break away from their religious background .
Facebook groups are used by SSA affiliates to organize events , host discussions and provide an " anonymous way to test the waters " for students who may be starting to change their beliefs , Liddell said .
" Community is the biggest thing that is provided for these students , " said Liddell .
Most of the affiliate groups meet regularly to have discussions , get involved with politics and do service projects .
One group , Students for Freethought at Ohio State University , teamed up with the Coalition for Christian Outreach ( CCO ) , to do service work in New Orleans in March 2009 .
" We have similar worldviews " about service opportunities , said Jonathan Weyer , a CCO staff member who has been working with Students for Freethought on service projects .
The two groups are planning a return trip for March 2010 with 15 students from each group .

SALT LAKE CITY , Aug. 17 , 2009 - University of Utah mathematicians developed a new cloaking method , and it 's unlikely to lead to invisibility cloaks like those used by Harry Potter or Romulan spaceships in " Star Trek . "
Instead , the new method someday might shield submarines from sonar , planes from radar , buildings from earthquakes , and oil rigs and coastal structures from tsunamis .
" We have shown that it is numerically possible to cloak objects of any shape that lie outside the cloaking devices , not just from single - frequency waves , but from actual pulses generated by a multi- frequency source , " says Graeme Milton , senior author of the research and a distinguished professor of mathematics at the University of Utah .
" It 's a brand new method of cloaking , " Milton adds .
" It is two - dimensional , but we believe it can be extended easily to three dimensions , meaning real objects could be cloaked .
It 's called active cloaking , which means it uses devices that actively generate electromagnetic fields rather than being composed of ' metamaterials ' [ exotic metallic substances ] that passively shield objects from passing electromagnetic waves . "
Milton says his previous research involved " just cloaking clusters of small particles , but now we are able to cloak larger objects . "
For example , radar microwaves have wavelengths of about four inches , so Milton says the study shows it is possible to use the method to cloak from radar something 10 times wider , or 40 inches .
That raises hope for cloaking larger objects .
So far , the largest object cloaked from microwaves in actual experiments was an inch - wide copper cylinder .
A study demonstrating the mathematical feasibility of the new cloaking technique - active , broadband , exterior cloaking - was published online today in the journal Optics Express .
A related paper was published online Aug. 14 in Physical Review Letters .
Milton conducted the studies with Fernando Guevara Vasquez and Daniel Onofrei , both of whom are assistant professors - lecturers in mathematics .
The research was funded by the National Science Foundation and the University of Utah .
Cloaking : From Science Fiction to Science
Cloaking involves making an object partly or completely invisible to incoming waves - sound waves , sea waves , and seismic waves , but usually electromagnetic waves such as visible light , microwaves , infrared light , radio and TV waves .
Cloaking things from visible light long has been a staple of science fiction , from invisible Romulan Bird of Prey warships in " Star Trek " to cloaking devices in books , games , films and shows like " Harry Potter , " " Halo , " " Predator , " and " Stargate . "
In recent years , scientists devised and tested various cloaking schemes .
They acknowledge practical optical cloaking for invisibility is many years away .
Experiments so far have been limited to certain wavelengths such as microwaves and infrared light , and every method tried so far has limitations .
Compared with passive cloaking by metamaterials , the new method - which involves generating waves to protect or cloak an object from other waves - can cloak from a broader band of wavelengths , Milton says .
" The problem with metamaterials is that their behavior depends strongly on the frequency you are trying to cloak from , " he adds .
" So it is difficult to obtain broadband cloaking .
Maybe you'd be invisible to red light , but people would see you in blue light . "
Most previous research used interior cloaking , where the cloaking device envelops the cloaked object .
Milton says the new method " is the first active , exterior cloaking " technique : cloaking devices emit signals and sit outside the cloaked object .
Videos Simulate How Cloaking Method Works
The new studies are numerical and theoretical , and show how the cloaking method can work .
" The research simulates on a computer what you should see in an experiment , " Milton says .
" We just do the math and hope other people do the experiments . "
The Physical Review Letters study demonstrates the new cloaking method at a single frequency of electromagnetic waves , while the Optics Express paper demonstrates how it can work broadband , or at a wide range of frequencies .
In Optics Express , the mathematicians demonstrate that three cloaking devices together create a " quiet zone " so that " objects placed within this region are virtually invisible " to incoming waves .
Guevara Vasquez created short videos of mathematical simulations showing a pulse of electromagnetic or sound waves rolling past an object :
In one video , with the kite - shaped object uncloaked , the wave clearly interacts with the object , creating expanding , circular ripples like when a rock is thrown in a pond .
In the second video , the object is surrounded by three point - like cloaking devices , each of which emits waves that only propagate a short distance .
Those points and their emissions resemble purple sea urchins .
As the passing waves roll by the cloaking devices , waves emitted by those devices interfere with the passing waves .
As a result , the passing waves do not hit the cloaked object and there are no ripples .
Milton says the cloaking devices cause " destructive interference , " which occurs when two pebbles are thrown in a pond .
In places where wave crests meet , the waves add up and the crests are taller .
Where troughs meet , the troughs are deeper .
But where crests cross troughs , the water is still because they cancel each other out .
The principle , applied to sound waves , is " sort of like noise cancelation devices you get with headphones in airplanes if you travel first class , " Milton says .
Protecting from Destructive Seismic and Tsunami Waves
" We proved mathematically that this method works when the wavelength of incoming electromagnetic radiation is large compared with the objects being cloaked , meaning it can cloak very small objects , " Milton says .
" It also can cloak larger objects . "
Because visible light has tiny wavelengths , only microscopic objects could be made invisible by the new method .
" The cloaking device would have to generate fields that have very small wavelengths , " Milton says .
" It is very difficult to build antennas the size of light waves .
We 're so far from cloaking real - sized objects to visible light that it 's incredible . "
But imagine incoming waves as water waves , and envision breakwater cloaking devices that would generate waves to create a quiet zone that would protect oil rigs or specific coastal structures against incoming tsunami waves .
Or imagine cloaking devices around buildings to generate vibrations to neutralize incoming seismic waves .
" Our method may have application to water waves , sound and microwaves [ radar ] , " including shielding submarines and planes from sonar and radar , respectively , and protecting structures from seismic waves during earthquakes and water waves during tsunamis , Milton says .
All those waves have wavelengths much larger than those of visible light , so the possible applications should be easier to develop .
" It would be wonderful if you could cloak buildings against earthquakes , " Milton says .
" That 's on the borderline of what 's possible . "
The new method 's main disadvantage " is that it appears you must know in advance everything about the incoming wave , " including when the pulse begins , and the frequencies and amplitudes of the waves within the pulse , Milton says .
That might require placement of numerous sensors to detect incoming seismic waves or tsunamis .
" Even though cloaking from light is probably impossible , it 's a fascinating subject , and there is beautiful mathematics behind it , " Milton says .
" The whole area has exploded .
So even if it 's not going to result in a ' Harry Potter ' cloak , it will have spinoffs in other directions , " not only in protecting objects from waves of various sorts , but " for building new types of antennas , being able to see things on a molecular scale .
It 's sort of a renaissance in classical science , with new ideas popping up all the time . "

From cave paintings it is believed that the equid from which modern horses are derived resemble the modern Przewalski Horse .
The large strong heads and erect manes depicted in these paintings bear a striking resemblance to this modern breed .
The first domestication of the horses was probably in the steppes of central Asia between 3000 and 4000 B.C.
These first animals were kept for meat and milk .
As early man became more mobile undoubtedly horses began to be used as pack animals .
Oxen were being used in the Middle East at approximately 4000 B.C. for plowing .
Progressively they were used on sleds , which were eventually mounted on rollers , with the final evolution of wheels .
Early in the 3rd millennium B.C. there is archeological evidence that vehicles drawn by equid , generally onagers or ass hybrids , were being used in warfare .
As horses from the north became more numerous the carts moved to the familiar two - wheeled chariot with spoked wheels .
Due to his greater speed the horse rapidly replaced other equid as harness animals .

It will take years before there are enough electric cars and gas–electric hybrids on the road to put much of a dent in the output of the electrical grid .
But once they do roll out en masse , these vehicles ( and their drivers ) will have to be smart about when they recharge so that utilities can avoid spikes in grid demand and drivers can avoid spikes in their electric bills .
This puts carmakers and utility companies on the spot to develop a uniform technology that lets cars communicate with the grid , and vice versa .
Ideally , drivers will be able to program the start time for charging , the rate they want to pay , and the time needed to complete charging , says Nancy Gioia , Ford Motor Co. 's director of Sustainable Mobility Technologies and Hybrid Vehicle Programs .
" As electric vehicles hit the road , you need to predict what technology you need to have out there to be able to use the extra capacity in the system at off - peak hours , " she adds .
A common scenario depicting how so - called " smart charging " will work : Electric vehicle ( EV ) drivers return home from work in the evening after having used some portion of the battery charge during the day .
They plug into an outlet ( most likely in their garage , if they have one ) and use in - car controls to set a timer that dictates the period when the battery actually draws juice for its recharge .
If drivers get home at 6 P.M. , for example , they might want to wait until 9 P.M. to avoid overburdening the electric grid — and possibly to get a better price for the electricity .
" The reason we want to have vehicles talking to utilities is primarily so we can make sure that we do n't make any peak loads worse than they are today , " says Britta Gross , General Motors 's manager of Hydrogen and Electrical Infrastructure Development .
Utilities do not want EVs adding significantly to peak demands , she adds , because the peak defines how many more power - generation plants utilities have to build .
" Some utilities will have very advanced technology in homes , but others wo n't for some time to come , " Gross says .
" We have to make sure the vehicle works in that sort of broadly defined environment . "
Although GM's OnStar in - car communication service seems well suited to become a part of any smart - charging system that must connect with utility companies , Gross points out , " we have n't talked about is how this relates with OnStar . "
OnStar is like a help desk for drivers , using Global Positioning System ( GPS ) satellite and cellular technology to connect both the vehicle and driver to accident assistance operators , driving directions and other services , wherever they are .
" Everyone is in agreement with what the physical connector will look like , but until we have common standards , " she says , " it does n't make sense to go too far down the road . "
Ford , on the other hand , expects its SYNC in - car communications system will play a big role in tying in with home owners ' smart meters to determine how much vehicle batteries need to be charged , how long it will take , and when to charge them , Gioia says .
Ford claims that more than one million of the vehicles it has sold have SYNC systems .
Whereas OnStar and SYNC may be important as stepping stones to smart charging systems , the technology will not take off until utility companies and EVs have a single , standard protocol for communicating .
( Imagine the mess if different car companies each wanted to send data to and from utilities in their own way . )
" We have the technology but need to create standards to make sure it can connect with all of the smart metering technology out there , " says Mark Duvall , director of Electric Transportation at the Electric Power Research Institute ( EPRI ) , a Palo Alto , Calif . –based group of energy researchers funded primarily by the electric utility industry .
" If we do these simple things there 's more than enough capacity in the electrical system to charge all of these vehicles with very little additional investment in the grid . "
The Society of Automotive Engineers 's ( SAE ) Hybrid Task Force began working early last year , with input from carmakers , utilities and suppliers , to develop a standard that will connect any vehicle to one of hundreds or even thousands of different smart - metering systems or other external devices that want to communicate with plug - in vehicles , says Duvall , who is also co-chair of the SAE task force .
" It 's a step - by - step process , " he says , " one that I hope we 'll be able to finish in the next 18 months or so .
I would personally like to see the things that we are working on here start to show up in new vehicles in the next few years . "

Alex Massie is probably right that there are “ two essential truths in international health policy , ” namely that :
No - one sees fit to copy the National Health Service and no-one sees fit to copy the American system .
But even given this , the right wingers have taken smearing Britain ’s National Health Service too far .
Chuck Grassley claimed , for example , that “ Sen. Edward M. Kennedy would be refused treatment for his brain tumor in England . ”
As Matt Yglesias pointed out :
[ T] here ’s actually a two - fold lie here .
First Grassley falsely implies that congressional Democrats are proposing to create an NHS - like system .
Second , he lies about how the NHS operates .
And he pays no price for it .
And despite what Cassandra over at Villainous Company has to say , Grassley is lying .
Calling Yglesias an “ evil - monger ” and saying that “ Google is not Matt Yglesias ’s friend , ” she claims that the drug Senator Kennedy is being prescribed for his tumor is prohibited by the National Health Service .
Her source ?
An “ expert ” quoted by NewsMax – who forgets to mention that the drug – Temodar – was invented in Britain and has been prescribed by the National Health Service since 2007 2005 .
The “ expert ” also claims , the drug would be “ available to every American . ”
Which is true .
Every American who can pay for it .
And the same was true in Britain even when the National Health Service did refuse to prescribe the drug .
Now , of course , in Britain , the drug is actually available to everyone in that country – whether they have the money to spare or not .
This two - fold lie about the National Health Service is one of the pillars of the right wing smears against the proposed Democratic health care plan – most disasterously used of course by the Investors Business Daily in discussing Stephen Hawking .
Hawking later told the Guardian :
I would n’t be here today if it were not for the NHS ,
But that ’s still not the point .
This whole conversation about Britain ’s National Health Service is a distraction .
Very few Democrats or liberals or progressives want anything resembling the British system .
What is at issue is a plan to improve upon the system we currently have – modest steps .
Though , as Ezra Klein explains , the modesty and popularity of what the Democrats are proposing is the reason Cassandra , Senator Grassley , Sarah Palin , Rush Limbaugh , and other right wingers are pretending the Democrats have proposed something else :
In part , that ’s why the debate has had to move toward fear - mongering and lies :
There just are n’t that many scary elements in the bills , because the legislation is oriented toward preserving the existing system and avoiding points of controversy .
And so , we face this unhinged debate about totalitarianism – a fearful fantasy – instead of a reality - based discussion of the system we have and how it can be improved upon .
Which is why the right wingers spreading these lies and smears and distractions just so they can achieve a political victory and slingshot their way back into power as they did in 1994 should be ashamed .

Octomom : ' I Screwed My Life Up '
As the octuplets head toward 6 months , Nadya Suleman says she has deep regrets .
June 5 , 2009  -- Nadya Suleman , the infamous " Octomom , " expresses deep regret over her historic birth of octuplets , saying , " I screwed my life up , I screwed up my kids ' life , " in an interview with Radar Online .
" What the heck am I going to do ?
I have to put on this strong face , and I have to pretend like I do n't regret it , " she said .
As Radar Online cameras rolled , Suleman opened up to a friend about her " guilt " over the multiple birth and her romantic feelings for the mystery man who she says fathered the octuplets along with the six children she already had .
" I blame myself for bringing this on my own , " Suleman said .
" These are my choices .
I coerced him into helping me every year .
...
The more kids I had , the stronger connection I had with him , and I could n't even imagine anyone else , and he knew that . "
Click here to watch the Radar Online video .
Suleman , who claims to have had all her children through in vitro fertilization , said she did not tell the donor before she had more children with his sperm .
" I went behind his back , and I feel so much guilt and want to apologize to him , " she said .
As for the identity of the Octodad , Suleman plans to keep quiet .
" He has his own world .
He will lose everything .
He will lose what he created , and it is important to him in his life .
I think he is so fearful [ for ] what he created on his own , " she said .
" I live in denial , and it is my fault and that is how I live with that . "
The sullen statements come just days after Suleman agreed to let a camera crew film her and her children for a reality television show .
' Regret ' a Sharp Turn for Once - Happy Octomom
The Radar Online video shows Suleman with a very different demeanor than the near - beaming smiles she showed during an exclusive interview with " Good Morning America " in April as she gave a tour of the babies ' nursery in her La Habra , Calif . , home .
" I know I 'm going to sound kind of crazy to say this , but [ raising the kids ] is actually a lot less stressful than I envisioned it to be , " Suleman told " Good Morning America " .
" They 're really good babies . "
" I never anticipated [ having ] more than one [ baby ] .
I was praying for one more , " Suleman said .
" If one had n't come , I 'd be happy with six . "
Then , Suleman was raising the eight newborns with the constant help of at least seven nurses working in shifts -- four during the day and three each night .
The octuplets reportedly go through around 2,000 diapers every month , placing a hefty financial burden on the family .
Multiple Birth Makes History , Stirs Controversy
Likely the nation 's most recognizable mother , Suleman made headlines in January when she gave birth to history - making octuplets .
Days after news of the miracle multiple birth spread from coast to coast , the public turned on Suleman when it came to light that the 33 - year - old already had six children who were born , like the octuplets , through in vitro fertilization .
Now all eight of the babies , the world 's longest - surviving set of octoplets , are home with Suleman and their six brothers and sisters .
The last to arrive home was Jonah on April 14 .
Jonah weighed 1 pound 8 ounces when he was born Jan. 26 . ; he now weights 4 pounds 10 ounces .
" They 're all here and really , really healthy , " Suleman said in a Radar Online video in April .
" They have very strong personalities . "

Nadya's Mother Criticizes Multiple Birth
Many people across the country expressed outrage at Suleman and the fertility doctor who impregnated her , saying it was irresponsible for a single woman to bring 14 children into the world without the means to care for them .
Even Suleman 's mother , Angela Suleman , has been vocal about her disapproval .
In Februrary , said her daughter 's decision was " really unconscionable . "
Click here to read Radar Online 's report .
On Feb. 24 , Radar Online posted video of a heated debate over the babies between Nadya and her mother .
" I will never understand , " Angela said to her daughter about her decision to have in vitro .
" You should have considered your other six children . "
" You ca n't go back and alter the past .
Done , done , done , " Nadya replied .

In early March Suleman defended herself after a frantic 911 call she made when she thought she lost one of her six previous children .
Police in Whittier , Calif. , say they responded eight times to emergency calls from the Suleman family .
Suleman moved out of her parents house in early March and into a larger one in La Habra , Calif .
She told Radar Online she put the down payment on the home herself .

Nurse Claims Suleman ' Does Not Care ' About Kids
The non-profit nursing service Angels in Waiting offered to provide around - the - clock nurses to help Suleman care for the children , but there were problems from the beginning , according to reports .
A nurse who had been helping provide care for some of the octopulets said on the " Dr. Phil Show " that Suleman seemed more interested in publicity than her children .
" This woman does not care for these kids , that 's my honest opinion , " said Linda West - Conforti , the founder of Angels in Waiting .
Suleman fired Angels in Waiting accusing the group of being unprofessional , spying on her and reporting her to child welfare officials .
Suleman told Radar Online she nearly called police to file a restraining order against the group .
In the video , she described a bizarre scene where an Angels in Waiting worker opened her purse and said how easy it would be to stuff one of her babies in there and abduct it .

Just days after West - Conforti claimed Suleman did not care for her children , Victor Munoz , Suleman 's publicist , told Usmagazine.com she was " nuts . "
" It just got to be too much , " Munoz said .
" Nadya got real greedy .
This woman is nuts . "
Suleman 's first publicist , Joann Killeen , also stepped aside .
' Harry Potter - style ' video ads to be run inside U.S. paper magazine
The animated newspapers of the Harry Potter books will come a step closer next month with the appearance of the world 's first video magazine advert .
America 's Entertainment Weekly will contain a wafer - thin screen and mini-speaker that will allow readers to watch a video when the publication is opened .
CBS , the US TV station paying for the advert , said the device would be tough enough to cope with the rough and tumble of printing , binding and delivery .
[ caption ]
The screens will be no bigger than two inches by 1.5 inches , roughly the size of a mobile phone screen .
The first wave of advertisements will be for American TV shows such as The Big Bang Theory and Two And A Half Men .
New shows will also be previewed , and the soft drink Pepsi will also light up the small screen .
Built - in buttons will allow readers to select which clips they want to watch .
[ caption ]
How much the screens cost to produce - and how much advertisers will be charged - has not been released , but until the technology becomes more widespread , and cheaper to produce , it is likely to be a costly exercise .
Paul Caine , president of the Time Inc. magazine group that includes Entertainment Weekly , said the ballpark dollar cost for one of the units is in the ' low teens ' , the Wall Street Journal reported .
He said the cost may come down before the issue comes out .
See video of the screens here
But for advertisers the premium might be worth it , as the adverts are likely to grab the reader 's attention .
George Schweitzer , president of CBS 's marketing group , said : ' As a rule , 90 per cent of people will say they heard about new programming on television .
' This is the first way we can get video samples into the hands of entertainment enthusiasts off the television screen . '
The screens will appear in selected copies of Entertainment Weekly 's September 18 edition .
BBC correspondent Rajesh Mirchandani likened the technology to that used in the ' Daily Prophet ' newspaper featured in the Harry Potter books .
Other examples from the world of fiction include 2002's Minority Report , where Tom Cruise goes on the run - and even has to hide from the adverts .
In reality , the world has been inching closer to moving screens - from e-book readers promising to revolutionise book - reading to e-ink screens promising digital newspapers that update constantly .
In the midst of the ongoing financial crisis , Congress is now considering a bill that would subject the Federal Reserve to congressional audits .
It would be a shame to let that happen .
Some functions of government properly belong in the realm of technocracy ( for example , drug approvals ) , and others belong in the realm of politics ( for example , same - sex marriage ) .
I first argued in the November / December 1997 issue of Foreign Affairs that the U.S. government was placing too many decisions in the political realm and too few in the technocratic one .
In the 12 years since , I have become increasingly convinced of this .
The thought back then was inspired by the apparent success of the Federal Reserve System .
A noteworthy creation of the Progressive Era , the Fed was designed to conduct monetary policy on decidedly nonpolitical grounds : it has only a vague legal mandate from Congress -- to pursue both " stable prices " and " maximum employment " -- and nearly complete discretion to fulfill its mission as it sees fit .
Over the years , the Fed , protected from partisan political concerns , has been able to run a very capable -- which is not to say perfect -- monetary policy , almost certainly keeping inflation lower than politicians would have .
Yet , despite this success , few , if any , U.S. government agencies today enjoy anything remotely close to the Fed 's degree of insulation from politics .
Maybe , I suggested in 1997 , more should .
Since then , the Fed has scored some spectacular successes .
It averted financial calamity in the United States as economies faltered throughout Asia in 1997 - 98 ; it steered the country through the post -2000 stock market crash with minimal damage ; and , most recently , it took extraordinary measures to avert what its chair , Ben Bernanke , said might have become the Great Depression 2.0 .
But it has also suffered some spectacular failures .
For example , it did not properly supervise banks in the run-up to the current crisis , nor did it protect consumers from predatory mortgage lenders .
Ironically , both the Federal Reserve 's failure to prevent the crisis and its remarkable success in pulling the economy back from the brink have fueled Congress ' hostility .
Since it proved to be a poor regulator , some legislators are reasonably asking why they should give it additional regulatory powers , as the Obama administration 's reform plan proposes .
Others have accused the Fed of usurping congressional authority by engaging in back - door appropriations of taxpayer funds -- for example , when it used emergency loans to facilitate Bear Stearns ' purchase by JPMorgan Chase and propped up AIG in 2008 .
Congress ' ire cuts across party lines , but it has been crystallized by Ron Paul ( R - Tex . ) , an extreme libertarian and longtime foe of the Fed .
He has , incredibly , persuaded almost two - thirds of the House of Representatives to co-sponsor a bill that would jeopardize the Fed 's independence .
The bill is titled , innocently enough , the Federal Reserve Transparency
Act , which sounds like something everyone should favor .
In fact , many have long advocated greater Federal Reserve transparency .
And , incidentally , the Fed has become substantially more transparent over the past decade , such as by issuing explanatory statements with each policy decision and revealing more about its internal economic forecasts .
But the cutting edge of the Paul bill is not a call for more transparency ; it is a proposal to subject the Fed 's decisions on monetary policy and its dealings with foreign central banks and foreign governments to audit by Congress ' Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) .
Up until now , these activities have been explicitly exempted from audit by the U.S. legal code .
On the surface , authorizing such an audit may sound like much ado about nothing .
After all , the Fed already gets a regular external audit of its financial statements .
( If Chairman Bernanke were living high on the hog at the taxpayer 's expense , Congress would know , as it should . )
Further , the GAO is already permitted to examine most aspects of the Fed 's operations , including such special financial arrangements as the deals with Bear Stearns , AIG , Citigroup , and Bank of America .
The Federal Reserve 's chair and other officials are frequently called before congressional committees to testify about the body 's activities , even its monetary policies -- precisely the area in which it is independent .
What is more , those policies are dissected and evaluated by the markets and the media in excruciating detail on an almost daily basis .
The Fed , appropriately enough , gets plenty of critical evaluations .
But an audit of its monetary policies by the GAO -- which , remember , works for Congress -- could easily develop into something quite dangerous .
Here is a not - so - unlikely hypothetical : sometime in 2010 , the Fed , wanting to avoid inflation , will likely begin to abandon the hyper - expansionary monetary policy it adopted during the recent crisis as a way to stave off a depression .
As it does so , interest rates will start rising even as unemployment remains high .
Predictably , Congress , being more closely attuned to public opinion , will be unhappy with this situation .
Until now , the Fed 's independence has ensured that it can afford to ignore public opinion and take such necessary but unpopular economic measures .
That is precisely why we want an independent monetary policy .
But if the Paul bill passes , angry members of Congress could ask for a GAO audit .
And , if the report is critical , they could use it to browbeat members of the Federal Open Market Committee , the Fed 's interest - rate - setting body , for killing the country 's economic recovery .
Congress has always had , but never used , the legal right to override the Fed 's decisions .
But does anyone believe monetary policy would be better if it were made in the political domain ?
In my 1997 article , I invoked the success of the Federal Reserve 's monetary policies to argue that perhaps we should adapt the model to other selected government decisions , thereby moving some of them out of the political and into the technocratic realm .
I suggested , in particular , that decisions that are more technical in nature ( as opposed to laden with value judgments ) and those that require a long time horizon were the most likely candidates for such treatment .
Watching Congress 's handiwork over the past dozen years , I have become increasingly convinced that this is true and that monetary policy should remain firmly in the technocratic realm .
Transcript :
Joining us is Congressman Barney Frank , a Democrat of Massachusetts , he is Chair of the House Financial Services Committee .
Mr. Chairman , thanks for making time to come on the show .
REP .
BARNEY FRANK , ( D ) MASSACHUSETTS :
Thank you and it ‘s a pleasure to be with you .
MADDOW : It ‘s nice to meet you in person .
FRANK : Thank you .
MADDOW : Let me ask you about something that happened tonight that was unexpected and that I did n‘t expect to have to ask anybody about .
A Republican Member of Congress named Joe Wilson of South Carolina screamed , " You lie " at the president tonight , interrupting his speech .
Is this an " ignore the tantrum " moment or is that a big deal ?
FRANK : I do n‘t think it ‘s a big deal .
Look , I think free speech — you know , heckling is a tradition , obviously , in the British parliament .
They even have mikes that come down to hear the heckles .
I think what we should take it as — it is unusual — it ‘s a sign of how effective the president was .
These guys just could n‘t handle it .
I looked at John Boehner and he looked about as glum and as dour as — as possibly he could be .
So what Joe Wilson did was just scream out in frustration because the president was nailing it .
So we‘ve got to be very clear , Wilson lied when he said the president lied .
And he talked about illegal immigrants .
It ‘s clearly excluded from the bill .
So I would say what Wilson did was a mark of their frustration .
And Barack Obama is a big boy .
I think , I must say , to any Republicans particularly like Joe Wilson who want to get into a debate with Barack Obama is tugging on Superman ‘s cape and pulling the Lone Ranger ‘s mask .
But if that ‘s what he wants to do , free country .
And he 's exactly right , what the Republicans did last night was a HUGE FAIL .
No SANE person thinks what they did was good , responsible , or mature .
They acted WORSE than children do .
Rahm said it best , no President has ever been treated like that .
They are losing , and after last night 's speech they will continue to LOSE .
President Obama held out the olive branch , he praised them where it was n't due , he 's incorporated their ideas ( including the red herring about tort reform ) .
And how do they respond ?
They continue to lie about the plan the Democrats want to advance .
They continue to be rude .
They continue to show their lack of class and their true colors .
Even on the death panel LIE ( which has been repeatedly debunked ) only 4 Republicans stood up and applauded .
According to The Hill ’s Walter Alarkon , the only Republican senators seen standing and applauding Obama ’s dismissal of the " death panel " myth were Sens. Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) , Susan Collins ( R - ME ) , Bob Bennett ( R - UT ) and Judd Gregg ( R - NH ) .
" Four or five House Republicans also appeared to stand and applaud Obama ’s remark , but it ’s unclear which ones they were , " writes Alarkon .
Indeed , I just saw a segment on MSNBC where a Republican Representative from Texas REFUSED to flat out say that what Joe Wilson did last night was WRONG .
That 's how far gone the Republican Party is .
But Rep .
Frank was n't done :
MADDOW : Were the Republicans tonight in a more so — in a more sober response are asking for everything to start over again .
They are saying let ‘s go back to square one .
They say that ‘s what Americans are demanding .
That everything that ‘s happened so far has been wrong foot and they want a restart .
FRANK : Well , what they really want to do is go back to square one and judge the reaction .
I mean , one thing you have to be very clear , when people said does this have to be bipartisanship ?
Let ‘s be very clear that since this bipartisanship really goes against the notion of democracy .
We had an election in 2008 , and the Democrats won the presidency , significant majorities in the House and the Senate .
We do n‘t all agree on everything but there were clear differences .
There were clear differences .
And one of the great things the president did today — and I do n‘t agree with everything he said — but he articulated the philosophy of a liberal governance in a very good way about what ‘s the private sector — public sector , interrelationship ?
The Republicans represent an extremely conservative faction .
The notion that those of us who won the election with a solid majority should compromise 50/50 with those who lost , well , then why not ( INAUDIBLE ) why do we just have to make a cover war ?
Let ‘s make it camp .
And it just did n‘t make any sense .
And this notion of starting from scratch — in the first place — I already had a first place .
In the second place , if they wanted to start from scratch , why did n‘t they ?
They have n‘t put anything forward .
What ‘s been stopping them from January of this year from coming forward with their plan ?
The answer is they really do n‘t have anything constructive to do .
EXACTLY .
WE WON .
And now I think the Democrats are going to start acting like winners again .
We took our lumps in August , and we were largely divided ( even on this site ) , but I really think last night 's speech is going to be a rallying point for Democrats , Progressive , Moderates and ConservaDems alike .
When the Republicans come to the table with REAL ideas and without all of the lies and the bullshit , then we can take them seriously .
Until then , we should ignore them .
MADDOW : When the president was talking about — about liberalism tonight , about the idea that government has a constructive role to play , I thought that was important just — not even in terms of health care but just in terms of his presidency .
FRANK : Yes .
MADDOWN : Because I have n‘t heard him make that argument before .
FRANK : No and then it would be particularly relevant to what I happen to be working on now , which is financial regulation .
MADDOW : Yes .
FRANK : Ronald Reagan in 1980 won , his first inaugural , my first year in Congress , said government is not the answer to our problems .
Government is the problem .
Of course , switch to the Bush administration when they were running up and down on Wall Street saying , we ‘re from the government and we ‘re here to help you .
But it was the absence of government not restraining the excesses of the financial sector that caused this great problem we ‘re in .
And yes , the president had n‘t done that .
And it ‘s interesting that he did that at the same — and this annoyed me a little bit — it was this " oh , you on the left and you on the right .
It ‘s kind of like I ‘m above the battle . "
I think the president underestimated when he came to office exactly how right - winged the Republicans are and I ‘m glad he asked them today to join .
I have no great hopes for it because they are in the control of the most conservative .
Knowing how right wing the Republican Party has become , my only bad moment with Barack Obama during the campaign was when he said he was going to be post partisan and I got post - partisan depression because I knew that that meant dealing with these people .
So I think he was in effect — I guess — I ‘m talking too much — their extreme reactionary posture forced him to articulate what he may have previously thought we could take for granted , this liberal approach to a private sector , public sector cooperation and I agree with you , he did it very well .
MADDOW : One of the things that I thought — I — was interesting in the sense that it was thought provoking and not at all on the surface level , obvious what he meant when he was doing that riff about the importance of governance and about the idea that liberalism is something that ought not be conflated with big government .
It should be seen as springing from a desire to help one ‘s fellow man and help one ‘s fellow citizens .
One of the things he said is that we will sometimes say that timidity is the only form of wisdom .
And it seemed to me that , that was the unexpected shot in the middle of that — the shot in the middle of that round .
FRANK : Again , I think they forced him to — to get to the basics .
I think he may have thought that they were more reasonable than they are ; this collection of loons that you scrolled down there .
I got to say , those people , if anybody needs a health plan in America it ‘s those people who are in severe need of mental health services ; this lunacy about mandatory abortions and death .
By the way , there is a political faction in America that would have the government intervene in what should be the most private moment for people when they are dealing with the last breaths , with when death is there , and that is an intensely private thing .
And government should n‘t be in it .
But it was the right wing and in the Terri Schiavo case that got involved in this .
So if you do believe government should stay out of that terribly intimate decision , then the people to fear are the right wingers who drove the Schiavo bill .
But the one thing that is very rational in their decision - making about what to do about health care reform is that they are making a ton of money off of it , that they have energized their own base , that they have sort of brought the Christian right back to life , at least in their own estimation .
They think that this is a big issue for them not necessarily because they ‘re going to win but because it ‘s going to stoke people up that are going to support them .
FRANK : Coming back to life is after all a very fundamental part of Christian doctrine .
But it ‘s a nice blend for them of cynicism and stupidity , some of them know better .
Some of these people talking about death panels , I think some of what Newt Gingrich said .
He ‘s a smart man who ‘s just being cynical .
Some are just dumb and do n‘t understand it .
But I will say this , the one thing I take comfort for , when I ‘m in a debate with people , if they are making cogent points against what I think is very important , I get a little nervous .
I noticed last week in " The New York Times " that the responsible conservatives are starting to complain now that the arguments against the Obama plan and against our efforts for health care are being dominated by the crazies .
That ‘s their fault .
They were very happy to have the crazies getting out there doing Hitler stuff and et cetera .
I think the problem is they do n‘t have good arguments .
When people make ridiculous arguments against something , it ‘s because that ‘s all they got .
They can‘t deny it would be good to improve health care ‘s efficiency or to extend it to people who can‘t have it or to protect people against arbitrary cancellations from the private companies so they come up with death panels and mandatory abortions .
The very weakness to their argument is it ‘s testimony to the strength of ours .
MADDOW : Congressman Barney Frank , Democrat of Massachusetts , chairman of the banking committee .
It ‘s really nice to have you here .
FRANK : Nice to have you in Washington .
Come back again .
MADDOW : Will do .
Thank you .
FRANK : Ok .
And there you have it , the crazies have taken over the Republican Party .
President Obama and the Democrats , in good faith , went to the Republicans in Congress and attempted to negotiate in good faith , and they got slapped repeatedly .
Now we are hearing that Democrats are meeting amongst themselves to get it done without Republicans .
Meanwhile , I 'm still hearing Republicans whine about " government run healthcare " even though Obama stated clearly and unequivocally that there will NOT be government run health care .
They are STILL lying about public support for the public option even though every poll states differently .
We all know by now that we can't take the craziness of the early August townhalls as the truth of how the American people feel .
The thing is , President Obama won last night 's public opinion polls .
That 's why the Republicans were acting like recalcitrant school children last night .
They know they are about to lose , and I for one think they have done everything possible to earn that defeat .
These swing voters reacted strongly to Obama 's message .
Support for Obama 's plan jumped 20 points , from 46 percent before the speech to 66 percent after .
Importantly , Obama also achieved one of his principal goals of boosting the intensity of support .
Prior to the speech , just 2 percent of these swing voters supported the plan strongly while 26 percent opposed it strongly ; by the end of the evening those numbers were virtually reversed , with 28 percent supporting the plan strongly against just 8 percent strongly opposed .
The president was also extremely successful in moving the needle on areas where progressives have struggled over the last few months , making great strides in reassuring voters on issues like the deficits and taxes , seniors and Medicare , choice and control , competition and costs , and government intervention .
Older independent voters came away from the speech more supportive of health care reform and feeling that the president had addressed some of their concerns , according to the AARP .
Their national survey found that 77 percent of independents had concerns about health reform coming into last night 's speech and 72 percent felt that some of those concerns were addressed .
Sixty - three percent of independents considered themselves " more supportive of the proposals being talked about related to health care " after the speech was over .
Considering he 's winning over the middle , and the left is coming back home for the most part , the Republicans have every reason to be afraid .
UPDATE : Here 's the guy that refused to say Wilson was wrong .
And good for David for not letting go .
THAT'S what we 're dealing with .
SMH
The next time you hear Christians complaining about being persecuted in America , remember this story .
You probably know Hemant Mehta , author of the blog Friendly Atheist .
What you may not know , and what I did n’t know , is that by day he ’s a math teacher at a public high school in Illinois .
And it seems that a right - wing Christian group , outraged by the thought of an atheist being a teacher and potentially a role model , is now trying to get him fired .
You can read the story in Hemant ’s own words in three posts , Why the Illinois Family Institute Is Angry With Me , Illinois Family Institute Goes After Me Again , and most recently , Laurie Higgins of the Illinois Family Institute Issues an Open Letter to Me .
Hemant does a superb job of telling the story himself , but the summary is that he outraged the Illinois Family Institute , a gay - bashing religious right group , by writing a blog post sarcastically criticizing a “ warning ” they issued about same - sex couples kissing in public .
The IFI was terrified that – gasp !
– young , impressionable children might see gays and lesbians engaging in acts of affection !
In response , the IFI ’s director , Laurie Higgins , sent a letter to Hemant ’s school board to insinuate that he should be fired for being an atheist :
… He , of course , has a First Amendment right to write whatever he pleases on his blog “ The Friendly Atheist ” during his free time , but it ’s unfortunate that a role model for students would write some of the things he writes .
When this failed to produce the desired effect , Higgins then sent letters to parents in Hemant ’s district , suggesting that they should be horrified by an atheist teacher and should demand that their children be removed from his class :
… as I mentioned in my earlier article , parents have the right not to have him as a teacher and a role model for their children .
I want to be very clear about what I ’m suggesting : I am suggesting that parents who have serious concerns about Mr. Mehta ’s potential influence on their children ’s beliefs politely insist that their children be placed in another teacher ’s class .
The IFI ’s fearmongering follows the usual religious right smear - job tactics : dig around for anything controversial that can be linked to the person they ’re attacking – especially anything having to do with sex , which the Christianists are obsessed with to the point of paralysis – and then describe it to make it sound as upsetting to mainstream sensibilities as possible .
Gasp !
Another poster on Hemant ’s blog answered an e-mail from someone who practices polyamory !
Gasp !
Hemant linked to the “ obscene column ” of “ homosexual activist ” Dan Savage !
Heavens , wo n’t someone please think of the children ?!
Notably , not even Higgins has claimed that Hemant has said or done anything in the classroom to promote atheism to his students .
Her sole concern is that he might be a good teacher , such that students will find him inspiring and look up to him , will then Google his name , find out he ’s an atheist , and be drawn to atheism themselves !
( Really .
I ’m not kidding .
That ’s actually what they say . )
I ’ve heard nothing to indicate that Hemant ’s job is in jeopardy , but if the school board does take any kind of retaliatory action against him , he would have a very strong legal case for religious discrimination .
I ’ll post an update if I hear anything more on that front , and I ’d gladly help raise money in his defense .
In the meantime , to Laurie Higgins and the IFI : shame on you .
How dare you , here in America , try to get a man fired for expressing his views ?
How dare you suggest that speech protected by the First Amendment makes him any less fit as a teacher or as a role model ?
You should be ashamed for such a sleazy and contemptible attack on a good American citizen who ’s serving his community by teaching its children .
You have no right to demand that students in public schools only be exposed to opinions that are exactly the same as their parents ’ .
That is a foolish , reprehensible and ignorant expectation .
The whole point of education is to expose kids to new ideas .
And when was the last time you complained about a religious teacher expressing their views ?
Have you ever issued press releases trying to frighten parents into pulling their children out of some class because the teacher is a Christian or a Jew ?
Have you ever written to the school board to complain because a teacher wears a crucifix in class ?
Hemant does n’t even so much as wear an atheist pin !
No teacher , atheist or theist , should proselytize their students in class ( although religious ones too often do ) .
The First Amendment requires that public institutions be secular and religiously neutral .
But what constitutionally - protected opinions a teacher holds and expresses on their own time , that ’s their business .
The IFI , a gang of small - minded bigots if ever I saw one , thinks they have the right to close down the circle of opinions to only the ones that they approve of .
It ’s too bad for them that they live in America , a nation founded on precisely the opposite ideal .

So we ’ve had some celebrity deaths , and like all things they come in threes , although science ca n’t explain that .
Granted , science is also still not sure if eggs are good for you , if we ’re all biologically the same , or what quantum theory underlies all matter .
But scientists will arrogantly tell you The Absolute TruthTM nonetheless .
The trifecta of celebrity mortality is complete : Farrah Fawcett , Michael Jackson , and Billy Mays .
A pin-up , a jingle writer , and a late - night TV pitchman .
Is this our “ culture ” ?
It ’s the culture of non-culture .
If you do n’t have an ancestral culture with its dances , language , rituals , ceremonies , food preparation , costumes , literature , art and values , you just sort of pick up whatever trends are popular .
Michael Jackson was , at best , a talented songwriter in the pop style .
Pop music , known for its endless repetition of catchy themes , is not rocket science to write .
In fact , most of the best musicians avoid it because it ’s really boring if you know anything about music or life .
But Jacko was the king of pop , etc etc because we needed a hero and he was on our side during the Cold War .
Awesome .
Farrah Fawcett , while a nice person , was known for her clingy swimsuit more than anything else .
She did not invent rockets .
She probably participated in human rights missions , but so do millions of others , except they ’re not celebrities .
Oh well .
Billy Mays was a lot of fun , because if you did encounter late - night TV when he was selling you some nostril cleansing product or tomato growing apparatus , he made it more amusing than most .
But there ’s not much distinction in that either .
What I ’m getting at here … our culture is like the sweepings from the floor of history .
We dote on these people because they ’re famous , but then the trend changes , and things move on .
We accumulate what ’s left over and call it culture because we have nothing , because some wise idiot convinced us that culture like strong government was a form of oppression and we ’d finally be “ free ” when we threw it out .
So now we get … heroes who are n’t heroes , a culture of non-culture , a society based not on working together but barely tolerating each other ?
Good thinking .

Customer : “ No . ”
Me : “ Did your pregnant wife send you out at eight in the morning to buy this candy ? ”
Customer : “ Yes . ”
Me : “ For the love of God , man !
Get these home to her before you ’re in even more trouble !
You can come back and pay me later ! ”

I came to extreme poverty late in life , and did very badly at it .
I should have done some kind of crime .
But what kind ?
That ’s what I could n’t figure out .
What kind of crime can you actually do , if you are n’t a lawyer and do n’t understand computers ?
There were certainly plenty of people who could have offered me some advice on the matter .
We were living on a boat , moored in a skuzzy little harbor full of small - time criminals .
The one guy who went off to a job every day was a figure of awe and mockery , a freak .
Everybody else scavenged or stole to buy their booze and weed .
But crime did n’t pay , at least for these guys .
They were as poor as we were .
Poorer , because they needed a lot of cash for their chemicals , and we stuck with free government Prozac .
They talked a good game , crime - wise , but their lives were more than just bad — they were ridiculous .
Horrible , stupid things happened to them on a regular basis .
Like Chris , who failed to notice that his boat was resting lower in the water every day .
It finally sank right under him .
I hear he ’s living in his van now .
Then there was Mike , who used to ride with the Angels and still had a classic Fu Manchu , maybe the last on the continent .
He was dropping prawn traps , drunk as ever , when he managed to wrap a rope around his legs and found himself zooming to the sea floor , a big screaming mass of live bait .
He was proud of having cut the line and made it back to the surface , but everybody else was so sick of the story they wished he had n’t had his knife with him when he took his dip .
Those people forced me into something like a partial revaluation of my values .
There was no honor among these thieves .
I mean , you think you know that already , but in the early winter months , when our murderer friend rowed over through the sea ice with a propane heater and shared it with us — with us and his pale young friend Benny — we were deeply moved .
You ’d have to have been through what we went through , begging the respectable people of British Columbia first for jobs , and at last simply for shelter from the first blizzard — and getting not just rejections but loathing , utter disgust that we might need help .
At least Johnny - the - double - murderer , fresh from 17 years in Collins Bay , a venerable medium - security institution in Ontario , did n’t despise us for needing help .
He was proud to help us , and that counted for an awful lot with me and Katherine .
We still talk about the night of the first big snowstorm , when we begged for shelter at the thrift store , then the public library , and got nowhere — but when we rowed over to Johnny ’s boat in desperation , he just said , “ Go over to your boat , I ’ll be right over ! ” and rowed over with his propane heater .
That night Johnny and his catamite lay in their sleeping bags a few feet from us , all warmed by that blue sunflower of Propane .
We wanted badly to believe that they were our friends ; there were no other candidates .
We learned soon enough that even murderers ca n’t be trusted .
We fled the boat in mid-winter , with the sea ice grinding at the hull , and by the time I made it back to collect our stuff it was all gone , pawned by Johnny .
He had every intention of paying me back , he explained , and that was the last I heard of it .
In fact , that was the only crime that seemed to pay out on the boats : talking newcomers out of their money by offering to do repairs , or befriending them in a heavy - handed prison manner .
That worked , at least on us , but the trouble is , you end up with what Flann O’Brien succinctly described as “ paupers impoverishing each other . ”
There ’s got to be a better , braver , more honorable form of crime than that .
We went over the possibilities many times , sitting hungry and cold on that damn boat .
Not that crime was our first thought .
You do n’t want to know how hard and long I tried for every job in Canada .
The locals have all the teaching jobs well wrapped up , though .
Like Limonov said , “ In America , every profession has its mafia . ”
Nice legal mafias .
That ’s the apex of the crime pyramid , and it soon became clear it was as closed to overeducated immigrants as the Sicilian original would have been .
Then we panicked and just tried for a job , any job .
You ca n’t get “ any job ” these days , though .
You may think you ’re being very flexible , but McDonald ’s does n’t actually want a fifty - year old , slovenly , slightly crazed academic taking orders .
You ’d be surprised what snobs they are .
Call - centers did n’t want me answering their phones with my expensively trained voice .
Inuit villages hundreds of miles inside the Arctic Circle did n’t want me teaching English to their kids .
It was astonishing ; it seemed improbable , excessive .
Until you got back to the boat in the evening with no food and no propane , sleeping two - to - a - mummy - bag for warmth .
When you ’re literally out in the cold , in the middle of thousands of nice warm houses , you think about home invasion first .
It must be some Pleistocene brainstem connection : Me cold … Them got warm and foodzez … beat them heads in and take foodzez .
That was the only sort of crime that came naturally to me , arising naturally from the long cold walks past rows of warm , well - stuffed houses full of smug , stupid householders .
You start to wonder , how hard would it be ?
Just knock on the door with something , anything , a tree branch , a piece of pipe .
You ’ll never do it , at least I ’d never do it , but you sort of wish you could .
I had a more practical version that made a little more sense : find a house occupied by a single aged recluse , somebody who kept totally to themselves .
Knock - knock , bang - bang , and spend the winter there , leave in the spring .
It was a comforting notion , no more than that .
As Nietzsche said about suicide , it got me through many a long night .
But it did nothing about the fact that we were utterly broke , poorer than I thought it was possible to be in North America .
Last week I posted on an exciting new Gush Shalom campaign to cut off funding from the US for Israeli settlements .
Now we have more information on the campaign directly from Gush Shalom , and the campaign is focused much more broadly than just money to the settlements .
The organization was kind enough to share more details on the campaign , which I ’ve included below .
In addition to targeting US - based non profit organizations which serve as financial conduits to the settlers , and larger Jewish charities , such as Nefesh B’Nefesh and the Jewish National Fund , that carry out projects in the occupied Palestinian territories , Gush Shalom is also going after " those supporting policies enabling illegal settlement activity through propaganda campaigns " such as StandWithUs and The Israel Project .
Great work .
We ’ll be following this campaign closely .
Hopefully this campaign will find some US partners soon .
As I said earlier , this is really a campaign that should be coming from the American Jewish community as a way to take responsibility for our ongoing complicity in the Israeli occupation .
Here are the details from Gush Shalom –
Shortly after the passage of the Debt Slave Act of 2005 ( more widely known as the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2005 ) the number of bankruptcies collapsed .
Now , in conjunction with soaring unemployment , Bankruptcy filings return to pre-reform - law pace .
Pummeled by unemployment , foreclosures , the credit crunch and other manifestations of the worst recession in memory , Americans are filing bankruptcy petitions at rates approaching those that mounted before the new bankruptcy law took effect in October 2005 .
" That law was draconian , and it included huge disincentives to filing for bankruptcy , " said Robert Lawless , a professor of law at the University of Illinois College of Law and a nationally recognized expert on bankruptcy rules , regulations and rates .
" So these numbers show that people are really hurting right now . "
In [ 2005 ] , just before the more stringent rules took effect , 6,339 bankruptcy petitions were filed during an average business day .
In 2006 , with the law fully in force , the rate plunged to 2,372 per day .
Now , Americans are flooding back into bankruptcy court at the rate of 5,593 per day .
By year 's end , about 1.45 million bankruptcy petitions will be filed , Lawless said .
The American Bankruptcy Institute offers a similar prediction of more than 1.4 million petitions .
That would represent an increase of about 35 percent over last year 's numbers .
The modern record is about 2 million bankruptcy petitions , set in 2005 as filings spiked just ahead of the effective date of the new law .
" The situation certainly is not getting any better and it might be getting worse , " Lawless said .
" We wo n't see any improvement for a while . "
Effect of Hurricane Katrina
Thinking of Filing Bankruptcy ?
Charging up a storm on your credit cards before you file is considered fraud .
If the court determines you made purchases shortly before you filed for bankruptcy -- which they can easily see by looking at your credit card statements -- they may decide you took out loans with no intention of paying them back .
That 's called fraud .
At the very least , those debts will not be discharged , or your entire bankruptcy case may be thrown out of court .
If you transfer money and gifts to your family and friends , you can find yourself in worse trouble .
It 's easy to run afoul of the fraudulent transfer laws -- rules designed to keep people from making gifts to take value out of the hands of creditors .
The most flagrant abuse of the fraudulent transfer laws is when people give away cash that they expect to get back after the bankruptcy is complete .
It 's clearly a fraudulent transfer if both the giver and the recipient know that the goods are only being held until after the bankruptcy .

You know the spoiled little rich girl complaining that her Daddy wo n't buy her a Porsche and she has to make due with a BMW ?
If you 're American , you 'll probably think I sound like that spoiled little rich girl after reading this post .
I 'm sorry .
I 'm Canadian .
I have access to almost a year of leave ( combined maternity leave and parental leave ) from work after having a baby with some pay .
And I do n't think it is enough .
In fact , I think it provides a bare minimum amount of benefits and protection to a select group of people .
Although I think that the amount of time off , the dollar value of the benefits , the eligibility criteria , and the job protection of parents on leave still leaves a lot to be desired , those are not the subject of my post today .
What I want to talk about today is the lack of flexibility in the current system , which is something that I think could be addressed without significant expense while making maternity , paternity and parental leave relevant and helpful to a lot more Canadian families .
What do I mean when I say that the current system is inflexible ?
You have to take the leave starting at the end of your pregnancy or the latest when your child is born .
You have to take all of the leave within the first year following the birth of your child ( you ca n't take some leave , go back to work for a bit , and then take some more leave later ) .
Money you earn while on leave is deducted from your benefits .
What is wrong with that ?
The problem is the lack of flexibility .
It seems to assume that the parent with the lower income will stay home for a year with the baby while the higher earning partner continues to bring home the bacon and pay most of the bills .
Maybe that is fine for a lot of people , but what happens if :
A mother is the higher wage earner and wants to be able to stay home with her baby to facilitate breastfeeding but can't afford to pay the bills with the combination of her husband 's salary and the benefits that she is getting ?
A family is just scraping by on two incomes and can't afford to have one of the two parents earning significantly less or shelling out a lot of money for day care ?
One of the parents that wants to take leave is in the middle of a critical project or initiative at work during the first year of the baby 's life and can't take time off then ?
The baby turns out to be a very calm baby that just sleeps and nurses all day and the at - home parent is bored and would like to be able to go back to work early ( perhaps working from home with the baby there or taking the baby to work ) but defer the leave for when the baby is more active ?
Too bad .
So what would I like to see instead ?
Just like people need to accumulate a certain number of hours of work to qualify for benefits under the maternity , paternity and parental leave provisions , I think people should be guaranteed a certain number of hours of leave that they can take as they like .
For example :
Instead of taking one year off , they could work half - time for two years and get the same total dollar value of benefits ( at the moment if you work half - time while on leave what you earn would essentially cancel out your benefits , so you would n't be getting any benefits )
A mother with a calm baby could continue working until her baby is 6 months old and then take a year off from the time the baby is 6 months until the baby is 18 months .
In a family where the one partner is staying home and the other one is a teacher , could have the non-teacher partner go back to work for a few months while the teacher is at home during the summer and then continue the leave when the school year resumes .
The stay - at - home parent could gradually reintegrate into the workplace by going back one day per week , then two days per week , then three days per week and so on without the total dollar value of benefits or number of hours off being affected .
This would make the transition easier for the baby and the parent .
Let families split the leave by having both parents take small amounts of time off .
Instead of one parent being off full - time , let each parent take a bit of time off each week and share the job of raising their child .
Quebec has made some changes to its system ( the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan ) to be more generous and more flexible .
For example , parents can choose between having a year off at the regular rate of benefits or taking a shorter leave at a higher payout .
They also allow you to interrupt your benefits and then restart them later , however all of the benefits must be received within 52 weeks of the birth of the baby .
This is a move in the right direction , but I 'd like to see more options that increase the flexibility for parents without necessarily increasing the cost to the taxpayer .
Let 's work towards a system that guarantees a certain number of paid hours off from work and that does n't penalize parents for taking those hours in a way that best suits their professions , their family and their baby .
My hope for the United States is certainly that they create a system of paid maternity , paternity and parental leave for all Americans .
But I hope that they can perhaps learn from some of the failings of our system and implement a more flexible approach from the start .

About one in every hundred people faces being diagnosed with schizophrenia at some stage in their life .
Probably the last thing they and their families want to be told is that there are questions over the quality of the treatment on offer .
But there is concern in the US that drug companies have been influencing psychiatrists over what anti-psychotic drugs to prescribe .
Dr Herbert Meltzer , who pioneered the use of clozapine in America , passionately denies such interference is the norm .
He was challenged by US medical journalist Robert Whitaker over the need for medication at all when the two debated on the BBC's World Today programme .
' Cherry - picking '
Whitaker pointed to academic studies in Vermont and Illinois as evidence that too many schizophrenia patients are kept on medication for too long .
I am responsible for the atypical anti-psychotic drugs and I never made a penny in terms of the profit
Dr Herbert Meltzer
US anti-psychotic drug pioneer
In the Vermont case , patients discharged in the 1950s and 1960s were studied 30 years on .
Dr Courtenay Harding determined that one - third had completely recovered and all of those ex-patients had stopped taking anti-psychotic drugs .
" You need a paradigm of care which recognises that some percentage of patients would do better off medication and that should be built into the system , " Whitaker concluded .
Suggesting the journalist was " cherry - picking " academic studies , Meltzer warned against making generalisations based on the Harding study " because there was no evidence that these people needed medication to begin with " .
Acknowledging that psychotic symptoms might diminish in time because of biological changes in the brain , he pointed out that schizophrenia was " not just a disease of delusions and hallucinations [ but ] a disease of cognition " .
Without medication , Meltzer said , there was no possibility of recovery from this cognitive impairment .
' Losing faith ' Controversy over alleged conflicts of interest has been dogging the world of US psychiatry : I do think there is an incredible crisis for psychiatry right now in American society because we do not believe what we are told
Robert Whitaker
US medical journalist •
In July of last year , Senator Charles Grassley demanded clarity over the finances of the American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) •
The US Department of Health and Human Services is investigating payments to the former head of Emory University 's psychiatry department , Charles Nemeroff • Harvard University is conducting an internal investigation into psychiatry professor Joseph Biederman , who is accused of failing to disclose payments from drug companies in full Robert Whitaker suggests the American public is " losing faith in psychiatry as an honest profession " .
" What has happened over the past 30 years is that the academic psychiatrists now receive money from the drug companies through a lot of channels : they are members of speaker bureaus , they act as consultants , they are on advisory boards , " said the author of Mad in America : Bad Science , Bad Medicine , and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill .
" I do think there is an incredible crisis for psychiatry right now in American society because we do not believe what we are told . "
Herbert Meltzer accepted that some pharmaceutical companies had encouraged over - treatment in the past , and that there had been instances of " bad apples " in the industry .
CLOZAPINE
Prescribed for the approximately one in five people with schizophrenia who do not respond to other medications Developed by Sandoz in the 1960s but withdrawn in Europe in 1975 when it was linked to agranulocytosis Approved in US in 1989 when its benefits were judged to outweigh the side effects
Another side effect has been identified as metabolic syndrome
But if exaggerated claims had been made for some anti-psychotic drugs , they had not been made by pharmaceutical industry publications , he insisted .
" I am responsible for the atypical anti-psychotic drugs and I never made a penny in terms of the profit from bringing forward the models that led to the profusion of drugs in that era , " he added .
Meltzer contended that there would be no effective psychotropic treatments for serious mental illness today without the joint efforts of pharmaceutical companies and academics .
" There is no single drug - whether for schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , major depression or anxiety - that has ever been produced by a governmental agency , " he said .
Free lunches over
While concurring that pharmaceutical firms had an important part to play in bringing new treatments to market , Whitaker called for researchers to keep a greater distance .
SCHIZOPHRENIA
Impacts on thinking , feeling and behaviour Usually starts between the ages of 15 to 35 Affects about one in every 100 people during their lifetime " What we need is a group of independent physicians who will have a critical perspective as they figure out how to best use those drugs , " he said .
" I would agree but unfortunately there are very few people who have nothing to do with drug companies but who are still as knowledgeable as the rest of us , " Meltzer replied .
" But when you look at the aggregate of what we do , it is incorrect to characterise it as self - serving and abusing the public trust . "
In a sign of the sensitivity that now attaches to the US pharmaceutical industry , the APA recently put an end to medical education seminars and meals sponsored by drug companies at its annual meetings .
" There is a perception that accepting meals provided by pharmaceutical companies may have a subtle influence on doctors ' prescribing habits , " Dr James Scully , the APA 's medical director and chief executive officer , said in a statement .

ST .
LOUIS -- Rene Tosoni waited out the rain and went home with an MVP award .
Tosoni and Dayan Viciedo hit consecutive RBI doubles to cap a four - run comeback that carried the World team past the United States 7 - 5 on Sunday in a Futures Game that provided a soggy start to All - Star festivities at Busch Stadium .
" You talk about why this is such a great baseball town and as you saw , even with a 4 - hour rain delay , the majority of the people stayed , " said Cardinals Hall of Famer Ozzie Smith , who managed the U.S. squad .
" It 's a very special place . "
Baseball 's annual showcase for top minor league talent was interrupted for 4 hours , 9 minutes in the first inning by a heavy storm that rolled through the ballpark , darkening skies and briefly cloaking the famous Gateway Arch beyond center field .
Because of the delay , the game was shortened to seven innings .
When play finally resumed , Colorado 's Eric Young hit a solo homer and Houston 's Jason Castro added a three - run shot that gave the U.S. a 5 - 3 lead going into the seventh .
But with three outs remaining , the World team rallied against losing pitcher Trevor Reckling of the Los Angeles Angels .
Milwaukee 's Brett Lawrie led off with a double and went to third on an infield single by Starlin Castro of the Chicago Cubs .
Lawrie scored on a wild pitch that sent Castro to second , and one out later Oakland second baseman Jemile Weeks made a costly mistake .
Milwaukee 's Alcides Escobar hit a humpback liner up the middle that was grabbed by Weeks on one hop behind second .
With no chance to make a balanced throw , Weeks tried to flip the ball with his glove to shortstop Danny Espinosa -- an ill - advised attempt .
Tyson Gillies celebrates after the World team won its third straight Futures Game , becoming the first squad to do so in 11 years .

The toss went awry and the ball trickled away on the infield , allowing Castro to score the tying run .
" It 's a play we work on in the A's organization , " Weeks said .
" I think maybe I might have tossed it too hard . "
Tosoni , a Minnesota Twins outfield prospect from Canada , came up as a pinch hitter to face Pittsburgh right - hander Brad Lincoln .
Tosoni hit a hard one - hopper that deflected off first baseman Chris Carter and down the right - field line for a go - ahead double .
" I 'm usually an everyday player .
It 's been a while since I got to pinch hit , " Tosoni said .
" I wanted to get in , especially coming all the way over here . "
Viciedo , a Cuban defector playing third base in the Chicago White Sox system , followed with a well - struck double to right that made it 7 - 5 .
" I felt overwhelmed by the moment .
It was a huge hit .
I will always treasure this ocassion , " Viciedo said .
" I know my family and friends were watching in Cuba and I know I gave them joy . "
Astros reliever Chia -Jen
Lo worked a hitless inning for the win and Cincinnati's J.C. Sulbaran got three outs for a save .
With one swing , Tosoni earned an MVP award previously won by Alfonso Soriano , Jose Reyes , Grady Sizemore and Aaron Hill .
The World team won its third straight Futures Game , becoming the first squad to do so in the event 's 11 - year history .
Afterward , Tosoni was covered with shaving cream , courtesy of World teammate Luis Durango of the San Diego Padres .
Looking to break up the boredom during the long delay , Lincoln played frisbee in the outfield with fellow U.S. pitchers Kyle Drabek and Mat Latos .
Drabek , a Philadelphia prospect and the son of 1990 NL Cy Young Award winner Doug Drabek , pitched a perfect second inning .
Other players had big league family ties , too .
Young 's father is former infielder Eric Young .
Weeks ' brother is Brewers second baseman Rickie Weeks .
Boston 's Junichi Tazawa had been slated to start for the World team but was scratched after the delay .
The right - hander had finished warming up before the downpour , so Red Sox assistant general manager Jed Hoyer , who was at the ballpark , called World team manager Jose Oquendo and requested that Tazawa not pitch .
" Everyone is playing right now .
I 'm the only one who can't play , so I 'm very disappointed , " Tazawa said through a translator during the game .
Texas righty Neftali Feliz got the ball instead and was impressive , striking out two in one scoreless inning .
More than 50 Futures Game alumni have developed into major league All - Stars .
Pablo Sandoval , Elvis Andrus and Andrew McCutchen are among the youngsters from last year 's game who have already made an impact as big league regulars this season .
" It 's the elite of the elite , " said Pittsburgh 's Pedro Alvarez , the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2008 .
Alvarez had an RBI single for the United States .
We learned a few days ago that Broughton attended a sermon at Faithful Word Baptist Church the day before that infamous town hall , in which Pastor Steve Anderson prayed for Obama " to die and go to hell " .
Quoth the man of God :
... you 're going to tell me that I 'm supposed to pray for the socialist devil , murderer , infanticide , who wants to see young children and he wants to see babies killed through abortion and partial - birth abortion and all these different things -- you 're gonna tell me I 'm supposed to pray for God to give him a good lunch tomorrow while he's in Phoenix , Arizona ?
Nope .
I 'm not gonna pray for his good .
I 'm going to pray that he dies and goes to hell .
Well , it appears that at least one of his flock may not be willing to wait for the Lord to move in His mysterious ways :
In an interview with ABC 15 outside the storefront Faithful Word Baptist Church in Tempe , Broughton said of Anderson 's controversial August 16 " Why I Hate Barack Obama " sermon : " I concur , I think we'd be better off if God would send [ Obama ] where he 's going now instead of later .
[ Obama ] is destroying our country . "
Okay , so Broughton wants Obama to die .
Nothing illegal about that , right ?
But wait , there 's more :
And when a reporter followed up with , " you 're not advocating violence against the president ? "
Broughton , who has previously said his weapons are for defense , says " I 'm not going to answer that question directly . "
Hmm , seems like a pretty straightforward question to me .
Why not answer it straightforwardly ?
Then he adds a chilling little coda :
" I do n't care how God does it , I 'm not going into further detail than that , " Broughton says .
" It would be better now than later . "
Okay , so we have a guy who shows up at a Presidential appearance heavily armed and openly carrying .
That 's creepy enough .
Now he says it would be a good thing if Obama dies now .
Should it be done with violence ?
He 'd prefer not to answer that question directly .
According to TPM , no word yet from the Secret Service on whether they 're investigating the matter further .
Added clarification : I do n't personally believe that this particular man is an imminent threat to President Obama .
For one thing , assassins do n't tend to broadcast their intentions .
The overall point of this diary is the ratcheting - up of violent rhetoric generally , and the corrosive effect it has on the discourse overall .
The more people talk about this sort of thing openly , the more acceptable it becomes , and the more others are encouraged to say the same things .
Or perhaps act .

At the heart of the Oklahoma City bombing case lies a lingering question :
How did just two men — Terry Nichols and Timothy McVeigh — manage to mix up a large bomb overnight at a Kansas lake , drive it into Oklahoma City and set it off at the Murrah Building on April 19 , 1995 ?
For a time , the FBI believed there was a third accessory to the crime , referred to as John Doe No. 2 and depicted in a police composite sketch as a muscular man with dark hair .
Investigators initially pursued the possibility that John Doe No. 2 was in the cab of the truck , jumped out before the bomb blew up , and made a clean getaway .
But then the government dropped all references to John Doe No. 2 .
Early on in the case it maintained that there was no evidence supporting the existence of a third participant , and insisted its extensive investigation proved that the bombing had been carried out by two main players : McVeigh and Nichols .
In the July / August 2007 issue of Mother Jones , I wrote about a strange twist in the investigation : the case of a laborer called Kenney Trentadue .
His brother Jesse , a Salt Lake City attorney , has accused federal agents of wrongly suspecting Kenney of being John Doe No. 2 .
When Kenney did not confess to aiding the bombing , Jesse Trentadue alleges , the agents beat him to death in a prison outside Oklahoma City and tried to cover it up by claiming he had killed himself .
Kenney ’s death was indeed ruled as a suicide , but Jesse said his body bore numerous injuries that could not have been entirely self - inflicted .
( The government later awarded the Trentadue family a $ 1.1 million settlement for its handling of the death . )
Ever since the bombing , Trentadue has been fighting the Bureau and Justice Department in one lawsuit after another to try and figure out what happened to his brother .
In the process he has delved deep into the bomb case itself .
He has sought to interview Nichols , a move opposed by the FBI and denied by a federal appeals court .
He has submitted FOIA requests to obtain CIA files on the bombing , with scant success .
Now his search has at last borne some fruit .
As the Associated Press reported Sunday , the government has released a set of surveillance tapes filmed moments before the bomb went off — tapes which have , until now , been withheld from the public .
When Trentadue looked at footage from the various cameras around the site , he said the tapes had a blank spot in the minutes before the blast — eliminating imagery of the truck carrying the bomb and people in the vehicle .
Trentadue concludes that key parts of the tapes have been edited out — an accusation certain to fuel suspicions that the government may have withheld relevant evidence in the case .

„ So ein Dekolleté hätte ich auch gerne “ , meinte eine meiner Tanten zu mir , als Angela Merkels Busen durch die Yellowpress ging * .
„ Ich bin direkt neidisch . “
Das war , als der Rest der Welt entdeckte , dass Angela Merkel Brüste hat .
Jetzt hat man entdeckt , dass Vera Lengsfeld Brüste hat und die auch noch vorzeigt .
Und Halina Wawzyniak einen Arsch .
Und das Wahlplakate nichts mit politischen Inhalten zu tun haben .
Ach nee .
Update : bitte den Kommentar mitlesen .
Ein Zwiegespräch zwischen dem Plakat und den Kritikern der Plakates stell ich mir ungefähr so vor : Das Plakat schreibt laut und euphorisch TITTEN ! , woraufhin der Kritiker entsetzt und die Haare raufend TITTEN !
schreit .
Wie schön , wie damals im Jugendclub , als wir 15 waren und rotzbesoffen .
Es gibt viel , was an Vera Lengsfeld auszusetzen ist : Dass sie damals Partei ergriffen hat für den Rechtsausleger Hohmann .
Sie glaubt , „ bei dem Journalisten Udo Ulfkotte findet man die besten Beiträge zur Terrorismusforschung in Deutschland “ und hält diese Seite für eine geeignete Form , mit der Umweltkatastrophenhysterie aufzuräumen .
Kurzum : Entweder sie ist nicht ganz dicht , oder schon zu sehr .
Und Grund genug , sich zu wünschen , sie nähme lieber ein Blatt vor ihren Mund statt vor ihr Dekolleté .
Aber dass sie mit Titten Wahlkampf macht , das kann man ihr nicht vorwerfen .
Im Gegenteil , dass eine Mittfünfzigerin offensiv mit ihrem Körper umgeht , ist sympathisch .
Hehre Ziele der Politik hin oder her , Wahlkampfplakate sind nie etwas anderes als Boulevard .
In drei Worten lässt sich kein Programm zusammenfassen , noch nicht einmal das der FDP .
Lengsfeld nimmt stattdessen eine Falte .
Das wissen natürlich auch alle Kommentatoren , die jetzt von der Boulevardisierung der Politik in mehr oder weniger entrüsteten Worten schreiben und in in ihren Artikeln dafür als einzigen Aufhänger die Brüste der Frau Lengsfeld verwenden .
Wer „ Titten geht gar nicht “ schreibt , sagt Titten .
Ich bin Vera Lengsfeld schon allein deswegen dankbar , weil in jedem Kommentarbereich nicht nur vereinzelt zu lesen ist , dass die ästhetisch ambitionierten verklemmten Spießer jetzt „ erblinden “ , dass sie sich bemüßigt fühlen , festzustellen , dass das mit den Titten doch in dem Alter gar nicht mehr gehe und die Scham - und Geschmacklosigkeit der Vera Lengsfeld anprangern .
Immer wieder wichtig , sich zu erinnern , mit wie vielen Idioten man sich die Straßen dieses Landes teilen muss .

Carbon nanotube - based photodiode
Cornell researchers fabricated , tested and measured a simple solar cell called a photodiode , formed from an individual carbon nanotube .
Using a carbon nanotube instead of traditional silicon , Cornell researchers have created the basic elements of a solar cell that hopefully will lead to much more efficient ways of converting light to electricity than now used in calculators and on rooftops .
The researchers fabricated , tested and measured a simple solar cell called a photodiode , formed from an individual carbon nanotube .
Reported online Sept. 11 in the journal Science , the researchers — led by Paul McEuen , the Goldwin Smith Professor of Physics , and Jiwoong Park , assistant professor of chemistry and chemical biology — describe how their device converts light to electricity in an extremely efficient process that multiplies the amount of electrical current that flows .
This process could prove important for next - generation high efficiency solar cells , the researchers say .
“ We are not only looking at a new material , but we actually put it into an application — a true solar cell device , ” said first author Nathan Gabor , a graduate student in McEuen ’s lab .
The researchers used a single - walled carbon nanotube , which is essentially a rolled - up sheet of graphene , to create their solar cell .
About the size of a DNA molecule , the nanotube was wired between two electrical contacts and close to two electrical gates , one negatively and one positively charged .
Their work was inspired in part by previous research in which scientists created a diode , which is a simple transistor that allows current to flow in only one direction , using a single - walled nanotube .
The Cornell team wanted to see what would happen if they built something similar , but this time shined light on it .
Shining lasers of different colors onto different areas of the nanotube , they found that higher levels of photon energy had a multiplying effect on how much electrical current was produced .
Further study revealed that the narrow , cylindrical structure of the carbon nanotube caused the electrons to be neatly squeezed through one by one .
The electrons moving through the nanotube became excited and created new electrons that continued to flow .
The nanotube , they discovered , may be a nearly ideal photovoltaic cell because it allowed electrons to create more electrons by utilizing the spare energy from the light .
This is unlike today ’s solar cells , in which extra energy is lost in the form of heat , and the cells require constant external cooling .
Though they have made a device , scaling it up to be inexpensive and reliable would be a serious challenge for engineers , Gabor said .
“ What we ’ve observed is that the physics is there , ” he said .

Do you struggle with having a manageable email Inbox ?
Are you worried that you ’re missing something important because you ca n’t keep up with the volume of email traffic you ’re getting ?
Do n’t worry , you ’re not alone – and there ’s an easier way to have less stress and overwhelm without being anal - retentive and that does n’t require you to learn to be anal - retentive about clearing your Inbox .
I ’ve written a lot about effective email habits , and I ’ve recommended using the R.A.F.T. ( Read - Act - File - Trash ) method to process your Inbox .
Over the course of time , though , I recognized some of the weaknesses of that particular method , and I ’ve changed things up a bit – the process that I ’ve distilled and now recommend is the S.T.A.R. method .
Here ’s a quick breakdown :
S stands for SCAN .
Scan your Inbox for senders and subjects .
This step gives you a higher perspective of what ’s in your Inbox – you have to know where you ’re starting from and where you ’re going .
T stands for TRASH – as in “ trash everything that ’s not relevant , useful , or something you want or need . ” 
You may see 60 % of the messages in your Inbox disappear from this one step alone .
A stands for ARCHIVE , as in “ archive relevant reference information . ” 
A lot of messages just contain information that you want to keep but that do n’t require any specific action from you at this time .
Archiving them clears them from your attention , and these may account for 20 - 30 % of the messages in your Inbox .
R stands for RESPOND , as in “ respond to what ’s left . ” 
This is the hardest step , when it comes down to it , as you ’ll actually have to do more than click on a few buttons .
But once you get down this far , you ’ll have a lot fewer messages , and that alone may give you the motivation to start working through these remaining messages .
The other main difference between the S.T.A.R. method and the R.A.F.T. method is that the goal of the S.T.A.R. method is not to get to Inbox Zero – instead , it gets you to a much more manageable Inbox that lets you have the perspective to consider what needs to be done with your Inbox in the context of everything else you need to be doing .
Why the S.T.A.R. Method Is Better Than the R.A.F.T. Method
When I recommended the R.A.F.T. method , I was heavily influenced by the literature on home and office organizing .
The R.A.F.T. method works beautifully for physical stuff , and two years ago , the volume of traffic sent by email was n’t as high as it is today , so it was a great start at an effective email habit .
While R.A.F.T. is great for helping you get your Inbox empty , it is much slower .
As the sheer volume of email messages increases , it becomes increasingly harder to actually get through your Inbox by using this method .
More importantly , though , the R.A.F.T. method does n’t incorporate two of the best features of modern email clients : 1 ) the ability to see , almost at a glance , everything that ’s in your Inbox , and 2 ) batch processing .
When you ’re dealing with physical files , you ca n’t see 80 discrete items at once , so you have to process them one at a time .
And even if you could see them all at once , you could only shift them around one item at a time .
However , email clients do allow you to see many more items at once .
And if you start from a more holistic perspective , you can see that many of the messages do n’t actually require your attention .
With a few clicks of a button , you can get rid of everything that does n’t require your attention quickly , and everything left is something that requires you to do something .
So , rather than having to process and evaluate everything as the R.A.F.T. method recommends , with the S.T.A.R. method you can quickly get to just those things that you should actually be spending time and effort on .
This makes the S.T.A.R. method much more effective and efficient .
Spend less time and energy fighting with your Inbox and more time doing other , more meaningful activities – give the S.T.A.R. method a try .

It ’s a product I designed that teaches you how to make rapid , effective decisions about what to do with what you have in your Inbox .
JULY 23 -- Here are the police reports detailing the confrontation last week between Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates , Jr. and Cambridge , Massachusetts cops , who were condemned last night by President Barack Obama for acting " stupidly " in arresting the African - American scholar .
Cops responded to Gates 's house after neighbor Lucia Whalen reported spotting " two black males with backpacks " trying to gain entry to the home ( Gates , returning home from a trip overseas , and his driver were contending with a stuck front door ) .
The Cambridge Police Department reports , authored by Sergeant James Crowley and Officer James Figueroa , quote an incensed Gates yelling , " This is what happens to black men in America ! , " and , when asked by Crowley to speak with him outside the residence , Gates replied , " Ya , I 'll speak with your mama outside . "
A disorderly conduct rap was filed against Gates , but quickly dropped by prosecutors .
Gates is reportedly considering legal action against the Cambridge police .

Britain will emerge last from recession among the world 's advanced economies , a leading international body warned yesterday .
As Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling prepare to welcome the world 's finance ministers to the G20 summit in London today , the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) said the UK would lag behind France , Germany , Japan and the US , among others , pouring scorn on hopes for a strong British recovery .
The OECD said that the UK would not see any growth in its economy until 2010 , at least six months after most of her competitors .
The OECD forecast a further shrinkage of 0.25 per cent in the UK's GDP this autumn , and stagnation for the rest of the year .

By contrast , the OECD said the world as whole would benefit from " mostly favourable " economic trends and would enjoy " an earlier recovery than envisaged " .
The OECD forecast that the British economy would contract by 4.7 per cent over 2009 , compared with its earlier forecast of a 4.3 per cent fall in output .
The UK was the only major - economy country to have its forecasts for growth reduced by the economic think - tank , which was relatively upbeat about the prospects for the rest of the world .
America is expected to return to growth in the third quarter of this year .
Japan , however , may see a fall in output again next year .
The news comes as an embarrassment to ministers , who are trying to persuade their international counterparts who meet at the full G20 leaders summit in Pittsburgh later this month to sustain the monetary and fiscal stimulus agreed with some difficulty at previous summits .
Nations returning to growth may no longer see the point of spending their way out of recessions that they are no longer in .
The UK still needs the benefits of the boost to her economy but is arguably less able to implement it , because of the parlous state of public finances and the scale of the Bank of England 's £ 175bn " quantitative easing " programme .
The Bank 's scheme and the Budget deficit are the most ambitious in the world , given the size of the UK economy .
Economists say neither can be sustained indefinitely .
The UK will also suffer for years from its public and private debt overhangs , the product of the largest credit binge in its history and the biggest Budget deficits in peace time .
A fragile banking system will also act as a brake on growth .
Last month the Office for National Statistics revealed worse - than - expected growth figures for the second quarter , which also prompted the OECD 's downgrade .
While a joint letter from Mr Brown , Germany 's Angela Merkel and France 's Nicolas Sarkozy stressed that no- one wanted to remove the stimulus packages immediately , there remain sharp differences of view about how quickly governments and central banks should prepare to implement their so - called " exit strategies " .
As more economies expand more vigorously – Australia announced an impressive bounce back earlier this week and China and India are continuing to accelerate – a slowdown in public spending and borrowing becomes more likely , as does a reduction in central bank schemes to inject money into the financial system .
Paris and Berlin have made little secret of their desire to rein in such plans .
Hopes that the European economic establishment would heed British pleas suffered a further setback yesterday when the president of the European Central Bank , Jean - Claude Trichet said : " It is crucial that ambitious and realistic fiscal exit and consolidation strategies , underpinned by concrete structural measures , are put in place .
The structural adjustment process should start , in any case , not later than the economic recovery and the consolidation efforts should be stepped up in 2011 . "
US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner offered limited support for Mr Darling ' s pleas , saying that the talks this weekend were the start of discussions on exit strategy and that " it 's too early to talk about detailed road maps for unwinding " .
The OECD called for an earlier than anticipated withdrawal of official support for economies :
" The possibility of a recovery taking hold a little sooner than envisaged only a few months ago diminishes the likelihood that further fiscal stimulus will be needed " .
Even so , the OECD stressed that , while the recovery may have arrived sooner than expected , it will be " slow " and subject to " numerous headwinds " .
High unemployment and fragile house prices meant the recovery was " ' likely to be modest for some time to come ' " .
Consensus seems to be emerging among G20 ministers on taking the task of banking regulation a step further , however , the issue of banker 's pay and bonuses remains contentious .
Listen to what Gregg says very closely .
He gives NO ANSWERS in his vagueness .
He tells us NOTHING on insuring the millions that are uninsured or underinsured in this country .
It is all about keeping the insurance companies in BUSINESS .
Again , if the insurance companies were honest brokers with the American Public through the years , we would not even have this discussion NOW .
Microsoft Apologizes for “ Separate but Equal ” Photo - Editing Blunder
In the old days , when you wanted to make a photo more palatable for an Eastern European state , you just airbrushed it , and no one complained ( out loud ) .
Now it ’s easier than ever to alter an image .
But it ’s harder to get away with it .
Ask Microsoft , which just got caught digitally erasing a black man from a promotional photo and replacing him with a white guy .
The original photo ran on a U.S. version of a Microsoft promotional site ; the ( clumsily ) retouched version ended up on a Polish version .
CNET has before and after screenshots ( click to enlarge ) :

Microsoft ( MSFT ) has since replaced the Polish photo with the original , and apologized last night .

Victims of domestic abuse can hide the truth from doctors , but they leave clues in their medical records that a computer program has now learned to follow .
The program could save lives by acting as an early warning system for domestic violence , flagging up possible cases of abuse to doctors months or even years before they would otherwise be detected .
“ You are potentially able to detect high abuse risk years ahead of time : you do n’t wait for a very bad thing to happen , ” says Ben Reis at Children ’s Hospital Boston and Harvard Medical School , who led the new study .
Though domestic abuse occurs in up to 16 per cent of US couples every year , it ’s notoriously difficult for doctors and nurses to spot , Reis says .
Victims and abusers frequently make excuses for emergency room visits – saying that an injury caused by a partner ’s assault was due to a fall , for instance .
Studies have shown that some go so far as to visit different hospitals to avoid a pattern of injuries getting noticed .
Advertisement
Doctors are trained – or required , in some hospitals – to be on the lookout for domestic violence , but isolated emergency room visits make it difficult for them to spot patterns that could be a sign of domestic violence .
Trails of violence
To make these patterns more apparent , Reis and his colleagues Isaac Kohane and Kenneth Mandl turned to the medical histories of 561,000 people over six years in a single US state .
About 19,000 of these people were known to have been domestically abused .
To protect confidentiality , the team did not identify the state where the people lived .
Their program started by searching two - thirds of the records for differences between the histories of people who were abused by their partners and those of people who were not known to have been abused .
“ Unsupervised , you tell us , computer : what are the risk factors ?
What are the things highly associated with future diagnosis of abuse ? ” says Reis , summarising his approach .
New clues
The program produced a set of rules based on the differences it found .
These were mainly based on patterns of injuries and bouts of mental illness – signs of abuse that doctors already look for .
But the program also found new clues , including some that pick out victims of one sex but not the other .
Alcoholism , for instance , is a red flag for abuse in women , but not men , because it is less common among women in general .
In contrast , depression and other mood disorders are a strong predictor of abuse in men , but less so for women .
To see how useful the rules could be for detecting domestic violence , the team fed the remaining medical histories to the program .
They found that on average it detected abuse earlier in people ’s records than their doctors had .
“ Sometimes doctors are blinded because they do n’t have access to 10 years of medical history , ” he says .
“ We ’re trying to empower the doctors to make the decision . ”
The usefulness of the program varied greatly between patients .
In some , the program flagged abuse six years earlier than doctors had , but in others the warning came just before doctors noticed – or not at all .
Reis ’s team could also tweak the sensitivity of the software to lengthen or shorten this window .
Setting the program to tolerate higher rates of “ false positives ” – instances where the program flags up abuse , even though none was ever detected by a doctor – meant it also caught more cases of real abuse earlier .
Under one scenario , a 10 per cent false - positive rate turned up two - thirds of abuses an average of two years before being reported .

Collaboration is one key area every company still need alot to work on .
Right kind of Collaboration tools can do wonder for you and your business .
Most Business models today rely on basic collaboration that includes nothing more than Email , IM , Screen sharing .
Which is barely sufficient , for atleast the way they think about it .
What is meant by a Good Collaboration has alot more than these inferior ways of communication .
– Unified Communications – A single device that lets you control over everything .
It can be a single messenger / gadget that can handle your VoIP , Messages / Emails , instant messaging , Realtime Video conferencing and NextGeneration Screen sharing / control .
How do you end up cutting Cost ?
– Travel – As per Gartner , business spent $ 41 Billion in last year alone for travel .
Imagine the scope of savings when you no longer have to travel because of proper Collaboration tools like Cisco ’s Telepresence , etc .
– Time – Time is Money for every business .
Improper communication tools has discouraged fast business models to evade deals at faster rates .
The means of accessibility , travel , access to data , analytics ; everthing causes delays in the business and hence heavy losses .
Acoording to a research , 60 % of the time today is spent achieving what could have been possible to achieve , with proper collaboration , in only 10 % of the time .

Over the past 70 years , the national government has overstepped its powers in enforcing what has become a prohibition against cannabis .
Equally shocking is the failure of the media to act as a watchdog against federal agencies and reflect the mores of a changing America .
In a three part mini-series , three interconnected contributors to cannabis prohibition will be discussed .
Legalization has made procuring marijuana safe and profitable , and over the course of the next month , the Oakland city council will strongly consider passing a bill taxing the $ 20 million in legal marijuana sales that coffee shops and clubs made in profit last year .
Though California is the most liberal example , 13 states have decided to legalize medical marijuana .
Others , like New York , have decriminalized small amounts of cannabis .
But while throughout the country citizens are electing local and state officials who reflect their more tolerant view of marijuana , the national government continues to ignore the will of the people .
Upstanding citizens like Charlie Lynch and Ed Rosenthal , who grew and sold medical marijuana within California 's state guidelines , have been prosecuted in federal court .
Drug enforcement agencies have regularly harassed citizens by superseding state law , and ignoring local policy in federal court .
" In a federal court you cannot even mention the medical marijuana card , because the federal government has the ' Alice in Wonderland ' delusion that medical marijuana does n't exist , " said Allen St. Pierre , director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) .
" Ed Rosenthal had video tapes of him and a chief of police with his marijuana that were not even allowed to be shown in court . "
Rosenthal did everything within his power to ensure that his operation was within the law , yet in federal court he was found guilty of three felonies .
In 2007 Lynch was involved in a similar case , where his medical marijuana store was harassed before his home and business was raided by DEA agents with guns and shields .
" They sent in undercover sheriff 's deputies to go encourage Charlie to break the federal law , " said Lynch 's lawyer , John Littrell .
" In every case , what they found was that his employees always verified doctors ' recommendations .
No one could manage to get anybody - Charlie or anyone that Charlie was working with - to dispense marijuana in a way that violated state law . "
There are many marijuana users and businessmen persecuted in the same way as Lynch , who received a minimum year sentence from a federal judge .
These citizens are not dealing drugs in a back alley , they are selling " medicine " in stores .
Businessmen like Lynch and Rosenthal have shown the ability to legitimize a black market industry , and turn it into a profitable and taxable cash crop .
Local and state government can afford to be more responsive to the changes of citizens ' attitudes , and should be given greater influence in enforcing marijuana laws .
More importantly , the powers not delegated to national government by the U.S. Constitution are reserved by the states .
Citizens like Lynch and Rosenthal are not criminals , and their cases do not warrant the suspension of the 10th Amendment .
Americans ' opinions on the practicality of legalizing a drug less potent than alcohol is changing , and this is being made possible partially through the examples set by California and 12 other states .
Voters in California have told elected officials their views on marijuana , and the state has responded .
The Drug Enforcement Administration and its " War on Drugs " was not created to limit democracy by circumventing state law and policy .
" Executive departments and agencies have sometimes announced their regulations preempt state law , including state common law , without explicit preemption by the Congress or an otherwise sufficient basis under applicable legal principles , " read a memo on May 20 from the office of the press secretary to the heads of executive departments and agencies .
Thankfully , President Obama has indicated through his May 20 press release that the national government is no longer willing to ignore the constitution to continue this prohibition against pot .
Unfortunately , this comes on the heels of federal anti-drug agencies acting overzealously with their policies , willing to ignore both the law and the Bill of Rights to catch more marijuana users .
Perhaps in an attempt to propagate themselves , institutions like the DEA and other enforcement agencies have continued this prohibition against cannabis in sovereign states no longer desiring persecution .
Values are changing slowly about cannabis , and state governments need their constitutional right to govern .

Honda ’s bulletproof enduro weapon for the latter part of the twentieth century was the XL600 , a big four - valve thumper built to handle desert rallies .
There were several variants and upgrades , and they were n’t pretty bikes — but with a few modifications , the XL was surprisingly capable on the road .
This street tracker conversion , however , sure is a pretty bike .
You can see how it was built on Thierry ’s Roc Street Tracker site .
We suspect the powerful XL600R has the makings of a cult classic , and in the years to come , may even be mentioned in the same breath as the SR400 and W650 .

OTTAWA – The Harper government has no plans to act on opposition calls for a national standard on the number of work hours needed to collect EI , says a cabinet minister .
" We 're not open " to the idea of 360 hours as a minimum threshold for benefits , " National Revenue Minister Jean - Pierre Blackburn said today outside the House of Commons .
" We 're acting , " he said , referring to Conservative changes that extended EI benefits by five weeks regardless of region .
Demand for EI has soared by more than 20 per cent in parts of the country hardest hit by the economic slide .
And the issue is shaping up to be a key factor in how long an increasingly fractious minority Parliament survives .
Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff is demanding to see changes to the EI system by the time Parliament adjourns for the summer in June .
Following the Liberals ' national convention on the weekend , Ignatieff suggested EI could be the issue that triggers another federal vote .
He says there 's a patchwork of entrance requirements across the country and called on Prime Minister Stephen Harper to commit to a national standard of 360 hours as a threshold for collecting benefits .
" Canadians are hurting from this recession , and yet our EI system leaves too many unemployed workers out in the cold and discriminates against them based on where in Canada they live , " he said .
" We have record job losses – 357,000 and counting – and a government that has failed to adequately reform EI to accommodate the current economic circumstances . "
The Bloc Quebecois has also pressed for a 360 - hour threshold .
Asked specifically about the 360 - hour standard , Blackburn said today the government is " not open " to such changes .
Pressed on whether the Conservatives are willing to fight an election on the matter , he said " bonjour " and ended the media scrum .
The issue once again dominated the daily question period in the Commons .
Harper touted recent improvements made to EI , a system he says is ``generous . "
" Mr. Speaker , as the leader of the Liberal party should know , Canada has a very generous system of employment insurance that was , in fact , enhanced in the most recent economic action plan of this government . "
NDP Leader Jack Layton says those changes , which include an extra five weeks ' of benefits regardless of where the person lives , do n't go far enough .
Layton is pushing for the minimum number of required hours to be set at 360 and for elimination of the two - week unpaid waiting period before benefits kick in .
He demanded the Tories adopt these and more wide - ranging measures contained in a motion recently passed by MPs .
" Women are not being treated equally , people in different regions across the country are not being treated equally , " Layton said in the Commons .

" The Liberal record is clear .
Before Liberals took government , 75 per cent of workers were able to get EI help when they needed it .
When they left , it was down to 40 per cent .
Now is the chance to fix it . "
Ignatieff says the EI system – with 54 different regional rates that now apply – is ripe for overhaul .
The wife of Conservative cabinet heavyweight Jim Flaherty , the finance minister , is also publicly calling for major changes .
" The federal EI program is unfair to Ontario , " said Christine Elliott , MPP for Whitby - Oshawa and an Ontario Tory leadership hopeful .
Both Elliott and her husband have seen their ridings sideswiped by auto - sector and manufacturing layoffs .
" Ontarians who pay into EI during the good times should get benefits when they need them , just like they were promised , " she said .
Ontario should consider opting out to create its own system if Ottawa wo n't fix the federal one , she said .
Ignatieff has denied he 's jockeying for an EI electoral showdown .
But he has stressed : " If we ca n't make ( Parliament ) work , then the people will have to sort it out . "
Election timing is not under Liberal control in any case .
All three opposition parties would have to join to force what would be the fourth federal election in five years .
And there are signs the NDP and Bloc Quebecois are shying away from campaign prospects as Liberals gain political steam .
Bloc Leader Gilles Duceppe said the party will wait to see what the government does on EI before deciding whether it can co-operate on that and other issues .
After months of voting non-confidence in the government at every turn , both the NDP and the Bloc are now hinting they could co-operate with the Tories on various causes , including EI reform .

The Way We Live Now : Always forgetting .
We 're back into stocks !
We 're back to buying art !
We 're ... poor !
Statistics prove it .
But we already forgot .
Live it up , for tomorrow you may die of something weird .
" Cautiously , Small Investors Edge Back Into Stocks . "
Here 's some news for you , small investors : you 're screwed either way .
If you really had balls you would have bought heavy into stocks the whole time they were cratering .
If you were incredibly prudent you would have plowed it all into CDs and bonds and been satisfied with slow and steady .
But , " Cautiously , " you edge out just far enough on the plank to see what 's going on in the wild seas , and woops — get pushed right off by all the other suckers crowding on that same plank with you .
I do n't really know much about stocks .
Another thing I do n't know much about : the art market .
What 's this we hear about auctioneer Phillips de Pury & Co. adding 18 new sales of contemporary art in the coming year ?
I would swear it 's some sort of hunger - crazed rat burrowing into my ear canal in desperate search of food now that all the edible scraps have been snapped up by unemployed human hobos , but no , it says it right there in the WSJ .
And furthermore the head of this alleged auction house is named " Bernd Runge " and he calls himself an " art virgin " and he says he wants to sell this art , including some about " Sex , " to people who have n't even bought art before ?
We have a name for those people : " Suckers , " we call them , and their preferred form of " art " is colorful marker drawings of their own name by Chinese men sitting on stools in Times Square , okay .
Just forget it , " Bernd . "
We remember what happened last time a bunch of idiots started bidding and bidding on dumb art : Damien Hirst .
The new census tells us something a little different , you snake oil salesmen .
It tells us we wo n't be buying many stocks or art or anything else from " Bernd , " because one in five kids under 18 live in poverty , and our median household national income has fallen to barely over $ 50 k .
That 's not even enough to buy Damien Hirst 's left nut , the one without the diamonds on it .
Never forget that we are all financially illiterate .

THE EVERGLADES , Florida ( CNN ) -- Joe Wasilewski drives along a narrow stretch of road through Florida 's Everglades .
The sun is setting , night is coming on quickly , and Wasilewski is on the prowl for snakes -- and one snake in particular .
Reptile expert Joe Wasilewski holds a Burmese python he found in the Florida Everglades .
" The next 10 miles seem to be the hot spot for Burmese pythons , " he said .
Wasilewski is a state - sanctioned snake - hunter who regularly scours this area for the reptiles .
The Everglades , known as the River of Grass , has the perfect space and climate for pythons to hide and breed .
And breed they do :
The largest clutches found in the Everglades have contained 83 eggs .
They are also speedy travelers , able to move across 1.6 miles of land every day , experts say .
The travel lets people like Wasilewski hunt the snakes from the driver 's seat of his truck .
But it also means that the problems created in the local ecosystem by the non-venomous snakes are spreading .
" It 's a large predator , and they 're eating basically everything in sight .
That 's the problem , " Wasilewski said of the Burmese python .
Volunteers like Wasilewski , happy to grasp the problem and the snakes with both hands , are not the only troops in Florida 's war on the invading pythons .
A " Python Patrol " was launched in the Florida Keys , south of the Everglades , by Alison Higgins of the Nature Conservancy .
Her program uses utility workers , wildlife officials , park rangers and police to keep an eye out for snakes and trains them to capture any they find .
" The Burmese pythons that are coming out of the Everglades are eating a lot of our endangered species and other creatures , and we want to make sure they do n't breed here , " said Higgins , the conservation manager for the Keys .
It is believed that the problem originated when reptile - breeding facilities near the Everglades were destroyed during Hurricane Andrew .
Compounding the problem is the release of these snakes by pet owners .
" These pets were released by owners that do not understand the threat to the ecosystem , " Everglades National Park spokeswoman Linda Friar said .
She said the pets , which can grow to 200 pounds and live for 30 years , often get too big for owners to handle .
The state has a pilot program with several volunteer snake hunters such as Wasilewski .
Twenty years ago , no Burmese pythons were found in the Everglades , park statistics say .
Now , there could be 100,000 snakes in the River of Grass , but no one knows for sure .
What Wasilewski , an expert on reptiles , is sure of is that night is the best time for his hunting , as that is when the snakes tend to be on the move .
When he finds his prey , he puts the snake in a bag , deposits it in a crate and delivers it to biologists for the Everglades National Park , where the snake can be studied and / or destroyed .
On one recent evening , the pickings were slim , and after two hours of driving back and forth along the two - lane Tamiami Trail , Wasilewski 's crate was empty .
He saw a python on the road , but it was dead , and the other small snakes and a baby alligator in the area did not interest him .
Finally , Wasilewski , an environmental and wildlife consultant , spotted something .
" Yeah , baby !
Hee ha !
Look at the size of this one , " he exclaimed from the front seat of his truck .
He got out and picked up the brownish - green snake , which immediately coiled around his arm .
" This is n't a big one , " he said , but as he got a closer look , he did not deny that it was a good one : " At least 12 [ feet . ] "
Wasilewski has a soft spot for these species , and one of the reasons he volunteers for the snake hunt is to learn more about them .
He says it is not the snakes ' fault that they ended up in the Everglades , but he acknowledges the problems they are causing on the Florida ecosystem and the need to do something .
" One down , 100,000 to go , " he said .

JOHANNESBURG /KERUGOYA , Kenya ( Reuters ) - Mini hydro plants could be the answer to a lack of power in rural Africa , especially as larger power projects are put on hold due to limited cash and abundant red tape , industry officials say .
Workers stand next to a NuPlanet 's mini hydro plant in Bethlehem September 2 , 2009 .

Analysts say the continent could generate as much as 330,000 megawatts ( MW ) from its hydro reserves , yet only some 7 percent of that potential has been exploited so far .
But rather than trying to build big dams such as the Grand Inga dam in the Democratic Republic of Congo , which comes with political risk and an $ 80 billion price tag , communities and investors are looking into developing smaller plants .
“ It ’s a very effective way of providing electricity .
The lifespan of a mini hydro scheme could be 20 years or more , ” said Steven Hunt , an energy consultant based in London .
Hunt said most projects in Africa would be 10 kilowatts to 10 MW .
So far only one in four Africans is linked to the grid , but power needs on the continent are estimated to triple by 2035 .
Small hydro plants , involving small dams , pumps or water mills , can light villages with minimal environmental impact .
A 7 MW plant in the South African town of Bethlehem is expected to supply power to 15 percent of the roughly 70,000 people , at a total cost of 100 million rand ( $ 13.24 million ) .
Mini plants satisfy people ’s basic needs , like the 0.75 kilowatt turbine in Kenya ’s Kerugoya village which gives access to power without forcing people to walk miles to the next town .
“ Now people can walk from their homes to this site and access the Internet , print and charge their mobile phones , ” said James Kinyua , the head of the project .
The part self - help , part donor - funded project is one of many initiatives across Africa to bring electricity to people not yet covered by national grids .
Zimbabwe is estimated to be able to generate up to 85 MW from small hydro on free - flowing rivers and irrigation dams to supply electricity to farmers whose production could help fight food shortages in the country .
“ Power is essential for development .
The minute power becomes available , it enables a number of activities , ” said Felix Kiptum , a U.N. renewable energy consultant .
African governments say the extension of electricity lines to more people is a priority .
Kenya is in the process of adding 200,000 new electricity consumers every year until 2012 .
While South Africa plans to electrify the country by 2012 , Rwanda has said it requires $ 200 million by the same year to add 220,000 new customers to the national grid .
Rwanda , which relies on diesel , high fuel oils ( HFO ) generators and imports to complement the 43 MW generated from hydro- electric power , has identified 333 potential hydro sites .
A mix of infrastructure bonds , mobilization of donor funds and even the small community ’s initiative like the one in Kerugoya are all fair game to increase electrification .
Civic group Practical Action is building 15 mini hydro plants in Zimbabwe , Malawi and Mozambique to light homes , schools and clinics and to irrigate fields .
Kenya , the world ’s largest exporter of black tea , also plans to build 10 mini hydro plants supplying a total of 23 MW to irrigate tea plantations .
Mini hydro projects will also help retain professionals such as teachers and health workers in rural areas .
“ People will not be running away to go to the urban areas ... ( power ) is the thing they desire everyday , ” Kinyua said .
( CNN ) -- Beastie Boy Adam " MCA " Yauch is recovering from surgery to treat a tumor and gearing up for radiation treatments , according to an e-mail he sent to his fans .
Beastie Boy Adam " MCA " Yauch said he is doing well after cancer surgery .
Yauch recently sent the e-mail with the subject line " What I did over my summer vacation " after having revealed in July that he had a cancerous tumor in a salivary gland .
" So I 'm about a week and a half out of surgery now and rapidly recovering from it , " the e-mail said .
" I have n't taken any of the pain meds , which supposedly speeds along the healing process , or should I say , taking them slows it down . "
The rapper said he was faring well , other than a stiff neck and jaw , and went on to say he expected to start seven weeks of radiation treatments soon .
The cancer was in his left parotid gland and " also in a lymph node right in that area , " he said last month in a video statement .
In the e-mail , Yauch thanked everyone " who sent positive thoughts my way " and gave a thumbs - up to the recent Jay - Z and Coldplay cover performances of " No Sleep Till Brooklyn " and " ( You Gotta ) Fight For Your Right ( to Party ) " at the 2009 All Points West Music and Arts Festival held in New Jersey , which Yauch said he saw via YouTube .
Jay - Z replaced the Beastie Boys as headliners of the festival .
" And I heard Karen O [ of the group Yeah Yeah Yeahs ] wore a ' Get well MCA ' armband , and that [ rapper ] Q - Tip gave a shout out too ... very kind of them , " Yauch 's e-mail said .
Yauch 's illness caused the cancellation of upcoming Beastie Boys concerts and will delay the release of the band 's next album , " Hot Sauce Committee Part 1 . "

Classes
The object - oriented features of D all come from classes .
The class hierarchy has as its root the class Object .
Object defines a minimum level of functionality that each derived class has , and a default implementation for that functionality .
Classes are programmer defined types .
Support for classes are what make D an object oriented language , giving it encapsulation , inheritance , and polymorphism .
D classes support the single inheritance paradigm , extended by adding support for interfaces .
Class objects are instantiated by reference only .
A class can be exported , which means its name and all its non-private members are exposed externally to the DLL or EXE .
A class declaration is defined :
ClassDeclaration : class Identifier BaseClassList opt ClassBody ClassTemplateDeclaration BaseClassList : : SuperClass : SuperClass , Interfaces : Interfaces SuperClass : Identifier Interfaces : Interface Interface , Interfaces Interface : Identifier ClassBody : { } { ClassBodyDeclarations } ClassBodyDeclarations : ClassBodyDeclaration ClassBodyDeclaration ClassBodyDeclarations ClassBodyDeclaration : DeclDef Invariant ClassAllocator ClassDeallocator
class Foo { ... members ... }
class
Foo { } var ;
class Foo { } Foo var ;
Access Control
Classes consist of : A class is defined : Note that there is no trailing ; after the closing } of the class definition .
It is also not possible to declare a variable var like : Instead :
Access to class members is controlled using ProtectionAttributes .
The default protection attribute is public .
Access control does not affect visibility .
Fields
Class members are always accessed with the . operator .
Members of a base class can be accessed by prepending the name of the base class followed by a dot :
class A { int a ; } class B : A { int a ; } void foo ( B b ) { b.a = 3 ; b.A.a = 4 ;
The D compiler is free to rearrange the order of fields in a class to optimally pack them in an implementation - defined manner .
Consider the fields much like the local variables in a function - the compiler assigns some to registers and shuffles others around all to get the optimal stack frame layout .
This frees the code designer to organize the fields in a manner that makes the code more readable rather than being forced to organize it according to machine optimization rules .
Explicit control of field layout is provided by struct / union types , not classes .
Field Properties
The .offsetof property gives the offset in bytes of the field from the beginning of the class instantiation .
.offsetof can only be applied to expressions which produce the type of the field itself , not the class type :
class
Foo { int x ; } ... void test ( Foo foo ) { size_t o ; o = Foo.x.offsetof ; o = foo.x.offsetof ; }
Class Properties
The .tupleof property returns an ExpressionTuple of all the fields in the class , excluding the hidden fields and the fields in the base class .
class
Foo { int x ; long y ; } void test ( Foo foo ) { foo.tupleof [ 0 ] = 1 ; foo.tupleof [ 1 ] = 2 ; foreach ( x ; foo.tupleof ) writef ( x ) ; }
The properties .__vptr and .__monitor give access to the class object 's vtbl[ ] and monitor , respectively , but should not be used in user code .
Super Class
All classes inherit from a super class .
If one is not specified , it inherits from Object .
Object forms the root of the D class inheritance hierarchy .
Non-static member functions have an extra hidden parameter called this through which the class object 's other members can be accessed .
Synchronized class member functions have the storage class synchronized .
A static member function is synchronized on the classinfo object for the class , which means that one monitor is used for all static synchronized member functions for that class .
For non-static synchronized functions , the monitor used is part of the class object .
For example :
class Foo { synchronized void bar ( ) { ... statements ... } }
is equivalent to ( as far as the monitors go ) :
class Foo { void bar ( ) { synchronized ( this ) { ... statements ... } } }
Structs do not have synchronized member functions .
Constructor : this Parameters FunctionBody
Members are always initialized to the default initializer for their type , which is usually 0 for integer types and NAN for floating point types .
This eliminates an entire class of obscure problems that come from neglecting to initialize a member in one of the constructors .
In the class definition , there can be a static initializer to be used instead of the default :
class Abc { int a ; long b = 7 ; float f ; }
This static initialization is done before any constructors are called .
Constructors are defined with a function name of this and having no return value :
class
Foo { this ( int x ) { ... } this ( ) { ... } }
class A { this ( int y ) { } } class B : A { int j ; this ( ) { ... super ( 3 ) ; ... } }
Base class construction is done by calling the base class constructor by the name
Constructors can also call other constructors for the same class in order to share common initializations ( this is called delegating constructors ) :
class C { int j ; this ( ) { ... } this ( int i ) { this ( ) ; j = i ; } }
If no call to constructors viaorappear in a constructor , and the base class has a constructor , a call to ( ) is inserted at the beginning of the constructor .
If there is no constructor for a class , but there is a constructor for the base class , a default constructor of the form :
this () { }
is implicitly generated .
Class object construction is very flexible , but some restrictions apply :
It is illegal for constructors to mutually call each other , although the compiler is not required to detect it .
It will result in undefined behavior .
this ( ) { this ( 1 ) ; } this ( int i ) { this ( ) ; }
If any constructor call appears inside a constructor , any path through the constructor must make exactly one constructor call : this ( ) { a || super ( ) ; } this ( ) { ( a ) ? this ( 1 ) : super ( ) ; } this ( ) { for (... ) { super ( ) ; } }
It is illegal to refer to this implicitly or explicitly prior to making a constructor call .
Constructor calls cannot appear after labels ( in order to make it easy to check for the previous conditions in the presence of goto's ) .
Instances of class objects are created with NewExpressions :
A a = new A ( 3 ) ;
The following steps happen :
Storage is allocated for the object .
If this fails , rather than return null , an OutOfMemory Error is thrown .
Thus , tedious checks for null references are unnecessary .
The raw data is statically initialized using the values provided in the class definition .
The pointer to the vtbl [ ] ( the array of pointers to virtual functions ) is assigned .
This ensures that constructors are passed fully formed objects for which virtual functions can be called .
This operation is equivalent to doing a memory copy of a static version of the object onto the newly allocated one , although more advanced compilers may be able to optimize much of this away .
If there is a constructor defined for the class , the constructor matching the argument list is called .
If class invariant checking is turned on , the class invariant is called at the end of the constructor .
Destructor : ~ this ( ) FunctionBody
class Foo { ~ this () { } }
The garbage collector calls the destructor function when the object is deleted .
The syntax is :
There can be only one destructor per class , the destructor does not have any parameters , and has no attributes .
It is always virtual .
The destructor is expected to release any resources held by the object .
The program can explicitly inform the garbage collector that an object is no longer referred to ( with the delete expression ) , and then the garbage collector calls the destructor immediately , and adds the object 's memory to the free storage .
The destructor is guaranteed to never be called twice .
The destructor for the super class automatically gets called when the destructor ends .
There is no way to call the super destructor explicitly .
The garbage collector is not guaranteed to run the destructor for all unreferenced objects .
Furthermore , the order in which the garbage collector calls destructors for unreference objects is not specified .
This means that when the garbage collector calls a destructor for an object of a class that has members that are references to garbage collected objects , those references may no longer be valid .
This means that destructors cannot reference sub objects .
This rule does not apply to auto objects or objects deleted with the DeleteExpression , as the destructor is not being run by the garbage collector , meaning all references are valid .
Objects referenced from the data segment never get collected by the gc .
Static Constructors
StaticConstructor : static this ( ) FunctionBody
A static constructor is a function that performs initializations before the main ( ) function gets control .
Static constructors are used to initialize static class members with values that cannot be computed at compile time .
Static constructors in other languages are built implicitly by using member initializers that can't be computed at compile time .
The trouble with this stems from not having good control over exactly when the code is executed , for example :
class
Foo { static int a = b + 1 ; static int b = a * 2 ; }
What values do a and b end up with , what order are the initializations executed in , what are the values of a and b before the initializations are run , is this a compile error , or is this a runtime error ?
Additional confusion comes from it not being obvious if an initializer is static or dynamic .
D makes this simple .
All member initializations must be determinable by the compiler at compile time , hence there is no order - of - evaluation dependency for member initializations , and it is not possible to read a value that has not been initialized .
Dynamic initialization is performed by a static constructor , defined with a special syntax static this ( ) .
class
Foo { static int a ; static int b = 1 ; static int c = b + a ; static this ( ) { a = b + 1 ; b = a * 2 ; } }
If main ( ) returns normally ( does not throw an exception ) , the static destructor is added to the list of functions to be called on program termination .
Static constructors have empty parameter lists .
Static constructors within a module are executed in the lexical order in which they appear .
All the static constructors for modules that are directly or indirectly imported are executed before the static constructors for the importer .
The static in the static constructor declaration is not an attribute , it must appear immediately before the this :
class
Foo { static this ( ) { ... } static private this ( ) { ... } static { this ( ) { ... } } static : this ( ) { ... } }
Static Destructors
StaticDestructor : static ~ this ( ) FunctionBody
static ~ this ( )
class
Foo { static ~ this () { } }
A static destructor is defined as a special static function with the syntax
A static destructor gets called on program termination , but only if the static constructor completed successfully .
Static destructors have empty parameter lists .
Static destructors get called in the reverse order that the static constructors were called in .
The static in the static destructor declaration is not an attribute , it must appear immediately before the ~this :
class
Foo { static ~ this ( ) { ... } static private ~ this ( ) { ... } static { ~ this ( ) { ... } } static : ~ this ( ) { ... } }
Invariant : invariant ( ) BlockStatement
class Date { int day ; int hour ; invariant ( ) { assert ( 1 <= day && day <= 31 ) ; assert ( 0 <= hour && hour < 24 ) ; } }
Class invariants are used to specify characteristics of a class that always must be true ( except while executing a member function ) .
For example , a class representing a date might have an invariant that the day must be 1..31 and the hour must be 0..23 :
The class invariant is a contract saying that the asserts must hold true .
The invariant is checked when a class constructor completes , at the start of the class destructor .
For public or exported functions , the order of execution is :
preconditions invariant body invariant postconditions
The code in the invariant may not call any public non-static members of the class , either directly or indirectly .
Doing so will result in a stack overflow , as the invariant will wind up being called in an infinitely recursive manner .
Since the invariant is called at the start of public or exported members , such members should not be called from constructors .
class
Foo { public void f( ) { } private void g( ) { } invariant ( ) { f( ) ; g( ) ; } }
assert ( )
Date mydate ; ... assert ( mydate ) ;
AssertError
The invariant can be checked when a class object is the argument to anexpression , as : Invariants contain assert expressions , and so when they fail , they throw as .
Class invariants are inherited , that is , any class invariant is implicitly anded with the invariants of its base classes .
There can be only one Invariant per class .
When compiling for release , the invariant code is not generated , and the compiled program runs at maximum speed .
ClassAllocator : new Parameters FunctionBody
new ( uint size ) { ... }
new Foo ;
void *
class
Foo { this ( char [ ] a ) { ... } new ( uint size , int x , int y ) { ... } } ... new ( 1,2 ) Foo(a ) ;
A class member function of the form : is called a class allocator .
The class allocator can have any number of parameters , provided the first one is of type uint .
Any number can be defined for a class , the correct one is determined by the usual function overloading rules .
When a new expression : is executed , and Foo is a class that has an allocator , the allocator is called with the first argument set to the size in bytes of the memory to be allocated for the instance .
The allocator must allocate the memory and return it as a .
If the allocator fails , it must not return a , but must throw an exception .
If there is more than one parameter to the allocator , the additional arguments are specified within parentheses after thein the
Derived classes inherit any allocator from their base class , if one is not specified .
The class allocator is not called if the instance is created on the stack .
See also Explicit Class Instance Allocation .
ClassDeallocator : delete Parameters FunctionBody
delete ( void * p ) { ... }
void *
delete f ;
A class member function of the form : is called a class deallocator .
The deallocator must have exactly one parameter of type .
Only one can be specified for a class .
When a delete expression :
is executed , and f is a reference to a class instance that has a deallocator , the deallocator is called with a pointer to the class instance after the destructor ( if any ) for the class is called .
It is the responsibility of the deallocator to free the memory .
Derived classes inherit any deallocator from their base class , if one is not specified .
The class allocator is not called if the instance is created on the stack .
See also Explicit Class Instance Allocation .
scope class Foo { ... }
A scope class is a class with theattribute , as in :
The scope characteristic is inherited , so if any classes derived from a scope class are also scope .
An scope class reference can only appear as a function local variable .
It must be declared as being scope :
scope class Foo { ... } void func ( ) { Foo f ; scope Foo g = new Foo( ) ; }
When an scope class reference goes out of scope , the destructor ( if any ) for it is automatically called .
This holds true even if the scope was exited via a thrown exception .
Final classes cannot be subclassed :
final class A { } class B : A { }
class Outer { int m ; class Inner { int foo( ) { return m ; } } } void func ( ) { int m ; class Inner { int foo ( ) { return m ; } } }
class Outer { int m ; static int n ; static class Inner { int foo( ) { return m ; return n ; } } } void func ( ) { int m ; static int n ; static class Inner { int foo( ) { return m ; return n ; } } }
is a class that is declared inside the scope of a function or another class .
A nested class has access to the variables and other symbols of the classes and functions it is nested inside :
If a nested class has theattribute , then it can not access variables of the enclosing scope that are local to the stack or need aNon-static nested classes work by containing an extra hidden member ( called the context pointer ) that is the frame pointer of the enclosing function if it is nested inside a function , or theof the enclosing class 's instance if it is nested inside a class .
When a non-static nested class is instantiated , the context pointer is assigned before the class 's constructor is called , therefore the constructor has full access to the enclosing variables .
A non-static nested class can only be instantiated when the necessary context pointer information is available :
class Outer { class Inner { } static class SInner { } } void func ( ) { class Nested { } Outer o = new Outer ; Outer .
Inner oi = new Outer .
Inner ; Outer .
SInner os = new Outer .
SInner ; Nested n = new Nested ; }
class Base { int foo( ) { return 1 ; } } Base func ( ) { int m = 3 ; class Nested : Base { int foo( ) { return m ; } } Base b = new Nested ; assert ( b.foo ( ) == 3 ) ; return b ; } int test ( ) { Base b = func ( ) ; return b.foo( ) ; }
class Base { int foo( ) { return 1 ; } } Base func ( ) { int m = 3 ; class Nested : Base { int m_ ; this ( ) { m_ = m ; } int foo ( ) { return m_ ; } } Base b = new Nested ; assert ( b.foo ( ) == 3 ) ; return b ; } int test ( ) { Base b = func ( ) ; return b.foo( ) ; }
While a non-static nested class can access the stack variables of its enclosing function , that access becomes invalid once the enclosing function exits :
If this kind of functionality is needed , the way to make it work is to make copies of the needed variables within the nested class 's constructor :
A this can be supplied to the creation of an inner class instance by prefixing it to the NewExpression :
class Outer { int a ; class Inner { int foo( ) { return a ; } } } int bar ( ) { Outer o = new Outer ; o.a = 3 ; Outer .
Inner oi = o. new Inner ; return oi.foo( ) ; }
Here o supplies the this to the outer class instance of Outer .
The property .outer used in a nested class gives the this pointer to its enclosing class .
If the enclosing context is not a class , the .outer will give the pointer to it as a void * type .
class Outer { class Inner { Outer foo( ) { return this .outer ; } } void bar ( ) {
Inner i = new Inner ; assert ( this == i.foo ( ) ) ; } } void test ( ) { Outer o = new Outer ; o.bar( ) ; }
An anonymous nested class is both defined and instantiated with a NewAnonClassExpression :
NewAnonClassExpression : new AllocatorArguments opt class ClassArguments opt SuperClass opt Interfaces opt ClassBody ClassArguments : ( ArgumentList opt )
which is equivalent to :
class Identifier : SuperClass Interfaces ClassBody new ( ArgumentList ) Identifier ( ArgumentList ) ;
where Identifier is the name generated for the anonymous nested class .

NASA Satellites Unlock Secret to Northern India 's Vanishing Water

As animated here , groundwater storage varied in northwestern India between 2002 and 2008 , relative to the mean for the period .
These deviations from the mean are expressed as the height of an equivalent layer of water , ranging from - 12 cm ( deep red ) to 12 cm ( dark blue ) .

Beneath northern India ’s irrigated fields of wheat , rice , and barley ... beneath its densely populated cities of Jaiphur and New Delhi , the groundwater has been disappearing .
Halfway around the world , hydrologists , including Matt Rodell of NASA , have been hunting for it .
Where is northern India ’s underground water supply going ?
According to Rodell and colleagues , it is being pumped and consumed by human activities -- principally to irrigate cropland -- faster than the aquifers can be replenished by natural processes .
They based their conclusions -- published in the August 20 issue of Nature -- on observations from NASA ’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ( GRACE ) .
" If measures are not taken to ensure sustainable groundwater usage , consequences for the 114 million residents of the region may include a collapse of agricultural output and severe shortages of potable water , " said Rodell , who is based at NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. Groundwater comes from the natural percolation of precipitation and other surface waters down through Earth ’s soil and rock , accumulating in aquifers -- cavities and layers of porous rock , gravel , sand , or clay .
In some of these subterranean reservoirs , the water may be thousands to millions of years old ; in others , water levels decline and rise again naturally each year .
Groundwater levels do not respond to changes in weather as rapidly as lakes , streams , and rivers do .
So when groundwater is pumped for irrigation or other uses , recharge to the original levels can take months or years .
Changes in underground water masses affect gravity enough to provide a signal , such that changes in gravity can be translated into a measurement of an equivalent change in water .
" Water below the surface can hide from the naked eye , but not from GRACE , " said Rodell .
The twin satellites of GRACE can sense tiny changes in Earth ’s gravity field and associated mass distribution , including water masses stored above or below Earth ’s surface .
As the satellites orbit 300 miles above Earth 's surface , their positions change -- relative to each other -- in response to variations in the pull of gravity .
The satellites fly roughly 137 miles apart , and microwave ranging systems measure every microscopic change in the distance between the two .
With previous research in the United States having proven the accuracy of GRACE in detecting groundwater , Rodell and colleagues Isabella Velicogna , of NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of California - Irvine , and James Famiglietti , of UC - Irvine , were looking for a region where they could apply the new technique .
" Using GRACE satellite observations , we can observe and monitor water changes in critical areas of the world , from one month to the next , without leaving our desks , " said Velicogna .
" These satellites provide a window to underground water storage changes .
" The northern Indian states of Rajasthan , Punjab and Haryana have all of the ingredients for groundwater depletion : staggering population growth , rapid economic development and water - hungry farms , which account for about 95 percent of groundwater use in the region .
Data provided by India 's Ministry of Water Resources suggested groundwater use was exceeding natural replenishment , but the regional rate of depletion was unknown .
Rodell and colleagues had their case study .
The team analyzed six years of monthly GRACE gravity data for northern India to produce a time series of water storage changes beneath the region ’s land surface .
They found that groundwater levels have been declining by an average of one meter every three years ( one foot per year ) .
More than 109 cubic km ( 26 cubic miles ) of groundwater disappeared between 2002 and 2008 -- double the capacity of India 's largest surface water reservoir , the Upper Wainganga , and triple that of Lake Mead , the largest man-made reservoir in the United States .
"
We do n’t know the absolute volume of water in the Northern Indian aquifers , but GRACE provides strong evidence that current rates of water extraction are not sustainable , " said Rodell .
" The region has become dependent on irrigation to maximize agricultural productivity , so we could be looking at more than a water crisis .
"
The loss is particularly alarming because it occurred when there were no unusual trends in rainfall .
In fact , rainfall was slightly above normal for the period .
The researchers examined data and models of soil moisture , lake and reservoir storage , vegetation and glaciers in the nearby Himalayas , in order to confirm that the apparent groundwater trend was real .
Nothing unusual showed up in the natural environment .
The only influence they could n’t rule out was human .
" At its core , this dilemma is an age - old cycle of human need and activity -- particularly the need for irrigation to produce food , " said Bridget Scanlon , a hydrologist at the Jackson School of Geosciences at the University of Texas in Austin .
" That cycle is now overwhelming fresh water reserves all over the world .
Even one region ’s water problem has implications beyond its borders . " " For the first time , we can observe water use on land with no additional ground - based data collection , " Famiglietti said .
" This is critical because in many developing countries , where hydrological data are both sparse and hard to access , space - based methods provide perhaps the only opportunity to assess changes in fresh water availability across large regions .
" The map shows groundwater changes in India during 2002 - 08 , with losses in red and gains in blue , based on GRACE satellite observations .
The estimated rate of depletion of groundwater in northwestern India is 4.0 centimeters of water per year , equivalent to a water table decline of 33 centimeters per year .
Increases in groundwater in southern India are due to recent above - average rainfall , whereas rain in northwestern India was close to normal during the study period .

Last year 's Blizzcon was tremendously popular .
So much so that their servers were unable to handle the strain of fans competing for 15,000 available tickets .
This year , Blizzard was more prepared ; they made an additional 5,000 tickets available and set up a queue so that the transaction servers were n't overwhelmed .
CEO
Mike Morhaime said during the keynote address that if you were n't able to get into the queue within 30 seconds of its opening , the tickets were sold out before your turn came .
Tens of thousands more chose to order the pay - per- view coverage , demonstrating the extraordinary enthusiasm felt for Blizzard 's games .
Their presentations did n't disappoint .
Read on for details on the status of StarCraft II , Diablo III , World of Warcraft : Cataclysm , and the new Battle . net .
It 's divided into sections by game in case you 're only interested in one or two of them .
The big StarCraft II news this year was n't so much about the first installment , Wings of Liberty , as it was about two of the major features shipping with the game : the editor and Battle .
net .
Both look to be extremely powerful , and they 're being given the same level of care and polish you 'd expect from the game proper .
Still , the devs spoke a little bit about their philosophy and vision for the game .
One of the major themes is making sure the player has options .
When selecting missions in the single - player campaign , players can choose from several different paths to advance the main plot .
There are also optional missions ; you can choose to skip them if you want , or you can finish them to open up new units that you would n't have access to otherwise .
Even within missions themselves , Blizzard wants to give you different ways to get the job done .
One example they gave was an escort mission where you 're shown the path some escaping civilians will be taken , so you can plan out how you want to prepare for attacks and decide how many resources to commit at a particular time .
Another mission features high terrain surrounded by low terrain .
Zerg attack frequently , and every so often , lava rises out of nearby crevasses and floods the low terrain .
The goal of the mission is to build up a certain amount of money , which puts a new spin on resource planning .
Spending a lot of money to fight off the Zerg goes contrary to the mission objective , but spending too little has its own risks .
You can also decide to be as aggressive or as cautious as you want when playing chicken with the lava .
Harvesting those extra few minerals can make a huge difference if you time it well enough .
This leads into another major theme : keeping all the missions unique and interesting .
Even with the brief look at the single - player campaign that we 've already seen , there are several cool new mechanics that make the game more than " build up an army and smash the other army " thirty times in a row .
It 'll do great things for replayability , and I think it will make the single - player portion of the game stand on its own more than in the original StarCraft .
Solo - play in RTS games is often referred to as " training " for multi-player , but Blizzard does n't look at it this way ; the missions are far too unlike PvP to be useful in that regard .
Instead , they 've added what they call " Challenges , " which do train you for common PvP scenarios .
There will be mini-missions for things like maximizing your economy , learning how to counter particular units , or using micro-management skills to take out a superior force .
You 'll be able to keep trying , improve your scores , and track your performance — thanks to the new Battle .
net .
Battle .net is shaping up to be a really impressive addition .
Match - making is at the heart of it , but calling it simply a match - making system does n't really do it justice .
Communication , stat - tracking , and mod-sharing are also central to the new platform .
Players will be able to create friends lists that span the different games , allowing somebody in World of Warcraft to talk with somebody playing Wings of Liberty .
They 're rolling out what is essentially an integrated IM client with all the features you 'd expect for keeping track of people and conversations — multiple frames , online / offline notices , setting an alias for somebody , etc .
I think it 'll be an incredible boon for multi-player when people are able to look for groups in one game while playing another .
Blizzard also made sure to mention that they were aware of the privacy concerns involved in such a system , and they 'll be implementing controls to let you limit the amount of information you share .
The new system also supports looking at your performance in myriad ways .
When reviewing a game , you 'll be able to see how the players ' economies developed , what their build orders were , unit production , battle details , and more .
What 's more , you 'll get a much more useful replay system , allowing you to fast - forward , rewind , jump to particular points in the game , view from different places , and look at stats as they 're being accumulated .
In addition to this is a full achievement system with a ton of things to unlock and show off .
One of the coolest parts is the ability to unlock and choose artistic decals which will then be rendered on your units in - game .
But , of course , the matchmaking system itself can't be overshadowed .
Their goal when designing it was to give a competitive experience to as many people as possible , and it looks like they 've found a way .
As you play against other people and start to accumulate wins and losses , you are put in a League with players of a similar skill level .
There are seven Leagues : Pro , Platinum , Gold , Silver , Bronze , Copper , Practice .
The Leagues are broken down further into Divisions , which include opponents even closer to your skill level .
Divisions are limited to 100 people .
Players will be ranked against others in their Division , and there will be seasons of play .
Tournaments held at the end of the season will determine Division winners , who can complete for the League championship .
The idea is that everyone should be paired against people of their own skill level as much as possible , and everyone should have a reasonable chance of winning their division — even the most hopeless of casuals .
Speaking of which — for the truly new ( or truly terrible ) , there will be a few maps designed specifically to be " anti-rush " so that they can learn the basics without fear of being immediately crushed .
Another significant fact to keep in mind is that these ratings will be tied to Battle .
net accounts , which will require the purchase of a Blizzard game to use .
This allows for two great new controls : first , people will be much less likely to try cheating , since they can't just register a new account for free .
Second , your game rating is tied to your account , so the problem of " smurfing " — when highly - skilled players make a new account for the sole purpose of being matched against ( and then demolishing ) newer players — is neatly eliminated .
Providing meaningful , interesting matches to every player will go a long way toward a thriving , sustainable PvP community .
Also , the rating system will apply to co-op match - making as well .
Each team of players has its own rating , so you do n't have to worry about dropping in the standings if you want to goof off with your friends in 3v3 .
Speaking of co-op , the match - making and game creation system has been streamlined in that regard as well .
It 's simple to , for example , join up with one friend and then drop into a 3v3 or 4v4 game as a group of two .
You also do n't have to jump through hoops to get your friends in a game and select settings before letting random people in to fill the extra slots .
The last major feature of the new Battle .
net is the support for custom maps and mods .
They 're making it very easy to browse custom games and download maps without having to repeatedly get booted from a server or visit a third - party site .
The Blizzard developers were extremely enthusiastic about what they called the StarCraft II Marketplace — essentially an App - Store - like interface for browsing and getting maps and mods .
You could feel the wariness from the Blizzcon audience when this was announced ; people were wondering if they would be required to pay for custom maps .
But , for the most part , this wo n't be the case .
The capacity for premium mods does exist , but the devs said that even a massively - popular mod like DotA would probably be too simple to expect people to pay for .
The ability to charge was put into place so development teams that were interested could plan for a budget , in order to build extremely detailed or complex maps and mods .
You can expect free access to all the great fan - made maps and mods that are typical of Blizzard games .
This naturally leads to questions about the editor that will be coming with StarCraft II .
From what we 've seen so far , the Blizzard devs are going out of their way to include a ridiculous amount of flexibility in the tools they are providing .
They seem to have a tremendous respect for what fans have done with their previous games ; fully one - third of their design staff has come out of the mod community , and they have every intention of contacting people who make incredible creations for StarCraft II .
Put simply , everything in the single - player campaign can be done with their editor .
Many things not in the single - player campaign can be done with the editor .
They gave a few simple examples : nothing in StarCraft II makes use of an inventory , but the code is there to support it .
One of the powerful Zerg units , an Ultralisk , was modified with spiny grafts on its back that rapidly shot back and forth to destroy smaller units .
When the Ultralisk was surrounded , it gave off a huge circular flame wave , destroying what was , literally , a screen full of enemies .
Most impressive , though , were the two complicated examples .
Using just the editor , they were able to transform the game into a third - person shooter .
You took control of a unit ( a Ghost , of course ) , and ran around the map ( even underground ) shooting Zerg , complete with a shooter UI , keyboard movement controls and mouse - look .
They were also able to turn the game into a top - down scrolling space shooter .
Take a look .
And they 're still adding features .
They 're looking for ways to create libraries that can be passed around — they want to give mod-makers the ability to work on different tasks at the same time .
They 're also very aware of the possibility that people might grab somebody else 's custom map , make one minor change , and re-submit it as their own — Blizzard is making it very difficult to do this , and they 're already working on a report and review system for objectionable content .
The editor will be available during the beta , but probably not right away .
With all of this in development , it 's easy to see why Blizzard is so focused on getting people to use Battle .
net .
The oft - repeated suggestion that it 's just DRM to fight piracy is n't the case .
Hearing them talk about it and finally seeing what Battle .
net has to offer makes it plain that they really do think the gaming experience will be better for it .
That said , the door to LAN play does n't seem to be closed .
Rob Pardo acknowledged that there are a number of fringe cases where access to the internet is n't available or networking concerns prevent decent gameplay , and they 're still looking into ways to give people what they want .
They 're also continuing to look into ways to optimize for situations where people are playing with each other from the same location .
Diablo III
The big reveal for Diablo III this year was the new Monk class .
It 's the game 's second melee character , after the Barbarian , but manages to have a completely distinct style and feel .
The inspiration for the Monk came from rather disparate sources ; pen-and - paper RPGs and arcade - style fighting games ( think Street Fighter ) .
Since a
Monk is holy by nature , Blizzard felt he should have access to a bit of holy magic to enhance his martial - arts style of fighting .
Interestingly , they drew on a more Eastern European background , rather than the archetypical Southeast Asian variety , and the departure works well ; the character seems to have the discipline and focus expected of a devoted adherent while concealing a craziness that would make him try to kill a bear with his teeth .
And win .
When designing the Monk , they wanted a fragile fighting class with more depth than just running up and smashing something .
They looked at World of Warcraft 's Rogue and Diablo II 's Assassin , but decided each was ultimately unsatisfying for a game like Diablo III .
They wanted something with a limited amount of skills but many ways to have those skills work together .
Thus was born the combo system .
Many of the Monk 's major attacks have three different stages .
Clicking on an enemy once gives you the first stage , clicking again ( within a short period of time ) gives you the second stage , and another click for the third stage .
For example : Exploding Palm .
The first stage hits for 35 % of your weapon damage .
Second stage hits for 50 % .
Third stage puts a damage - over - time bleed effect on the enemy , exacerbated by movement .
If the enemy dies from the bleed effect , it explodes , causing a huge amount of damage to nearby enemies .
This happens quite often , and it's a very powerful area - of - effect attack .
Another example : Way of the Hundred Fists .
The first attack is a quick dash , striking one enemy .
The second stage is a rapid series of low - damage attacks .
The third stage is a powerful area - of - effect damage and knock - back effect around the player .
Now , the most interesting part about these combos is that you can mix and match .
You can take the first stage from one ability , second stage from another , and the third stage from still another .
This lets you tailor the way you attack to fit whatever situation you 're in .
These combine with more typical single - stage abilities , although some of the abilities themselves are anything but typical .
An attack called Seven Sided Strike makes the Monk zip around part of the screen , teleporting between enemies to attack them .
It 's great fun to use , and very reminiscent of combo attacks in arcade fighting games .
It 's not something you 'd expect in a Diablo game , but it fits perfectly .
Everything feels like an impact .
There were hands - on gaming areas set up throughout the convention , so we got to sit down and play through a level using the brand - new Monks , and it was probably the most entertaining time I spent there .
Figuring out interesting ways to weave the abilities together is fun .
Plus , one of the coolest things I noticed was how well two players could complement each other , even playing the same class .
As I got comfortable with the Monk 's skills and began to watch what my partner ( also a Monk ) was doing , I found that if I planned my attacks to play into his , we could tackle much stronger groups of monsters than we could otherwise .
I could use my knock - back to bump a few monsters in to his area - attack or to give him a little space when he was vulnerable .
We could layer our disorient spell so that monsters had less time to hit us .
It gave me great hope for group synergy .
Blizzard had some neat tidbits on display within the level itself , too .
Several boss monsters , and even some regular ones , required strategic movement and ability use — not just blindly running in the opposite direction waiting for our heath bars to fill up , as was often the case in Diablo II .
By playing smart , we could avoid a lot of the damage , which is how it should be .
There was also an interesting side - dungeon ; upon zoning in , we were warned that the place was collapsing , and a timer began ticking down .
As we moved further inside , the ceiling would periodically drop rocks on us , forcing us to dodge quickly or take damage .
But here 's the rub : the further you go into the dungeon the more and better loot you get from chests .
So it becomes a race — a challenge .
How far can you go before you can't get back ?
When the timer expires , everything collapses , and you die .
Several quests were available in the demo level as well .
They all operate in a very smooth and story - driven manner .
Several lessons have obviously been taken from World of Warcraft in that regard , but not in a way that undermines the Diablo style .
They succeeded in showing a very dark thematic tone in a visually bright level .
The developers spent some time talking about their design process and philosophy , and showed some examples of what they had in the works .
They 're trying to do interesting things with the monsters without making an individual monster too complex .
Difficulty and complexity is achieved through combining different types of monsters .
They have a variety of archetypes , such as swarmers , ranged attackers , enemies that weaken you in some way , monsters that alter or constrict your movement through area - effect spells , and many others .
Knowing how to prioritize your targets will be a valuable skill .
Diablo III is a game that 's already impressive , but very much still in development .
Blizzard is n't ready to talk about many things ; major decisions for the PvP system have n't been made yet , Battle .
net integration is something for the future ( though they will have cross - game communication , like the others ) , and the much - anticipated rune system for customizing skills is on hold until they finalize the skills themselves .
Even things like the Barbarian 's resource system and graphical effects are still going through new iterations , and they 're trying to smooth out the bumps in monster design .
They mentioned a sand - shark which would become much more powerful in the open desert ( think Tremors ) , making the sand feel less safe to stand on than nearby rocks .
Unfortunately , in playtesting , they found that it was hard to balance and confusing for the players , so they 're tinkering with the design .
I would n't expect this game before 2011 .
A few more random snippets : the stash will be " gigantic , " and there will still be endgame loot runs , but they will most likely be " diversified " such that you 'd actively want to kill multiple bosses rather than the same one over and over .
There will be some method for transferring items between your characters , and they 're working on ways to prevent item duping / hacking .
They want Diablo III to have a more meaningful economy than Diablo II .
They do n't feel like modding or map - making provides any substantial benefit for the game , and they do n't plan to support it .
They like the idea of using the Horadric Cube to craft items , but would n't be satisfied duplicating the way it was implemented .
World of Warcraft : Cataclysm
The unveiling of World of Warcraft 's third expansion was perhaps the biggest hit of the conference .
It was clear since the launch of The Burning Crusade that Blizzard has gotten much better at quest and zone design since the original two continents were created .
Wrath of the Lich King only emphasized that point ; comparing the landscape of Howling Fjord to that of Desolace made you wonder that they were part of the same game .
Players had been asking for a better leveling experience for years , and their demands did not go unnoticed .
Cataclysm is easily the biggest expansion , and is sure to further solidify the game 's place at the top of the MMO food chain .
So , what do we know about Cataclysm ?
Well , it 'll affect every zone on Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms , some to greater extent than others .
Northrend will be affected too , though not as much .
The Outland , being separate from the world of Azeroth , wo n't undergo significant physical change , but quests and dialogues will be updated to reflect such a major event .
In addition to the remodeling of the two major continents , several entirely new areas will be available to players as well , including an underwater zone .
The phasing technology introduced in Wrath is being upgraded to affect terrain , and players will be able to use their flying mounts in Azeroth .
That 's a lot to digest , but the WoW developers just kept piling on more information throughout the convention .
There are five new high - level zones for taking players from level 80 to 85 .
Two of them , Mount Hyjal and the Sunken City of Vashj'ir , are starter zones .
Vashj'ir is the underwater zone .
The devs promised to " make sure it wo n't be annoying . "
From what they described , most of the combat will be done on the bottom of the ocean , with characters able to move around and fight much like normal .
They 'll also be able to detach themselves from the bottom and swim through the water above them .
Underwater mounts will be introduced that move as quickly as flying mounts , and there may even be some areas at the bottom of the sea that will be enclosed , containing air .
They showed some concept art that was very bright and colorful , what you might expect from a documentary on a lively reef on the Discovery channel .
Hyjal will be under siege by an old enemy — Ragnaros .
He 's not too happy about what happened to him the last time around , and he 's trying to take out his anger on the World Tree .
Deepholm was termed the " hub " of the new 80 - 85 areas ; it will facilitate quick transport to any of them .
A temple in the center of the zone is where the expansion 's villain , Deathwing , broke through and caused the cataclysm .
It 's designed to feel like an enclosed space , and the art we 've seen makes it look like a giant cavern , which will definitely give it a different feel from any zone we 've seen before .
Uldum is a long - awaited addition to Azeroth .
As it turns out , it was always " there , " but Titan - created machines prevented anyone from seeing it .
The cataclysm broke those machines , so it 's open season on this Egypt - inspired zone .
Twilight Highlands is home to the Twilight 's Hammer cult , the ones who helped to free Deathwing .
It 'll have Grim Batol , one of the new raids , as well as new port towns for both the Horde and the Alliance .
The cataclysm will have political ramifications as well , resulting in two new playable races .
The Goblins will be forced from their neutrality into partnership with the Horde , and a break in the Greymane Wall puts the Worgen squarely on the side of the Alliance .
They each get their own starting zone ( levels 1 - 15 ) , and both will have fairly powerful racial abilities ;
Worgen get a sprint ability , slightly increased damage , and a bonus to skinning — which they do n't require a knife to do .
Goblins get price discounts regardless of reputation , engineering abilities ( one launches them at their target , another fires rockets , but they share a cooldown ) , and a bonus to their alchemy skill , which includes increased effects from potions .
You do n't need to worry that these are more powerful than the old races — all of them will be updated to a similar level of usefulness when Cataclysm launches .
Oh , and race changes will become available at some point as well .
More big news : rated battlegrounds will be arriving with Cataclysm .
They will function differently from arenas in that you wo n't have particular teams , and your rating will never go down — only up .
Every week a particular battleground can be used for rated matches .
If you win , you gain rating determined by your current rating and the quality of your opponents .
If you lose , your rating stays the same .
Winning also awards you a number of arena points per game .
Arenas will be shifting to this system as well .
Your rating will determine the maximum number of points you can earn in a week .
You wo n't have rated teams for battlegrounds , but you will need to queue as a group .
A variety of new bonuses and awards are being introduced , including epic ground mounts and the return of honor titles , like Grand Marshal .
Also on the PvP front , a new world - PvP zone will be opening : an island called Tol Barad .
The intent is to combine the battles in Wintergrasp with the daily quest hub of the Isle of Quel ' Danas .
When the battle is n't active , players from both factions can do daily quests and choose whether or not they want to rumble on their own terms .
When the fight is underway , daily quests shut down until there is a victor .
The winner gets access to an instance and a few more daily quests .
The action will be spread out over a larger area in order to avoid some of the crippling lag that plagued Wintergrasp on some servers , and different areas will have different types of combat .
There will be a new battleground too , the Battle of Gilneas , which will have players trying to capture districts of a city .
There will probably be new arena maps as well .
Perhaps as significant as the physical changes to World of Warcraft are the changes to itemization that are in the works .
Mana per 5 is being rolled into Spirit .
Attack Power will be abandoned for Strength and Agility .
Spell Power will be rolled into Intellect .
Defense and Armor Penetration are going away ( almost ) entirely .
Block value is gone too ; blocks now absorb a flat percentage of the damage , making it a useful stat against bosses .
The intent is to streamline gear so that players do n't need giant spreadsheets to figure out whether something is an upgrade .
Most of these stats will be replaced by a new stat called " Mastery , " which " makes you better at what you do best . "
The talent trees are being revised to remove talents that give a passive bonus to your character , since that 's kind of boring .
Instead , simply spending points in a particular talent tree will give you appropriate passive bonuses .
The further you go , the better the bonuses are .
It will allow for more meaningful choices in how the characters is played .
The system will be smart enough to know what weapon specialization you use , and if you go all the way down to the bottom of a tree , you 'll see some really interesting bonuses .
One they showed for Paladins granted a percentage reduction in cooldown duration .
Some big class changes are underway too ;
Hunters will no longer use mana , but instead adopt the Focus system used by their pets .
This lets them ignore Intellect gear and reduces the need for cooldowns on their abilities , since that can be handled by their resource system .
Warlocks are seeing a substantial change in the way Soul Shards work .
No longer will they have to carry around a few dozen in their bags ; instead , they 'll acquire a max of three , held in a UI system similar to Death Knight Runes .
They wo n't be easily recharged during combat , but grant substantial boosts to spell effects .
For example , one might be used to make a long summoning spell or their biggest , slowest damage spell instant - cast instead .
It would n't be an expansion without a new profession , and once again Blizzard is doing it in a way they have n't done before ; Archaeology is a new secondary profession , so everyone can get it without taking up one of their primary profession slots .
It 's also the key to a new max - level character progression system called " Paths of the Titans . "
This will be a way to gradually improve your character once you 've hit the level cap .
Progress will be limited ; they do n't want people to feel obligated to grind it out , so it 'll become available slowly .
There are 10 ranks to each Path , and you get bonuses to your character at every rank .
The bonuses are not class specific , so it 's feasible for a warrior and a priest to pick the same one ; it just depends on what abilities you 'd like .
The examples they gave included a passive damage reduction to your character and an activated ability that reduced damage to nearby allies .
It uses the glyph system , but the glyphs come from Archaeology rather than Inscription .
Another way to customize will be an ability called Reforging .
It will let you exchange part of one stat on an item for another .
For example , a ring with 10 Intellect could be changed to a ring with 5 Intellect and 5 Spirit .
That 's not all with regard to customization , however .
Cataclysm will be introducing a Guild leveling system .
Almost everything you do — boss kills , level - ups , skill - ups , PvP , etc. — contributes toward your guild gaining levels , to a maximum of 20 .
Guilds will have their own talent trees , which only apply to its members .
Blizzard showed a few of the possible talents ; one reduced repair costs , and another granted a mass resurrection spell .
They also talked about talents for removing reagent costs and having extra gold drop from monsters .
There will also be Guild Achievements and Guild Heirlooms .
Heirloom recipes can be purchased , allowing anyone of that profession within the guild to craft the item .
If a person with one of those items leaves the guild , the item is put back in the guild bank .
It was an eventful two days for the WoW team .
They mentioned a variety of other news , too .
They 're doing away with spell ranks ; they all just scale with level now .
Incidentally , this opens the door to a mentoring system , which they may decide to implement at some point .
They 're making " big changes " to fishing so it will be " more fun . "
Players with two gathering professions will be able to track both simultaneously .
The terrain phasing system will let you see entire coastlines change as the cataclysm progresses .
There will be a guild news feed , not to mention cross-faction , cross-realm , and cross - game communication through Battle .
net .
Cross - server instance groups ( aimed at PUGs ) are planned for the next major patch .
The revamped leveling zones will lead to each other in a more contiguous manner , so expect some high level zones to become low - level zones , and vice versa .
All in all , it looks like the WoW devs have been busy cramming every cool feature they could manage into this expansion , while simultaneously addressing some of the game 's biggest weaknesses .
It 's getting hard to see how new MMOs will ever be able to compete against something like this .
Blizzard wants new players to have this experience , so it 's likely they 'll integrate Cataclysm into the base game .
It 'll be interesting to see whether the development cycle takes longer than the previous expansions , since it seems like Cataclysm will require a lot more work .
I 'm sure we 'll have a better idea after the next Blizzcon !

A " Pochi Tama " clip featuring a dog in Japan that rides around the neighborhood on an exercise ball instead of taking regular walks
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
When Glynis McCants looks at Michael Jackson 's life , she sees the number five .
Numerologist Glynis McCants says that with his numbers , Jackson was a draw to fans .
Jackson 's talent was discovered when he was 5 years old , he came to fame as a member of the Jackson 5 and he planned a series of 50 concert dates in London , England , as part of a comeback tour before he died on June 25 at the age of 50 .
For McCants , a noted numerologist and author , those facts are very telling : " Five is the number for drama , and it was in his life his whole life . "
For many fans , the lure of Michael Jackson as a performer and pop icon was magical .
Those who deal in the paranormal are tuned in to that magic .
Numerology deals with the influence of numbers on personal characteristics and human affairs .
McCants -- who has appeared on nationally syndicated television and radio shows and is known as the " Numbers Lady " -- said that by taking Jackson 's birth date ( August 29 , 1958 , or 8/29/1958 ) she could chart his personality .
His was " six life path , " she said , meaning he was magnetic and drew people to him .
That , coupled with the fact that he was born on a two day made him irresistible , she said .
" If you are born on a two day and are a six life path then America and the world seem to fall in love with you , " McCants said .
" It 's almost as if you always get a shot with that energy if you shoot for stardom , and then you can sabotage it , " McCants said .
" Britney Spears was born on a two day , and she 's a six life path ; Lindsay Lohan was born on a two day , and she 's a six life path ; and Sarah Palin was born on a two day , and is a six life path . "
Such people , McCants said , thrive on the attention .
Psychic Eddie Conner said Jackson could n't help but attract such attention , even if it resulted in a life of isolation .
" He 's an old soul with an enormous amount of creative artistic energy that pours to him and from him , " said Conner , who works as a " soul intuitive " in Los Angeles , California , and whose clients include celebrities he declines to name .
" Whenever he 's doing his magic he 's untouchable , and I think that 's the reason everybody gravitates toward him . "
And despite all of Jackson 's troubles , Conner said he believes the star will have an opportunity at success and fame again .
Unlike other souls that stay in the nonphysical realm anywhere from 70 to 150 years , he said , he believes the singer 's soul will return quickly -- within the next 20 years -- because Jackson was such a perfectionist that he will want to " pick up where he left off . "
" If not as a performer , then a Quincy Jones / Michael Jackson / whoever , the top producers that get mass [ music ] out to the world to uplift them , " Conner said .
Fans continue to gravitate toward Jackson even as they try to make sense of his passing because mourning him reinvigorates the energy and attention surrounding him , Conner said .
" He was untouchable when he was connected to his soul and what he came to this planet to do , " Conner said .
" The average person looks at that and they believe that if they can touch it -- or have him touch them -- then maybe some of it would rub off . "
The desire for such a connection can cause devastation now that Jackson is gone , said psychic consultant Jack Rourke , who has worked extensively in paranormal research and consulted for major Hollywood studios .
" Even though we 've never met Michael , people create a symbiotic relationship with this image or this person , " Rourke said .
" We project all of the positive aspects of ourselves , all of the wonderful things onto this image of perfection or near perfection that we see , and we imagine subconsciously that this person is in agreement with the deepest part of ourselves .
" When this is no longer possible because this person is gone , it creates a vacuum within us , so people need to maintain a psychological or even a spiritual stability by creating a fixed image of Jackson , " he said .
Rourke said he fully expects people to come forward claiming to have communicated with Jackson , but that any credible professional psychic or medium will not attempt to connect with Jackson for at least six months to a year and will only do so at the behest of a family member or an intimate friend of the singer .
In the meantime , Conner said fans can still reach out to the singer 's energy in a simple way : " The greatest way to connect with Michael is through listening to his music . "
All About Michael Jackson • Reincarnation • Music
It ’s always a gamble when actors are asked to mimic musicians .
The results vary anywhere from surprisingly good to chalkboard scraping bad .
It ’s usually a smart idea to cast people who have some semblance of vocal ability , but Hollywood cares more about marketing their product than utilizing common sense .
However , not all fictional music groups will leave you shoving spoons in your ears .
A select few might even get thrifty misers like us to open our wallets and plop down a couple bucks to listen to them jam .
The following ten movie bands are worth the price of admission .
( Beware of coarse language .
For shame ! )
10 ) Barry Jive and the Uptown Five
Before Tenacious D and School of Rock , Jack Black rocked the mic in this excellent flick .
Barry the music snob record store employee was a scene - stealer .
His insistence that he possessed mad frontman skills was met with much skepticism .
That is until he hit the stage and covered a Marvin Gaye classic .
9 ) The Brady Bunch
You gotta include the Brady Bunch !
Greg and Marsha and Jan and Peter and Cindy and Bobby sure do know how to harmonize .
Not many bands are capable of pulling off an impromptu jingle while shopping at the local mall .
Even U2 needs rehearsal time .
8 ) Sex Bob - Omb
In Scott Pilgrim vs. The World , Michael Cera plays bass player Scott Pilgrim and leads his band in a literal battle of the bands .
In the end they sold out to Gideon Gordon Graves , but they ’re still good enough for our list .
7 ) Crucial Taunt
Remember when Tia Carrere was super - hot ?
She still looks decent , but back in ’ 92 she sizzled .
As Cassandra , lead singer of Crucial Taunt , she was sexy , tough and the apple of Wayne Campbell ’s eye .
A reunion sounds in order , but only if they play “ Ballroom Blitz . ” ( I kinda dig the German voice track . )
6 ) The Wonders
The beauty of one - hit wonders is they last forever .
If radio still exists in twenty years , we ’ll still be hearing “ Take on Me ” by a - ha .
The Wonders may have had only one hit to their credit , but they crushed it every time they took the stage .
Maybe they ’d be agreeable to do birthdays and Bar Mitzvahs .
5 ) Wyld Stallyns
Imagine the Stallyns traveling through time and performing their unique brand of metal in front of Roman Emperors and America ’s first settlers .
That would be totally awesome .
Too bad Rufus passed on to the great gig in the sky .
He ’d be all over this idea .
4 ) Marty McFly and The Starlighters
No list of movie bands would be complete without everyone ’s favorite time traveling guitar player , Marty McFly .
Not only did he ensure his parents got together back in 1955 , but he also took the stage with The Starlighters and ripped like Hendrix , or in this case , Chuck Berry .
3 ) Eddie and the Cruisers
Michael Paré killed it in this flick .
He had that whole rebel rocker , better to burn out attitude down to a science .
Even a slight resemblance to “ Bowzer ” from Sha Na Na could n’t stop Eddie from becoming a rock legend .
If he ’s still alive , a comeback concert could prove quite profitable .
2 ) Stillwater
Stillwater had the look , feel and dysfunction of a ’ 70s group .

These figures are unsustainable
Lost in the hoopla over the hollow settlement offer recently made by the woman suing Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger for sexual assault is the fact that her lawyer recently has asked for a list of all women with whom Ben has had relations .
The request came in a Tuesday court filing aimed at defeating Roethlisberger ’s motion to dismiss the case .
The accuser also wants Roethlisberger to identify whether any of his sexual partners have alleged misconduct on his part .
( Suddenly , we ’re reminded of the scene where Jerry Seinfeld calls Patty Lawrence . )
Though likely outrageous to the non-lawyers in the crowd , this is a fairly common practice in the pre-trial discovery process .
In this case , Roethlisberger ’s accuser wants to find out whether other women have accused him of sexual assault .
If the process for getting that information creates a hassle or an embarrassment for Roethsliberger , it ’s an added benefit , from the perspective of the plaintiff .
Meanwhile , lawyer Calvin Dunlap apparently claims that the woman , whose credibility has been dramatically undermined by the fact that she filed no criminal complaint after the incident , told a doctor about the alleged assault , presumably within a short period of time after it occurred .

In pictures : Kuwait wedding fire Four teams of fire - fighters were dispatched to the scene , about 50 km ( 30 miles ) west of the capital , as well as a large number of ambulances .
Officials said the authorities had had difficulty evacuating the injured because of the large numbers of anxious relatives at the scene .
The country 's ruler , Sheikh Sabah al - Ahmed al - Jaber al - Sabah , extended his condolences to the families of the victims .
Fire department chief Brig Gen Jassem al - Mansouri told AP news agency the authorities would have to carry out DNA tests to identify the victims .
" It was a horrific scene with bodies and many shoes stuck to the ground at the only exit .
They must have trampled over one another , " he said .
Interior ministry spokesman Col Mohammed al - Saber confirmed to Reuters news agency that the tent , which could seat more than 200 people , had only one exit .
Investigators are trying to establish what sparked the blaze , with faulty electrical wiring , or coals used for burning incense , among possible causes , according to reports .

Two Russian fighter jets have collided while training for an air show near Moscow , killing one pilot and injuring at least five people on the ground .
Two pilots from the elite Russian Knights aerobatic team parachuted to safety , but a third , the group 's commander , did not survive .
One woman suffered burns and at least four other people were injured as one jet struck houses near the airfield .
Initial reports say that pilot error caused the crash of the two Su - 27 jets .
Air force spokesman Lt Col Vladimir Drik said the fighters collided near Zhukhovsky airfield , east of Moscow , where they were preparing for the Maks 2009 aerospace exhibition , due to start on Tuesday .
The dead pilot was named as Russian Knights ' commander Igor Tkachenko , 45 , a decorated air force colonel .
Earlier this year Russia grounded its entire fleet of another fighter , the Su - 24 , after two crashes in three days , the Associated Press news agency reported .
Correction : A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that the Su - 27 fleet had been grounded earlier this year instead of the Su - 24 fleet .
By dropping his insistence on a public insurance option , President Obama angered some of his most loyal supporters but sharply improved the odds of passing a far - reaching healthcare overhaul .
Moderate Democratic lawmakers are now more likely to back other parts of the evolving legislation , such as prohibiting insurers from denying coverage because of preexisting conditions or cutting off benefits to ill policy - holders , as well as making it easier for small businesses to cover workers .
At the same time , the White House appeared to be making a calculation that liberals would go along with the legislation even if it lacked a provision they deemed indispensable .
The White House expressed Obama ’s position in calibrated language , making clear that though he preferred to include a government - run healthcare plan in legislation , its absence would not be a deal - breaker .
Advertisement
Speaking to reporters on Air Force One , Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said there had been no change in White House policy with respect to a government - run plan .
Obama wants an insurance market that does a better job of serving consumers , he said , and does n’t consider a public option the only means of accomplishing that .
“ The goals are choice and competition , ” Gibbs said .
“ His preference is a public option .
If there are other ideas , he ’s happy to look at them .
I think this is true not only for the issue of healthcare , but for virtually every other issue that he ’ll ever deal with in public life . ”
Many congressional analysts expect the House to approve some form of public plan and the Senate to reject it , setting up a showdown in the final round of negotiations -- probably late this fall .
But the political gain for Obama was clear Monday in the reaction of Rep. Rick Boucher of Virginia , one of five Democrats who opposed the bill when it cleared the House Energy and Commerce Committee in July .
Advertisement
Boucher said Obama ’s willingness to compromise on the public option had strengthened the president ’s hand among conservative Democrats and other skeptics without harming the basic goal of lowering healthcare costs and insuring more people .
Dropping that option , Boucher said , “ creates the opportunity to pass the healthcare bill .
. . .
A government - operated healthcare plan is not essential ” to reform .
Throughout the healthcare debate , there has been a push for a more competitive insurance marketplace -- either through the creation of cooperatives or a government plan -- that would drive prices down .
Polls have shown that a large majority of Americans favor a public option .
But a vocal group of opponents , who fear an expanded federal influence in people ’s healthcare , have taken their case to town halls around the country during the August congressional recess .
They have argued that a government - run plan would have an unfair advantage and ultimately drive private insurers out of business .

The opposition reached such a pitch , dominating news reports , that the president held three town halls of his own in recent days to rebut what he has called misinformation about his healthcare plan .
And in making clear that the public option was merely a “ means to an end ” -- in the words of a senior Obama official who requested anonymity when discussing administration thinking -- the president may be able to blunt some of the criticism .
Centrist Democrats on Monday said they welcomed the new White House flexibility .
Rep. Jason Altmire ( D - Pa. ) , a second - term lawmaker from a swing district , said : “ It ’s going to bring votes . ”
Altmire , who was one of three Democrats to vote against the bill in the House Education and Labor Committee , said that the government plan had “ become a flash point . ”
Advertisement
Families USA Executive Director Ron Pollack , a leading consumer advocate who has been pushing a healthcare overhaul for decades , said his group had been distributing a memo touting the “ 10 Reasons to Support the Health Care Reform Bills . ”
A government plan was only one of them .
“ The health reform bills have many critical factors designed to make healthcare more accessible and more affordable , ” Pollack said in an interview .
He and others noted that the bills working their way through the House and Senate included provisions that would transform the way Americans get health insurance -- even without a government plan .
“ The public plan is not the essential element of reform , ” said Jim Kessler , vice president for policy at Third Way , a centrist Democratic think tank in Washington .
When it comes to strategy , many lawmakers long have seen a concession on the government - run plan as essential to getting any healthcare bill through the Senate , where 60 votes are needed to ensure passage .
Advertisement
All 40 Senate Republicans oppose the public option , as do some Democrats .
Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) has been working to overcome political obstacles in the Senate , where a small bipartisan group of lawmakers has been trying to reach a compromise .
“ While Sen .
Reid supports a public option , he also supports bipartisan compromise healthcare reform that cuts cost and provides coverage for all Americans , ” said Reid spokesman Jim Manley .
“ There are different proposals on the table that can accomplish that goal . ”
Obama ’s willingness to jettison the public option if necessary risks alienating some in his liberal base .
Jed Lewison , a liberal blogger , said that if a healthcare bill passed without a government - run program , grass - roots support for future Obama objectives may be more tepid .
Advertisement
“ People ’s intensity will definitely diminish , ” Lewison said .
“ People have been listening to strong arguments for the public option coming from the administration .
And they believe those arguments .
If it comes down to where people feel like in the last few yards of the field , the rug was pulled out from underneath them , they may not be as willing to work hard the next time around . ”

Other Obama compromises

President Obama ’s willingness to compromise on the public option is not the first time he has modified his position as the healthcare battle has unfolded .
Here are some other areas of change :
NEGOTIATING LOWER DRUG PRICES
Then :
As a candidate , Obama ran an ad vowing to repeal a 2003 law that barred the government from using its clout to negotiate lower prescription prices with drug companies .
Now : Democrats -- in a deal “ blessed ” by the White House , according to pharmaceutical lobbyist Billy Tauzin -- last week got the drug industry to back the healthcare overhaul by agreeing that the ban on negotiating drug prices would remain in force .

UNIVERSAL INSURANCE COVERAGE
Then : Obama , throughout the presidential campaign , embraced an overhaul that would mean coverage for all Americans .
Now : Last week , he said about 38 million of the 46 million people now uninsured would get coverage .
IMPORTING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

Then : “ Barack Obama and Joe Biden will allow Americans to buy their medicines from other developed countries if the drugs are safe and prices are lower outside the U.S. , ” their campaign website said .
Now : Worried drug executives have been told “ health insurance reform that lowers costs , including pharmaceutical costs , would probably make such legislation unnecessary , ” according to White House spokeswoman Linda Douglass .

Why NIST ’s Final 9/11 Report is Unscientific and False
by Prof. David Ray Griffin
At 5:21 in the afternoon of 9/11 , almost seven hours after the Twin Towers had come down , Building 7 of the World Trade Center also came down .
The collapse of this building was from the beginning considered a mystery . [ 1 ]
The same should have been true , to be sure , of the collapse of the Twin Towers .
But they had been hit by planes , which had ignited big fires in them , and many people assumed this combination of causes to be sufficient to explain why they came down .
But WTC 7 had not been hit by a plane , so it was apparently the first steel - framed high - rise building in the known universe to have collapsed because of fire alone .
New York Times writer James Glanz quoted a structural engineer as saying : “ [ W ] ithin the structural engineering community , [ WTC 7 ] is considered to be much more important to understand [ than the Twin Towers ] , ” because engineers had no answer to the question , “ why did 7 come down ? ” [ 2 ]
From a purely scientific perspective , of course , there would have been an obvious answer .
Scientists , presupposing the regularity of nature , operate on the principle that like effects generally imply like causes .
Scientists are , therefore , loathe to posit unprecedented causes for common phenomena .
By 9/11 , the collapse of steel - framed high - rises had become a rather common phenomenon , which most Americans had seen on television .
And in every one of these cases , the building had been brought down by explosives in the process known as controlled demolition .
From a scientific perspective , therefore , the obvious assumption would have been that WTC 7 came down because explosives had been used to remove its steel supports .
However , the public discussion of the destruction of the World Trade Center did not occur in a scientific context , but in a highly charged political context .
America had just been attacked , it was almost universally believed , by foreign terrorists who had flown hijacked planes into the Twin Towers , and in response the Bush administration had launched a “ war on terror . ”
The idea that even one of the buildings had been brought down by explosives would have implied that the attacks had not been a surprise , so this idea could not be entertained by many minds in private , let alone in public .
This meant that people had to believe , or at least pretend to believe , that Building 7 had been brought down by fire , even though , as Glanz wrote : “ [ E ] xperts said no building like it , a modern , steel - reinforced high - rise , had ever collapsed because of an uncontrolled fire . ” [ 3 ]
And so , this building ’s collapse had to be considered a mystery – insofar as it was considered at all .
But this was not much .
Although WTC 7 was a 47 - story building , which in most places would have been the tallest building in the city , if not the state , it was dwarfed by the 110 - story Twin Towers .
It was also dwarfed by them in the ensuing media coverage .
And so , Glanz wrote , the collapse of Building 7 was “ a mystery that . . . would probably have captured the attention of the city and the world , ” if the Twin Towers had not also come down . [ 4 ]
As it was , however , the mystery of Building 7 ’s collapse was seldom discussed .
For those few people who were paying attention , the mysteriousness of this collapse was not lessened by the first official report about it , which was issued by FEMA in 2002 .
This report put forward what it called its “ best hypothesis ” as to why the building collapsed , but then added that this hypothesis had “ only a low probability of occurrence . ” [ 5 ]
This FEMA report , in fact , increased the mystery , thanks to an appendix written by three professors at Worcester Polytechnic Institute .
This appendix reported that a piece of steel from WTC 7 had melted so severely that it had gaping holes in it , making it look like a piece of Swiss cheese . [ 6 ]
James Glanz , pointing out that the fires in the building could not have been hot enough to melt steel , referred to this discovery as “ the deepest mystery uncovered in the investigation . ” [ 7 ]
The task of providing the definitive explanation of the collapse of WTC 7 was given to NIST , the National Institute of Standards and Technology .
Although NIST had been expected to issue its report on this building along with its report on the Twin Towers , which came out in 2005 , it did not .
NIST then continued to delay this report until August of 2008 , at which time it issued a Draft for Public Comment .
1. NIST ’s Denial of Evidence for Explosives
At a press briefing , Shyam Sunder , NIST ’s lead investigator , declared that “ the reason for the collapse of World Trade Center 7 is no longer a mystery . ”
Also , announcing that NIST “ did not find any evidence that explosives were used to bring the building down , ” [ 8 ] he said : “ [ S ] cience is really behind what we have said . ” [ 9 ]
In the remainder of this lecture , I will show that both of those statements were false .
NIST and Scientific Fraud
With regard to the question of science :
Far from being supported by good science , NIST ’s report repeatedly makes its case by resorting to scientific fraud .
Before going into details , let me point out that , if NIST did engage in fraudulent science , this would not be particularly surprising .
NIST is an agency of the US Department of Commerce .
During the years it was writing its World Trade Center reports , therefore , it was an agency of the Bush - Cheney administration .
In 2004 , the Union of Concerned Scientists put out a document charging this administration with “ distortion of scientific knowledge for partisan political ends . ”
By the end of the Bush administration , this document had been signed by over 15,000 scientists , including 52 Nobel Laureates and 63 recipients of the National Medal of Science . [ 10 ]
Moreover , a scientist who formerly worked for NIST has reported that it has been “ fully hijacked from the scientific into the political realm , ” with the result that scientists working for NIST “ lost [ their ] scientific independence , and became little more than ‘ hired guns .
’” 11 Referring in particular to NIST ’s work on the World Trade Center , he said everything had to be approved by the Department of Commerce , the National Security Agency , and the Office of Management and Budget — “ an arm of the Executive Office of the President , ” which “ had a policy person specifically delegated to provide oversight on [ NIST ’s ] work . ” [ 12 ]
One of the general principles of scientific work is that its conclusions must not be dictated by nonscientific concerns – in other words , by any concern other than that of discovering the truth .
This former NIST employee ’s statement gives us reason to suspect that NIST , while preparing its report on WTC 7 , would have been functioning as a political , not a scientific , agency .
The amount of fraud in this report suggests that this was indeed the case .
According to the National Science Foundation , the major types of scientific fraud are fabrication , falsification , and plagiarism .
There is no sign that NIST is guilty of plagiarism , but it is certainly guilty of fabrication , which can be defined as “ making up results , ” and falsification , which means either “ changing or omitting data . ” [ 13 ]
The omission of evidence by NIST is so massive , in fact , that I treat it as a distinct type of scientific fraud .
As philosopher Alfred North Whitehead said in his 1925 book , Science and the Modern World : “ It is easy enough to find a [ self - consistent ] theory . . . , provided that you are content to disregard half your evidence . ”
The “ moral temper required for the pursuit of truth , ” he added , includes “ [ a ] n unflinching determination to take the whole evidence into account . ” [ 14 ]
NIST , however , seemed to manifest an unflinching determination to disregard half of the relevant evidence .
Physical Evidence of Explosives
Some of the evidence ignored by NIST is physical evidence that explosives were used to bring down WTC 7 .
Swiss - Cheese Steel : I will begin with the piece of steel from WTC 7 that had been melted so severely that it looked like Swiss cheese .
Explaining why it called this “ the deepest mystery uncovered in the investigation , ” James Glanz wrote : “ The steel apparently melted away , but no fire in any of the buildings was believed to be hot enough to melt steel outright . ” [ 15 ]
Glanz ’s statement was , in fact , quite an understatement .
The full truth is that the fires in the building could not have brought the steel anywhere close to the temperature – about 1,482 °C ( 2,700 °F ) – needed for it to melt . [ 16 ]
The professors who reported this piece of steel in the appendix to the FEMA report said : “ A detailed study into the mechanisms [ that caused ] this phenomenon is needed . ” [ 17 ]
Arden Bement , who was the director of NIST when it took on the WTC project , said that NIST ’s report would address “ all major recommendations contained in the [ FEMA ] report . ” [ 18 ]
But when NIST issued its report on WTC 7 , it did not mention this piece of steel with the Swiss - cheese appearance .
Indeed , NIST even claimed that not a single piece of steel from WTC 7 had been recovered . [ 19 ]
This piece of steel , moreover , was only a small portion of the evidence , ignored by NIST , that steel had melted .
Particles of Metal in the Dust : The Deutsche Bank building , which was right next to the Twin Towers , was heavily contaminated by dust produced by their destruction .
But Deutsche
Bank ’s insurance company refused to pay for the clean - up , claiming that this dust had not resulted from the destruction of the WTC .
So Deutsche Bank hired the RJ Lee Group to do a study , which showed that the dust in the Deutsche Bank was WTC dust , which had a unique signature .
Part of this signature was “ Spherical iron . . . particles . ” [ 20 ]
This meant , the RJ Lee Group said , that iron had “ melted during the WTC Event , producing spherical metallic particles . ” [ 21 ]
The study even showed that , whereas iron particles constitute only 0.04 percent of normal building dust , they constituted almost 6 percent of WTC Dust – meaning almost 150 times as much as normal . [ 22 ]
The RJ Lee study also found that temperatures had been reached “ at which lead would have undergone vaporization ” [ 23 ] – meaning 1,749 °C ( 3,180 °F ) . [ 24 ]
Another study was carried out by the US Geological Survey , the purpose of which was to aid the “ identification of WTC dust components . ”
Besides also finding iron particles , the scientists involved in this study found that molybdenum had been melted .
This finding was especially significant , because this metal does not melt until it reaches 2,623 °C ( 4,753 °F ) . [ 25 ]
NIST , however , did not mention either of these studies , even though the latter one was carried out by another US government agency .
NIST could not mention these studies because it was committed to the theory that the WTC buildings were brought down by fire , while these studies clearly showed that something other than fire was going on in those buildings .
Nanothermite Residue :
What was that ?
A report by several scientists , including chemist Niels Harrit of the University of Copenhagen , showed that the WTC dust contained unreacted nanothermite , which – unlike ordinary thermite , which is an incendiary – is a high explosive .
This report by Harrit and his colleagues , who included Steven Jones and Kevin Ryan , did not appear until 2009 , [ 26 ] several months after the publication of NIST ’s final report in November 2008 .
But NIST , as a matter of routine , should have tested the WTC dust for residue of explosives , such as nanothermite .
The Guide for Fire and Explosion Investigations put out by the National Fire Protection Association says that a search for evidence for explosives should be undertaken whenever there has been “ high - order damage . ”
Leaving no doubt about the meaning of this term , the Guide says :
High - order damage is characterized by shattering of the structure , producing small , pulverized debris .
Walls , roofs , and structural members are splintered or shattered , with the building completely demolished . [ 27 ]
That description applied to the destruction of the Twin Towers and WTC 7 .
The next sentence – “ Debris is thrown great distances , possibly hundreds of feet ” – applied to the destruction of the Twin Towers , a fact that NIST had to admit in order to explain how fires were started in WTC 7 . [ 28 ]
So NIST should have looked for signs of explosives , such as nanothermite .
But when asked whether it had , NIST said No .
A reporter asked Michael Newman , a NIST spokesman , about this failure , saying : “ [ W ] hat about that letter where NIST said it did n’t look for evidence of explosives ? ”
Newman replied : “ Right , because there was no evidence of that . ”
“ But , ” asked the reporter “ how can you know there ’s no evidence if you do n’t look for it first ? ”
Newman replied : “ If you ’re looking for something that is n’t there , you ’re wasting your time . . . and the taxpayers ’ money . ” [ 29 ]
( You could n’t make this stuff up . )
When Shyam Sunder , who headed up NIST ’s investigation of the WTC buildings , gave his press conference in August of 2008 – at which he announced that “ the reason for the collapse of World Trade Center 7 is no longer a mystery ” – he began by saying :
Before I tell you what we found , I ’d like to tell you what we did not find .
We did not find any evidence that explosives were used to bring the building down . [ 30 ]
By making this point first , Sunder indicated that this was NIST ’s most important conclusion – just as it had been NIST ’s most important conclusion about the Twin Towers .
However , although Sunder claimed that this conclusion was based on good science , a conclusion has no scientific validity if it can be reached only by ignoring half the evidence .
Molten Metal :
In addition to the ignored evidence already pointed out , NIST also , in its investigation of the WTC , ignored reports that the rubble contained lots of molten metal – which most people described as molten steel .
For example , firefighter Philip Ruvolo , speaking of the Twin Towers , said : “ You ’d get down below and you ’d see molten steel , molten steel , running down the channel rails , like you ’re in a foundry , like lava . ” [ 31 ]
Peter Tully , president of Tully Construction , which was involved in the clean - up operation , said that he saw pools of “ literally molten steel . ” [ 32 ]
However , when John Gross , one of the main authors of NIST ’s reports , was asked about the molten steel , he said to the questioner : I challenge your “ basic premise that there was a pool of molten steel , ” adding : “ I know of absolutely no . . . eyewitness who has said so . ” [ 33 ]
However , in addition to Ruvolo and Tully , the eyewitnesses who said so included :
• Leslie Robertson , a member of the engineering firm that designed the Twin Towers . [ 34 ] • Dr. Ronald Burger of the National Center for Environmental Health . [ 35 ] • Dr. Alison Geyh of The Johns Hopkins School of Public Health , who headed up a scientific team that went to the site shortly after 9/11 at the request of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences . [ 36 ] •
Finally , the fact that “ molten steel was also found at WTC 7 ” was added by Mark Loizeaux , president of Controlled Demolition , Inc. , which was involved in the clean - up . [ 37 ]
And yet John Gross suggested that no credible witnesses had reported molten steel .
That appears to have been a gross lie .
Testimonial Evidence for Explosives
Besides ignoring physical evidence that explosives had been used , NIST also ignored testimonial evidence .
NIST ’s Twin Towers Report :
In its 2005 report on the Twin Towers , NIST ignored dozens of testimonies provided by reporters , police officers , and WTC employees , along with 118 testimonies provided by members of the Fire Department of New York . [ 38 ]
NIST even explicitly denied the existence of these reports , saying that there “ was no evidence ( collected by . . . the Fire Department of New York ) of any blast or explosions ” that would have suggested that explosives were going off . [ 39 ]
However , when a group of scholars including scientists and a lawyer called NIST on this false statement , NIST refined its meaning , saying :
NIST reviewed all of the interviews conducted by the FDNY of firefighters ( 500 interviews ) .
. . .
Taken as a whole , the interviews did not support the contention that explosives played a role in the collapse of the WTC Towers . [ 40 ]
So , although NIST had said in its report that there was no testimonial evidence for explosives , it now seemed to be saying that , because only 118 out of 500 reported explosions , the testimonies , “ taken as a whole , ” do not support the idea that explosions were going off , so that NIST had been justified in claiming that there was no testimonial evidence to support the idea that explosives had been used .
Imagine an investigation of a murder on the streets of San Francisco .
Of the 100 people who were at the scene at the time , 25 of them reported seeing Pete Smith shoot the victim .
But the police release Pete Smith , saying that , taken as a whole , the testimonies did not point to his guilt .
That would be NIST - style forensic science .
Reports from People Outside WTC 7 : NIST continued this approach in its WTC 7 report .
There had been several credible reports of explosions .
A reporter for the New York Daily News , said :
[ T ] here was a rumble .
The building ’s top row of windows popped out .
Then all the windows on the thirty - ninth floor popped out .
Then the thirty - eighth floor .
Pop !
Pop !
Pop ! was all you heard until the building sunk into a rising cloud of gray . [ 41 ]
NYPD officer Craig Bartmer said :
I was real close to Building 7 when it fell down .
. . .
[ A ]ll of a sudden . . .
I looked up , and . . . [ t ] he thing started pealing in on itself .
. . .
I started running . . . and the whole time you ’re hearing “ boom , boom , boom , boom , boom . ” [ 42 ]
Reports from Hess and Jennings from Inside WTC 7 : Besides ignoring these and other reports of explosions made by people outside Building 7 , NIST distorted the testimony of two highly credible men who were inside : Michael Hess , who was New York City ’s corporation counsel , and Barry Jennings , the deputy director of the Emergency Services Department of the New York City Housing Authority .
Immediately after the North Tower was struck that morning , both men followed the instruction that , whenever there was an emergency , they were to meet Major Giuliani at his Emergency Management Center on the 23rd floor of Building 7 .
The North Tower was struck at 8:46 , so they would have arrived at about 9:00 .
They found , however , that everyone had left .
Calling to find out what they should do , Jennings was told to get out of the building immediately .
So , finding that the elevator would not work ( the electricity had evidently been knocked out at 9:03 by the airplane strike on the South Tower ) , they started running down the stairs .
But when they got to the 6th floor , there was a huge explosion , which blew the landing out from under them and blocked their path .
They went back up to the 8th floor , broke a window , and signaled for help .
Firemen came to rescue them , Jennings said , but then ran away .
Coming back after a while , the firemen again started to rescue them , but then ran away again .
They had to run away the first time , Jennings explained , because of the collapse of the South Tower , which occurred at 9:59 , and the second time because of the North Tower collapse , which occurred at 10:28 .
On that basis , Jennings told Dylan Avery in an interview in 2007 , he knew that , when that big explosion occurred , “ both buildings were still standing . ”
Finally , when the firemen returned after the second tower collapsed , Hess and Jennings were rescued .
This must have been sometime between 11:00 and 11:30 , because at 11:57 , Hess gave an on - the - street interview several blocks away .
Jennings also gave an on - the - street interview .
Both men reported that they had been trapped for some time – Hess specified “ about an hour and a half . ”
This story obviously was very threatening to NIST .
It was going to claim that , when Building 7 came down at 5:21 that afternoon , it did so solely because of fires .
There were no explosives to help things along .
But here were two city officials reporting that a big explosion had gone off pretty early in the morning , evidently before 9:30 .
In his interview for Dylan Avery , moreover , Jennings said that the big explosion that trapped them was simply the first of many .
He also said that when the firefighter took them down to the lobby , he saw that it had been totally destroyed – it was , he said , “ total ruins , total ruins . ”
Jennings also that , when he and the firefighter were walking through this lobby , they were “ stepping over people . ” [ 43 ]
Jennings ’s testimony contradicted the official story , according to which there were no explosions in WTC 7 and no one was killed in this building .
What would NIST do ?
NIST ’s Treatment of the Hess - Jennings Testimony : NIST simply ignored Jennings ’ report about the lobby and , with regard to the time that Hess and Jennings got trapped , followed the line that had taken by Rudy Giuliani in a 2002 book , according to which the event that Hess and Jennings took to be an explosion within WTC 7 was simply the impact of debris from the collapse of the North Tower .
But that collapse did not occur until 10:28 , whereas the event described by Hess and Jennings had occurred at least an hour earlier .
Also , Jennings said that the South Tower as well as the North Tower was still standing when the event he called an explosion occurred , and that is surely what he told NIST when it interviewed him ( as well as Hess ) in the Spring of 2004 .
Another problem was that Hess had said that they had been trapped for “ about an hour and a half . ”
If the event that trapped them did not happen until almost 10:30 , as NIST claims , then they would not have been rescued before noon .
And sure enough , in an Interim Report on WTC 7 put out by NIST in 2004 , it claimed that Hess and Jennings had been rescued “ [ a] t 12:10 to 12:15 PM . ”
But that is clearly false , given the fact that Hess was being interviewed several blocks away before noon . [ 44 ]
NIST would , of course , deny that it had distorted Jennings ’ testimony .
But when we sent a Freedom of Information
Act request to NIST to obtain a copy of the Hess and Jennings interviews , NIST declined on the basis of a provision allowing for exemption from FOIA disclosure if the information is “ not directly related to the building failure . ” [ 45 ]
NIST thereby suggested that a report of a massive explosion within the building would be irrelevant to determining the cause of its failure .
Using such an obviously phony reason seemed to be NIST ’s way of saying :
There ’s no way we ’re going to release those interviews .
The BBC Helps Out :
In any case NIST ’s attempt to neutralize the testimony of Barry Jennings was aided by the BBC , which interviewed Jennings and then , obviously , changed the timeline , so that the narrator , with her reassuring voice , could say :
“ At 10:28 , the North Tower collapses . . . .
This time , Tower 7 takes a direct hit from the collapsing building .
. . .
Early evidence of explosives were just debris from a falling skyscraper . ” [ 46 ]
Mike Rudin , who produced this BBC program , recently telephoned me to discuss the possibility of interviewing me about my little book , Osama bin Laden : Dead or Alive ? [ 47 ]
I told him that I had a book coming out shortly about WTC 7 and that , after seeing it , he probably would not want to interview me .
When he asked why , I said because I pointed out that he had obviously distorted the timeline of Jennings ’s account .
When he denied this , I said , OK , show me the uncut , unedited interview .
If this interview had showed that Rudin had not distorted the timeline , I would have told the world .
Rudin , however , declined to allow me to see the unedited interview . [ 48 ]
This BBC program had appeared in July of 2008 .
The first version of NIST ’s final report – its Draft for Public Comment – was to be released at a press briefing on August 21 , at which time Sunder would announce that the mystery of the collapse of WTC 7 had been solved .
The Death of Barry Jennings :
Two days prior to that , Barry Jennings died – and died very mysteriously .
No one has been willing to provide any information as to how or why this 53 - year - old man had died .
Dylan
Avery , trying to find out something , hired a private investigator – reputed to be one of the best in the state of New York – to find out what she could .
He used his credit card to pay her a considerable fee .
Within 24 hours , however , Avery received a message from her , saying :
Due to some of the information I have uncovered , I have determined that this is a job for the police .
I have refunded your credit card .
Please do not contact me again about this individual .
This is not the response one would expect , Avery observed , if she had merely found that Jennings had passed away “ innocently in a hospital . ” [ 49 ]
The dedication page on my book says : “ To the memory of Barry Jennings , whose truth - telling may have cost him his life . ”
Be that as it may , his death was very convenient for NIST , which now did not need to fear that Jennings might hold his own press conference to say that NIST had lied about his testimony .
The BBC Helps Out Again :
The death of Jennings was also convenient for the BBC , which could now put out a second version of its program on WTC 7 , this time including Michael Hess .
In the first version , the BBC had pretended that Jennings had been in the building all by himself .
Even though Jennings would say , “ We did this , and then We did that , ” the BBC spoke only of Jennings , never mentioning the fact that Hess was with him .
But in the new version , which was aired at the end of October 2008 , Hess was the star .
While admitting that , back on 9/11 , he had “ assumed that there had been an explosion in the basement , ” he said : “ I know now this was caused by the northern half of Number 1 [ the North Tower ] falling on the southern half of our building , ” exactly what Giuliani had said in his book .
It is no surprise that Hess supported Giuliani ’s account , given the fact that since 2002 Hess has been Giuliani ’s business partner .
In spite of the fact that Hess could in no way be considered an impartial witness , Mike Rudin portrayed him as such .
On his BBC blog , Rudin said that some “ self - styled truthers ” had charged that the BBC , in presenting Barry Jennings ’ testimony , had “ misrepresented the chronology . ”
But , Rudin said triumphantly , Michael Hess , “ In his first interview since 9/11 . . . confirms our timeline . ”
But Hess ’s account could be said to “ confirm ” the BBC timeline only if it were a credible account .
In my book , however , I show that it is riddled with problems , so that anyone can easily see that he was lying . [ 50 ]
2. NIST ’s Own Theory of WTC 7 ’s Collapse
Thus far , I have spoken about the first half of my book , which deals with NIST ’s negative claim , namely , that it had found no evidence that explosives were used to bring down WTC 7 .
NIST could make this argument , I have pointed out , only by committing two kinds of scientific fraud :
Ignoring relevant evidence and falsifying evidence – in this case , the testimony of Barry Jennings .
The second half of my book deals with NIST ’s own theory as to how fire brought the building down .
To develop such a theory , NIST had to falsify and fabricate data on a possibly unprecedented scale .
And yet , after all of that , it had to violate one of the basic principles of science :
Thou shalt not affirm miracles .
You perhaps know the cartoon about this .
A physics professor has filled several boards with mathematical equations , at the bottom of which we read : “ Then a miracle happens . ”
In science , you cannot appeal to miracles , whether explicitly , or only implicitly – by implying that some basic principle of physics has been violated .
And yet that is what NIST does .
Fabrication of Evidence
But before describing its miracle story , I will point out three especially obvious examples of scientific fraud committed by NIST before it resorted to this desperate expedient .
These examples all involve fabrication .
No Girder Shear Studs : NIST ’s explanation as to how fire caused Building 7 to collapse starts with thermal expansion , meaning that the fire heated up the steel , thereby causing it to expand .
A steel beam on the 13th floor , NIST claims , caused a steel girder attached to Column 79 to break loose .
Having lost its support , Column 79 failed , and this failure started a chain reaction , in which all 82 of the building ’s steel columns failed . [ 51 ]
Without getting into the question of whether this is even remotely plausible , let us just focus on the question :
Why did that girder fail ?
It failed , NIST said , because it was not connected to the floor slab with sheer studs .
NIST wrote :
In WTC 7 , no studs were installed on the girders .
Floor beams . . . had shear studs , but the girders that supported the floor beams did not have shear studs .
This point was crucial to NIST ’s answer to a commonly asked question :
Why did fire cause WTC 7 to collapse , when fire had never before brought down steel - framed high - rise buildings , some of which had had much bigger and longer - lasting fires ?
NIST ’s answer was : differences in design .
One of those crucial differences , NIST stated repeatedly , was “ the absence of [ girder ] shear studs that would have provided lateral restraint . ”
But this was a fabrication on NIST ’s part .
How can we know this ?
All we need to do is to look at NIST ’s Interim Report on WTC 7 , which it had published back in 2004 , before it had developed its theory of girder failure .
This report stated that girders as well as the beams had been attached to the floor by means of shear studs . [ 52 ]
We have here as clear a case of fabrication as one will see , with NIST simply making up a fact in order to meet the needs of its new theory .
The Raging Fire on Floor 12 at 5:00 PM : NIST also contradicted its “ interim report ” in telling a lie about the fire in the building .
NIST claims that there were very big , very hot fires covering much of the north face of the 12th floor at 5:00 PM .
This claim is essential to NIST ’s explanation as to why the building collapsed 21 minutes later .
However , if you look back at NIST ’s interim report , published before it had developed its theory , you will find this statement :
Around 4:45 PM , a photograph showed fires on Floors 7 , 8 , 9 , and 11 near the middle of the north face ; Floor 12 was burned out by this time .
Other photographs even show that the 12th floor fire had virtually burned out by 4:00 .
And yet NIST now claims that fires were still going strong at 5:00 PM . [ 53 ]
We have here another clear case of fabrication .
Shear Stud Failure : A third case of fabrication involves shear studs again – this time the shear studs that connected to the steel beams to the floor slab .
NIST claims that , due to the failure of that crucial girder discussed earlier , the floor beams were able to expand without constraint .
But each of these beams was connected to the floor slab by 28 high - strength shear studs .
These studs should have provided plenty of restraint .
They would have , except for the fact , NIST tells us , that they all broke .
Why did they break ?
Because of what NIST calls “ differential thermal expansion , ” which is simply a technical way of saying that , in response to the heat from the fires , the steel beams expanded more than the floor slabs did .
But why would that have been the case ?
Steel and concrete have virtually the same “ coefficient of thermal expansion , ” meaning that they expand virtually the same amount in response to heat .
If that were not the case , reinforced concrete – that is , concrete reinforced with steel – would break up when the weather got very hot or very cold .
NIST itself points out that “ steel and concrete have similar coefficients of thermal expansion . ”
So why does NIST claim that the shear studs broke because of differential thermal expansion ?
To understand this point , you need to understand that NIST ’s theory is an almost totally computer - based theory .
NIST fed various variables into a computer program , which then supposedly told it how WTC 7 would have reacted to its fires .
So , what did NIST feed into its computer that caused it to say that the steel would have expanded so much more than the concrete slab that all of the shear studs would have broken ?
The answer is given in this bland statement :
No thermal expansion or material degradation was considered for the concrete slab , as the slab was not heated in this analysis .
When I first read this statement , I had to rub my eyes .
Surely , I thought , I have mis-read the statement , because a few pages earlier , NIST had said : “ differential thermal expansion occurred between the steel floor beams and concrete slab when the composite floor was subjected to fire . ”
The “ composite floor , ” by definition , is the steel beams made composite with the floor slab by means of the shear studs .
So NIST had clearly said , in stating that the composite floor had been subjected to fire , that both the steel beams and the concrete slab had been heated .
But then in the eye - rubbing passage , NIST said :
When doing its computer simulation , it told the computer that only the steel beams had been heated ; the concrete floor slab was not . [ 54 ]
So of course the steel beams would have expanded , while the floor slabs stayed stationary , thereby causing the sheer studs to break , after which the steel beams could expand like crazy and bump into Column 79 , which then causes the whole building to come down .
A comic book version of the official story of 9/11 has been published . [ 55 ]
This was an exercise in redundancy , because the official reports already are the comic book version of what happened on 9/11 .
In any case , I come now to NIST ’s miracle .
NIST ’s Miracle
Members of the 9/11 Truth Movement had almost from the first been pointing out that WTC 7 came down at the same rate as a free - falling object , at least virtually so .
NIST ’S Denial of Free Fall :
In NIST ’s Draft for Public Comment , it denied this , saying that the time for the upper 18 floors to collapse “ was approximately 40 percent longer than the computed free fall time and was consistent with physical principles . ”
Implicit in this statement is that any assertion that the building did come down in free fall would not be consistent with physical principles – that is , the principles of physics .
Explaining why not , Shyam Sunder said at a technical briefing :
[ A ] free fall time would be [ the fall time of ] an object that has no structural components below it .
. . .
[ T ]he . . . time that it took . . . for those 17 floors to disappear [ was roughly 40 percent [ longer than free fall ] .
And that is not at all unusual , because there was structural resistance that was provided in this particular case .
And you had a sequence of structural failures that had to take place .
Everything was not instantaneous .
Chandler ’s Challenge : However , high - school physics teacher David Chandler challenged Sunder ’s denial at this briefing , pointing that Sunder ’s 40 percent claim contradicts “ a publicly visible , easily measurable quantity . ”
The following week , Chandler placed a video on the Internet showing that , by measuring this publicly visible quantity , anyone knowing elementary physics could see that “ for about two and a half seconds .
. . , the acceleration of the building is indistinguishable from freefall . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Finally , Chandler wrote a comment to NIST , saying : “ Acknowledgment of and accounting for an extended period of free fall in the collapse of WTC 7 must be a priority if the NIST is to be taken seriously . ”
NIST Admits Free Fall : Amazingly , NIST did acknowledge free fall in its final report .
It tried to disguise it , but the admission is there on page 607 .
Dividing the building ’s descent into three stages , it describes the second phase as “ a freefall descent over approximately eight stories at gravitational acceleration for approximately 2.25 s[econds ] .
“ Gravitational acceleration ” is a synonym for free fall acceleration .
So , after presenting 606 pages of descriptions , testimonies , photographs , graphs , analyses , explanations , and mathematical formulae , NIST on page 607 says , in effect : “ Then a miracle happens . ”
Why this would be a miracle was explained by Chandler , who said : “ Free fall can only be achieved if there is zero resistance to the motion . ”
The implication of Chandler ’s remark is that , by the principles of physics , the upper portion of Building 7 could have come down in free fall only if something had removed all the steel and concrete in the lower part of the building , which would have otherwise provided resistance , and only explosives of some sort could have removed them .
If they had not been removed and the upper floors had come down in free fall anyway , even for only a second or two , a miracle would have happened .
That was what Sunder himself had explained the previous August , saying that a free - falling object would be one “ that has no structural components below it ” to offer resistance .
Having stated in August that free fall could not have happened , NIST also stated that it did not happen , saying : “ WTC 7 did not enter free fall . ”
But then in November , while still defending the same theory , which rules out explosives and thereby rules out free fall , NIST admitted that , as an empirical fact , free fall happened .
For a period of 2 and a fourth seconds , NIST admitted , the descent of WTC 7 was characterized by “ gravitational acceleration ( free fall ) . ”
Knowing that it had thereby affirmed a miracle , meaning a violation of a law of physics , NIST no longer claimed that its analysis was consistent with the physical principles .
In its Draft put out in August , NIST had repeatedly said that its analysis of the collapse was “ consistent with physical principles . ”
One encountered this phrase time and time again .
In its final report , however , this phrase is no more to be found .
NIST thereby admitted , for those with eyes to see , that its report on WTC 7 , by admitting free fall while continuing to deny that explosives were used , is not consistent with the principles of physics . [ 56 ]
And yet the mainstream press will not report this admission .
So the press continues to support the notion that anyone who questions the official reports on 9/11 is unfit for public service . [ 57 ]
Conclusion
The 9/11 Truth Movement has long considered the collapse of Building 7 to be the Achilles ’ heel of the official story about 9/11 – the part of this story that , by being most vulnerable , could be used to bring down the whole body of lies .
My latest book , The Mysterious Collapse of World Trade Center 7 : Why the Final Official Report about 9/11 Is Unscientific and False , shows that the official account of this building is indeed extremely vulnerable to critique – so vulnerable that , to see the falsity of this account , you need only to read NIST ’s attempt to defend it , noting the obvious lies in NIST ’s report and its violations of basic principles of physics .
I hope that my book will indeed help bring down that body of lies that some of us call the Bush - Cheney conspiracy theory , according to which al - Qaeda hijackers , by flying planes into two buildings of the World Trade Center , brought down three of them – an obviously false conspiracy theory that is still being used , among other things , to kill women , children , and other innocent people in Afghanistan and Pakistan .

I am referring to the fact that Van Jones , who had been an Obama administration advisor on “ green jobs , ” felt compelled to resign due to the uproar evoked by the revelation that he had signed a petition questioning the official account of 9/11 .
The view that this act made him unworthy was perhaps articulated most clearly by Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer .
After dismissing as irrelevant the other reasons that had been given for demanding Jones ’s resignation , Krauthammer wrote : “ He ’s gone for one reason and one reason only .
You ca n’t sign a petition demanding … investigations of the charge that the Bush administration deliberately allowed Sept. 11 , 2001 – i.e. , collaborated in the worst massacre ever perpetrated on American soil – and be permitted in polite society , let alone have a high - level job in the White House .
Unlike the other stuff … , this is no trivial matter .
It ’s beyond radicalism , beyond partisanship .
It takes us into the realm of political psychosis , a malignant paranoia that , unlike the Marxist posturing , is not amusing .
It ’s dangerous … .
You can no more have a truther in the White House than you can have a Holocaust denier – a person who creates a hallucinatory alternative reality in the service of a fathomless malice ” ( Charles Krauthammer , “ The Van Jones Matter , ” Washington Post , September 11 , 2009 http://www.washingtonpost.com/wpdyn/content/article/2009/09/10/AR2009091003408.html
Every couple argues .
Some of them do it overtly by yelling at each other while others do it covertly by avoiding contact and conversation .
Whatever the method , the result is the same — hurt feelings and disenchantment .
Here are my tips to help you argue constructively .
If done correctly , it can be a pathway to growth and problem - solving .
Understand that itself is not destructive .
There is a vast difference between anger and rage .
When someone is angry they need to state their feelings , they do n't break things or relationships — that is rageful behavior .
Talk about your feelings before you get angry .
When you or your partner can approach the situation as it happens and deal with it in a safe way , it may not get to the point of being an argument .
Sometimes things just need to be verbalized and most arguments can be avoided if your partner understands how you feel .
Do n't raise your voice .
It 's amazing how issues of hurt feelings or differences can be resolved with a whisper .
I counsel couples who are yellers to only communicate with a whisper and it greatly reduces the anger factor in their relationships .
Do n't threaten your relationship and do n't take every argument as a threat to your relationship .
This type of emotional blackmail puts the other partner in a / flight - or - flight mode .
While you 're telling them you want to leave , they may be making plans to find a roommate .
In addition , they may be so devastated by the thought of losing their family they can go into a deep and be unable to give you what it is you need .
Do n't stockpile .
This is where you bring up issues from the past to use as a hammer against whatever problem your partner has asked for help with .
Deal with their issue first and if you really have unresolved feelings from past problems talk about them at another time .
Do n't avoid your anger .
If you stuff your feelings long enough you will explode and say or do things that you will regret .
Anger does not diminish love , you can be angry with those you love .
In fact the ones we love hurt us the most because we love them the most .
Create a process for resolving problems without anger .
Start by each of you taking five minutes to state your feelings , then take a 20 - minute break to think about things and come back to the table for another ten minutes to discuss how you think you can best deal with the problem .
Also , know that it 's OK if the problem does n't get solved right away .
Abuse is never allowed .
This includes verbal abuse , any type of violence including slamming doors , breaking plates or hitting .
If your arguments escalate to this level you need to leave the house .
If one partner ever hits another a police report needs to be made and an appointment with a therapist is mandatory .
Do n't engage .
Remember that negative is still attention .
If your partner tries to goad you into an argument , simply do n't go there .
Some people actually like to argue because it gives them a temporary feeling of power and gratification .
Avoid being sucked into their need for attention .
Listen to your body .
When you are angry your body releases chemicals that may cause you to react in ways that can be destructive to you , your partner and your relationship .
Learn to understand your feelings and how the process of anger affects you physically and emotionally .
Research has shown that couples who argue more than twenty percent of the time are probably not going to survive .
Hopefully , these tips will help you get your arguments under control and reduce the level of energy in those arguments .
If not , and if you want to keep your relationship , you need to find a qualified couple 's therapist .
If you would like information on finding an appropriate therapist , send an e-mail to me at the web site below with the word " therapists " in the subject line .
I will send you information about the different types of therapists and available , and a list of some local clinics .
The majority of music sold in the U.S. is still via CD -- 65 % market share , almost a two - to - one lead over digital , according to research firm NPD Group .
But digital sales continue to take share , now 35 % of all music sales in the first half of 2009 , up from 30 % of sales last year and 20 % in 2007 .
From NPD 's release : According to NPD MusicWatch , when it comes to the unit - sales volume of music sold at retail – including paid digital music downloads and CDs – Apple iTunes leads in the U.S. with 25 percent of music units sold , which is up from 21 percent in 2008 and 14 percent in 2007 .
Walmart ( including Walmart , Walmart.com , Walmart Music Downloads ) remains in second position with 14 percent of music volume sold at their stores and Web sites with Best Buy ranked third .
iTunes also continued to solidify its lead in the digital music arena , as consumer downloads from iTunes comprised 69 percent of the digital music market in the first half of 2009 , followed by AmazonMP3 at 8 percent .
Walmart leads all sellers of CDs with a 20 percent share of the physical music market , followed by Best Buy at 16 percent and Target and Amazon tied at 10 percent each .
If I tell someone I am a financial mathematician , they often think I am an accountant with pretensions .
Since accountants do not like using negative numbers , one of the oldest mathematical technologies , I find this irritating .
A roll of the dice
I was drawn into financial maths not because I was interested in finance , but because I was interested in making good decisions in the face of uncertainty .
Mathematicians have been interested in the topic of decision - making since Girolamo Cardano explored the ethics of gambling in his Liber de Ludo Aleae of 1564 , which contains the first discussion of the idea of mathematical probability .
Cardano , famously , commented that knowing that the chance of a fair dice coming up with a six is one in six is of no use to the gambler since probability does not predict the future .
But it is of interest if you are trying to establish whether a gamble is fair or not ; it helps in making good decisions .
The average value of rolling a dice converges to the expected value of 3.5 when
the dice is rolled a large number of times .
With the exception of Pascal ’s wager ( essentially that you 've got nothing to lose by betting that God exists ) , the early development of probability , from Cardano , through Galileo and Fermat and Pascal up to Daniel Bernoulli , was driven by considering gambling problems .
These ideas about probability were collected by Jacob Bernoulli ( Daniel 's uncle ) , in his work Ars Conjectandi .
He introduced the law of large numbers , proving that if you repeat the same experiment ( say rolling a dice ) a large number of times , then the observed mean ( the average of the scores you have rolled ) will converge to the expected mean .
( For a fair dice each of the six scores is equally likely , so the expected mean is ( 1+2+3+4+5+6 ) /6 = 3.5 . )
Measure theory
Building on Jacob Bernoulli ’s work , probability theory was developed by the likes of Laplace in the eighteenth century and the Fisher , Neyman and Pearson in the twentieth .
In conjunction with statistics , probability theory became an essential tool of the scientist .
For the first third of the twentieth century , probability was associated with inferring results , such as the life expectancy of a person , from observed data .
But as an inductive science ( i.e. the results were inspired by experimental observations , rather than the deductive nature of mathematics built on axioms ) , probability was not fully integrated into maths until 1933 when Andrey Kolmogorov identified probability with measure theory .
Kolmogorov defined probability to be any measure on a collection of events — not necessarily based on the frequency of events .
What is it worth ?
This idea is counter - intuitive if you have been taught to calculate probabilities by counting events , but can be explained with a simple example .
If I want to measure the value of a painting , I can do this by measuring the area that the painting occupies , base it on the price an auctioneer gives the painting or base it on my own subjective assessment .
For Kolmogorov , these are all acceptable measures which could be transformed into probability measures .
The measure you choose to help you make decisions will depend on the problem you are addressing : if you want to work out how to cover a wall with pictures , the area measure would be best ; if you are speculating , the auctioneer ’s would be better .
Kolmogorov formulated the axioms of probability that we now take for granted .
Firstly , that the probability of an event happening is a non-negative real number ( P( E ) ≥ 0 ) .
Secondly , that you know all the possible outcomes , and the probability of one of these outcomes occurring is 1 ( e.g. for a six - sided dice , the probability of rolling a 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , or 6 is P ( 1,2,3,4,5,6 ) = 1 ) .
And finally , that you can sum the probability of mutually exclusive events ( e.g. the probability of rolling an even number is P ( 2,4,6 ) = P( 2 ) + P( 4 ) + P( 6 ) = 1/2 ) .
( You can read more about probability and its development on the Understanding Uncertainty site , and the Plus article Measure for measure is an excellent introduction to measure theory . )
Deciding a fair price
Why is the measure theoretic approach so important in finance ?
Financial mathematicians investigate markets on the basis of a simple premise ; when you price an asset it should be impossible to make money without the risk of losing money , and by symmetry , it should be impossible to lose money without the chance of making money .
If you stop and think about this premise you should quickly realise it has little to do with the practicalities of business , where the objective is to make money without the risk of losing it , which is called an arbitrage , and financial institutions invest millions in technology that helps them identify arbitrage opportunities .
An asset should be priced so as to prevent such arbitrages .
Financial mathematicians realised that an asset ’s price can be represented as an expectation under a special probability measure , called a risk - neutral measure , which bears no direct relation to the ' natural ' probability of the asset price rising or falling based on past observations .
( The explanation of risk - neutral measures is pretty straightforward and is described here .
You can also read a general introduction to arbitrage and pricing in the Plus article Rogue Trading . )
However , as with much of probability , what seems simple can be very subtle .
A no -arbitrage price is not simply an expectation using a special probability ; it is only an arbitrage - free if it is risk neutral and will not result in the possibility of making or losing money .
And you have to undertake an investment strategy , known as hedging , that removes these possibilities .
In the real world , which involves awkward things like taxes and transaction costs , it is impossible to find a unique risk - neutral measure that will ensure all these risks can be hedged away .
One of the key objectives of financial maths is to understand how to construct the best investment strategies that minimises risks in the real world .
In good company
Financial mathematics is interesting because it synthesizes a highly technical and abstract branch of maths , measure theoretic probability , with practical applications that affect peoples ’ everyday lives .
Financial mathematics is exciting because , by employing advanced mathematics , we are developing the theoretical foundations of finance and economics .
To appreciate the impact of this work , we need to realise that much of modern financial theory , including Nobel prize winning work , is based on assumptions that are imposed , not because they reflect observed phenomena but because they enable mathematical tractability .
Just as physics has motivated new maths , financial mathematicians are now developing new maths to model observed economic , rather than physical , phenomena .
Financial innovation currently has a poor reputation and some might feel that mathematicians should think twice before becoming involved with " filthy lucre " .
However , Aristotle tells us that Thales , the father of western science , became rich by applying his scientific knowledge to speculation , Galileo left the University of Padua to work for Cosimo II de Medici , and wrote
On the discoveries of dice , becoming the first quant .
Around a hundred years after Galileo left Padua , Sir Isaac Newton , left Cambridge to become warden of the Royal Mint , and lost the modern equivalent of £ 3,000,000 in the South Sea Bubble .
Personally , what was good enough for Newton is good enough for me .
Moreover , interesting things happen when maths meets finance : the concept of probability emerged out of the interface .
And looking at the 23 DARPA Challenges for mathematics , several of these — the mathematics of the brain , the dynamics of networks and capturing and harnessing stochasticity in nature , beyond convex optimization — are all highly relevant to finance .
The Credit Crisis did not affect all banks in the same way .
Some banks , like J.P. Morgan .
engaged with mathematics and made good decisions , while others did not and caused mayhem ( see Gillian Tett ’s book Fools ’ Gold for more information ) .
Since Cardano , financial maths has been about understanding how humans make decisions in the face of uncertainty and then establishing how to make good decisions .
Making , or at least not losing , money is simply a by - product of this knowledge .
As Xunyu Zhou , who is developing the rigorous mathematical basis for behavioural economics at Oxford , recently commented :
Financial mathematics needs to tell not only what people ought to do , but also what people actually do .
This gives rise to a whole new horizon for mathematical finance research : can we model and analyse ... the consistency and predictability in human flaws so that such flaws can be explained , avoided or even exploited for profit ?.
This is the theory .
In practice , in the words of one investment banker :
Banks need high level maths skills because that is how the bank makes money .

EAST DALLAS , Texas , Aug. 16 ( UPI ) --
A resident in an East Dallas , Texas , historic district has been told to remove the artificial lawn he installed , city officials said .
The Dallas Morning News reported Jose Escobedo was unable to grow grass on his Junius heights Historic District property , so he paid $ 1,400 to have artificial grass installed where his failing lawn had been .
Advertisement
Escobedo is a former construction worker who was injured several years ago and receives about $ 1,500 a month in disability payments .
He uses the money pay $ 639 per month on his mortgage and to raise two daughters .
" I 've done everything I can do .
I do n't have money , " Escobedo said .
" If the city does n't like it , I say to them -- come and take it . "
" The artificial turf is simply inappropriate for neighborhood houses built from 1900 to 1940 .
The materials they used back then would not have been artificial , " Kate Singleton , East Dallas ' preservation office 's chief planner said , referring to the restoration efforts .
While neighborhood association officials side with the city preservation office , Escobedo 's neighbors side with him , the newspaper reported .
" It ( Escobedo 's house ) looks nicer than anything around it , " said his next - door neighbor Steve Winget .
" I saw how it was before .
Grass would n't grow there .
They should leave him alone . "
One celebrity supporter , the actress Debra Winger , said it was a " three - decades - old case that is dead but for minor technicalities .
We stand by him and await his release and his next masterpiece . "
Movie mogul Harvey Weinstein said Polanski was a " humanist " who had been the victim of a " miscarriage of justice " .
He said : " We will have to speak to our leaders , particularly in California .
I 'm not too shy to go and talk to the Governor of California , Arnold Schwarzenegger , and to ask him once and for all to look at this . "
However , the views of the Hollywood elite seemed out of step with those of ordinary Americans and they now face a backlash .
For those of you who thought the Catholic Church was truly feeling some deep remorse about the tens of thousands of children who have been molested by priests over the years , think again .
Self - reflection , shame , and remorseful regret ?
Are you out of your mind ?
How about a defiant counterattack in the face of unjust criticism and slander ?
Oh yeah , you heard that right .
According to the Guardian , the Vatican has indeed just lashed out at its critics — that is , those who say it has n't done enough to uncover and stop the abuse — claiming that the abuse is just as bad , if not worse , in other religions and dominations .
That 's right , people , the Catholic Church — according to the Catholic Church — is actually one of the world leaders when it comes to low sex abuse rates among clergy .
You want real sex abuse ?
Check out the Jews , Protestants , Muslims , and Hindus .
And , for Christ sakes , do n't forget those filthy - minded Buddhists .
Pedophilia , Schmedophilia
Even more ballsy than all this finger pointing at others and insinuations that the whole thing has been blown out of proportion by the media and those whiny little " victims " is the claim that none of this has anything to do with pedophilia .
Yes , that 's right , according to the Vatican none of this is really about pedophilia , rather it's all about raging ephebophilia ( the homosexual attraction to adolescent males ) .
In other words , it 's not so much about sexual abuse as it is about gay priests , to quote the Vatican , " engaging in sex with adolescent boys between the ages of 11 and 17 " .
What a relief !
And to think that I had felt sickened by all this alleged abuse , when really it was never anything more than teenage ( and prepubescent ) boys " engaging in sex " with their priests .
I do n't know about you , but I 'm convinced by all this and I think it 's finally time that people lay off the poor misunderstood Catholic Church .
Minuscule Numbers
Oh and one other thing : the Vatican also stated that , " only 1.5 % - 5 % " of Catholic clergy are involved in child sex abuse .
I know that some may argue with that number but , personally , I know the good church has nothing to hide and these numbers are probably pretty accurate .
So , using the five - percent figure , with a worldwide Catholic priesthood of more than 400,000 , that means there are only about 20,000 Catholic priests presently involved in child sex abuse .
And those 20,000 on average are only molesting , say , half a dozen to a dozen kids at any one time , right ?
So at worst there are only between 120,000 and 250,000 kids being buggered and fondled by their clergy in any given month .
That 's nothing !
Not even when you add in the thousands of others who claim to have been abused by non-priests , such as the Christian Brothers in both Newfoundland and in Ireland , where a government inquiry found rape to be " endemic " over a period of decades , or when you include the tens of thousands of Natives who suffered abuse in Canada 's notorious residential schools .
No , I think it 's pretty clear , the Vatican is right ; there simply is n't anything to be concerned about here .
Especially since , once again , we 're not actually talking about pedophilia , but only priests " engaging in sex with adolescent boys " .
Lighten up everyone ; priests have to have a little fun , too , you know .
Has n't the Church been put through enough already ?
Seriously , if you 're looking for a real victim in all of this , look no further than the poor misunderstood Church .
I 'm so glad they stood up for themselves and finally set this matter straight once and for all .

Terrorizing Dissent
The Election Cut
Glass Bead Collective , Twin Cities Indymedia , and other independent media activists have released a new film , ' Terrorizing Dissent ' , an exposé of events at the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul , Minnesota .
Featuring first - person accounts and footage from more than forty cameras on the streets , ' Terrorizing Dissent ' focuses on the story of dissent suppressed .
People charged with " conspiracy to riot in furtherance of terrorism " speak out against the government 's campaign to manipulate media coverage and label civil disobedience and community organizing as terrorism .
" If civil disobedience becomes framed as ' terrorism ' ... that 's baloney .
And the reason they 're waving the T - word around , there 's one reason and one reason only , because they want to squash dissent and they want to justify what the police do in the effort of squashing that dissent . "
Michelle Gross , Communities United Against Police Brutality
' Terrorizing Dissent ' shows the results of the $ 50 million dollars the Department of Homeland Security gave to local authorities for security — a large chunk of which went to weaponize the police — and the $ 10 million insurance policy contract between the RNC Host Committee and the City of St. Paul , which shattered Minnesota 's civil compact between protesters and police .
Effectively , the Republican National Committee provided financial cover for the widespread , organized suppression of dissent .
The FBI and Secret Service coordinated with local police to raid homes and work spaces before the RNC even began .
On the streets , the government 's intimidation strategy shut down peaceful protests through the heavy use of tear gas , pepper spray , stun grenades , rubber bullets , and other projectiles .
This excessive use of force followed months of harassment and surveillance of community activists .
At every stage , local officials have refused to release the documentation behind what they did , from the origins of dubious search warrants to joint powers agreements .
The Republican Party 's efforts to control the message and crush dissenting voices were led by one of the top local Republicans , troubled Ramsey County Sheriff Bob Fletcher , who personally spearheaded the " pre-emptive raid " strategy and spun the media by claiming captured household items were weapons ( most notably , the buckets of recycled grey water he dubbed " urine " ) .
At every stage , from fake urine to riot threats , messages of fear were distributed to chill Minnesotans from exercising their First Amendment rights .
Just days before Fletcher launched high - profile preemptive raids against protesters , two of his closest aides , Mark Naylon and Timothy Rehak , were found guilty on federal charges after they attempted to steal $ 6,000 in an FBI sting .
To shore up his murky political future , Fletcher staged an authoritarian spectacle unparalleled in Minnesota history .
" We have unlawful search and seizure .
We have unlawful arrest without probably cause ....
Mass arrest and detention without probable cause ....
Then you have excessive force .
Spraying people point blank range with mace who are n't resisting and who are peaceful is excessive force .
Beating people in jail is excessive force ...
Those all should be criminal complaints .
They 'll never be charged as such by any prosecutor . "
Bruce Nestor , National Lawyers Guild
As local Democratic officials cautiously stepped back , Fletcher put himself in front of a classic " security theater " media campaign to create a non-existent enemy , equate civil disobedience with terrorism , and move in to attack peaceful protests .
This plan culminated with the blocking and flashbang bombing of a peaceful march organized by anti-war activists on September 4th as John McCain delivered his acceptance speech at the Xcel Center .
Within weeks , John McCain 's campaign turned to attacking Barack Obama on the same grounds as the RNC Welcoming Committee , a group that provided logistical help such as housing , food and a convergence center for demonstrators .
This rapidly produced " election cut " shows how the government — even in a liberal state like Minnesota — easily rolled over to domestic militarization and criminal abandonment of Constitutional freedoms .
As the Republican National Convention paved the way for a fall of terrifying national instability and financial chaos , Americans need to know about the techniques used to silence Minnesota .

Trafigura , the oil - trading company at the centre of the scandal caused by the dumping of tons of toxic waste in one of the world 's poorest countries , could be prosecuted for murder after a dossier of evidence was submitted to a court in the Netherlands yesterday , alleging that the sludge caused deaths and serious injuries .
A complaint filed by Greenpeace Netherlands calls for a Dutch prosecution arising from Trafigura 's actions in July 2006 – when a chartered tanker carrying the contaminated waste arrived in Amsterdam – to be widened to include events in Ivory Coast a month later which caused thousands of people to fall ill after tons of the foul - smelling slurry was dumped in the port of Abidjan .
The campaigning group wants Dutch courts to order public prosecutors to bring charges of murder , manslaughter , negligence and conspiracy against the London - based commodities giant , which has vigorously denied any knowledge of the fly - tipping of the waste by an Ivorian sub - contractor in August 2006 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Emails between Trafigura employees submitted to the court in The Hague are claimed by Greenpeace to show that the company knew the waste – described in one internal memo as " the shit " – was potentially hazardous and could not be exported outside the European Union .
Trafigura insists that its managers sought at all times to dispose lawfully of the " slops " on board its chartered tanker , the Probo Koala .
Trafigura , which last year had a turnover of $ 73bn ( £ 44bn , equivalent to twice the GDP of Ivory Coast ) , has agreed to a multimillion - pound payout to settle Britain 's largest group lawsuit , brought by 30,000 Abidjan residents who fell ill after breathing in fumes from the sludge .
The settlement of the High Court case , expected to be finalised within weeks , concerns claims by victims who suffered short - term illnesses .
But it does not apply to allegations , which will now not be tested in the British courts , that the dumped waste caused more serious problems , including deaths , miscarriages and birth defects .
Trafigura has fought a three - year battle , engaging PR consultants and libel lawyers to dispute critical reporting of the incident , and insists that the waste could not have caused the serious injuries alleged .
A United Nations report this week stated that there seemed to be " prima facie evidence " that up to a dozen deaths in Abidjan were linked to the sludge .
The oil trader , the third - largest of its kind in the world , is already being prosecuted in the Netherlands over claims that it breached Dutch and European laws by misdeclaring the nature of the sludge on the Probo Koala when it arrived in Amsterdam , and by subsequently taking the waste outside EU borders .
A Greenpeace spokesman said : " The emails show that Trafigura employees knew the waste would be difficult to deal with and were desperate to find someone who would take it off their hands .
" There are now no legal proceedings which will test the claims that as well as making thousands of people in Ivory Coast sick , the waste was also responsible for deaths and other serious injuries of innocent people .
We are asking the Dutch courts to change that . "
The contaminated sludge – its composition is disputed by Trafigura and opponents – was the by - product of deals struck by the company 's traders in 2005 and 2006 to buy a cheap and dirty oil known as " coker naptha " from a Mexican refinery and extract clean fuel from it by adding a mixture of caustic soda and a catalyst .
Emails show Trafigura expected to make a profit of $ 7 m ( £ 4 m ) from each cargo , despite the fact that " caustic washes are banned in most countries due to the hazardous nature of the waste " .
This do - it - yourself process was performed in or about April 2006 on board the Probo Koala while it was anchored off Gibraltar .
The resulting waste arrived in Abidjan on 19 August 2006 and was unloaded from the tanker into trucks hired by Compagnie Tommy , the sub - contractor employed by Trafigura 's shipping agent .
It was then dumped at 18 sites , including drains and lagoons , around the sprawling city , leading to a flood of victims complaining of symptoms including sickness , diarrhoea and breathing difficulties .
Autopsy reports included in the Greenpeace dossier suggest that the bodies of 12 people who died in Abidjan showed high levels of hydrogen sulphide , a poisonous gas which campaigners claim was present in the waste .
Trafigura insists the gas could not have been emitted by the sludge .
In a statement , the company accused Greenpeace of a " wholly selective interpretation " of a small number of emails containing " trader - speak " which could not be taken literally .
It added : " More importantly , on a proper analysis of all the material and of what in fact happened , it is clear that the responsible individuals at Trafigura sought at all times to ensure that the slops were disposed of lawfully .
" Greenpeace Netherlands ' unfounded accusations are utterly rejected by Trafigura .
It is deeply regrettable that Greenpeace has chosen to make a number of serious and unfounded remarks , without any regard to the available scientific evidence or to statements made by Trafigura based on detailed analysis by independent experts . "
AMMUNITION FOR THE SELF - DEFENSE FIREARM
Opinion by Anonymous Preface by Chuck Hawks , Guns and Shooting Online Owner and Managing Editor Perhaps a decade and a half ago , I decided to reproduce this rather long article on Guns and Shooting Online , because it addressed an important topic and it was clearly the author 's desire that it be widely disseminated .
Another reason was that it made interesting reading and I enjoy a good read as much as anyone .
Although the author had some strong opinions and I did n't necessarily agree with all of them , they were informed opinions and worthy of consideration .
Actually , I had an idea about the identity of " Anonymous , " but I could have been mistaken .
Self - defense ammunition is a field in which improvements and changes are continually taking place and these have been especially rapid in the last 10 years .
In order to keep this article reasonably timely , every couple of years or so I have taken the liberty of lightly revising some sections to include new information .
By 2016 , so many new developments , especially in the area of bullet design , but also powders , had taken place that many of the loads originally discussed by the author had been superseded or discontinued by their manufacturers and completely new American manufacturers had begun offering factory loaded defensive ammunition .
( Nosler and Sig Sauer would be examples . )
It was clear that if the article were to remain useful , a complete revision was necessary .
This was accomplished in July , 2016 .
I have tried to retain as much of the original philosophy , language , style and information as possible , while including new ammunition developments from the major American ammunition manufacturers and the results of the latest testing and data .
For example , we now have data from the ongoing Lucky Gunner ammunition tests , which is among the most extensive civilian ammunition testing programs ever , and this information has been included in the article .
Future updates in this article will continue to be made as required .
I hope you enjoy reading " Ammunition For The Self - Defense Firearm " and find it useful .
This is a guide to help you select the best ammunition for your defensive firearm .
Most of these opinions are based upon the work of Massad Ayoob , Evan Marshall and Ed Sanow , police officers who have extensively studied the issue of firearms , ammunition and stopping power .
I refer all interested parties to the excellent series by Ayoob ( In the Gravest Extreme , Stressfire , The Semi-Automatic Pistol in Police Service and Self - Defense , Stressfire II : Advanced Combat Shotgun ) and the Stopping Power books by Marshall and Sanow .
In particular , it can not be stressed too heavily that all gun owners should own a copy of In the Gravest Extreme and re-read it periodically .
Once you have read it you will understand why .
These three policemen are the world 's foremost authorities on choosing ammunition for real - world defensive use .
Their views are based on exhaustive review of thousands of police and civilian shooting incidents , autopsies and ballistic gelatin tests .
I have chosen to rely primarily on Ayoob , Marshall and Sanow when it comes to selecting my personal ammunition .
Some other authorities rely entirely on the latter ( e.g. Dr. Martin Fackler , the FBI Wound Ballistics Lab , the National Institute of Justice Ballistic Research Laboratory ) , which is often insufficient to make reliable predictions .
Human beings react differently to being shot than gelatin or other test media and this should be realized and understood .
Obviously , I cannot discuss every available load in an article of this nature .
I urge you to research the sources listed for a more detailed discussion than is possible here .
I cannot stress too heavily that the primary determinant of stopping power is BULLET PLACEMENT .
A cool , deliberate marksman with a little .32 Walther PPK will beat a panicky , inaccurate man with a .357 Magnum or $ 1200 customized .45 auto every time .
Whatever firearm and caliber you select , you must practice firing hundreds , or thousands , of rounds in realistic defensive scenarios until you can confidently make disabling hits on your target .
Tactics and marksmanship win gunfights , not having the latest wonder bullet in your gun .
Unfortunately , I cannot address tactics in this short essay , only recommend proven ammunition .
You should seek competent training in tactics and marksmanship from a qualified instructor in your area .
Self Defense Ammunition Generally American ammunition is the best in the world .
Stick to Federal , Cor-Bon , Hornady , Remington , Winchester , Speer , CCI , Blazer , Sig Sauer , Nosler or other American made ammunition .
Some foreign stuff is pretty good ( PMC , IMI - Samson , Fiocci ) , some foreign stuff is great ( Dynamit - Nobel , Norma , GECO ) , some foreign stuff is practice - only junk ( e.g. Wolf , CDM - Mexico , military surplus ) , but no foreign stuff is as good as domestic ammunition when it comes to vanquishing hostile attackers .
Buy American .
Never use hand loaded or reloaded ammunition for self - defense , unless it is absolutely unavoidable .
You may encounter some joker who says he can hand - load ammunition so powerful it will knock anything on two legs down for the count , but do n't buy it .
This junk will either misfire or ruin your gun .
Use only fresh factory loaded cartridges from reputable manufacturers .
Handgun Ammo
One should carry ammunition loaded with bullets that expand or fragment rapidly upon impact in a defensive handgun .
This generally means hollow point bullets , tipped bullets , or in some cases frangible or pre-fragmented bullets .
Hollow point ammunition has much better stopping power than full metal jacket or round - nose lead and stopping power is what you need when being assaulted .
The point is not to wound or kill the adversary , the point is to stop him in his tracks and make him cease attacking you .
Stopping power ( sometimes called " knock - down power " ) refers to a particular bullet 's ability to incapacitate an attacker ; the greater that ability , the less chance that your attacker will be able to continue shooting , stabbing , or beating you after you have shot him .
Handguns are not death rays .
Despite what you see in the movies , the vast majority of people ( over 80 % ) shot with handguns survive .
Handguns are weak compared to rifles and shotguns and you want every edge you can get .
Great ammunition is no more expensive than mediocre ammunition , so carry the best .
Rifles and shotguns have stopping power to spare ; handguns do not .
You must select your handgun load very carefully and the detail of the handgun ammunition section reflects this .
Hollow point ammunition is NOT more lethal than ball ( full metal jacket ) ammunition .
You may have seen media hype about " killer dum - dum bullets , " but this is nonsense .
Hollow point bullets usually expand and stop in the human body and thus the attacker absorbs much more of the bullet 's kinetic energy than if the bullet had merely zipped through him and left two small holes .
You are safer because your attacker is more likely to be incapacitated after one or two shots and thus unable to harm you .
Furthermore , if your foe is incapacitated quickly he wo n't be spraying wild bullets around and endangering uninvolved third parties .
Innocent bystanders are safer because hollow point bullets are less likely to exit the attacker 's body and go on to injure anyone else .
The ricochet danger is also lower than with ball ammunition and hollow point bullets are less likely to penetrate walls or doors and strike uninvolved third parties .
A variation on the jacketed hollow point bullet is the tipped bullet .
This is essentially a hollow point bullet with the hollow cavity filled or partially filled with a plastic plug .
This plastic tip is intended to be driven back into the bullet 's lead core upon impact , initiating expansion .
Sometimes heavy clothing or barrier materials ( wall board , wood , etc. ) can plug the nose cavity of hollow point bullets , preventing the bullet from expanding properly .
Tipped bullets are designed to eliminate this problem .
Another relatively recent innovation in handgun bullet design is the bonded core .
This solders or chemically bonds the lead core of a jacketed bullet to the copper or gilding metal jacket material .
This prevents core / jacket separation as the bullet expands , retaining weight and thus increasing penetration .
No single bullet design works optimally in all calibers and at all velocities .
Higher impact velocity aids expansion , while lower velocity degrades expansion .
This makes bullet performance more problematical with low velocity cartridges , such as .380 ACP and .45 ACP .
Bullets that initiate expansion relatively easily are usually the best choice in such calibers .
( Example : Speer Gold Dot , Federal HST , Remington SJHP , Winchester Silvertip and Winchester Defender . )
Remember , there is no universal Wonder Bullet .
Here are some common jacketed hollow point ( JHP ) bullets and tipped bullets found in US factory loaded ammunition that generally give good results in most of the calibers in which they are loaded : Federal HST ( JHP )
Hornady FTX ( tipped bullet )
Remington SJHP ( a JHP designed specifically for revolvers )
Sierra JHC ( used in Cor-Bon Self - Defense JHP loads )
Sig Sauer V - Crown ( JHP )
Speer Gold Dot ( JHP )
Winchester Defender ( bonded JHP )
There are some exceptions to the " carry only hollow points in a handgun " rule .
Some older or cheaper semi-automatic pistols will jam with hollow point rounds .
With these guns , one must use ball rounds ( or " full metal jacket " rounds - the terms are synonymous ) and I specify some " reliable with ball only " pistol models by caliber .
It is crucial for you to test your pistol to make certain it is reliable with specific loads ; do n't rely on my advice .
My life will never depend on the reliability of your handgun .
Your life may .
Rifle Ammo Generally speaking , fast expanding bullets are the best choice for rifles .
Hollow point and plastic tipped bullets usually expand rapidly .
Some soft - point designs are recommended and these will be specified .
Shotgun Ammo
Use buckshot .
Slugs and birdshot may be useful in some limited situations .
A Note On Exotic Ammunition
There are several exotic ammunition designs on the market , such as the Glaser Safety Slug , Glaser Pow ' RBall , Mag Safe , GECO BAT 9 mm , DRT , et cetera .
Generally speaking , I recommend that you avoid them .
Exotic ammunition is expensive , often inaccurate and often unreliable .
These rounds cost so much ( $ 2 - $ 4 each , or more ) that you will never adequately practice with them and thus will not be certain of their reliability and accuracy in your gun .
This is a big mistake .
You should not carry a particular type of ammunition until you have fired at least 100 rounds through your semi-automatic pistol to ensure reliable feeding .
( This does n't apply to revolvers , but you should still fire the ammunition you intend to carry to assure yourself of its accuracy ) .
Glaser Safety Slugs , made by Cor -Bon , are one exotic round I can fully recommend , but only for revolvers in a few scenarios .
The Glaser is a proven man-stopper in typical civilian frontal - shooting situations and it has very good quality control .
However , it may not feed or cycle reliably in some automatic pistols .
Because you probably cannot afford to fire enough Glasers to establish that it feeds reliably in your pistol ( 100 test - fire rounds will cost over $ 300 ) , I cannot recommend them for autoloading pistols .
The Walther PPK , H&K P7 series and SIG P230 , for example , are notorious for this failure - to - cycle problem with Glaser Safety Slugs .
With revolvers , feeding is not an issue , but there are other factors to consider .
Glaser Safety
Slugs use unusually lightweight bullets at higher than normal velocity .
This means your gun will almost certainly shoot to a very different point of aim than it does with conventional ammunition .
The Glaser lightweight , pre-fragmented bullet is designed for easy break - up and minimal penetration .
This is great for cutting down ricochet and over - penetration dangers , but drastically limits its ability to penetrate light cover between you and your foe .
A car window , hollow - core door , particle board , or even exceptionally thick winter clothing between you and your assailant can cause the Glaser to disintegrate and leave him unharmed .
Bad news for you , great news for him .
However , there are some situations where the Glaser is a good choice .
I keep my bedside .357 revolver loaded with .38 Special +P
Glasers , because I live in a thin - walled apartment building and want to be able to put down an intruder rapidly , without worrying about injuring my neighbors .
I chose .38 Special over .357 Magnum , because I am likely to be in a just - awakened daze and would rather not be blinded and disoriented by the flash , kick and blast of firing a .357 Magnum in a darkened room .
You may have a similar situation , such as retail store defense , living in an apartment , or staying in trailer park , where injury to third parties is of concern and you 'll likely be facing an assailant at extremely close range .
The Glaser 's inaccuracy and inability to penetrate cover will probably not be serious drawbacks in such situations .
In these narrowly defined scenarios , the Glaser is a good choice , but keep a couple of speed loaders of hollow points handy , just in case .
I do .
Glaser Safety Slugs are available in " Blue " or " Silver " versions .
The latter are a little heavier for better penetration , but performance is similar .
I would be happy with either , but Sanow prefers the Silver .
It 's up to you .
Mag -Safes are imitations of Glasers and I cannot recommend them , due to a history of poor quality control .
Reliability is the number one requirement of a self - defense handgun and Mag - Safes do n't make the grade .
GECO " Blitz Action Trauma " or BAT 9 mm rounds from Germany are a proven design .
Called the " GECO Action Safety " in Europe , this is a high velocity ( 1400 feet per second ) lightweight ( 86 grain ) hollow bullet that has proven itself to be very reliable and successful on the street .
I recommend them , but they are tough to find .
Save yourself the trouble and use a good American - made hollow point .
Other exotics are best avoided .
You may occasionally encounter " Thunderzaps , " " Omni-Shocks , " " Terminators , " " Annihilators , " " Kaswer Law Grabbers , " and other such marginalia in gun shops .
Stay away .
If you want to gamble , go to an Indian reservation .
Do n't gamble with your life , or the lives of others .
Glasers and GECO 9 mm BATs are the only proven exotics .
Terminology I have tried to keep specialized technical jargon to a minimum , but it will be helpful for you to understand a few terms and acronyms .
" Ball " is full metal jacketed ammunition .
All military pistol and rifle ammunition uses full metal jacket bullets .
Synonyms for ball include FMJ ( " full metal jacket " ) , MC ( " metal case " ) and TMJ ( " totally metal jacketed , " a term used only by the ammunition maker CCI ) .
Ball rounds do not expand , typically over - penetrate and are always the worst choice in a defensive round .
The military traditionally uses ball ammo , because it feeds reliably ( i.e. rarely jams ) and penetrates well , but mostly because the military is required to use ball ammo by the Geneva Convention .
However , due to the poor stopping power of ball ammo in the Middle East conflicts , even the US military has started to move away from ball and is adopting JHP handgun ammunition .
Fortunately , you are free to choose better ammunition and should use ball only for practice , unless your pistol will not feed anything else .
" Round nose lead " ( RNL ) are old fashioned revolver bullets without any jacket around the bullet .
These generally do not expand and perform similarly to FMJ bullets for self - defense and I do n't even use them at the range .
If you come upon a bargain lot of RNL ammo , feel free to buy it for target practice .
You will be scrubbing out your barrel until the wee hours , however , as lead bullets scum up barrels something fierce .
Use Flitz metal polish to scour out the grimy residue .
" Wadcutter " ( WC ) and " semi-wadcutter " ( SWC ) are sharp - shouldered , solid lead revolver bullets with an odd cylindrical or truncated cone appearance .
They are designed to cut clean holes in paper targets .
In self - defense use , they have statistically proven to be no more effective than RNL bullets .
Factory loaded wadcutters are very low power rounds used for target shooting .
Like all lead bullets , they leave lead residue in the barrel 's grooves after use .
" Jacketed soft - points " ( JSP ) are jacketed bullets with exposed lead at the tip .
They typically penetrate deeper and expand less than JHP bullets .
They are usually designed for big game hunting and make poor anti-personnel rounds for handguns , but may be effective in rifles , due to the latter 's high velocity .
Avoid using JSP rounds in a handgun for self - defense , unless your only alternative is hard ball .
( However , JSP bullets may be good choice for defense against large animal predators in the field , due to their superior penetration . )
" Jacketed hollow point " ( JHP ) bullets are usually the best choice for handguns and also many rifles .
They are typically very accurate .
JHP bullets have a hollow cavity in the nose and usually expand ( and stop ) in the body of your attacker , transferring all of their kinetic energy for maximum stopping power .
They are the best handgun bullets available and less likely to over - penetrate than other conventional bullet designs .
" Jacketed Hollow Cavity " ( JHC ) is the term Sierra uses for their JHP bullets .
HANDGUN AMMUNITION BY CALIBER .22 Long Rifle
You should really be using something bigger than a .22 for self - defense , but even a .22 LR beats nothing .
( It also beats the .25 Auto . )
Full size .22 handguns are usually very accurate and they are the best way to learn how to shoot a handgun .
Their 4 " and longer barrels extract considerably more velocity and energy from the little .22 LR cartridge than pocket models and their longer sight radius makes them much easier to aim .
This makes them superior to pocket models for home defense .
There are some nice .22 pocket autos and mini-revolvers that make sense for special concealed carry situations ( vest pocket carry , for instance , or a woman 's dress purse ) .
NAA mini -revolvers , at least the models with sights ( Black Widow , etc. ) , are generally more accurate and more reliable than .22 pocket autoloaders .
They are also quite safe to carry with the hammer down between two chambers .
However , since they are single action revolvers , the user must be well acquainted with SA revolver operation before choosing an NAA mini for personal protection .
Choose any Federal , Remington , Winchester or CCI copper - plated 37 grain ( or lighter ) , high velocity hollow point round .
I recommend CCI Stinger 32 grain or Remington Yellow Jacket 33 grain hyper-velocity hollow points , as they have been very reliable in my Beretta 21A and Walther TPH pistols and have the highest stopping power ratings .
Shoot a lot of rounds through your self - defense .22 .
The ammo is cheap and you want to be sure to pick a reliable round .
If high velocity solids do n't cycle reliably , try standard - velocity .
There is little difference in power , but it may improve your gun 's reliability ( e.g. Jennings J - 22 pistols are more reliable with standard - velocity solids ) .
Marksmanship is crucial with such a tiny gun .
Brain shots that destroy the medulla oblongata are the most reliable stoppers .
Keep your .22 autoloader meticulously clean ; these tiny guns cannot function reliably with gunk in them .
If you carry your .22 in a pocket , purse or ankle holster , inspect it daily and brush off any dust or grit with an old toothbrush .
Lubricate it properly .
This is very important .
. 22 WMR The .22 Magnum is much better than the .22 LR and perhaps better , in full size revolvers , than most calibers less powerful than the .32 ACP .
40 grain JHP loads are the traditional choice , with Winchester 's 40 grain JHP load scoring highest in 4 " and longer barrels .
Winchester also offers a Defender 40 grain JHP self - defense load in .22 Magnum .
The Speer 40 grain GDHP - SB load was tailored for use in mini- revolvers with 2 " and shorter barrels .
The Hornady Critical Defense 45 grain FTX load , also developed for use in mini-revolvers , is another possibility .
An NAA Black Widow mini-revolver in .22 Magnum is probably as good as " mouse guns " get .
.25 ACP ( 6.35 mm ) Less powerful , less accurate and more expensive than the .22 LR , the .25 ACP 's redeeming feature is that it was designed to function more reliably in semi-automatic pocket pistols .
The best .25 load is the Hornady 35 grain XTP - HP round , but only if it is 100 % reliable in your pistol .
Fire 200 rounds through your gun to verify .
If it jams , use any Federal , Remington , or Winchester 50 grain ball round .
Winchester has an odd 45 grain " Expanding Point " round that should be okay , if it is reliable in your gun .
It seems to work fine in Beretta 950 pistols , for example , but do n't expect more than a marginal improvement in performance over the 50 grain ball rounds .
The excellent Walther TPH .25 pistol should be loaded only with ball ammo .
Ed Sanow recommends the pre-fragmented MagSafe 22 grain " Defender " and Glaser 40 grain Safety Slugs .
This makes a lot of sense in this under - powered caliber , since the .25 Auto lacks the velocity and energy to reliably expand most hollow point bullets .
.32 ACP ( 7.65 mm Browning , 7.65x17 mm )
Use the Winchester Super - X 60 grain Silvertip Jacketed Hollow Point , provided it is reliable in your gun .
Hornady offers a 60 grain XTP - HP and Federal offers a 65 grain Hydra - Shok JHP to compete with the Winchester Silvertip load .
Many of the common .32 autos on the market are only reliable with 71 grain ball .
These include the Llama , Walther PP and PPK , CZ - 24 , CZ - 70 , Davis P - 32 , Mauser HSc and others .
Worth mentioning is that , in a pinch , .32 ACP cartridges can be fired in .32 H&R Magnum and .327 Magnum single action ( SA ) revolvers .
The .32 Auto is a semi-rimmed cartridge and it has enough rim to headspace in revolver cylinders .
This small rim will not catch the extractor star of double action ( DA ) revolvers , but presents no problem for the external extractor rod of Ruger SA revolvers .
.32 Smith & Wesson Long
The best defense load for this obsolescent revolver caliber is the Federal Champion 98 grain lead wadcutter target load .
Shoot very carefully .
Remington and Winchester offer only 98 grain LRN bullets .
. 32 H&R Magnum
An interesting revolver cartridge designed to approximate the stopping power of the .38 Special in a smaller caliber package .
Excellent for those adverse to recoil and muzzle blast , but who want more power than the .32 Long , .32 ACP or .380 ACP .
Unfortunately , the .32 H&R Mag. has never caught - on in the marketplace , so the selection of good defensive ammo is very limited .
Use the Federal Personal Defense 85 grain JHP or Hornady Critical Defense 80 grain FTX loads .
.327 Federal Magnum
This potent revolver cartridge is based on a lengthened version of the .32 H&R Mag. case loaded to much higher pressure .
It is the flattest shooting of all the conventional magnum revolver cartridges .
The .327 exceeds the .38 Special +P and 9 mm Luger in energy and velocity .
Like all " .32 caliber " handgun cartridges , the actual bullet diameter is .312 " .
Any .327 revolver can also shoot .32 ACP , .32 Long and .32 H&R Mag. ammo .
The latter ( .32 H&R Mag. ) is a good choice for shooters and situations when the recoil , blast and muzzle flash of .327 Magnum loads is undesirable .
There is a reasonable selection of factory loaded ammunition in bullet weights from 85 to 115 grains available from the ATK combine ( Federal , Speer , CCI , Blazer , Fusion and American Eagle brands ) .
The Federal Premium Low Recoil .327 Magnum 85 grain Hydra - Shok JHP at 1400 fps is specifically intended for personal defense and promises to be very effective .
Other .327 Magnum JHP loads from ATK include the Speer 100 grain Gold Dot and Speer 115 grain Gold Dot ; both are full power loads .
Specialty ammo maker Jamison offers a 90 grain Sierra JHC bullet ( MV 1465 fps ) in their Guardian Grade ammunition .
American Eagle brand .327 loads are available with 85 grain or 100 grain JSP bullets .
Reserve these for hunting or practice , not self - defense .
.380 ACP ( 9 mm Short , 9x17 mm , 9 mm Kurz )
The three or four best .380 JHP rounds have better stopping power than most bullets fired out of a 2 " barrel .38 Special revolver , so the .380 can no longer be considered a " mouse gun " caliber .
All of the well known US ammo manufacturers load good hollow points for this caliber , but getting them to expand out of the short barreled autos ( " pocket pistols " ) typically favored for concealed carry is quite difficult .
Bullets that expand properly when fired from a service pistol ( Walther PP or Baikal IJ - 70a , for example ) may not expand at all when fired from little guns , such as a Walther PPK or Glock 42 .
Good all - around .380 ACP loads : Winchester 90 grain Defend - Top expansion in the Lucky Gunner .380 ammo tests ( averaged .63 " ) Hornady Critical Defense 90 grain FTX - A soft - plastic - tipped bullet that is building a good reputation .
Sig Sauer Elite 90 grain V - Crown - Made by Sierra for Sig Sauer and performs well in FBI protocol gelatin tests , including Lucky Gunner .
Speer 90 grain Gold Dot JHP - A good all - around hollow point .
Reliability is crucial and thus you must test JHP rounds in your pistol before carrying .
A hollow point load that feeds well in the Colt Government Model .380 , H&K HK4 , Taurus PT - 58 , older PP and PPK , Bersa .380 , Beretta 70s , Makarov and Hungarian FEG is the Remington 88 grain JHP .
These are all good guns that might choke on other hollow points , but they will probably feed the Remington fine .
If your .380 chokes on other JHP loads , try fifty rounds of the Remington 88 grain through your gun and see if it improves .
Unfortunately , in the Lucky Gunner ballistic gelatin ammo tests , this load did not expand at all when fired from a Glock 42 with a short 3.25 " barrel .
Unlike revolvers , auto pistol barrel measurements include the chamber , so the actual effective barrel length of the G42 is around 2.25 " .
.380 ACP hollow point loads to avoid : Winchester Super - X 85 grain Silvertip - I really cannot recommend this jam - prone round , although the Silvertip bullet expands more reliably than most in .380 caliber .
It functions reliably in a few modern European guns ( e.g. SIG P230 / P232 , Glock 42 and Beretta 84 F ) , but the Silvertip may jam in many older American - made .380 automatics .
The .380 Silvertip was once state - of - the - art , but it has since been superseded by newer designs .
PMC - Eldorado Starfire 95 grain JHP -
This round is weak and jam - prone .
Federal 90 grain JHP ( 380 BP ) and Hornady 90 grain XTP ( 9010 ) - Both the Federal 380BP and the Hornady XTP seldom expand and may jam many guns , due to their truncated - cone bullet nose profiles .
Pass by these two .
95 grain ball : Use only ball ammo in the Davis P- 380 , Accu - Tek , EAA .380 , Tanarmi , AMT / OMC / TDE Back - Up , Heritage , FIE , Jennings , Bryco , Lorcin , Llama and other bargain priced autos .
Hollow points should not be used in these low - priced guns , due to reliability problems .
9 mm Makarov ( 9x18 mm ) Despite its " 9 mm " nomenclature , this cartridge actually uses an odd diameter bullet , about 9.2 mm .
The performance of the 9x18 mm is virtually identical to the far more popular .380 ACP .
The Russian Baikal IJ - 70 commercial Makarov pistol was produced in both calibers , so if you have a choice , get the .380 version .
Alone among the major US ammo makers , Hornady offers a serious 9x18 mm defensive load .
This is the Critical Defense 95 grain FTX load ( #91000 ) .
.38 Special .38 Special ammunition is loaded to two pressure levels : standard pressure and +P .
Standard pressure loads may be used in any .38 Special revolver , but +P loads should be used only in revolvers specifically rated by the manufacturer for such loads .
+ P ammo should not be used in most small , aluminum - framed , .38 Special revolvers .
Firing a few + P loads in your aluminum - framed revolver may not destroy it or cause it to explode , but it will damage your revolver if you fire more than a hundred rounds .
The main problem with carrying +P .38 Special loads in an aluminum - framed .38 Special revolver , besides excessive wear and tear on the gun , is that the kick is nasty and slows repeat shots .
.38 +P ammunition is generally at its best when fired in 4 " or longer barrels .
These cartridges are typically loaded with more powder and slower burning powder than standard velocity cartridges and generally require at least a 4 " barrel to achieve their intended velocity .
Fixed sight .38 revolvers are regulated at the factory to shoot to the point of aim with 158 grain bullets , as this was the weight of the long - time standard US and Canadian police load .
Lighter bullets will normally shoot low ( some very low ) .
This is not a problem , of course , with revolvers equipped with adjustable sights
The best loads for .38 Special revolvers with 4 " or longer barrels : The Numero Uno .38 defense load for your 4 " barrel revolver is the Cor - Bon .38 Special +P 125 grain JHP .
It is a very high pressure load for a .38 Special and should be used only in modern revolvers specifically rated for +P ammunition .
When I carry a 4 " .38 , I want it loaded with this cartridge .
It has less felt recoil and muzzle flip than the # 2 choice .
The second - best choice is the .38 Special +P 158 grain lead semi- wadcutter hollow point ( LSWCHP ) available from Winchester and Remington .
Ayoob has found the latter to have the greatest expansion , so I would choose Remington ( # R38S12 ) .
This unjacketed , all lead HP round ( often called the " FBI load " or " Chicago load " ) is a proven man stopper when fired from a 4 " barrel .
Other .38 Special loads for 4 " barrel revolvers :
All major US manufacturers catalog .38 Special +P JHP loads with bullets weighing from 110 to 129 grains .
( 125 grains is the most common bullet weight . )
As far as I know , none of these have yet proven as successful on the street as the Cor - Bon .38 Special +P 125 grain JHP or 158 grain +P LSWCHP , but most are effective loads and worthy of consideration , depending on your situation and requirements .
IMI - Samson offers a lightweight , very high pressure load , the 110 grain +P+ JHP .
This is said to be a ballistic duplicate of the law enforcement only " Treasury " load that T - men used to carry .
Noteworthy exotic .38 Special loads :
The Glaser Safety Slug is a good choice for self - defense in a .38 revolver of any barrel length .
( See caveats under " exotic ammunition " above ) .
It is crucial to keep the chambers and frame interior absolutely free of oil or solvents when carrying Glasers , as you do n't want any Breakfree CLP or Hoppe 's # 9 solvent seeping into the primer pocket and deactivating the round .
This is important for all rounds , of course , but the Glaser is n't known for particularly good sealing against such mishaps .
You may also want to consider carrying two Glasers as the first rounds to be fired and JHP loads for the rest .
This gives you a bit of insurance if your assailant tucks himself behind a sheet rock wall , doorway or some other flimsy cover that JHP rounds can blast through .
PMC makes a bizarre 66 grain tubular hollow bullet load .
Some enthusiastic gun -shop salesman may try to sell it to you .
Refuse politely .
A Special Note on Snub - Nose .38 Revolvers : The Cor -Bon .38 Special +P 125 grain JHP and 158 grain LSWCHP FBI load are not the best choice for 2 " or 3 " barrel revolvers .
The short barrel does not provide enough velocity to ensure reliable expansion with these loads and the unpleasant and hard - to - control recoil hurts snub - nose accuracy ( as well as your hand ) .
Controllability is crucial and I recommend standard pressure ( non +P ) loads for any .38 snub - nose .
If you carry an aluminum frame , snub nose .38 ( e.g. S&W Models 38 , 642 , 442 , 37 or Colt Cobra ) , I especially urge you to carry a standard pressure ( non +P ) .38 round .
Standard Pressure ( non +P ) loads for short barreled revolvers : Federal Premium 125 grain NyClad HP ( P38MA ) - Known as the " Chief 's Special " load , this is my preferred 2 " - 3 " barrel snub - nose revolver load and it is the best load for both standard and +P rated snub - nose revolvers .
The Nylon - coated hollow point was specifically designed to expand at lower velocities from short barreled .38s .
For many years this load was available only to law enforcement agencies , but it is again available to the general public .
Other acceptable standard pressure .38 loads include the Winchester Super - X 110 grain Silvertip , Federal Low Recoil Personal Defense 110 grain Hydra - Shok JHP , Hornady Critical Defense 110 grain FTX and Sig Sauer Elite 125 grain V - Crown .
Loads ONLY for +P rated , 2 " - 3 " barrel revolvers : Federal Premium 129 grain +P
Hydra - shok JHP Hornady Critical Defense 110 grain FTX +P Remington Premier 125 grain Golden Saber +P
Cor -Bon 110 grain +P JHP - I would recommend this high - pressure load only for the sturdy Ruger SP101 and LCR snub - nose .38s , or a .357 Magnum revolver .
If you have a J - frame Smith & Wesson snub - nose .38 ( i.e. the five - shot Model 36/37 Chief 's Special , Model 38/49/649 Bodyguard , or 640/642/442/940 Centennial ) , you can greatly improve the controllability of your gun by installing Uncle Mike 's " Boot Grip . "
This is a $ 14 godsend .
The skinny little wooden grips that come on these guns are worthless .
Installing good grips does wonders for your ability to control your .38 snub - nose revolver in rapid fire .
9 mm Parabellum ( 9 mm Luger , 9x19 mm , 9 mm NATO )
This is unquestionably the world 's most popular pistol round .
For this reason it has been the subject of a lot of experimentation .
9 mm ball , used by every army in the Western world , is a mediocre man stopper .
Jacketed hollow points are a must if one wishes to rely on the 9 mm as a defense round .
Use ball ammo only for practice .
Civilian 9 mm ammunition is generally available in two pressure levels , standard and " + P. "
( There is also +P+ ammo , usually restricted for police use only . )
The +P ammo should only be used in newer guns ( made since 1985 or so ) and is best used sparingly .
9 mm +P loads are generally intended for use in service pistols with 4 " or longer barrels .
I will only deal with commercially available ammunition .
Civilians should not worry , as there are commercial loads as good as anything restricted to law enforcement usage .
The top rated 9 mm Luger load for self - defense is the Cor - Bon 9 mm 115 grain +P Jacketed Hollow point .
It is the most street - proven man stopper available in this caliber .
It is a high velocity ( 1350 fps ) and high pressure round , more effective than loads restricted to law enforcement use .
Unfortunately , it is also likely to jam many older guns .
For this reason I add a table at the end of the 9 mm section discussing round suitability for different guns .
Modern hollow points may either ( a ) jam , or ( b ) be too powerful for some older guns .
This load is suitable only for First Class pistols ( see table ) .
Here are high performance 9x19 mm + P loads worth consideration : Barnes 115 grain TAC-XPD +P
Cor -Bon 115 grain DPX +P
Cor -Bon 115 grain JHP +P
Hornady Critical Duty 135 grain FlexLock +P
Nosler 124 grain bonded core JHP +P
Nosler 124 grain bonded core Tipped +P
Remington 124 grain Golden Saber BJHP +P
Winchester Defender 124 grain bonded core JHP +P
Good standard pressure 9 mm loads include : Federal Personal Defense 115 grain JHP
Federal 124 grain HST
Federal 147 grain HST
Hornady Critical Defense 115 grain FTX
Remington 147 grain Golden Saber BJHP
Sig Sauer Elite 115 grain V - Crown JHP
Sig Sauer Elite 124 grain V - Crown JHP
Speer 115 grain Gold Dot
Speer 124 grain Gold Dot
Winchester Super - X 147 grain Defend
For guns that may jam with more aggressive hollow point bullets , the Remington 115 grain +P JHP is a good choice ( R9MM6 ) .
For older guns I would try the Remington standard pressure 115 grain JHP ( R9MM1 ) .
Table of 9 mm Pistols .
( Note : just because your pistol appears in Class 3 does n't mean it is unreliable ; it may indeed feed hollow points .
However , you must fire at least 200 rounds of your chosen JHP carry load to determine if your pistol will feed them properly .
I have placed pistols in each category according to reputation and experience .
These are only meant as guidelines ; your pistol may feed JHP rounds better - or worse - than this table indicates )
First Class pistols are ultra-reliable , high - quality new guns than can feed any hollow point and tolerate + P loads with no problems : All Glocks ; all Ruger 9 mm pistols ; all SIG Sauer 9 mm pistols ; Czech CZ75 and CZ85 ; Walther P5 , P5C and P88 ; Heckler and Koch USP and P7 series ; Taurus PT - 99 , PT - 92 and PT - 92C ; Steyr GB ; Beretta 92 series ; Browning BDM and Hi-Power ( if it says " Portugal " on the slide ) ; Smith & Wesson M&P models ; Star M28 , M30 , M31 and all Firestars , Megastars and Ultrastars .
Second Class pistols are guns that may not feed all hollow points reliably .
Remington 115 grain hollow points are recommended for these guns : Smith & Wessons with two or three digit model numbers ( e.g. 659 , 39 - 2 , 469 , 59 , 39 ) ; Heckler and Koch VP70 and P9S ; Beretta " Brigadier " M1951 ; Interarms Helwan ; Colt Series 70 Government Model and Series 70 Commander ; Astra A - 70 , A - 75 and A - 100 ; AMT On Duty ; Daewoo ; Bersa Thunder 9 ; EAA Witness and all other CZ - 75 copies ( e.g. Tanfoglio , Tanarmi , Springfield Armory P9 ) ; Taurus PT - 908 ; Walther P4 ; Star BK , BKM , Model B and Super ; Older Browning Hi-Powers ( without the word " Portugal " on the slide ) ; Llama Model 82 ; IMI Jericho and Kareen .
Third Class pistols should generally be loaded with ball for best reliability ; experiment with your gun extensively before carrying JHP : Walther P38 , P4 or P1 ; Luger P - 08 ; Llama ; Maverick ; MKS Model JS ; Intratec CAT - 9 , DC - 9 , KG - 9 , etc. ; SWD Cobray Model 11/9 and similar models ; Scarab Scorpion ; Kimel AP - 9 ; Bryco Jennings Model 59 ; all KBI Hungarian pistols ( e.g. GKK , PJ9C , P9HK and other FEG products ) ; Norinco and Sportarms Chinese Tokarev pistols ; Lahti ; Radom ; MAB P15 and Model 1950 .
.38 Super
The .357 SIG appears to have put the older .38 Super on the road to obsolescence .
( Both calibers shoot standard 9 mm /.355 " bullets faster than the 9x19 mm . )
Cor -Bon JHP , Winchester Super - X Silvertip and Sig Sauer Elite V - Crown loads are offered with 115 - 125 grain jacketed hollow points in .38 Super .
I like the Cor - Bon 115 and 125 grain hollow points best .
The Llama .38 Super pistol tends to jam with anything except ball .
.357 SIG I am unsure what advantage this 9 mm caliber is supposed to have over the .40 S&W from which it is derived , aside from a flatter trajectory , but it is a good stopper .
.357 SIG ballistics are quite impressive .
Suggested loads : Federal Premium 125 grain JHP
Hornady Critical Duty 135 grain FlexLock
Hornady Custom 147 grain XTP
Winchester Defender 125 grain JHP
Sig Sauer Elite 125 grain V - Crown .357 Magnum
The most effective handgun round on the market , regardless of caliber , is the .357 Magnum 125 grain jacketed hollow point load .
This load has more stopping power than any other handgun cartridge and this includes more powerful rounds like the .41 and .44 Magnums .
I advise all experienced revolver men to carry the legendary Federal Personal Defense 125 grain JHP or the equally good Remington 125 grain semi- jacketed hollow point ( SJHP ) in a .357 revolver .
In the same general class are the Cor - Bon 125 grain JHP , Sig Sauer Elite 125 grain V - Crown , Winchester Super - X 125 grain JHP and Hornady Critical Defense 125 grain FTX .
All of these are high velocity loads , with muzzle velocities around 1450 fps from a 4 " barrel .
If for some reason you think you need deeper penetration , or just favor heavier bullets , Winchester offers a Super - X 145 grain Silvertip load , Hornady offers a Critical Duty 135 grain FlexLock and Federal offers a 130 grain Hydra - Shok in their Personal Defense Low Recoil line .
None of these have the street credentials of the various 125 grain JHP loads , but they can definitely get the job done .
There is one caveat , however .
These full - power .357 Magnums have a lot of blast and kick .
If you are not comfortable with the buck and roar of full - house .357 Magnums , I would strongly suggest that you use a lower - recoil round .
Controllability is important and you will be able to fire lower - recoil rounds more rapidly and accurately .
All .357 loads have excellent stopping power , so do n't worry that you are giving up too much .
In descending order of severity of recoil ( i.e. the Silvertip kicks the most ) I recommend the Winchester Super - X Silvertip 145 grain JHP , Remington Golden Saber 125 grain JHP and Winchester 110 grain JHP .
The 110 grain jacketed hollow points by Winchester , CCI and Remington are all good for use in .357 Magnum 2.5 " and 3 " barrel snub - nose revolvers , such as the S&W Models 66 , 19 , 65 , 13 , Colt King Cobra , Ruger GP100 and especially the small - frame Ruger SP101 .
( Avoid the latter revolver unless you absolutely LOVE punishing recoil . )
If you still find that your .357 kicks too much , carry the Cor - Bon .38 Special + P 110 grain JHP discussed above .
Two or three hits with good .38 + P slugs beat any number of misses with .357 slugs .
Note : if you are using the factory wood stocks on your S&W or Taurus .357 revolver , you should try a set of rubber replacement grips .
Ruger .357
Magnums come factory - equipped with recoil - absorbing rubber grips and I have no idea why S&W and Taurus continue to put wood grips on their .357 revolvers .
The difference in control is enormous .
Get some good , compact rubber grips from Uncle Mike 's or Pachmayr and slap them onto your .357 revolver ASAP .
I used to cringe every time I fired a full - power load in my .357 Magnum snub - nose .
Once I put some compact Pachmayr grips on it , however , I had no problem firing the C357B load accurately and rapidly .
To summarize , you can never go wrong with a 110 - 125 grain .357 jacketed hollow point load from one of the major US ammunition makers .
All are great stoppers .
Avoid soft - points , semi- wadcutters , or any of the 158 grain or 180 grain JHP loads ; these are for hunting , practice , target or rifle use .
Stick to jacketed hollow points under 150 grains in weight .
Lead ( un - jacketed ) bullets are okay for practice , but you will have to spend twice as long cleaning your gun .
.40 Smith & Wesson
This caliber has established an excellent track record on the street .
Smith & Wesson and Winchester really hit the mark when they shortened the 10 mm Auto case to create the .40 S&W .
The .40 S&W generates snappy recoil , especially in the lighter pistols designed for concealed carry .
The 135-155 grain JHP loads generally kick less than the 165 - 180 grain JHP loads .
I would carry the potent Cor -Bon 135 JHP , which appears to be a real stopper , or the Cor - Bon 150 grain JHP .
Here are some high performance .40 S&W loads worthy of consideration : Barnes 140 grain TAC-XPD
Cor -Bon 135 grain JHP
Cor -Bon 150 grain JHP
Federal 135 grain Guard Dog
Federal 155 grain Tactical Bonded
Federal 155 grain Hydra - Shok
Federal 180 grain HST
Federal 180 grain Hydra - Shok
Hornady Critical Defense 165 grain FTX
Nosler 200 grain bonded JHP
Nosler 200 grain bonded Tipped
Remington 165 grain Golden Saber
Remington 180 grain Golden Saber
Remington 180 grain Golden Saber Bonded
Speer 180 grain Gold Dot
Winchester Defender 165 Grain
Winchester Defender 180 Grain
Winchester 180 Grain Defend
Winchester Ranger 180 grain JHP
In short , you can hardly go wrong with the .40 S&W , unless you carry ball ammo .
Choose a good hollow point and stick with it .
Leave the ball loads for practice .
10 mm Auto
The 10 mm was thought to be the ne plus ultra of autoloading pistol rounds when introduced in the late 1980's .
However , this big bore ( .40 caliber ) has n't turned out to be markedly superior to the best .40 S&W or .45 ACP jacketed hollow point loads .
The FBI , looking for more power , adopted the 10 mm to replace their 9x19 mm service pistols .
Some agents thought the big 10 too powerful , so the Agency developed the " 10 mm FBI Light " load .
The big case was n't necessary for the powder charge in the FBI Light load , so this led directly to Winchester 's creation of the .40 S&W on a shortened 10 mm case .
As a result , some 10 mm loads have been discontinued and most of those remaining are midway between .40 S&W velocity and full power 10 mm velocity .
This is n't to say there is anything wrong with the 10 mm Auto , as it is a fine stopper .
Even with 10 mm
Light loads , it is ballistically identical to the .40 S&W and with midrange or full power loads it is the most powerful of the common autoloading pistol cartridges .
Here are the 10 mm Auto JHP loads ( and catalog MVs ) currently offered by the major US ammo companies : Cor -Bon 135 grain JHP ( MV 1400 fps )
Cor -Bon 150 grain JHP ( MV 1325 fps )
Cor -Bon 155 grain DPX ( MV 1200 fps )
Cor -Bon 165 grain JHP ( MV 1250 fps )
Federal Premium Personal Defense 180 grain Hydra - Shok ( MV 1030 fps )
Sig Sauer Elite 180 grain V - Crown ( MV 1250 fps )
Winchester Super - X 175 grain Silvertip ( MV 1290 fps )
All of these bullets will expand nicely when driven at these muzzle velocities , so any of these loads should really romp and stomp on bad guys .
I would pick the Cor - Bon 135 grain JHP at 1400 fps or the Cor - Bon 150 grain JHP at 1325 fps for personal protection .
The full power Winchester Super - X 175 grain Silvertip and SIG Sauer Elite 180 grain V - Crown loads are good choices for experienced shooters who are used to considerable recoil .
They should also be good choices for carrying in the field , where I might have to shoot big , cranky animals that seem interested in munching on my bodily parts .
In this role the 10 mm Auto excels , particularly when mated with the Glock and Sig Sauer " long slide " pistols .
As always , ignore the 180 grain ball loads from Remington , Federal , Sig Sauer and others , except for practice sessions .
The 10 mm Auto is making something of a comeback , with new guns and new factory loads appearing .
Examples would be the Sig Sauer Elite ammunition and the Sig Sauer P220 Match Elite pistol .
.41 Remington Magnum
The .41 Magnum was conceived as a caliber midway between the .357 Magnum and the .44 Magnum , for those who wanted a big bore revolver , but were intimidated by the blast and recoil of the .44 Mag .
There was also some law enforcement interest in a new , big bore revolver caliber .
However , when finally introduced by Remington , the .41 Mag. was quite similar in recoil and muzzle blast to the .44 Magnum .
Consequently , the caliber has never become very popular .
The factory loaded JHP ammunition selection in .41 Mag. is not extensive .
The best defense choices for this hard - kicking caliber are the Cor - Bon 155 grain DPX , Cor -Bon 170 grain JHP , Winchester Super - X 175 grain Silvertip and Federal Power - Shok 210 grain JHP .
Remington offers a single 210 grain JSP load that will shoot right through a perp ( or two or three ) and continue on its way .
This is strictly a big game hunting load that should not be used for personal defense in populated areas .
. 44 Special
The best choices for your .
44 Special revolver are the Cor - Bon 165 grain JHP , Cor -Bon 200 grain DPX and Hornady Critical Defense 165 grain FTX loads .
Glasers , the Winchester Super - X 200 grain Silvertip , Hornady Custom 180 grain XTP and PMC Bronze 180 grain JHP are also potentially good rounds .
The newer Sig Sauer Elite 240 grain V - Crown load offers interesting possibilities for those who favor heavy bullets .
Federal offers a 200 grain SWC - HP lead bullet in their Champion line .
Most other .44 Special loads come with 240 grain RN lead bullets loaded at low velocity .
These are for practice or cowboy action shooting only , and then only if you are willing to waste time scrubbing lead from your revolver 's barrel .
. 44 Remington Magnum
The blast and kick of this powerful caliber make it less than optimum for defense use , despite what you may have seen in the movies .
The Cor -Bon 165 grain JHP , Cor -Bon 225 grain DPX and Federal Power - Shok 180 grain JHP loads are the hands - down choices in this caliber .
Glasers are probably the best alternative for use in heavily populated areas , due to the .44 Mag 's penchant for over - penetration .
The Hornady Custom 200 grain XTP , Winchester Super - X 210 grain Silvertip , Federal Premium 240 grain Hydra - shok , Remington 240 grain SJHP and Sig Sauer Elite 240 grain V - Crown are hunting loads that might be acceptable choices under certain circumstances .
Any .44 Magnum revolver can also fire the .44 Special loads mentioned above .
.45 ACP ( Occasionally called the 11.43x23 mm by some silly Europeans )
The .45 ACP is a recognized man stopper and there are a number of excellent loads in this caliber .
On the other hand , you must be selective , because the .45 ACP operates at relatively low velocity and many bullet types that perform well in faster calibers , such as 9x19 mm and .40 S&W , fail to expand at .45 ACP velocities .
( Note : if you are one of those knuckleheads who install light springs in your gun to get a lighter trigger pull , you are asking for reliability problems . )
Here are some of the best standard velocity .45 ACP defense loads : Cor -Bon 160 grain DPX
Federal Premium 155 grain Hydra - Shok
Federal Premium 165 grain Guard Dog
Federal Premium 180 grain Hydra - Shok
Federal Premium 230 grain HST
Remington Premier 230 grain Golden Saber
Speer 230 grain Gold Dot
Here are some of the best .45 ACP +P defense loads : Cor -Bon 165 grain JHP +P
Cor -Bon 185 grain JHP +P
Cor -Bon 185 grain DPX +P
Cor -Bon 200 grain JHP +P
Cor -Bon 230 grain JHP +P
Federal Premium 230 grain HST +P
Hornady Custom 230 grain XTP +P
Nosler 230 grain + P bonded core JHP +P
Nosler 230 grain + P bonded core Tipped +P
Remington Premier 185 Golden Saber +P
Speer 200 grain Gold Dot +P
These powerful and hard - kicking +P rounds are best left to the experienced shooter .
They are pretty hard on your gun , especially an aluminum - framed pistol like the SIG / Sauer P220 or Colt Lightweight Commander .
If you are sufficiently expert to confidently carry .45 + P loads , you probably do n't need my advice .
They really sledgehammer the bad guys .
Save the 230 grain ball ( FMJ ) loads for practice ; they are highly over - rated for self defense .
Carry FMJ ammo only if you must , because your gun jams with hollow points .
The Llama , Federal Ordnance , AMT and Auto - Ordnance M1911A1 copies often jam with anything except 230 grain ball .
Never compromise when it comes to reliability : if your gun only feeds ball , then ball is what you carry .
. 45 Colt With its much greater case capacity , this classic revolver cartridge can be loaded to do anything the .45 ACP can do , and more .
Unfortunately , most .45 Colt factory loads come with 250 - 255 grain lead RN bullets .
Good loads using JHP bullets are relatively scarce .
I would load a .45 Colt revolver with the Cor - Bon 200 grain JHP .
The Blazer 200 grain JHP , Hornady Critical Defense 185 grain FTX , Federal 225 grain Lead Semi-Wadcutter Hollow point , Winchester 225 grain Defender and Winchester 225 grain Silvertip JHP are also good .
SHOTGUN AMMUNITION BY CALIBER ( Gauge )
The shotgun is the ne plus ultra of man stoppers .
No doubt you have heard a lot of nonsense about the lethality of " assault rifles , " sub - machine guns and the like .
The fact is that the shotgun is the most effective firearm for short - range personal defense .
For example : an Uzi or Heckler & Koch sub - machine gun has about 340 ft. lbs. of impact energy - a 12 gauge shotgun has 2500 to 3100 ft. lbs. of impact energy .
The shotgun is not a magic weapon that will slay all foes .
Like all other guns , it must be aimed at a specific target .
Buckshot loads will not " sweep " a room .
" Close " still only counts in horseshoes .
Aim your shotgun from the shoulder ( like a rifle ) if you intend to hit an aggressor .
I invoke the Ascended Master , Massad Ayoob : " It is perhaps the most efficient close - range killing machine in the world 's arsenal of small arms . "
For a discussion of the shotgun 's strengths and weaknesses I refer all interested parties to Ayoob 's excellent and comprehensive book The Truth About Self - Protection .
( Truly , the best $ 8.95 investment you 'll ever make . )
This addresses every element of self - defense , from locks , chemical sprays and alarms to defensive driving , firearms and defending yourself against dogs .
A more in - depth treatment of the issue may be found in Ayoob 's book - length volume on shotgun technique , Stressfire II : Advanced Combat Shotgun .
Great reading for those who consider a tactical shotgun their primary defensive weapon .
A Note On Shotgun Ammo Shotgun ammunition falls into three general categories : BUCKSHOT - A shell loaded with large - diameter lead balls ( . 24 " and up ) used for big game hunting and self - defense .
The number of pellets in 12 gauge , 2 - 3/4 " ( non-magnum ) buckshot loads varies from eight .36 " balls in # 000 buck to 27 . 24 " pellets in # 4 buck .
( These figures are for Remington Express shells . )
Avoid #000 buckshot loads for most self - defense applications , due to the low pellet count per shell and potentially excessive penetration .
Note that not all buckshot sizes are available in all gauges .
The typical options in 12 gauge are numbers 000 , 00 , 0 , 1 and 4 . 20 gauge is generally limited to numbers 2 or 3 buck .
The more fragile the walls of your dwelling , the smaller the diameter of buckshot you should use .
# 00 works well outside and when more penetrations is required ( as in police and farm use ) .
# 0 , # 1 and # 2 are good for home defense in suburban houses with large yards .
# 3 and # 4 are preferred for urban houses with small yards , mobile homes , duplexes and condos .
Buckshot ratings are archaic and hard to understand ( as are shotgun specifications and ammunition in general ) , but thankfully there is n't much you need to learn .
Simply write down the recommended loads , walk into your local gun shop and announce your desired ammunition .
Note that " 00 " is pronounced " double ought . "
Do n't say " zero zero " or " oh - oh buckshot " in front of gun shop employees .
Then , practice with both your selected defense load and low - cost birdshot to fully familiarize yourself with the operation of your gun and its terminal performance ( e.g. patterns at various distances , the startling effects of buckshot on melons ) .
BIRDSHOT - small - diameter pellets used for bird hunting .
Its stopping power is poor , except when used at very close range .
For that reason it is not generally recommended .
SLUGS - solid lead bullets for shotgun use .
These are big , heavy , fat hunks of soft lead that have enormous stopping power .
They also have too much penetration for most urban situations , especially in apartment buildings and mobile home parks .
A typical 12 gauge slug is .729 " diameter and weighs 438 grains ; compare this to a typical 9 mm bullet , which is .355 " diameter and weighs 124 grains .
Slugs must be carefully aimed to be effective , just like a rifle bullet .
Actually , shotguns must be carefully aimed and fired with any load , just like handguns and rifles .
.410 Bore None of the above really applies to this weak caliber .
The .410 is only a half - way decent man stopper with slugs .
Choose the Federal Classic or Winchester Super - X 1/5 ounce ( 88 grain ) hollow point slugs .
Never use birdshot .
There are some odd buckshot loads for the .410 ( with three 000 pellets ) and I advise you to ignore them .
Lose the .410 and buy a 20 gauge shotgun .
28 Gauge
The 28 gauge makes a good upland bird or skeet gun , especially in a fine double gun .
However , as far as I know , there are no self - defense buckshot or slug loads available in the caliber .
20 Gauge
The 20 is an excellent self - defense caliber , particularly for those who dislike the recoil of the 12 gauge .
For guns with 3 " chambers there is the Federal 3 " Magnum # 2 buckshot load with 18 pellets .
If your gun has a 2 - 3/ 4 " chamber or your situation suggests it , use the Remington Express or Federal Vital - Shok # 3 buckshot shells with 20 pellets .
All of these loads provide definitive short range stopping power .
I specifically recommend the standard ( not magnum ) 2 - 3/4 " 20 gauge shell for women and recoil sensitive men who dislike the blast and recoil of the 12 gauge .
" Delivering roughly the ballistic force of two .44 Magnum rounds at once , " comments the knowledgeable Ayoob , the 20 " delivers 75 % of the lead for only 50 - 60 % of the recoil " .
Many police departments have found their officers shoot much more accurately in realistic training exercises with the lighter kicking , but still potent , 20 gauge .
If you are new to shotgunning and considering getting one for self - defense I suggest the reliable and reasonably priced Mossberg Model 500 , 18.5 " barrel 20 gauge pump shotgun .
The tried - and - true Mossberg 500 is the standard shotgun of the U.S. Armed Forces .
You 'll be much happier with the lighter - kicking 20 gauge than the 12 gauge version used by the military and , most importantly , you 'll shoot the 20 more accurately and rapidly .
For an in - depth look at the 20 - versus - 12 gauge issue I recommend all shotgun owners and potential shotgun owners read Stressfire II : Advanced Combat Shotgun by Massad Ayoob .
Perhaps
I am beginning to sound like a broken record on the theme of Ayoob 's books , but once you 've read them you 'll understand why I recommend them so highly ( and repeatedly ) .
Note : Ayoob dislikes the 20 gauge Remington 870 pump shotgun and recommends you choose the Mossberg 500 in 20 gauge for general self - defense and home - defense use .
For ultra -close range home defense , birdshot will do the trick .
Choose any # 4 , BB or larger high brass lead hunting load and have the balance of the magazine filled with buckshot , in case the birdshot does n't put them down fast enough .
Avoid slug use in 20 gauge ; you are better off defending yourself with buckshot .
If you must use slugs , pick one of the standard velocity , 5/8 ounce , Foster type ( " rifled " ) slugs .
Using slugs requires careful aiming and rifle sights ; few 20 gauge shotguns have the latter .
16 Gauge
The 16 has slipped in popularity with Americans to the point it has almost entirely been replaced by the 20 gauge .
As a result , no shotguns made specifically for defense are available in 16 gauge .
I know of no 16 gauge slug loads and the once common 16 gauge # 1 buckshot load is difficult to find .
12 Gauge
If you simply want to know the best defense load , go out and buy some 12 gauge , 2 - 3/ 4 " shells loaded with number 1 , 0 , or 00 buckshot .
You shall live happily ever after , as this is the most effective man-stopping firearm cartridge yet devised by man .
I recommend the Federal Vital - Shok , Winchester Super - X or Remington Express loads as the most common and useful buckshot defensive rounds .
The content of just one of these 00 shells is almost like a nine - round burst from a submachine gun , with every round hitting .
Effective shotgun technique , of course , requires that one hits with each shot .
Do n't think that you can merely point the shotgun in the general direction of your attacker and let fly .
Read Ayoob 's book Stressfire II : Advanced Combat Shotgun for the low - down on good shotgun skills and then practice , practice , practice .
Many experienced shooters prefer # 4 or # 1 buckshot to # 00 .
( Ayoob and many other authorities favor # 1 . )
I really cannot argue , but Lt. Marshall is on record as stating that 00 is superior in penetration .
( Obviously , as the heavier a round lead projectile is , the better it penetrates tissue . )
# 00 is good enough for me , but if your situation suggests # 1 or # 4 buckshot , go ahead .
Stay away from 2 - 3/4 " Magnum or 3 " Magnum loads , however .
The brutal kick of these rounds makes them a bad choice and you gain little in stopping power over the 2 - 3/4 " standard loads .
Controllability is important , and standard 12 gauge shells have quite enough kick as it is .
A note on shotgun spread : firing your shotgun does not create a diabolical cone of doom destroying all in its path .
If you have a typical tactical or riot gun with an 18 " - 20 " Cylinder bore barrel , the pellets will spread out about 1 " for every yard of range .
This means that the spread of pellets fired across a large room ( 18 ' ) will be 6 " or so , a circle the size of a coffee cup saucer .
At 50 feet , the spread will be the size of a large pizza ( 16 " ) .
Test - fire your shotgun at various ranges , using big white butcher paper targets to get an idea of the pattern you can expect .
It is a common misconception that blasting at foes ten feet away will take out two or three of them .
The spread at that range is just three inches , so you can see that I meant it when I said a shotgun must be skillfully aimed and fired , just like handguns and rifles .
The shotgun is simply more likely to stop the attacker .
Slugs are potent man stoppers , but have limited application for self - defense .
Slugs have ferocious recoil and often over - penetrate .
There are special situations where slugs might be preferred over buckshot ( e.g. road - blocks , barricaded foes ) , but if you are interested in such esoterica I again direct you to Ayoob 's masterful tome Stressfire II : Advanced Combat Shotgun .
This guide is for civilian readers .
Do n't be a knucklehead .
Stay away from weirdo rounds like rubber buckshot or neoprene slugs .
These are riot - control rounds designed for non-lethal , massed police use against mobs at a distance .
Do n't rely on such marginalia to save your life .
Two things to keep in mind about birdshot .
The first is that birdshot is as lethal as buckshot at very close range and ineffectual at longer range .
Birdshot is less likely to penetrate multiple interior walls and kill innocent people on the other side and generally has lower recoil than buckshot for faster follow - up shots .
I live in a thin - walled apartment house , which makes birdshot a viable alternative .
However , if I lived in a solid house with a decent size yard , I would definitely choose buckshot .
The stopping power of birdshot should not be under estimated .
At typical indoor ranges of 10 or 15 feet , birdshot is virtually a solid column of lead .
Choose any 2 - 3/4 " high brass ( non-magnum ) shell with 1 - 1/ 4 ounce of # 4 lead shot .
These are called " pheasant loads " ( Winchester and Remington ) or " Upland loads " ( Federal ) .
The muzzle velocity is 1220 fps ( Winchester ) or 1330 fps ( Federal and Remington ) .
I like the Winchester version for its lighter recoil .
There is little terminal difference between the various brands ; buy whichever you please .
Do n't believe for a second that you can just wound someone with birdshot and he 'll go on to live another day .
If you are n't justified in killing a man , you are n't justified in wounding him , either .
10 Gauge Yow .
Load your 10 gauge with whatever the hell you want .
Federal offers a 3 - 1/2 " Magnum buckshot load with 18 - # 00 pellets .
RIFLE AMMUNITION BY CALIBER
Rifles are n't a great choice for most self - defense applications .
Quoth Ayoob : " The rifle is not well suited to the sudden , close - quarters deployment and maneuvering that is required of a defensive firearm .
On the battlefield , yes .
In civilian close combat , no way . "
Ayoob adds that " the rifle is too bulky for maneuvering through doors and hallways , too long to quickly and surreptitiously pick up when the attacker drops his guard , and too easy for the criminal to take away if the homeowner 's attention is diverted . "
That being said , if all you have is a rifle , then a rifle is what you use .
Some liberal - infested cities ban handgun ownership ( Chicago , New York , Detroit , DC ) , so you are stuck using shotguns and rifles for home defense .
Take some comfort from the fact that rifles have better stopping power , are a strong visual deterrent and are much easier to hit with than any handgun .
On a ranch or farm a rifle may be quite appropriate under certain circumstances today , just as it was on the frontier .
Never use ball ( FMJ ) ammo for self - defense in a rifle .
. 22 Long Rifle
A good .22 autoloading , pump , or lever action rifle , such as the Ruger 10 / 22 ( auto ) , Remington Model 572 ( pump ) , or Henry Golden Boy ( lever ) , can do the job when nothing else is available .
Use any high - velocity or hyper-velocity , copper - plated HP round ( CCI Stinger , Remington Yellow Jacket , etc. ) and fire repeatedly .
Multiple hits are crucial with a .
22 .
Shoot and shoot and shoot some more .
Stay away from the aftermarket large capacity magazines made by Ram - Line , Eagle , Hot Lips , etc .
These plastic nightmares are unreliable , jam - prone and easily breakable .
. 22 Magnum ( .22 WMR )
Use a 40 grain jacketed hollow point load .
Try the Winchester Super - X 40 grain JHP , CCI Maxi-Mag 40 grain JHP , or Remington 40 grain JHP .
.223 Remington ( 5.56x45 mm NATO )
This is the standard NATO rifle round and one of the best choices for a self - defense rifle .
Many top notch rifles are ( or were ) available in this caliber : the Colt AR - 15 , Ruger Mini - 14 , Steyr AUG , FN FNC , et cetera .
All .223 hollow point , soft point and plastic tipped varmint bullets are good stoppers in civilian frontal shootings .
These are usually in the 40 - 60 grain range .
55 grain bullets are the most popular weight and offered in the most loads , so consider that a clue .
Nosler specifically recommends their 64 grain Bonded Solid Base soft point load for personal defense .
Avoid the heavy soft point bullets sold for hunting Class 2 game ( hogs , deer and antelope ) .
Save ball ammo for practice , as its stopping power is very unreliable .
Note : .223 rifles with a 1 in 12 " rifling twist shoot more accurately with 35 - 60 grain bullets , as this is the bullet weight range for which they were designed .
Rifles with a fast 1 in 7 " twist ( this includes the AR - 15A2 and nearly all European models ) prefer 55 - 75 grain bullets .
Other .223/5.56 mm barrels may have 1 in 8 " or 1 in 9 " twists .
Ruger Mini - 14 rifles have a 1 in 10 " twist and do well with most any bullet weight up to 70 grains .
They all adequately handle 55 grain bullets .
Twist rate is only important at longer ranges , in any case .
.30 M1 Carbine
Never use ball in your M1 for defense !
.30 Carbine ball sucks , but .30 Carbine hollow points work very well .
Try the Winchester Super - X 110 grain Hollow Soft Point load .
This provides a MV of 1990 fps and ME of 967 ft. lbs. 7.62x39 mm Soviet ( 7.62 mm Russian Short , 7.62 mm M43 Combloc )
Some prefer this East Bloc cartridge to the .223 for defense use .
It is an excellent round , most commonly used in SKS and AK - 47 derived rifles , as well as the Ruger Mini - 30 .
Use any 123-125 grain soft point or tipped bullet from Cor-Bon , Federal , Hornady , Winchester , or Remington .
PMC makes a good , low - priced 125 grain soft point you might like if you have a lot of magazines to fill .
.30 - 30 Winchester
This old round has survived so long for a simple reason : it works .
Load your Winchester , Henry , Mossberg , or Marlin .30 - 30 lever action carbine ( 16 " - 20 " barrel ) with any hollow point or plastic tipped factory load .
I like the Federal 125 grain .
Leave the 170 grain soft points for hunting , unless you live in the country .
A .30 - 30 carbine is excellent for use on a farm or ranch , but dangerously over - penetrative in most urban situations .
The lever action carbines , properly equipped , make good " scout rifles . "
Fresh cartridges can be slipped through the loading gate to top - up the tubular magazine without taking the rifle out of service .
.308 Winchester ( 7.62x51 mm NATO )
This is an excellent rifle cartridge , one of the best .
Over penetration is the biggest problem .
Use fast opening bullets of 150 grains or less in lever action , pump , or autoloading carbines .
The Nosler Ballistic Tip , Hornady SST , Hornady V - Max and Remington Accu-Tip are examples of quick - opening bullets that are available in various brands of factory loaded ammunition .
Carbine length .308 rifles also make excellent " scout rifles . " 9 mm Parabellum ( 9 mm Luger , 9x19 mm , 9 mm NATO )
Generally the same as for pistols , see above .
Heckler & Koch , Uzi and Colt 9 mm carbines will feed anything .
Any reliable hollow point is a good choice in a 9x19 mm carbine and the long barrel makes for high velocity and increased effectiveness .
.30 -06 Springfield
This excellent and time - proven cartridge has too many top - notch loads to list .
Choose the same bullets mentioned in connection with the .308 Winchester ( above ) in lever action , pump , or autoloading carbines .
As with the .308 , the biggest concern is over penetration in populated areas .
.357 Magnum
This is the best of the self - defense handgun cartridges available in carbines and superior to the .30 Carbine cartridge .
See the ammunition guidelines for revolvers , above , but avoid bullets lighter than 125 grains and Glasers or other exotic bullets .
The heavier 140 - 158 grain JHP bullets may shoot more accurately than lighter bullets in carbines .
This is okay , as the carbine 's higher velocity will cause more bullet expansion on impact .
For example , .38 Special +P 125 grain JHP loads fired from an 20 " carbine barrel will hit as hard as full power magnums fired from a service revolver 's 4 " or 6 " barrel .
The Winchester Super - X 158 grain JHP factory load has a MV of 1830 fps and ME of 1175 ft. lbs. per the Winchester catalog .
The .357 makes an excellent self - defense round in Marlin , Henry , Uberti and Winchester lever actions , or the Action Arms / Israeli Military Industries " Timber Wolf " .357 pump action carbine .
The recoil of full power .357 Magnum loads is very mild in a carbine .
. 44 Magnum Pick any good hollow point , using the guidelines for revolvers .
Winchester figures quote a MV of 1760 fps and ME of 1650 ft. lbs. for the Super - X 240 grain JHP factory load from a 20 " barrel .
Do n't be tempted to use soft points ; these hunting rounds will blow right through your foe and anyone standing behind him .
. 44 Magnum recoil in a carbine is much more than a .357 Magnum , about like a .30 - 30 .
.45 Colt
This revolver cartridge has rather recently been adopted to carbines , usually classic lever action designs , for cowboy action shooters .
From a 20 " barrel , its MV with full power loads ( around 1150 fps for a 225 grain bullet ) , ME ( around 670 ft. lbs. ) and trajectory are very inferior to .357 and .44 Magnum carbines , but clearly superior to .45 handguns of all types .
Recoil in a carbine is mild .
Pick any good hollow point load , using the guidelines for revolvers .
THE END
A Louisville ambulance took nine minutes to respond to a 911 call last night , despite a fire station being just 0.2 miles away - - a drive Google Maps estimates as one minute for cars under normal conditions ( that is , without a siren and the right to go through red lights ) .
I called 911 at 7:16 p.m. yesterday when a man sitting on the curb at Speedway ( 1101 Bardstown Road ) yelled and fell to the ground , grabbing his chest , moving slightly and spitting .
An ambulance did n't arrive until 7:25 p.m. though -- nine minutes later -- while a group of customers and Speedway employees tended to the man .
An EMT could have walked the 0.2 miles from the nearest fire station at 1025 Rubel Ave. to the Speedway in less time .
And with another fire station located at 1735 Bardstown Road , just 1.2 miles and a two - minute drive straight down the street , there 's no excuse for the delay .
And when the ambulance did arrive , rather than drive right over to the man , it did a lap around Speedway 's parking lot before pulling up next to him .
Finally , at 7:25 p.m. EMTs were providing medical care .
Around 7:10 p.m. last night I pulled into the Speedway at 1101 Bardstown Road to fuel my wife 's car .
As I got out of the Passat , I noticed a guy , probably homeless , certainly in discomfort , sitting on the curb in front of me .
As I was puttering around with the pump , the man yelled and fell to the ground .
I called 911 as other customers and Speedway employees approached him .
It was 7:16 p.m .
I gave the 911 dispatcher a good description of our whereabouts : the Speedway on Bardstown Road at the intersection of Grinstead Drive , the man to the left of the entrance .
She asked for his description .
I said something along the lines of a man in his forties or fifties , long hair , beard , probably homeless .
At 7:22 p.m. , six minutes later , an ambulance still had not arrived and no sirens were audible .
Knowing that several fire stations were close enough for an ambulance dispatched immediately to have arrived , I called 911 again .
I got the same dispatcher .
She verified that she had received my first call and an ambulance was dispatched a minute after we spoke .
A few minutes later I heard a siren and saw an ambulance coming northeast up Grinstead Drive .
I walked to the entrance to Speedway 's parking lot and pointed towards where the man was on the ground .
And with several people standing around him , it should have been obvious .
But the ambulance drove 270 degrees around the parking lot before pulling up to him .
Update , Sept. 21 , 11:20 p.m .
I submitted a link to this article to the Louisville EMS .
Monday afternoon I received this response from Kristen L. Miller , chief of staff , Louisville Metro EMS .
While I appreciate Miller 's prompt response , I 'm concerned : Miller said it took 6:22 for the EMS to arrive on the scene .
Based on the times of my calls to 911 ( shown above ) and the 7:26:19 timestamp on my photo of the EMT getting out of the ambulance ( right ) , it appears the response time was closer to 10 minutes -- longer than the recognized standards she cites .
Mr. Everson ,
I wanted to take this opportunity to respond to your post .
When you called 911 , the MetroSafe 911 Communications Center calltaker used an internationally - validated medical algorithm to collect critical patient information , dispatch the appropriate response resource , and give important guidance on how to assist the patient on - scene until responders arrived .
This system , used in more than 3,000 911 communications centers around the world , recommended a Code 2 , non-emergency response based on the answers given to the 911 calltaker .
Your 911 call was dispatched to the closest appropriate Louisville Metro EMS response unit at 19:18:34 .
The crew began its response approximately a minute later , and arrived on - scene in six minutes and 22 seconds .
The National Fire Protection Association ( NFPA ) recommends that prehospital medicine providers reach 90 % of emergent , life - threatening calls with an advanced life support provider in eight minute or less .
Additionally , the Journal of Emergency Medical Services ( JEMS ) reported in its 2008 200 - City Survey that the majority of urban transport EMS systems set eight minutes and 59 seconds as their response time goal .
As you can see , even though this particular call involved a non-emergency response , our LMEMS responders beat both of those recognized standards .
The ambulance that responded to this call was coming from University Hospital .
At the time the call was received , it was the closest appropriate unit to the patient 's location .
Typically the ambulance stationed at Engine 20 ( Bardstown and Maryland ) would have responded , however it was on an emergency run at the time of this call .
There is no ambulance stationed at Engine 11 ( Rubel ) , and to our knowledge there was not an ambulance stationed there prior to the creation of LMEMS .
Resource " stand - by " locations are placed strategically across the community ; there is not simply an ambulance at every fire station .
In placing these stand - bys , we analyzed several years ' worth of 911 emergency medical calls and where they were located across the community .
Then , using software that approximates real - time street and driving conditions , we analyzed which potential stand - by locations would allow our resources to reach 80 % of those calls in eight minutes or less .
We continually revisit the deployment of our resources to those locations to ensure that they continue to optimize our ability to reach the most severely ill or injured patients with the most appropriate
resource as quickly as possible .
If you have any additional questions , please feel free to contact us at 574-4260 .

LEBANON , Pennsylvania ( CNN ) --
A hostile crowd shouted questions and made angry statements Tuesday at a town hall meeting on health care in Pennsylvania led by Democratic Sen. Arlen Specter .
Sen . Arlen Specter , left , answers questions Tuesday during a forum in Lebanon , Pennsylvania .
The meeting drew an overflow of about 250 people , with more gathered outside the hall to demonstrate for and against President Obama 's push to expand health insurance for 46 million people without coverage while bringing down costs .
It was the latest in a series of emotional public meetings on the health care issue that have prompted Obama and Democratic leaders to complain of a campaign by opponents to drown out the debate with unruly disruptions .
At one point , Specter shouted into his microphone that demonstrators disrupting the proceedings would be thrown out .
" We 're not going to tolerate any demonstrations or any booing , " he said after one audience member shoved another making an unsolicited speech .
" So it 's up to you . "
Watch the shouting and shoving »
Many in the crowd identified themselves as conservative Republicans , with one man noting they had voted for Specter before the senator switched parties this year .
One woman prompted a standing ovation by telling Specter : " I do n't believe this is just health care .
This is about the systematic dismantling of this country .
... I do n't want this country turning into Russia , turning into a socialized country .
What are you going to do to restore this country back to what our founders created , according to the Constitution ? "
See a comparison of different countries ' plans »
Specter responded by noting his support for the Constitution as a past chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee on issues such as warrantless wiretaps .
" When you ask me to defend the Constitution , that 's what I 've been doing , " Specter said .
Specter said that overhauling the health care system is about America taking care of all of its people .
" In our social contract , we have provisions that see to it that you take care of people who need some help , " he said .
Several people asked if a health care bill would mean taxpayer dollars would pay for others to get abortions .
Specter responded that any measure passed by Congress would allow people to choose a plan that did n't cover abortions .
The senator agreed with the crowd on some issues , saying he opposes mandatory counseling on end - of - life issues called for in a House of Representatives version of health care legislation .
Specter also vowed he would never support any bill that increased the federal deficit or took away a person 's right to choose their health care coverage .
" I am opposed to anybody making a decision for you or me or anybody else about what health care plan we should have , " he said .
Emotions ran high , with questioners complaining of government intrusion in their lives on health care and other issues .
One man implored Specter and the government to " leave us alone , " while another said the message Specter should take back to Washington is that he and others " want our country back . "
The shoving incident occurred early in the 90 - minute session when a man started shouting that he had been told by Specter 's staff that he could speak , but he did n't get one of the 30 cards distributed to people allowing them to ask questions .
Another man stood up and shoved the protester , and Specter approached the men shouting for calm .
" You and your cronies in government do this kind of stuff all the time , " the protester shouted before leaving the hall .
" I 'm not a lobbyist with all kinds of money to stuff in your pockets .
I 'll leave you so you can do whatever the hell you do . "
Specter remained calm most of the time , except when a woman asked if the bill meant a 74 - year - old man with cancer would be written off by an overhauled health care system .
" Nobody 74 is going to be written off because they have cancer , " he responded angrily .
" That 's a vicious , untrue rumor . "
See an overview of the issue »
One man defended the rowdy behavior of the audience .
" I do n't think we have bad attitudes , " he said .
" We 're just being Americans . "
iReport.com : Attending a town hall ?
Specter said he would vote against all the provisions he said he opposed in the town hall meeting , but he dodged the question of whether he would vote against a final bill if it still contained those provisions .
The senator also tried to inject some humor , making sure to thank the lone person among the 30 questioners who supported the health care overhaul .
Obama has said an overhaul is essential for long - term economic stability .
Congressional action has slowed due to strong Republican opposition .
Neither the House nor the Senate met Obama 's goal of passing a bill before Congress ' August recess .
Watch how Obama is preparing for his own town hall »
In particular , Republicans and some Democrats reject a government - funded public health insurance option , arguing it would lead to a government takeover of the health care system .
Most Democrats want a public option to ensure coverage is available to virtually all Americans and provide competition to private insurers .
All About Arlen Specter • Health Care Policy • Barack Obama
Last Thursday Joel Spolsky posted an article on his blog , The Duct Tape Programmer , based on my interview with Jamie Zawinski in Coders at Work .
It — as Joel ’s posts often do — sparked quite a bit of commentary on the programming web , eliciting responses from Uncle Bob Martin and Tim Bray and hundreds of comments on sites like the programming reddit and hackernews .
It was probably fortunate for me that Spolsky used the title he did — praising someone while calling them a “ duct- tape programmer ” is provocative and the provocation probably helped drive interest which , no doubt , led to a few people buying the book .
So , that ’s awesome .
Thanks , Joel !
On the other hand , being provocative sometimes leaves little room for nuance .
Since I dragged Zawinski into this by asking him to be in the book , I thought maybe I could try to unpack some of the context for folks who have n’t yet read the interview .
The first thing to remember is that the first version of Netscape was written in 1994 .
When Zawinski talks about the choice to not use C++ and the problems with templates , he ’s not talking about C++ and templates in 2009 ; he ’s talking about 15 years ago , four years before the language was officially standardized and a time when different compilers did n’t necessarily implement all the nooks and crannies of the language the same way .
And Netscape had to run on Windows , Unix , and Mac , so reliable portability was especially important .
The second thing to keep in mind is that the Netscape team in 1994 was under tremendous , if self - imposed , time pressure .
I asked Zawinski how it was that the original Netscape team , many of whom had worked on Mosaic at the NSCA and were thus getting a second crack at the same problem , avoided falling into second - system syndrome :
Zawinski :
We were so focused on deadline it was like religion .
We were shipping a finished product in six months or we were going to die trying .
Seibel : How did you come up with that deadline ?
Zawinski :
Well , we looked around at the rest of the world and decided , if we ’re not done in six months , someone ’s going to beat us to it so we ’re going to be done in six months .
Could they have made a different trade - off in the old “ fast , good , cheap — pick two ” space ?
Possibly .
But history certainly testifies that they produced a product quickly enough that no one beat them to the punch and good enough that they changed the history of the web .
But wait !
Did n’t Netscape eventually collapse under the burden of accumulated cruft ?
Did n’t the Mozilla project have to do a massive , ground - up rewrite because the old code base was so covered in duct tape that it was impossible to work with ?
Does n’t that completely disprove Spolsky ’s point ?
Not clear .
I have n’t done an extensive investigation of the history of Netscape ’s code but I do have Zawinski ’s version of events and some corroboration from Brendan Eich , who was also there at the time .
Certainly they paid a price for their rapid development :
Seibel :
After this relentless pace , at some point that has to start to catch up with you in terms of the quality of the code .
How did you guys deal with that ?
Zawinski :
Well , the way we dealt with that was badly .
There ’s never a time to start over and rewrite it .
And it ’s never a good idea to start over and rewrite it .
Yet we all know that Netscape famously was rewritten after it was spun out into the Mozilla project .
So case closed , right ?
Not quite .
What many people do n’t know is that — at least according to Zawinski — the Mozilla rewrite was the second rewrite .
Here ’s Zawinski ’s version , from the part of his Coders interview where we were talking about his work with Terry Weissman on the mail reader that was added to Netscape in version 2.0 :
Zawinski :
So basically [ Netscape ] acquired this company , Collabra , and hired this whole management structure above me and Terry .
Collabra has a product that they had shipped that was similar to what we had done in a lot of ways except it was Windows - only and it had utterly failed in the marketplace .
Then they won the start - up lottery and they got acquired by Netscape .
And , basically , Netscape turned over the reins of the company to this company .
So rather than just taking over the mail reader they ended up taking over the entire client division .
Terry and I had been working on Netscape 2.1 when the Collabra acquisition happened and then the rewrite started .
Then clearly their Netscape 3.0 was going to be extremely late and our 2.1 turned into 3.0 because it was time to ship something and we needed it to be a major version .
So the 3.0 that they had begun working on became 4.0 which , as you know , is one of the biggest software disasters there has ever been .
It basically killed the company .
It took a long time to die , but that was it : the rewrite helmed by this company we ’d acquired , who ’d never accomplished much of anything , who disregarded all of our work and all of our success , went straight into second - system syndrome and brought us down .
They thought just by virtue of being here , they were bound for glory doing it their way .
But when they were doing it their way , at their company , they failed .
So when the people who had been successful said to them , “ Look , really , do n’t use C++ ; do n’t use threads , ” they said , “ What are you talking about ?
You do n’t know anything . ”
Well , it was decisions like not using C++ and not using threads that made us ship the product on time .
The other big thing was we always shipped all platforms simultaneously ; that was another thing they thought was just stupid .
“ Oh , 90 percent of people are using Windows , so we ’ll focus on the Windows side of things and then we ’ll port it later . ”
Which is what many other failed companies have done .
If you ’re trying to ship a cross - platform product , history really shows that ’s how you do n’t do it .
If you want it to really be cross- platform , you have to do them simultaneously .
The porting thing results in a crappy product on the second platform .
Seibel : Was the 4.0 rewrite from scratch ?
Zawinski :
They did n’t start from scratch with a blank disk but they eventually replaced every line of code .
And they used C++ from the beginning .
Which I fought against so hard and , dammit , I was right .
It bloated everything ; it introduced all these compatibility problems because when you ’re programming C++ no one can ever agree on which ten percent of the language is safe to use .
There ’s going to be one guy who decides , “ I have to use templates . ”
And then you discover that there are no two compilers that implement templates the same way .
And when your background , your entire background , is writing code where multiplatform means both Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 , you have no concept how big a deal that is .
So it made the Unix side of things — which thankfully was no longer my problem — a disaster .
It made the Mac side of things a disaster .
It meant it was no longer possible to ship on low - end Windows boxes like Win16 .
We had to start cutting platforms out .
Maybe it was time to do that , but it was a bad reason .
It was unnecessary .
Brendan Eich , who was also at Netscape at this time , confirms at least part of Zawinski ’s account :
There was an imperative from Netscape to make the acquisition that waved the Design Patterns book around [ i.e. Collabra ] feel like they were winners by using their new rendering engine , which was like My First Object - Oriented Rendering Engine .
From a high level it sounded good ; it used C++ and design patterns .
But it had a lot of problems .
He does , however , go on to say :
But the second reason we did the big rewrite — I was in mozilla.org and I really was kind of pissed at Netscape , like Jamie , who was getting ready to quit .
I thought , you know , we need to open up homesteading space to new contributors .
We ca n’t do it with this old hairball of student code from 1994 .
Or my fine Unix kernel - style interpreter code .
So Zawinski and Eich differ a bit on the extent to which the Collabra folks had completely replaced the old code in 4.0 .
If Zawinski ’s recollection is accurate and the 4.0 rewrite had really replaced all the old code , then the fact the Mozilla project felt compelled to do a big rewrite is only evidence of what a mess the first rewrite had made of things and says nothing about the quality of the pre-4.0 code .
Or maybe they had n’t quite replaced everything but had still messed things up enough that it was easier to start over .
Or maybe it really was the legacy of the 1994 code — too much duct tape — that was the real problem .
Ironically , if Zawinski had had his way it ’d be much easier to know what really happened — he tells me in a recent email that he tried , in 1998 , to get Netscape to open source both the 4.0 and 3.0 code bases but they would n’t go for it .

The 43 - year - old patient , who lost the lower half of his face during treatment for a malignant tumor 11 years ago , is recovering well and could be released in 10 days , Cavadas told a news conference in Valencia .
The unidentified patient was given a tongue and jaw as part of a face transplant operation , the first carried out in Spain .
“ The patient should recover the capacity to speak intelligibly , to swallow .... recover sensitivity in his tongue and his face , ” the Spanish surgeon said .
Tuesday ’s transplant , the eighth involving a face since the surgery was pioneered in 2005 , was particularly difficult because previous surgery had rendered the veins , arteries and nerves normally connected in these operations useless , Cavadas said .
The Beatles appeared at the end of the original film
US director Robert Zemeckis is in talks to remake a 3D version of the animated 1968 Beatles film Yellow Submarine , according to reports .
Trade magazine Variety said the Back To The Future filmmaker and Disney were working to secure rights to use the 16 Beatles tunes that feature in the film .
Zemeckis plans to use the performance - capture format he used for previous films Beowulf and The Polar Express .
It is hoped the film will be ready in time for the London 2012 Olympic Games .
The original 1968 film followed the band as they travelled to an undersea paradise - Pepperland , protected by Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band - to free it from the music - hating Blue Meanies .
Although actors provided the voices for the animated incarnations of Paul McCartney , John Lennon , George Harrison and Ringo Starr , The Beatles appeared in the film 's closing live - action scene .
Songs including All You Need Is Love , When I 'm 64 , Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds and Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band all featured in the film .
The 3D performance - capture technology is also being used in Zemeckis 's forthcoming film , A Christmas Carol , starring Jim Carrey as Scrooge and the three ghosts who haunt him in the Charles Dickens tale .

Bangkok 's showcase new international airport is no stranger to controversy .
Built between 2002 and 2006 , under the governments of then - Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , the opening date was repeatedly delayed .
It has been dogged by allegations of corruption , as well as criticism of the design and poor quality of construction .
Then , at the end of last year , the airport was shut down for a week after being occupied by anti-government protesters .
Now new allegations have been made that a number of passengers are being detained every month in the duty free area on suspicion of shoplifting , and then held by the police until they pay large sums of money to buy their freedom .
That is what happened to Stephen Ingram and Xi Lin , two IT experts from Cambridge , as they were about to board their flight to London on the night of 25 April this year .
They had been browsing in the duty free shop at the airport , and were later approached by security guards , who twice asked to search their bags .
Mr Ingram and Ms Xi were told they had to pay £ 8,000
They were told a wallet had gone missing , and that Ms Lin had been seen on a security camera taking it out of the shop .
The company that owns the duty free shop , King Power , has since put the CCTV video on its website , which does appear to show her putting something in her bag .
However the security guards found no wallet on either of them .
Despite that , they were both taken from the departure gate , back through immigration , and held in an airport police office .
That is when their ordeal started to become frightening .
Interpreter " We were questioned in separate rooms , " Mr Ingram said .
" We felt really intimidated .
They went through our bags and demanded that we tell them where the wallet was . "
The two were then put in what Mr Ingram describes as a " hot , humid , smelly cell with graffiti and blood on the walls " .
Mr Ingram managed to phone a Foreign Office helpline he found in a travel guide , and was told someone in the Bangkok embassy would try to help them .
The next morning the two were given an interpreter , a Sri Lankan national called Tony , who works part - time for the police .
They were taken by Tony to meet the local police commander - but , says Mr Ingram , for three hours all they discussed was how much money they would have to pay to get out .
Mr Ingram and Ms Xi were taken to meet the local police commander
They were told the charge was very serious .
If they did not pay , they would be transferred to the infamous Bangkok Hilton prison , and would have to wait two months for their case to be processed .
Mr Ingram says they wanted £ 8,000 ( about $ 13,000 ) - for that the police would try to get him back to the UK in time for his mother 's funeral on 28 April .
But he could not arrange to get that much money transferred in time .
' Zig - zag ' scheme
Tony then took Ms Lin to an ATM machine and told her to withdraw as much as she could from her own account - £ 600 .
He then withdrew the equivalent of £ 3,400 from his own account .
According to Mr Ingram this was then handed over to the police , and they were both forced to sign a number of papers .
Later they were allowed to move to a squalid hotel within the airport perimeter , but their passports were held and they were warned not to leave or try to contact a lawyer or their embassy .
" I will be watching you , " Tony told them , adding that they would have to stay there until the £ 8,000 was transferred into Tony 's account .
On the Monday they managed to sneak out and get a taxi to Bangkok , and met an official at the British Embassy .
She gave the name of a Thai lawyer , and , says Mr Ingram , told them they were being subjected to a classic
Thai scam called the " zig-zag " .
Their lawyer urged them to expose Tony - but also warned them that if they fought the case it could take months , and they risked a long prison sentence .
After five days the money was transferred to Tony 's account , and they were allowed to leave .
Mr Ingram had missed his mother 's funeral , but at least they were given a court document stating that there was insufficient evidence against them , and no charge .
" It was a harrowing , stressful experience , " he said .
The couple say they now want to take legal action to recover their money .
' Typical ' scam
The BBC has spoken to Tony and the regional police commander , Colonel Teeradej Phanuphan .
They both say Tony was merely helping the couple with translation , and raising bail to keep them out of prison .
Tony says about half the £ 8,000 was for bail , while the rest were " fees " for the bail , for his work , and for a lawyer he says he consulted on their behalf .
In theory , he says , they could try to get the bail portion refunded .
Colonel Teeradej says he will investigate any possible irregularities in their treatment .
But he said any arrangement between the couple and Tony was a private affair , which did not involve the police .
Letters of complaint to the papers here in Thailand make it clear that passengers are regularly detained at the airport for alleged shoplifting , and then made to pay middlemen to win their freedom .
The Danish Embassy says one of its nationals was recently subjected to a very similar scam , and earlier this month an Irish scientist managed to flee Thailand with her husband and one year - old son after being arrested at the airport and accused of stealing an eyeliner worth around £ 17 .
Tony told the BBC that so far this year he has " helped " about 150 foreigners in trouble with the police .
He says sometimes he does it for no charge .
The British Embassy has also warned passengers at Bangkok Airport to take care not to move items around in the duty free shopping area before paying for them , as this could result in arrest and imprisonment .
Here are a selection of your comments : A similar system operates in Cambodia .
Police arrest foreigners in the street and you are contacted by someone who claims to have influence with the police and judges and who asks for large sums for your immediate release , which does n't happen .
I was even told at my friend 's trial that the police would provide witnesses of my friend 's offence if more money was not immediately provided .
Even though there was no evidence against him and he was acquitted , a large sum had to be paid to the prison authorities for his release .
John Smith , Doncaster , England Two friends and I travelled to Bangkok 29 December 2008 .
We were really worried about the situation there , as the airport had just been closed for some time several weeks before .
Aside being quite harassed by taxi drivers who wanted to take us to hotels they no doubt received commission from , the experience was n't very trying at all .
Connor , Chicago , IL , USA Another scam at Bangkok Airport is when the Thai customs meet passengers off airplanes from Dubai / Qatar where there is cheap duty free .
The customs tell passengers to put duty free items inside their check - in luggage when they take it off the carousel - or they will be prosecuted for smuggling .
They then tell people that it will be OK not to show or declare any duty free items .
When the passengers reach the arrivals area , the customs pounce and you are arrested and taken to customs head office at BANG NA and told to pay four times the duty or go straight to jail .
There is an ATM machine next door to the customs office .
Your goods are kept by the officers and they then pocket the money you have paid them and you are free to go without any criminal record .
Paul Grant , London , UK Same happened to me in April this year .
The police arrested me and charged me approx £ 400 .
There were 5 of us in our group , we purchased 1000 cigarettes at Heathrow , but on leaving the plane at Bangkok the police approached me and told me to keep them in one bag .
I did as I was told , and that was the set up , so when I got through customs with the other four people they arrested me and would not accept what we told them .
They took copies of my passport and made me sign at least six documents , all in Thai .
They would not give me copies so at this moment I do n't know what I signed .
They escorted me to an ATM .
I have been in touch with the British consulate who asked me if I want to make a complaint but I do n't want to go to another country and find they have done something to my passport .
I will never return to Thailand again , it was the scariest time of my life .

Around half of the companies which purchase used software do so owing to a dislike of cloud and subscription models .
This was the finding of a recent market survey conducted by used software provider usedSoft .
However , the most important factor in the purchase of a used licence is and will remain the price …

You ’ve probably heard of the YAGNI principle , it stands for ( You Ain’t Gonna Need It ) .
Essentially it is meant as a mantra for developers to prevent us from anticipating functionality and building things before we know that they are actually necessary .
You can think of it as an Agile principle or an unspoken ( or sometimes vociferously spoken :) ) rule if you like .
Regardless , it can sometimes be a good idea to keep this principle in mind and measure much of what you do as a developer against it to make sure you ’re not building a ‘ mountain ’ when a ‘ mole hill ’ will do just fine .
I like the idea of YAGNI and often try to apply it to what I do , but just like any principle that has been around for a while I have seen the message ( or the idea behind the principle ) be diluted to the point where some people start to use it without thinking and without understanding what it is all about .
Applying YAGNI Without Thinking
You know you ’re applying YAGNI without thinking when it becomes the first and only yardstick for anything you do as a software developer .
Implement a pattern ?
No way – YAGNI , a simple loop will do .
Use a utility library ?
What for – YAGNI , it ’s just one simple method , we can roll our own .
How about building in more automation around our deployment process ?
Bah – YAGNI , we only do this once every 3 months , we can do without .
Do n’t get me wrong I am not advocating always using patterns , or libraries , or automating without thought .
What I am trying to say is , you ca n’t unilaterally apply YAGNI to everything without considering the larger context .
If I do use a pattern here , will it make my code more readable , maintainable , testable , if the answer is yes then perhaps the pattern is a good idea .
The point is , YAGNI in and of itself is not an objective it is just a practice , a tool .
No matter what task you do you should always be aiming to make the system easier to understand and easier to use , more testable and maintainable , cleaner and more robust .
If that means writing a little bit more code and putting in a little bit more thought , then YAGNI will just have to deal with it .
The Ideas Behind YAGNI
To give it even more context , applying YAGNI to everything you do is a recipe for a dish of spaghetti code .
In my opinion the two main ideas you need to consider before reaching for the YAGNI stick are :
granularity
balance
Granularity
It makes a lot more sense to me to apply YAGNI to much larger concerns .
Let ’s make our application scalable to 1000 requests per second .
Whoa , YAGNI – it is only ever gonna be used internally and there are only 100 users , not necessary .
We as developers tend to sometimes let our love of playing with cool technology run away with us and end up using a proverbial bazooka to clobber a fly .
YAGNI can help us avoid this , but it is only really relevant when we are talking about things that can take significant time , money or work .
I am referring to coarse - grained concerns – major features , changing project direction , radical technology changes .
If you ’re dealing with any of those or similar than by any means apply YAGNI and see if it still makes sense , otherwise there are perhaps other practices that can take precedence .
Balance
You have to balance the YAGNI mentality against reality .
You often CAN anticipate which way the project is likely to go in the near future and it might make sense to build particular things now to cater for this .
You may have capacity now but will not necessarily have it later .
You may have some expertise within your team at the moment that will not be available down the track .
These things can weigh in against YAGNI .
And when we are talking about finer grained features ( i.e. the actual code and low level design of the system ) , then the * abilities should always take precedence , maintainability , testability , usability , readability etc .
The Agile Practice Stupidity Threshold
No matter what practice you use you should always understand the implications behind it and in what context the practice is best applied .
For example , TDD is a great practice and you can use it to evolve better designs through writing the tests first .
However , would you ever use TDD to evolve attribute readers or writers – of course not !
More than that , there is a certain level of code that is just too simple to require being evolved through TDD , there is simply no need .
But , if you use TDD without thinking you can find yourself doing exactly that , which would just be stupid and a bad use of TDD .
Every practice you use , including TDD and YAGNI has a certain threshold which I call the stupidity threshold .
While you ’re using the practice as a tool giving due consideration to all other concerns , you ’re fine .
But , as soon as the use of a particular practice becomes an objective in and of itself , you have crossed the practice stupidity threshold and will find yourself in trouble eventually .

The Paleocene - Eocene Thermal Maximum ( PETM ) was a very weird period around 55 million years ago .
However , the press coverage and discussion of a recent paper on the subject was weirder still .
For those of you not familiar with this period in Earth ’s history , the PETM is a very singular event in the Cenozoic ( last 65 million years ) .
It was the largest and most abrupt perturbation to the carbon cycle over that whole period , defined by an absolutely huge negative isotope spike (> 3 permil in 13C ) .
Although there are smaller analogs later in the Eocene , the size of the carbon flux that must have been brought into the ocean / atmosphere carbon cycle in that one event , is on a par with the entire reserve of conventional fossil fuels at present .
A really big number – but exactly how big ?
The story starts off innocently enough with a new paper by Richard Zeebe and colleagues in Nature Geoscience to tackle exactly this question .
They use a carbon cycle model , tuned to conditions in the Paleocene , to constrain the amount of carbon that must have come into the system to cause both the sharp isotopic spike and a very clear change in the “ carbonate compensation depth ” ( CCD ) – this is the depth at which carbonates dissolve in sea water ( a function of the pH , pressure , total carbon amount etc . ) .
There is strong evidence that the the CCD rose hundreds of meters over the PETM – causing clear dissolution events in shallower ocean sediment cores .
What Zeebe et al. come up with is that around 3000
Gt carbon must have been added to the system – a significant increase on the original estimates of about half that much made a decade or so ago , though less than some high end speculations .
Temperature changes at the same time as this huge carbon spike were large too .
Note that this is happening on a Paleocene background climate that we do n’t fully understand either – the polar amplification in very warm paleo - climates is much larger than we ’ve been able to explain using standard models .
Estimates range from 5 to 9 deg C warming ( with some additional uncertainty due to potential problems with the proxy data ) – smaller in the tropics than at higher latitudes .
Putting these two bits of evidence together is where it starts to get tricky .
First of all , how much does atmospheric CO2 rise if you add 3000 GtC to the system in a ( geologically ) short period of time ?
Zeebe et al. did this calculation and the answer is about 700 ppmv – quite a lot eh ?
However , that is a perturbation to the Paleocene carbon cycle – which they assume has a base CO2 level of 1000 ppm , and so you only get a 70 % increase – i.e. not even a doubling of CO2 .
And since the forcing that goes along with an increase in CO2 is logarithmic , it is the percent change in CO2 that matters rather than the absolute increase .
The radiative forcing associated with that is about 2.6 W/m2 .
Unfortunately , we do n’t ( yet ) have very good estimates of background CO2 levels in Paleocene .
The proxies we do have suggest significantly higher values than today , but they are n’t precise .
Levels could have been less than 1000 ppm , or even significantly more .
If ( and this is a key assumption that we ’ll get to later ) this was the only forcing associated with the PETM event , how much warmer would we expect the planet to get ?
One might be tempted to use the standard ‘ Charney ’ climate sensitivity ( 2 - 4.5 ºC per doubling of CO2 ) that is discussed so much in the IPCC reports .
That would give you a mere 1.5 - 3 ºC warming which appears inadequate .
However , this is inappropriate for at least two reasons .
First , the Charney sensitivity is a quite carefully defined metric that is used to compare a certain class of atmospheric models .
It assumes that there are no other changes in atmospheric composition ( aerosols , methane , ozone ) and no changes in vegetation , ice sheets or ocean circulation .
It is not the warming we expect if we just increase CO2 and let everything else adjust .
In fact , the concept we should be looking at is the Earth System Sensitivity ( a usage I am trying to get more widely adopted ) as we mentioned last year in our discussion of ‘ Target CO2 ‘ .
The point is that all of those factors left out of the Charney sensitivity are going to change , and we are interested in the response of the whole Earth System – not just an idealised little piece of it that happens to fit with what was included in GCMs in 1979 .
Now for the Paleocene , it is unlikely that changes in ice sheets were very relevant ( there were n’t any to speak of ) .
But changes in vegetation , ozone , methane and aerosols ( of various sorts ) would certainly be expected .
Estimates of the ESS taken from the Pliocene , or from the changes over the whole Cenozoic imply that the ESS is likely to be larger than the Charney sensitivity since vegetation , ozone and methane feedbacks are all amplifying .
I ’m on an upcoming paper that suggests a value about 50 % bigger , while Jim Hansen has suggested a value about twice as big as Charney .
That would give you an expected range of temperature increases of 2 - 5 ºC ( our estimate ) or 3 - 6 ºC ( Hansen ) ( note that uncertainty bands are increasing here but the ranges are starting to overlap with the observations ) .
ALl of this assumes that there are no huge non-linearities in climate sensitivity in radically different climates – something we are n’t at all sure about either .
But let ’s go back to the first key assumption – that CO2 forcing is the only direct impact of the PETM event .
The source of all this carbon has to satisfy two key constraints – it must be from a very depleted biogenic source and it needs to be relatively accessible .
The leading candidate for this is methane hydrate – a kind of methane ice that is found in cold conditions and under pressure on continental margins – often capping large deposits of methane gas itself .
Our information about such deposits in the Paleocene is sketchy to say the least , but there are plenty of ideas as to why a large outgassing of these deposits might have occurred ( tectonic uplift in the proto - Indian ocean , volcanic activity in the North Atlantic , switches in deep ocean temperature due to the closure of key gateways into the Arctic etc. ) .
Putting aside the issue of the trigger though , we have the fascinating question of what happens to the methane that would be released in such a scenario .
The standard assumption ( used in the Zeebe et al paper ) is that the methane would oxidise ( to CO2 ) relatively quickly and so you do n’t need to worry about the details .
But work that Drew Shindell and I did a few years ago suggested that this might not quite be true .
We found that atmospheric chemistry feedbacks in such a circumstance could increase the impact of methane releases by a factor of 4 or so .
While this is n’t enough to sustain a high methane concentration for tens of thousands of years following an initial pulse , it might be enough to enhance the peak radiative forcing if the methane was being released continuously over a few thousand years .
The increase in the case of a 3000 GtC pulse would be on the order of a couple of W / m2 – for as long as the methane was being released .
That would be a significant boost to the CO2 - only forcing given above – and enough ( at least for relatively short parts of the PETM ) to bring the temperature and forcing estimates into line .
Of course , much of this is speculative given the difficulty in working out what actually happened 55 million years ago .
The press response to the Zeebe et al paper was , however , very predictable .
The problems probably started with the title of the paper “ Carbon dioxide forcing alone insufficient to explain Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum warming ” which on it ’s own might have been unproblematic .
However , it was paired with a press release from Rice University that was titled “ Global warming : Our best guess is likely wrong ” , containing the statement from Jerry Dickens that “ There appears to be something fundamentally wrong with the way temperature and carbon are linked in climate models ” .
Since the know - nothings agree one hundred per cent with these two last statements , it took no time at all for the press release to get passed along by Marc Morano , posted on Drudge , and declared the final nail in the coffin for ‘ alarmist ’ global warming science on WUWT ( Andrew Freedman at WaPo has a good discussion of this ) .
The fact that what was really being said was that climate sensitivity is probably larger than produced in standard climate models seemed to pass almost all of these people by ( though a few of their more astute commenters did pick up on it ) .
Regardless , the message went out that ‘ climate models are wrong ’ with the implicit sub - text that current global warming is nothing to worry about .
Almost the exact opposite point that the authors wanted to make ( another press release from U. Hawaii was much better in that respect ) .
What might have been done differently ?
First off , headlines and titles that simply confirm someone ’s prior belief ( even if that belief is completely at odds with the substance of the paper ) are a really bad idea .
Many people do not go beyond the headline – they read it , they agree with it , they move on .
Also one should avoid truisms .
All ‘ models ’ are indeed wrong – they are models , not perfect representations of the real world .
The real question is whether they are useful – what do they underestimate ?
overestimate ?
and are they sufficiently complete ?
Thus a much better title for the press release would have been more specific “ ” Global warming :
Our best guess is likely too small ” – and much less misinterpretable !
Secondly , a lot of the confusion is related to the use of the word ‘ model ’ itself .
When people hear ‘ climate model ’ , they generally think of the big ocean - atmosphere models run by GISS , NCAR or Hadley Centre etc. for the 20th Century climate and for future scenarios .
The model used in Zeebe et al was not one of these , instead it was a relatively sophisticated carbon cycle model that tracks the different elements of the carbon cycle , but not the changes in climate .
The conclusions of the study related to the sensitivity of the climate used the standard range of sensitivities from IPCC TAR ( 1.5 to 4.5 ºC for a doubling of CO2 ) , which have been constrained – not by climate models – but by observed climate changes .
Thus nothing in the paper related to the commonly accepted ‘ climate models ’ at all , yet most of the commentary made the incorrect association .
To summarise , there is still a great deal of mystery about the PETM – the trigger , where the carbon came from and what happened to it – and the latest research has n’t tied up all the many loose ends .
Whether the solution lies in something ‘ fundamental ’ as Dickens surmises ( possibly related to our basic inability to explain the latitudinal gradients in any of the very warm climates ) , or whether it ’s a combination of a different forcing function combined with more inclusive ideas about climate sensitivity , is yet to be determined .
However , we can all agree that it remains a tantalisingly relevant episode of Earth history .
The world 's first Welsh language phone will be launched later this year by Orange and Samsung .

The Samsung S5600 will be available for free on 24 month Orange contracts at 19.57 per month or 14.98 per month , as well as for 129 on Orange Pay As You Go .
It will only initially be available in Welsh stores , but will be rolled out online at a later date .
Rich Garbage Man Review
RichGarbageMan.com is the latest Money Making prgram released on the Clickbank network .
Does it live up to it 's claims ?
Finally , a review you can trust !
Hi , my name is Pat Johnson ,
Before I go further I want to first mention that I have indeed bought the Rich Garbage Man
and have read the entire contents , which makes me fully qualified to write this review , unlike most of the other reviews you will find that are nothing more than fake reviews from affiliate marketers designed to persuade you to buy the eBook through their affiliate link so that they will earn a commission on the sale .
( I promise never to do that ! )
As a respected marketer among my industry Peers , I am fortunate enough to be in a position where most merchants will gladly supply me with a review copy of their latest product release in hopes that I will be impressed enough to promote it , however , the author Scott Laevy was not so receptive to the idea so I decided to buy it and do a Rich Garbage Man Review .
The big up - sell
The first thing I discovered was that the book can be purchased for 1 / 2 price by simply going to the main page and then trying to exit the page , at that point you will be presented with a Pop - Up that offers you the ebook for only $ 27.00 , apparently this offer is normally reserved for friends and family , Yea Right !... this seems to be the latest marketing trend amongst all those so called Gurus .
I 'm not gonna lie to you , I went a step further and purchased it through my own clickbank affiliate link which saved me a further 75 % , It only ended up costing me $ 6.75 ( which was still too much ) .
Another annoying marketing strategy that has become so rampant these days is the so called " one time offers " - the ones that say ... " you will only see this offer once " , Yea Right !...
I was presented with 3 different up - sells before I finally arrived at the order confirmation page
What 's Inside RichGarbageMan.com
My first reaction to the ebook was one of utter disgust , how can anyone in good conscience peddle this crap to unsuspecting consumers and claim it to be " Ground Breaking Information "
In a Nut Shell , it 's all about using Google trends to find current hot niches then capitalizing on them .
Duhhhh !...
The author has the nerve to call that " Ground Breaking " , I and every other marketer I know have been using Google Trends for several years now , paying any amount of money to be told this is simply criminal .
The rest of the ebook is so vague that the average newbie will be completely lost and confused !
The Author of the " Rich Garbage Man " assumes that you ...
Already have your own accounts set up with several affiliate networks
Already know how to successfully market an affiliate product
Already know how to build your own landing pages
Already know how to set up your own hosting account etc .
Already know how to send traffic to your website via Pay - Per - Click
Already know how to convert your traffic into sales .
And the list goes on ...
Finally , the author tries to convince you to buy several other products from his so called business partners in order to make the whole system work , the links to the so called partner sites are nothing more than affiliate links in which he makes a commission from when you buy them .
To your success ,
Pat Johnson
Democrats celebrated the 200th day of their $ 787 stimulus plan this week , and the reception was surprisingly cheery .
Both the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post ran stories that quoted economists praising the stimulus for turning the economy around .
Goldman Sachs ' chief US economist went so far as to say that without the stimulus , our third quarter GDP might be flat instead of projected to rise by 3 percent .
So what are the Democrats doing ?
Bringing it all back to health care , of course !
Christopher Beam of Slate says that when Joe Biden talks about the stimulus plan , he 's really talking about that other multi- hundred billion bill they 've got in the pipeline .
Writes Beam :
In his speech today , Biden made sure to mention the economic benefits of electronic health records , to which the stimulus package allocated $ 19 billion .
They will prevent redundancy , he argued , saving patients and taxpayers money .
Plus , a major reason the stimulus has worked , Biden said , is because of " leverage . "
Wind turbines , he said , do n't just create jobs ; they generate power , save money , and wean the United States off foreign oil - - all at the same time !
Likewise , electronic health records will improve health care statistics , which produces better diagnoses , which makes Americans more healthy , which means they wo n't have to visit the doctor as much , which saves money , and so on .
Underlying the stimulus anniversary , therefore , is an implicit bargain :
Let us fix the health care system the way you let us fix the economy .
It 's not just Biden drawing those connections .
Here 's Michael Steele , chairman of the Republican National Committee , jumping all over the unemployment rate :
" The unemployment rate jumped to 9.7 percent .
More than 216,000 Americans lost their jobs in the month of August alone .
That means more than 3 million Americans have lost their jobs since the president took office .
The president 's economic experiment simply is n't working , and Americans should n't expect his government - run health care experiment to work , either . "
That 's one reason why my colleague Chris Good is right to tie the unemployment numbers to the Democrats ' agenda ( he says the 9.7 % unemployment figure wo n't hurt too bad ... yet . )
All these in - flux factors -- town hall sentiment , unemployment numbers , p olls on health care , consumer spending , retail and so on -- can tie either balloons or anchors to Obama 's agenda , but it only takes one bad number or event to stain the message that the president is in touch with the country and guiding it in the right direction .

The seventeen pieces in Ficciones demonstrate the gargantuan powers of imagination , intelligence , and style of one of the greatest writers of this or any other century .
Borges sends us on a journey into a compelling , bizarre , and profoundly resonant realm ; we enter the fearful sphere of Pascal 's abyss , the surreal and literal labyrinth of books , and the iconography of eternal return .
More playful and approachable than the fictions themselves are Borges 's Prologues , brief elucidations that offer the uninitiated a passageway into the whirlwind of Borges 's genius and mirror the precision and potency of his intellect and inventiveness , his piercing irony , his skepticism , and his obsession with fantasy .
To enter the worlds in Ficciones is to enter the mind of Jorge Luis Borges , wherein lies Heaven , Hell , and everything in between .
We were in Plymouth for a week and joined the Plimoth Plantation as members which proved to be an excellent decision ...

In the wake of a U.S Justice Department investigation into questionable hiring practices at tech companies , it ’s come to light that in August 2007 , Apple asked Palm not hire any of its employees .
According to former Palm CEO Ed Colligan , who once mocked Apple ’s entry into the smartphone market , he and Jobs held talks in 2007 to discuss Palm ’s recent hiring of former influential Apple executive Jon Rubenstein , who was instrumental in developing the iMac and the iPod .
According to reports , Rubenstein was actively recruiting a number of Apple employees with offers to work for Palm , a move which infuriated Jobs , and rumor has it , once resulted in a shouting match between the two .
According to reports , Rubenstein ’s recruiting efforts prompted Jobs to remark , “ We must do whatever we can to stop this . ”
Obviously , Palm was n’t interested in any non-hire agreement with Apple as a good number of former Apple engineers eventually migrated over to Palm where they helped churn out the Palm Pre .
While specific details of Jobs ’ offer and discussion with Colligan are n’t known , Bloomberg ’s review of the U.S Justice Department filings reveal that “ Jobs said Apple had patents and more money than Palm if the companies ended up in a legal fight . ”
Which is interesting , because it raises the question if Apple ever truly considered suing Palm for its use of multi-touch on the Palm Pre .
But back to Apple ’s rebuffed proposal to Palm .
Colligan responded to Jobs saying , “ Your proposal that we agree that neither company will hire the other ’s employees , regardless of the individual ’s desires , is not only wrong , it is likely illegal . ”
While the legality of such agreements are n’t entirely clear , the losers in such cases are the actual employees , who may potentially be prevented from moving on to more attractive jobs with higher pay .
Interestingly , this news comes hot on the heels that Apple and Google had a longstanding , albeit unofficial , agreement not to officially recruit each other ’s employees , an agreement which may no longer exist in light of the departure of Google CEO Eric Schmidt from Apple ’s board of directors .
It ’s unclear if Jobs ’ proposal to Palm was similar to its subsequent arrangement with Google , or if Jobs did n’t want Apple employees heading over to Palm under any circumstances , even if they sought out employment on their own volition .
Google ( GOOG ) has begun operating a data center in Belgium that has no chillers to support its cooling systems , a strategy that will improve its energy efficiency while making local weather forecasting a larger factor in its data center management .
Chillers , which are used to refrigerate water , are widely used in data center cooling systems but require a large amount of electricity to operate .
With the growing focus on power costs , many data centers are reducing their reliance on chillers to improve the energy efficiency of their facilities .
This has boosted adoption of " free cooling , " the use of fresh air from outside the data center to support the cooling systems .
This approach allows data centers to use outside air when the temperature is cool , while falling back on chillers on warmer days .
Google has taken the strategy to the next level .
Rather than using chillers part - time , the company has eliminated them entirely in its data center near Saint - Ghislain , Belgium , which began operating in late 2008 and also features an on - site water purification facility that allows it to use water from a nearby industrial canal rather than a municipal water utility .
Year - Round Free Cooling
The climate in Belgium will support free cooling almost year - round , according to Google engineers , with temperatures rising above the acceptable range for free cooling about seven days per year on average .
The average temperature in Brussels during summer reaches 66 to 71 degrees , while Google maintains its data centers at temperatures above 80 degrees .
So what happens if the weather gets hot ?
On those days , Google says it will turn off equipment as needed in Belgium and shift computing load to other data centers .
This approach is made possible by the scope of the company 's global network of data centers , which provide the ability to shift an entire data center 's workload to other facilities .
In a March interview , Urs Holzle , Google 's Senior Vice President of Operations , said the company typically uses manual tools to manage data center level outages and downtime .
" Teams regularly practice failing out of or routing around specific data centers as part of scheduled maintenance , " he said .
" Sometimes we need to build new tools when new classes of problems happen . "
Redirecting Workloads Instantly
At last month 's Structure 09 conference , Google 's Vijay Gill hinted that the company has developed automated tools to manage data center heat loads and quickly redistribute workloads during thermal events ( a topic covered by The Register ) .
" You have to have integration with everything right from the chillers down all the way to the CPU , " said Gill , Google 's Senior Manager of Engineering and Architecture .
" Sometimes , there 's a temperature excursion , and you might want to do a quick load - shedding to prevent a temperature excursion because , hey , you have a data center with no chillers .
You want to move some load off .
You want to cut some CPUs and some of the processes in RAM . "
Gill was asked if this was a technology Google is using today .
" I could not possibly comment on that , " Gill replied .
Look Ma : No Chillers !
But Google engineers had already disclosed the existence of the chiller - less Belgium data center at the Google Data Center Efficiency Summit in April in Mountain View , Calif .
At the event , we asked specifically : are there chillers on - site that are rarely used , or no chillers at all ?
The answer : no chillers at all .
The facility will rely entirely on free cooling , and redirect workload on days when it 's too hot to operate .
This approach makes local weather an issue in network management , although advanced forecasting can help Google anticipate days when it may need to divert work from the Belgium facility .
Nonetheless , even Google is periodically challenged by rerouting entire data centers , as seen in a February Gmail outage when a data center was overloaded while shifting workloads .
Traffic redirection was also an issue in a brief outage in May .
An Enabler for " Follow the Moon " ?
The ability to seamlessly shift workloads between data centers also creates intriguing long - term energy management possibilities , including a " follow the moon " strategy which takes advantage of lower costs for power and cooling during overnight hours .
In this scenario , virtualized workloads are shifted across data centers in different time zones to capture savings from off - peak utility rates .
This approach has been discussed by cloud technologists Geva Perry and James Urquhart as a strategy for cloud computing providers with global data networks , who could offer a " follow - the - moon " service to enterprise customers who would normally build data centers where power is cheap .
But this approach could also produce energy savings for a single company with a global network - someone like Google .
An insecticide is a pesticide used against insects in all development forms .
They include ovicides and larvicides used against the eggs and larvae of insects .
Insecticides are widely used in agriculture , household and even in medicine .
Insecticides are very widely used in agriculture , as well as in people 's dwellings and workplaces .
The use of insecticides is one of the major factors behind the increase in agricultural productivity in the 20th century .
Because insecticides have the potential to significantly alter ecosystems and may be concentrated through the food chain , it is necessary to balance agricultural needs with safety concerns when using them .
Classes of agricultural insecticides
The classification of insecticides is done in several different ways :
The systematic insecticides which are incorporated into the plants and the insects take up the insecticide while feeding on the plants .
The contact insecticides which take action when they are brought into direct contact with the insect by aerosol distribution .
The natural insecticides , such as nicotine and pyrethrum , made by plants as defence against insects .
In contrast to the inorganic insecticides like arsenates copper - and fluorine compounds , which are now seldom used , and the organic insecticides which now form the biggest group .
The point of action is also a good way of sorting the insecticides .
The neurotocic insecticides , the acetylcholinesterase blocking and moulting blockers .
The neurotoxic and coleterinas blocker are difficult because they are also toxic for other organisms .
Where as the skinning blockers and the other insecticides which take action only in metabolism of insects are less likely to be highly toxic on mammals .
The contribution as aerosol ( liquid or solid ) is mostly used for contact insecticides , as solid for the uptake by the plant roots is preferred for systematic insecticides and fumigation with phosphine or hydrogen cyanide is mostly used for sensitive products after the harvest .
[ edit ]
Classes of insecticides , a short history A series of classes of insecticides have existed , as time progressed one class has largely replaced the one before it .
These trends in the classes of compounds in some ways has mirrored the development of chemical warfare agents .
Heavy metals , eg lead , mercury , arsenic and plant toxins such as nicotine have been used for many years .
Various plants have been used as folk insectides for centuries , including tobacco and pyrethrum .
Chlorine based agents , with the rise of the modern chemical industry it was possible for form organochlorides .
The substances used in chemical warfare tend to be more potent electrophiles than those used as insecticides .
For instance mustard gas ( sulfur mustard , HD ) is a potent alklating agent which uses neighbouring group participation of the sulfur to make the alkyl chloride a stronger electrophile .
While a typical insecticide such as DDT or lindane does not depend on an electrophile / nucleophile reaction to kill the insect .
It is likely that the chlorine is used to tune the lipophilicity of the compound , and to alter the shape and electrostatic effects involved in the interactions of the insecticide and the biomolecules in the target organism .
For insatnce DDT works by opening the sodium channels in the nerve cells of the insect .
The next large class was the organophosphates , both the insecticides and the chemical warfare agents ( such as sarin , tabun , soman and VX ) work in the same way .
All these compounds bind to the neurotransmitter acetylcholinesterase and other cholinesterases .
This results in disruption of nervous impulses , killing the insect or interfering with its ability to carry on normal functions .
Recent efforts to reduce broad spectrum toxins added to the environment have brought biological insecticides back into vogue .
An example is the development and increase in use of Bacillus thuringiensis , a bacterial disease of Lepidopterans and some other insects .
It is used as a larvicide against a wide variety of caterpillars .
Because it has little effect on other organisms , it is considered more environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides .
[ edit ]
Environmental effects
One of the bigger drivers in the development of new insecticides has been the desire to replace toxic and irksome insecticides .
The notorious DDT was introduced as a safer alternative to the lead and arsenic compounds which had been used before .
It is the case that when used under the correct conditions that almost any chemical substance is ' safe ' , but when used under the wrong conditions even the ' safest ' substance can be a threat to life , limb and / or the environment .
Some insecticides have been banned due to the fact that they are persistent toxins which have adverse effects on animals and / or humans .
A classic example which is often quoted is that DDT is an example of a widely used ( and maybe misused ) pesticide .
One of the better known impacts of DDT is to reduce the thickness of the egg shells on predatory birds .
The shells sometimes become too thin to be viable , causing reductions in bird populations .
This occurs with DDT and a number of related compounds due to the process of bioaccumulation , wherein the chemical , due to its stability and fat solubility , accumulates in organisms fat .
Also , DDT may biomagnify which causes progressively higher concentrations in the body fat of animals farther up the food chain .
The near - worldwide ban on agricultural use of DDT and related chemicals has allowed some of these birds -- such as the peregrine falcon -- to recover in recent years .
The longlived organochlorine Dieldrin , if used with care , can prevent termites from destroying telephone cables , but it is clearly not suitable for aerial spraying to control insects in a field close to a school playground .
While the overuse of DDT lead to a reduction in its use , opponents of traditional environmentalism often cite it as an example of environmentalism going too far and interfering with malaria eradication , going so far as to estimate the cost of human lives resulting from the DDT ban ; for instance the novelist Michael Crichton states in his bestselling book , State of Fear : " Since the ban , two million people a year have died unnecessarily from malaria , mostly children .
The ban has caused more than fifty million needless deaths .
Banning DDT killed more people than Hitler . "
This accusation , while sensational , is erroneous , as no ban exists on the use of DDT for eradication of malaria or any other insect borne disease .
[ 1 ]
Groups fighting malaria have praised the ban on agricultural use of DDT , since it reduces the rate with which mosquitoes become resistant to DDT , which is the main reason it is not used more often to fight malaria :
" The outcome of the treaty is arguably better than the statu­­s quo going into the negotiations over two years ago .
For the firs­t time­ , there is now an insecticide which is restricted to vector co­ntrol onl­y , meaning that the selection of resistant mosquitoes wi­ll be slower th­an before . " [ 2 ] .
In fact , according to Agricultural production and malaria resurgence in Central America and India , Chapin , Georgeanne & Robert Wasserstrom , Nature , Vol. 293 , 1981 , page 183 ) , the lives actually saved due to banning agricultural use of DDT can be estimated : " Correlating the use of DDT in El Salvador with renewed malaria transmission , it can be estimated that at current rates each kilo of insecticide added to the environment will generate 105 new cases of malaria . "
Lindane and other insecticides have had to be used as an alternative to DDT because the population of insects have become resistant to DDT .
Some of the newer insecticides are more specific in their actions and are designed to break down into non-toxic components within a few days of application .
[ edit ]
Application methods Insect repellent , commonly referred to as " bug spray " , comes in a plastic bottle or aerosol can .
Applied to clothing , arms , legs , and other extremities , the use of this pesticide will tend to ward off nearby insects .
This is not an insecticide .
Insecticide used for killing pests — most often insects , and arachnids — primarily comes in an aerosol can , and is sprayed into the air or nest as a means of killing the animal .
Fly sprays will kill house flies , blowflies , ants , cockroaches and other insects and also spiders .
Active ingredients of many household insecticides include permethrin and tetramethrin , which act on the nervous system of insects and arachnids .
Bug spray should be used in well ventilated areas only , as the chemicals contained in the aerosol and pesticide can be harmful or deadly to humans .

Q From T J Wentzel : For most of my life , the common usage here in the USA was to home in on something .
Recently however , I increasingly notice the usage of hone in on instead .
I know that English usage changes over time , but it seems that the latter phrase has almost completely replaced the former in a short while .
I would appreciate your views on the subject .
A It ’s an interesting shift , one so far largely confined to the US , but one we ’re actually able to watch as it happens .
The original is from early aeronautics .
Pilots were guided to their destinations and back to their home bases by radio beacons .
In the jargon of the time — the early 1920s — they were said to home on the beacons .
This was clearly taken from the somewhat older expression homing pigeons .
In later years , beacons were fitted to aircraft so one could home on another .
By this time — around 1940 — home had lost much of its literal association with going home and had taken on the figurative idea of “ guiding an aircraft to its target or destination by means of a radio signal ” .
The exact expression to home in on began to appear during World War Two .
American researcher Ben Zimmer has discovered the earliest known example in the Chicago Daily Tribune in 1944 : “ The Oahu radio was coming in strong .
They had left the station on all night so we could ‘ home in ’ on its frequency . ”
After the war , people began to use it in the current figurative sense of focusing one ’s attention on a single matter .
That ’s now the only situation in which most people encounter it .
It ’s hardly obvious to somebody who has n’t come across it before or who does n’t know the background .
Why home ?
This lack of context makes it easy for speakers to change the word into something that seems to be more appropriate or make more sense .
Hone in on is a classic example of the type of word shift that has become known in recent years among linguists as an eggcorn : a change in word form due to error or misunderstanding .
In this case , it seems to be the figurative sense of the verb to hone , meaning to sharpen a tool , that has led to the change , since it ’s widely used to mean making something work better , for example when we say somebody is “ honing her skills ” .
If you are honing in on a topic , you can imagine people thinking , then you ’re improving your understanding of it .
It came to public attention and gained some notoriety when George Bush used it in the presidential campaign of 1980 — he spoke of “ honing in on the issues ” .
He was n’t the earliest user : George Plimpton wrote about his time with the Detroit Lions football team in Paper Lion , published in 1965 ; in that book he described a player “ looking back for the ball honing in to intercept his line of sight ” .
You ’re correct in your comment that the shift from home to hone has now gone so far that the latter is on the verge of becoming the usual form , at least in the USA .
Some people even assume that the home form is a misprint .
There seems little doubt that hone will eventually take over , though it ’s impossible to say whether it will spread to other English - speaking countries .
Even before Barack Obama was sworn in as the 44th president of the United States , the internet was seething with lurid conspiracy theories exposing his alleged subversion and treachery .
Among the many false claims : Obama was a secret Muslim ; he was not a native U.S. citizen and his election as president should be overturned ; he was a tool of the New World Order in a plot to merge the government of the United States into a North American union with Mexico and Canada .
Within hours of Obama ’s inauguration , claims circulated that Obama was not really president because Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts scrambled the words as he administered the oath of office .
A few days after the inauguration came a warning that Obama planned to impose martial law and collect all guns .
Many of these false claims recall those floated by right - wing conspiracy theorists in the armed citizens ’ militia movement during the Clinton administration — allegations that percolated up through the media and were utilized by Republican political operatives to hobble the legislative agenda of the Democratic Party .
The conspiracy theory attacks on Clinton bogged down the entire government .
Legislation became stuck in congressional committees , appointments to federal posts dwindled and positions remained unfilled , almost paralyzing some agencies and seriously hampering the federal courts .
A similar scenario is already hobbling the work of the Obama administration .
The histrionics at congressional town hall meetings and conservative rallies is not simply craziness — it is part of an effective right - wing campaign based on scare tactics that have resonated throughout U.S. history among a white middle class fearful of alien ideas , people of color and immigrants .
Unable to block the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court , the right - wing media demagogues , corporate political operatives , Christian right theocrats , and economic libertarians have targeted healthcare reform and succeeded in sidetracking the public option and single - payer proposals .
A talented environmental adviser to the Obama administration , Van Jones , was hounded into resigning Sept. 5 by a McCarthyite campaign of red-baiting and hyperbole .
Support for major labor law reform has been eroding .
With a wink and a nod , right - wing apparatchiks are networking with the apocalyptic Christian right and resurgent armed militias — a volatile mix of movements awash in conspiracy theories .
Scratch the surface and you find people peddling bogus conspiracy theories about liberal secular humanists , collectivist labor bosses , Muslim terrorists , Jewish cabals , homosexual child molesters and murderous abortionists .
This right - wing campaign is about scapegoating bogus targets by using conspiracy theories to distract attention from insurance companies who are the real culprits behind escalating healthcare costs .
Examples of right - wing conspiracy theories include the false claim that healthcare reform will include government bureaucrat “ Death Panels ” pulling the plug on grandma .
Another is the claim that Obama is appointing unconstitutional project “ Czars ” More fraudulent conspiracy theories are being generated every week .
The core narrative of many popular conspiracy theories is that “ the people ” are held down by a conspiracy of wealthy secret elites manipulating a vast legion of corrupt politicians , mendacious journalists , propagandizing schoolteachers , nefarious bankers and hidden subversive cadres .
This is not an expression of a healthy political skepticism about state power or legitimate calls for reform or radical challenges to government or corporate abuses .
This is an irrational anxiety that pictures the world as governed by powerful long - standing covert conspiracies of evildoers who control politics , the economy , and all of history .
Scholars call this worldview “ conspiracism . ”
The term conspiracism , according to historian Frank P. Mintz , denotes a “ belief in the primacy of conspiracies in the unfolding of history . ”
Mintz explains : “ Conspiracism serves the needs of diverse political and social groups in America and elsewhere .
It identifies elites , blames them for economic and social catastrophes , and assumes that things will be better once popular action can remove them from positions of power .
As such , conspiracy theories do not typify a particular epoch or ideology . ”
When conspiracism becomes a mass phenomenon , persons seeking to protect the nation from the alleged conspiracy create counter movements to halt the subversion .
Historians dub them countersubversives .
The resulting right - wing populist conspiracy theories point upward toward “ parasitic elites ” seen as promoting collectivist and socialist schemes leading to tyranny .
At the same time , the counter - subversives point downward toward the “ undeserving poor ” who are seen as lazy and sinful and being riled up by subversive community organizers .
Sound familiar ?
Right - wing demagogues reach out to this supposedly beleaguered white middle class of “ producers ” and encourage them to see themselves as being inexorably squeezed by parasitic traitors above and below .
The rage is directed upwards against a caricature of the conspiratorial “ faceless bureaucrats , ” “ banksters ” and “ plutocrats ” rather than challenging an unfair economic system run on behalf of the wealthy and corporate interests .
The attacks and oppression generated by this populist white rage , however , is painfully felt by people lower on the socio- economic ladder , and historically this has been people of color , immigrants and other marginalized groups .
It is this overarching counter - subversive conspiracy theory that has mobilized so many people ; and the clueless Democrats have been caught unaware by the tactics of right - wing populism used successfully for the last 100 years and chronicled by dozens of authors .
The techniques for mobilizing countersubversive right - wing populists include “ tools of fear ” : dualism , demonization , scapegoating , and apocalyptic aggression .
When these are blended with conspiracy theories about elite and lazy parasites , the combination is toxic to democracy .
DUALISM
Dualism is simply the tendency to see the world in a binary model in which the forces of absolute good are struggling against the forces of absolute evil .
This can be cast in religious or secular story lines or “ narratives . ”
SCAPEGOATING
Scapegoating involves wrongly stereotyping a person or group of people as sharing negative traits and blaming them for societal problems , while the primary source of the problem ( if it is real ) is overlooked or absolved of blame .
Scapegoating can become a mass phenomenon when a social or political movement does the stereotyping .
It is easier to scapegoat a group if it is first demonized .
DEMONIZATION
Demonization is a process through which people target individuals or groups as the embodiment of evil , turning individuals in scapegoated groups into an undifferentiated , faceless force threatening the idealized community .
The sequence moves from denigration to dehumanization to demonization , and each step generates an increasing level of hatred of the objectified and scapegoated “ Other . ”
One way to demonize a target group is to claim that the scapegoated group is plotting against the public good .
This often involves demagogic appeals .
CONSPIRACISM
Conspiracism frames demonized enemies “ as part of a vast insidious plot against the common good , while it valorizes the scapegoater as a hero for sounding the alarm . ”
Conspiracist thinking can move easily from the margins to the mainstream , as has happened repeatedly in the United States .
Several scholars have argued that historic and contemporary conspiracism , especially the apocalyptic form , is a more widely shared worldview in the United States than in most other industrialized countries .
Conspiracism gains a mass following in times of social , cultural , economic , or political stress .
The issues of immigration , demands for racial or gender equality , gay rights , power struggles between nations , wars — all can be viewed through a conspiracist lens .
Historian Richard Hofstadter established the leading analytical framework in the 1960s for studying conspiracism in public settings in his essay , “ The Paranoid Style in American Politics . ”
He identified “ the central preconception ” of the paranoid style as a belief in the “ existence of a vast , insidious , preternaturally effective international conspiratorial network designed to perpetrate acts of the most fiendish character . ”
According to Hofstadter , this was common in certain figures in the political right , and was accompanied with a “ sense that his political passions are unselfish and patriotic ” which “ goes far to intensify his feeling of righteousness and his moral indignation . ”
According to Michael Barkun , professor of political science at Syracuse University , conspiracism attracts people because conspiracy theorists “ claim to explain what others can’t .
They appear to make sense out of a world that is otherwise confusing . ”
There is an appealing simplicity in dividing the world sharply into good and bad and tracing “ all evil back to a single source , the conspirators and their agents . ”
COVER OBAMA’S BACK , BUT KICK HIS BUTT
Today , when you hear the right - wing demagogues whipping up the anti-Obama frenzy , you now know they are speaking a coded language that traces back to Social Darwinist defenses of “ Free Market ” capitalism and to xenophobic white supremacy .
The voices of Beck , Limbaugh , Hannity , O’Reilly , Coulter , Dobbs and their allies are singing a new melody using old right - wing populist lyrics .
The damage they can do is great even if most of these movements eventually collapse .
The centrist Democratic spinmeisters surrounding Obama have no idea how to organize a grassroots defense of healthcare reform .
That ’s pathetic .
These are the three R’s of civil society : Rebut , Rebuke , Re-Affirm : Rebut false and misleading statements and beliefs without name - calling ; rebuke those national figures spreading misinformation ; and re-affirm strong and clear arguments to defend goals and proposed programs .
That ’s exactly what President Obama did on in his nationally televised address Sept.
9 .
While keeping our eyes on the prize of universal , quality healthcare , we must also prevent right - wing populism as a social movement from spinning out of control .
Since Obama ’s inauguration , there have been nine murders tied to white supremacist ideology laced with conspiracy theories .
It is already happening here .
Since centrist Democrats are selling us out , it is time for labor and community organizers to turn up the heat .
We should defend Obama against the vicious and racist attacks from the reactionary political right , but we can have Obama ’s back while we are kicking his butt .
Vigorous social movements pull political movements and politicians in their direction — not the other way around .
We need to raise some hell in the streets and in the suites .
Chip Berlet , senior analyst at Political Research Associates , is the author of the recent study “ Toxic to Democracy ; ” and is co-author with Matthew N. Lyons of Right - Wing Populism in America : Too Close for Comfort .
Populist movements frequently adopt conspiracy theories of power , regardless of their ideological position on the political spectrum .
In her book Populism , Margaret Canovan defined four types of political populism .
Populist democracy is championed by progressives from the LaFollettes of Wisconsin to Jesse Jackson .
However , the other three types — politicians ’ populism , reactionary populism and populist dictatorship — are antidemocratic forms of right - wing populism .
These were characterized in various combinations in the 1990s by Ross Perot , Pat Robertson , Pat Buchanan and David Duke — four straight white Christian men trying to ride the same horse .
Two versions of right - wing populism are current in both the United States and Europe : one centered around “ get the government off my back ” economic libertarianism , coupled with a rejection of mainstream political parties , which is more attractive to the upper - middle class and small entrepreneurs .
The other is based on xenophobia and ethnocentric nationalism , which is more attractive to the lower middle class and wage workers .
These two groupings unite behind candidates that attack the current regime since both constituencies identify an intrusive government as the cause of their grievances .

Former U.S. House Majority Leader Dick Armey chairs FreedomWorks , while Matt Kibbe , who worked for the late Lee Atwater ( of Willie Horton ads notoriety ) , is president and CEO .
When accused of encouraging “ astroturf ” activists to disrupt healthcare town halls , Kibbe responded , “ Vocal participating was celebrated when the left would do it .
When conservatives do it we ’re denounced as thuggish . ”
Head of the Coalition to Protect Patients ’ Rights , Palmisano has wielded his title as former president of the American Medical Association , the main doctors ’ lobby , to oppose a public option .
Phillips started on the astroturf scene in 1997 when he joined former Christian Coalition director Ralph Reed at Century Strategies , a PR and consulting firm .
Phillips was named president of Americans for Prosperity in 2006 , which describes itself as “ one of the premier grassroots citizen lobbyist organizations in the country . ”
Scott , the former CEO of Columbia / HCA Healthcare , has shelled out $ 5 million of his own money to support Conservatives for Patients ’
Rights , which he chairs .
Also a significant donor to the GOP , Scott was head of Columbia / HCA when it engaged in criminal practices , including bilking Medicare , leading it to be slapped with a record $ 1.7 billion in civil and criminal penalties .
Americans for Prosperity ( AFP ) was involved in the Tea Party protests in April and July and started Patients First , an anti-healthcare reform group .
Other recent AFP campaigns include the Cost of Hot Air Tour — complete with a 70 - foot - tall hot - air balloon — warning of the negative economic impact of “ global warming alarmism , ” and NoStimulus .
com , an online petition signed by more than 450,000 “ concerned citizens ” protesting Obama ’s stimulus bill .
From 2003 to 2006 , AFP received $ 1,181,000 from conservative foundations , including $ 1 million from the Koch Family Foundation .
Described by The New York Times as “ lobbying … vocally against the proposed public option , ” the Coalition to Protect Patient ’s Rights ( CPPR ) states , “ the government should not be involved in the private , personal discussion between a doctor and patient . ”
While it is unclear who pays CPPR ’s bills , the Republican lobbying firm DCI Group coordinates its PR .
Founded in March 2009 to oppose Obama ’s healthcare plan , Conservatives for Patients ’ Rights ( CPR ) has launched a $ 20 million media campaign calling for reform that values competition between healthcare carriers , lets patients control their own coverage and rewards those who make healthy lifestyle choices .
To get its message out , Conservatives for Patients ’ Rights turned to CRC Public Relations ( formerly Creative Response Concepts ) , of Swift Boat fame .
When CPR is not making ads about the horrors of “ rationed ” care in Canada and Britain , it is sending out “ town hall alert ” emails and schedules of meetings .
In one mobilization on July 24 , CPR sent a list of more than 100 congressional town halls to the Tea Party Patriots Health Care Reform Committee listserve , about a week before the anti-healthcare demonstrations exploded .
According to Think Progress , DCI Group “ has specialized in manufacturing ‘ grassroots ’ support — using telemarketers , PR events , and letter writing campaigns — to achieve policy results for narrow corporate interests . ”
DCI clients include the Health Benefits Coalition , a trade association of HMOs that wanted to “ thwart congressional action on the patients ’ bill of rights , ” according to The American Prospect .
DCI has also worked for Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds , creating fake smokers ’ rights groups to fight smoking bans .
DCI has also worked for Burma ’s military junta , Exxon - Mobil , the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth and anti-global warming campaigns .

America is Now the World ’s Biggest Debtor Nation
Bob Chapman writes :
The latest Treasury auction of $ 19 billion of 10 - year notes was at a yield of 3.365 % .
The bid to cover was 3.28 to 1 , the highest ever .
This was the third of four sales this week totaling $ 73 billion .
Consumer credit fell $ 3.23 billion in May , as credit fell 1.5 % to $ 2.5196 trillion from $ 2.522 trillion in April .
Four monthly declines matches June - December of 1991 .
Big loans fell $ 400 million , or 0.3 % .
Revolving credit fell $ 2.9 billion , or at a 3.7 % rate .
We are now al most six months into the depression approaching a 1932 scenario .
America is now the world ’s biggest debtor .
The US has had a fiat currency for 38 years and major trade deficits for more than 30 years .
Is it any wonder we are in depression ?
Is it any wonder the dollar is under pressure even though our government supports it at every turn in the market ?
The world is looking aghast at the dollar as the Treasury runs short of money to fund its deficit beyond revenues of $ 1 to $ 3 trillion and as the Fed monetizes trillions of dollars .
What would you think if you had 64.5 % of your foreign exchange in US dollars ?
That is almost $ 1.8 trillion .
Some of these buyers have ceased buying and if that continues interest rates will head higher and the cost of carrying such debt will increase .
As a result the dollar , of course , would move lower .
Higher yields on 10 - year T - bills translate into higher mortgage rates as real estate inventory continues to grow , a terrible formula for the economy .
We estimate fiscal 2009 to have a deficit of more than $ 2 trillion and incoming revenues will only make up less than half of that .
In spite of the protestations of our Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner that the deficit will be reduced , our president guarantees $ 1 trillion annual deficits as far as the eye can see .
Cuts will never come and the dollar will fall because that is the way the elitists want it to be .
Only from the ashes of economic and financial collapse can the new world order rise .
Our government says one thing and does another .
They want to maintain confidence and trust , but at the same time proceed with the destruction of the monetary and financial system .
We are told that next month the monetization will end , when in fact the Fed will not have completed its $ 3 trillion monetization of Treasuries and Agencies and bank toxic garbage .
Europeans , the Japanese and the British all want their currencies lower in value versus the dollar , believing that a cheaper currency is somehow a magic elixir for trade and , of course , that is n’t always the case .
In fact , the latest efforts to subdue the euro have n’t been very successful .
The dollar has been incapable of breaking up and out of 81 on the USDX .
At the same time , for now the euro has retreated from $ 1.42 to just above $ 1.38 , but it wo n’t last .
Simply , the US is in worse trouble than the eurozone .
The latest madness to come out of CNBC / Wall Street and Washington is Rebuild America Retirement bonds .
This idea is being foisted on us by none other than the resident CNBC shill Jim Cramer .
These bonds do not as yet exist , and Cramer ’s proposal regarding them is a trial run to gauge investor reaction .
The idea was proposed on “ Mad Money , ” which we found appropriate .
These bonds supposedly would strike a medium between risk , safety and income .
They certainly would n’t offer growth with the dollar falling in value .
Cramer said investment options are somewhat limited today , and that he did n’t want to see people falling prey to investment scams .
He probably had his friend Bernie Madoff in mind .
This “ Mad Man Cramer ” has called upon the Treasury Department to issue 30 - year , 5 % bonds .
As you know our Treasury has so much paper to sell that it has had to ask the Fed to monetize , create money out of thin air , to fund $ 3 trillion in treasuries , Agencies ( Fannie – Freddie - FHA , etc. ) , and toxic garbage securities from America ’s biggest elitist banks .
Inadvertently , the secret Fed refuses to divulge what they are paying for such garbage .
These 30 - year , 5 % Treasuries would be offered as a way to help families , who are desperate after having lost some 50 % of their investments in the market to recover their savings .
You might call them modern day Continentals .
This newest monstrosity is designed specifically for 401 ( k ) ’s , IRA ’s and 529 college savings plans .
They ’d be commission free and the 5 % would compound .
Cramer tells us they ’d double in 14.5 years .
Supposedly these funds would go toward economic recovery .
How can that be when the Treasury is struggling to cover a $ 1 trillion plus budget shortfall ?
What Cramer and the elitists are trying to do is entice the average American into funding the administrations out of control spending .
Do n’t forget our president has told us we ’ll have annual budget shortfalls of $ 1 trillion or more as far as the eye can see .
Fools and their money are soon parted .
This is another scam to keep the American economy afloat .
Anyone who invests in US government paper is stupid and they deserve to lose their money .
This shows you how the elitists totally control CNBC to do their bidding .
July 3 MBA Mortgage Applications rise 10.9 % .
About $ 29 billion from President Barack Obama ’s $ 787 billion economic stimulus package has been provided to state and local governments , a pace slightly ahead of schedule , according to congressional auditors .
Most of the money is allocated for health care and education and makes up about 60 percent of the stimulus funding states and local governments will get for fiscal 2009 , the Government Accountability Office said in a report obtained by Bloomberg News .
More than 90 percent of those funds are being used to maintain benefits under Medicaid , the government health - care plan for low - income Americans , and to shore up education programs , the report said .
Many states are using money allocated for highway improvements on repaving projects because they put people to work quickly , it said .
State officials said bids are coming in below estimates because so many contractors are looking for work .
The analysis was based on information from 16 states and the District of Columbia , which represent about 65 percent of the U.S. population .
The $ 3.5 trillion commercial real estate market is a ticking “ time bomb ” that may lead to a second wave of losses at large U.S. banks , congressional Joint Economic Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney said .
About $ 700 billion in commercial mortgages will need to be refinanced before the end of 2010 and “ doing nothing is not an option , ” Maloney , a New York Democrat , said at a committee hearing today .
This “ looming crisis ” may lead to significant losses for banks , force shopping center and hotel owners into bankruptcy , and impede economic recovery , she said .
The response by banks to this “ growing threat has been slow and inadequate , ” said James Helsel , a partner at RSR Realtors in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , and treasurer for the National Association of Realtors .
“ The lack of liquidity and banks ’ reluctance to extend lending are also becoming apparent in the increasing level of delinquent properties . ”
There were 5,315 commercial properties in default , foreclosure or bankruptcy at the end of June , more than twice the number at the end of last year , with hotels and retail among the most “ problematic , ’ Real Capital Analytics Inc. said in a report yesterday .
Losses on commercial mortgage - backed securities , or CMBS , will total 9 percent to 12 percent of the market , or as much as $ 90 billion , said Richard Parkus , a research analyst for Deutsche Bank Securities in New York .
Government insured home loans jumped to 36 percent of all U.S. mortgage applications in June , the highest since 1990 , the Mortgage Bankers Association said .
Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Administration loan applications increased in market share from 25.7 percent in May and from 27 percent a year earlier , the Washington - based trade group said today in a statement .
Borrowers are turning to government backing to offset stricter lending by banks .
About 50 percent of banks tightened requirements for prime borrowers in the first quarter , asking for bigger down payments and more savings , the Federal Reserve said in June .
“ Credit standards are tightened so much , home - buyers have turned to the government , ” said Michelle Meyer , economist for Barclays Capital .
“ I think that as the financial markets normalize and credit markets heal , you ’ll start to see the share of conventional mortgages increase again . ”
The Mortgage Banker ’s index of applications to purchase a home or refinance a loan rose 11 percent to 493.1 in the week ended July 3 .
Purchase applications rose 6.7 percent while requests to refinance gained 15 percent .
The number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest since January , as early automotive plant closures altered the timing of layoffs that typically happen at this time of year .
Initial jobless claims fell by 52,000 to 565,000 , a lower level than forecast , in the week ended July 4 , from a revised 617,000 the prior week , the Labor Department said today in Washington .
Meanwhile , the number of people collecting unemployment insurance jumped to a record in the prior week .

A separate report from broker Citi-Habitats Inc. showed average rents fell 8 percent for studio and one - bedrooms and 11 percent for two - and three - bedrooms .
U.S. wholesale inventories fell again in May as distributors kept working to clear their shelves of excess supply built up by the reduced demand of the recession .
Wholesalers lowered inventories 0.8 % to a seasonally adjusted $ 402.2 billion , the Commerce Department said Thursday .
April inventories fell 1.3 % , revised from an originally reported 1.4 % drop .
A gauge of excess supply , the inventory - to - sales ratio , fell a second straight month , indicating wholesalers were slowly getting inventories under control .
The sales of these middlemen of the economy crept up 0.2 % in May to a seasonally adjusted $ 311.3 billion , after staying flat in April .
April sales were originally seen down 0.4 % .
For the year , sales in May were 19.9 % lower .
Year over year , inventories were down 7.6 % .
The nation ’s retailers were already reeling from the new consumer frugality but in June , incessant rain and rising unemployment further dampened sales .
Stores that had made strides in recent months reverted to double - digit declines .
Overall , the industry posted a 6.7 percent decline in sales for the month , in contrast to a 3.9 percent increase a year ago , according to the Goldman Sachs Retail Composite Index .
Wal - Mart , which had been a bright spot in the retailing world and helped lift the overall industry number , is no longer reporting monthly sales .
Retailers are also facing challenging year - over - year sales comparisons because this June there were no tax rebate checks to help bolster shopping .
The US Treasury on Wednesday pushed ahead with scaled back plans for public - private partnerships to buy toxic assets , naming nine fund managers and allocating $ 30bn of public funds , but without securing any further backing from the Federal Reserve .
Officially , the US central bank is still considering providing additional financing for investors buying bubble - era residential mortgage - backed securities , but its decision not to announce anything on Wednesday strongly suggests that it does not intend to take this step .
In June , the government - insured share of purchase applications climbed to 38.6 percent from 27.8 percent a year earlier , the MBA said .
The federally backed share of refinance applications increased to 33.6 percent .
It touched a record high 38.4 percent in October , according to the MBA .
Home loan rates climbing from a record low 4.78 percent in April are one reason buyers are looking for other ways to reduce costs .
The 30 - year fixed U.S. mortgage rate was 5.2 percent this week , according to McLean , Virginia - based Freddie Mac .
“ A primary reason government - insured loans have retained a high share of the purchase market is that these loans typically require lower down payments than conventional loans , ” said Orawin Velz , associate vice president of economic forecasting for MBA .
“ In addition , lending standards tend to be tighter for conventional loans , especially for loans that require private mortgage insurance . ”
God help Goldman if this is true and the government goes after them .
This would constitute massive unlawful activity .
Indeed , the allegation is that Goldman alone was given this access !
God help our capital markets if this is true and is ignored by our government and regulatory agencies , or generates nothing more than a " handslap . "
Nobody in their right mind would ever trade on our markets again if this occurred and does not result in severe criminal and civil penalties .
There apparently is reason to believe that Sergey might have been involved in exactly this sort of coding implementation .
Specifically , look at the patent claims cited on DailyKos ; his expertise was in fact in this general area of knowledge in the telecommunications world .
This is precisely the sort of thing that a Unix machine , sitting on a network cable where it can " see " traffic potentially not intended for it , could have an interface put into what is called " promiscuous mode " and SILENTLY sniff that traffic !
ASSUMING THE TRAFFIC IS PASSING BY THE MACHINE ON THE WIRE THIS IS TRIVIALLY EASY FOR ANY NETWORK PROGRAMMER OF REASONABLE SKILL TO DO .
IF THAT TRAFFIC IS EITHER UNENCRYPTED OR IT IS EASY TO BREAK THE ENCRYPTION .
Folks , I have no way to know what the code in question does , but if there 's anything to this - anything at all - there is a major , as in biggest scam of the century - scandal here - something much , much bigger than Madoff or Stanford .
Trade at international ports is on track to drop more than 10 % this year , one of the steepest declines ever , according to a new maritime industry report .
Cargo ships will carry 27 million fewer containers by year 's end than they did in 2008 -- a reduction roughly equivalent to all of the cargo containers handled by the five busiest U.S. seaports in a typical year , according to London - based Drewry Shipping Consultants ' Container Forecaster Report .
“ There has never been a decline like this before .
We have never seen numbers like these , " said Neil Dekker , editor of the Drewry report .
" The container industry is looking at a $ 20 - billion black hole of losses .
We can expect a lot of casualties . "

At this time last year , the average rate for a 30 - year fixed mortgage averaged 6.37 percent .
Rates on 30 - year mortgages fell to a record low of 4.78 percent earlier this year , spurring refinance activity .
But rates then rose as high as 5.6 percent in June after yields on long - term government debt , which are closely tied to mortgages rates , climbed as investors worried that the huge surplus of government debt hitting the market could trigger inflation .
Since then , the yield on the 10 - year Treasury note has fallen back from an eight - month high of 4.01 percent reached in June to 3.38 percent yesterday .
The American Bankers Association reported that the number of home equity loans 30 days or more delinquent rose to a record high of 3.52 percent in the first quarter , Nothaft noted .

The U.S. trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed in May to the lowest level in almost a decade as exports jumped while imports of crude oil and auto parts declined .
The gap between imports and exports decreased 9.8 percent to $ 26 billion , the smallest deficit since November 1999 , from a revised $ 28.8 billion in April that was lower than previously estimated , the Commerce Department said today in Washington .
Imports fell while exports rose the most since July 2008 .
A shrinking deficit signals trade will contribute more to U.S. gross domestic product as exports to emerging economies such as Brazil increase .
Meanwhile , U.S. demand for imported auto parts was held down in May by production cutbacks and factory shutdowns by Detroit - based General Motors Corp . and Chrysler LLC , based in Auburn Hills , Michigan , two of the nation ’s three largest automakers .
“ Trade looks like it ’s going to be a big plus for second quarter GDP , ” said James O’Sullivan , a senior economist at UBS Securities LLC in Stamford , Connecticut .
“ It looks like the plunge in exports is over , which is of course consistent with the goal of the economy starting to stabilize after a dramatic collapse . ”
Prices of goods imported into the U.S. rose in June for a fourth straight month as oil costs jumped by the most in a decade .
The 3.2 percent gain in the import price index followed a revised 1.4 percent increase the month before that was larger than previously estimated , according to a Labor Department report today in Washington .
While prices excluding fuels rose 0.2 percent , they were down a record 6.5 percent from June 2008 .

Zero Hedge ( May 5 , 2009 ) : Previously Zero Hedge observed the rather curious integration of Goldman Sachs within the fabric of the NYSE 's program trading environment , which , by their own admission , has everything to do with Goldman being the ( monopoly ) actor in the NYSE 's Supplemental Liquidity 2 Provider program .
I highlighted that the program was set to expire on April 30 .
Today , unsurprisingly , the NYSE posted a notice of a proposed rule change extending the SLP program another six months , until October 1 , 2009 ( this does not change my commitment to providing weekly NYSE program data ) .
I appreciate our readers ' existing and future feedback in this matter .
The full text of the comments by Jeffrey S. Davis of the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC is presented below , but here are some very relevant snippets .
NYSE fails to explain why proprietary liquidity is more valuable than agency liquidity , or why proprietary liquidity should be favored over agency liquidity .
NYSE claims that the proposal is designed to prompt liquidity provision but it simultaneously disqualifies large liquidity providers .
In NASDAQ 's view , these irregularities reveal that NYSE 's true motivation for the SLP Proposals is to discriminate among its members and to burden some members ' ability to compete with NYSE .
And who is the one and only beneficiary of this rampant disregard for almost 80 years of market regulatory practice ?
Who is it that has now become the de facto provider of " market liquidity " which however has much more sinister connotations when reading through the comments of not just some blogger but the NASDAQ Stock Market itself ?

When a firm has an 87.5 % trading accuracy record , something unnatural is occurring .
And we wonder why the buy side has been so docile and malleable when the money is being derived from them !
Over the past decade the move to electronic trading and pricing in pennies was heralded by Street insiders as a means to improve liquidity for clients .
This appears to be a deception .
Virtually every facility benefitted proprietary trading at a select few firms .
Who ’s the patsy ?
Anyone with a modicum of industry experience understands that ‘ providing liquidity ’ is at best a euphemism for front - running order flow .
Anyone that regularly ‘ provides liquidity ’ will go broke .
GS jumped yesterday on this : ( BN ) Goldman Sachs Trading Revenue May Beat 2007 Record , Moszkowski Note Says
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is on track to beat its 2007 trading - revenue record , enabling it to boost compensation by an estimated 64 percent from last year , according to Bank of America Corp. analyst Guy Moszkowski .
Goldman Sachs has ``unmatched risk - taking / risk - management skills in a market that strongly rewards these because of decline in competitor risk appetite , ''… Six months ago , Goldman Sachs was supported by $ 10 billion from the U.S. Treasury and relied on government guarantees to issue debt .
Moszkowski predicts the company will reap $ 26.45 billion from trading this year , a gain from $ 25.36 billion in 2007 when the firm shattered Wall Street profit records .
Remember this BN story from May ?
Goldman Sachs ’s $ 100 Million Trading Days Hit Record Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reaped more than $ 100 million in trading revenue on a record 34 separate days during the first three months of 2009 , up from the previous peak of 28 in last year ’s first quarter .
The first - quarter number was almost double the total for all of 2005 .
Zero Hedge : Citadel Joins the Program Trading Industrial Espionage Fray , Sues Malyshev
And Teza
The gloves are now completely off in the escalating program trading fiasco that was started by Goldman 's former Sergey Aleynikov .
Oddly , while Zero Hedge was fully expecting the Teza injunction to come from Goldman , it seems Griffin was more than happy to burden himself with that task .
Hopefully Citadel is not faced with a case of reverse discovery and forced to document the 40 % returns that it generated compliments of Malyshev when all its other groups on average lost around 50 % in 2008 .
Citadel Investment Group LLC , the $ 12 billion hedge fund firm founded by Ken Griffin , sued three former executives and the firm they founded , Teza Technologies LLC , claiming violation of noncompetition agreements .
Teza described itself in a July 6 e-mail as a “ formative ” firm that is neither trading nor investing .
Named after a river in western Russia , the Chicago - based firm was co-founded by Misha Malyshev , Jace Kohlmeier and Matt Hinerfeld .
All were named in the complaint …
Malyshev worked at Citadel for almost six years and until February was its head of high - frequency trading .
He was on the team that ran a $ 1.8 billion tactical trading fund that uses computer model to make trades every few seconds .
The fund climbed 40 percent last year , while its main funds tumbled 55 percent .
American International Group is preparing to pay millions of dollars in bonuses this month to several dozen top corporate executives after an earlier round of payments four months ago set off a national furor .

China has launched its highest - profile criticism of the dominant role of the US dollar as a global reserve currency at a meeting of the world ’s biggest economies .
Dai Bingguo , Chinese state councillor , raised the issue on Thursday when he joined the leaders of four other emerging economies for talks with the leaders of the Group of Eight industrialized nations
The Treasury Department apparently made a change in early June in the way how they compute indirect bids .
No one seems to have a definite answer as to what changed , but Indirect Bidder percentage in Treasury Auctions in June has been significantly higher in most cases , prompting the speculation by the traders of manipulation or massaging of the numbers so that the market sees high indirect bids ( considered to be the proxy for foreign interest in Treasuries ) .
Top officials in China and Russia have expressed unease about the growing U.S. budget deficit , slated for a record $ 1.75 trillion in fiscal 2009 alone .
This means that traders pay extra close attention to foreign demand figures .
The Treasury 's changes , contained in a June 1 entry to the Federal Register , relate to what it considers a " guaranteed bid . "
Under the previous arrangement , once a primary dealer offered securities at a prespecified level to its customer , that bid was considered to be the dealer 's own .
" We are not precisely sure what this all means , " said Ward McCarthy , managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton , New Jersey .
" We spoke with some very seasoned market players with decades of experience on dealer trading floors who were similarly unsure what to make of the contents of the Federal Register . "
To no one ’s surprise Fed insiders are protesting that a Congressional audit of its operations will compromise its independence .
Only the most gullible or ignorant believe the Fed has independence .
And once again we must warn that Americans are exhausting their unemployment benefits at a record rate ( 49.17 % as of 5/31 ) .

In the realm of electronic trading , systems are being fed into prop desks so traders can see all real money flows into and out of stocks and groups .
Recent revelations at Goldman Sachs show there is major automated front - running going on .
The sources for this illegal activity finding orders loaded into the system and trading against them ; and discovering and then front - running electronic orders by a penny or more by exploding the lag in execution .
Firms grabbing pennies are making billions of dollars a day .
The Street has been and is furious that the media regulators and our duly elected are not even discussing what could be the second biggest scam and abuse of our times .
The biggest is the suppression of gold and silver prices .
Worse yet , few people realize that exchanges actually pay firms to trade against order flow when they act as a “ supplementary Liquidity Provider . ”
Exchanges pay firms ¼ of a penny if they provide liquidity when an order appears in the system .
This is extra incentive to front - run order flows .
Can you imagine that this is a policy of the NYSE led by the pirates of Goldman Sachs ?

In the FDIC Friday Night Financial Follies : Bank of Wyoming , with $ 70 million of assets and $ 67 million of deposits , was closed by the state ’s Department of Audit , Division of Banking and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. was named receiver , the FDIC said today in a statement .

AIG has been talking with the Obama administration 's compensation czar , Kenneth Feinberg , about paying out about $ 235 million in bonuses , which are due to be paid on July 15 to about 400 employees in that group , according to published reports .
The Washington Post first reported the story this morning .
AIG does not actually need Feinberg 's approval to pay out the bonuses -- he has to review only payments that were contracted beginning in 2009 -- but AIG wants him to review the bonuses so as to avoid the public uproar that took place in March when AIG paid out $ 135 million in bonuses to employees of its financial products division .
The $ 235 million in bonuses was contracted in 2008 .
A firestorm of criticism surrounded AIG after it disclosed the March bonuses , causing some employees to return chunks of their payouts , with several resigning .
AIG lost $ 99 billion last year , most of which came from derivatives written by that unit .

The war over network neutrality has been fought in the last two Congresses , and last week 's introduction of the " Internet Freedom Preservation Act of 2009 " ( PDF ) means that legislators will duke it out a third time .
Should the bill pass , Internet service providers will not be able to " block , interfere with , discriminate against , impair , or degrade " access to any lawful content from any lawful application or device .
ISPs would also be forbidden to " impose a charge " on content providers that goes " beyond the end - user charges associated with providing the service to such a provider . "
In other words , AT&T does n't have to let Google " use its pipes for free , " but it can only collect the money is owed through customary peering and transit arrangements .
The bill was introduced in the House by Rep. Ed Markey ( D - MA ) — who introduced similar legislation during the last Congressional session .
During the Congressional session before that , Markey pushed network neutrality as an amendment rather than a standalone bill .
Neither method has yet been successful .
" The Internet has thrived and revolutionized business and the economy precisely because it started as an open technology , " said co-sponsor Rep. Anna Eshoo ( D - CA ) in a statement .
" This bill will ensure that the non-discriminatory framework that allows the Internet to thrive and competition on the Web to flourish is preserved at a time when our economy needs it the most . "
The bill goes out of its way to beat the " lack of competition " drum , noting that " the overwhelming majority of residential consumers subscribe to Internet access service from 1 of only 2 wireline providers : the cable operator or the telephone company . "
Given this limited choice , the bill warns that ISPs " have an economic interest to discriminate in favor of their own services , content , and applications and against other providers . "
And thus ... this bill , which defines US policy as anti-discrimination and pro-capacity upgrades , even for " applications and services that require substantial downstream and upstream bandwidth . "
Rulemaking and enforcement of network neutrality would be given to the Federal Communications Commission , which would also be given the unenviable job of hashing out what constitutes " reasonable network management " — something explicitly allowed by the bill .
Such management must be " narrowly tailored " and the techniques used must be " the least restrictive , least discriminatory , and least constricting of consumer choice available . "
Detailed rules are left to the FCC .
Neutrality would also not apply to the access and transfer of unlawful information , including " theft of content , " so a mythical deep packet inspection device that could block illegal P2P transfers with 100 percent accuracy would still be allowed .
If enacted , the bill would allow any US Internet user to file a neutrality complaint with the FCC and receive a ruling within 90 days .
If an ISP is found to be in violation , damages may have to be paid to " the complaining party , " which sounds like an excellent way to deputize Internet users into probing their ISPs for discriminatory practices .
Markey 's last two attempts at pushing network neutrality have faltered , but with a new president and new FCC chair in place — and both open to the concept — the idea 's political fortunes may have shifted as well .
That 's certainly the hope of Free Press , the media reform group that spearheaded the fight against Comcast 's P2P throttling technique last year .
" An army of lobbyists has been unleashed by the phone and cable companies to kill Net Neutrality so they can become the Internet ’s gatekeepers , " said Policy Director Ben Scott .
" But the momentum is shifting in the public ’s favor .
President Obama has repeatedly called for Net Neutrality ; we have a new pro-Net Neutrality chairman now heading the Federal Communications Commission ; and popular support is growing every day . "
So Nokia 's got a 10 - incher with built - in 3G and A - GPS ( Ovi Maps ) in the works .
Interesting , but will it be just - another - netbook ?
I 'd love to see a Nokia touch - screen interface on top of Windows .
What about easy tethering with cell phones ?

Having some sort of tie - in with Nokia handsets ( while not excluding everyone else ) is n't a must , but it'd be nice , right ?
We 'll have to wait and see .
Here 's what we do know :
It 'll be " HD ready " and have an Atom processor — hopefully that means Nvidia Ion - based .
It will also have Wi-Fi , HDMI , and an SD Card reader .
With a 12 hour battery and weight of 2.75 pounds , there 's some massive potential here , if only on paper .

Problem is we wo n't know more about its flavor of Windows - or any other specs and pricing - until Nokia World on September 2 .
Stay tuned .

As I said in April , the whole point of the “ tea parties ” was to astroturf a movement into existence that could be used to attack progressive legislation .
Republicans think they can beat health care reform with loud noises and a three - part plan for disruption at town halls :
The strategy may be working as theatre , but not as intimidation .
Lloyd Doggett was positive and undeterred on NPR this morning .
Senator Arlen Specter ( ?- PA ) also dealt with disruption at a town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius :
They yelled , shouted and jeered , and it was clear that they were not there to participate , but instead to try to disrupt the meeting and make it difficult as possible for anyone else to ask questions .
They jeered from the moment the director of the Constitution Center stood to welcome everyone .
For a few days leading up to the town meeting , e-mails circulated around Philadelphia warning that the “ tea - baggers ” were planning to protest the meeting and , although there were fewer of them than there were supporters –they made more noise shouting about “ socialism , ” “ abortion , ” and “ assisted suicide . ” ( Emphasis mine )
Denise Dennis reported from the scene
The tactics did n’t work any better in Pennsylvania than they did in Texas :
When an angry woman approached the microphone and complained that health care reform would lead to “ rationed care , ” Secretary Sebelius said emphatically , “ Rationed care is absolutely not something we condone , ” and explained that today health care is “ rationed everyday for people who do not have coverage . ”
To emotionally charged questions about abortion and assisted suicide , Sebelius calmly answered , “ Abortion and assisted suicide are not a part of the legislation . ” ( Emphasis mine )
The Achilles Heel of the “ noise strategy ” is a Republican Party that ’s woefully out - of - touch .
The noise is a mask for their helpless idiocy when it comes to details :
For anyone who has driven over the incredible Hoover Dam , you know the process can be a little tedious .
Your car first cuts back and forth * down * to the dam , then across , then cuts back and forth * back up * the other side ... all in snail 's - pace traffic , and all in 118 - degree heat .
I still laugh thinking about how my friend Dave Scales and I once got into a huge argument in that gridlock and heat , arguing about biofuels or presidential history or some such thing that you only argue about in extreme heat .
But !
That ridiculous argument need n't have happened , had we been driving over the Hoover Dam in 2010 .

Sarah Palin ’s spokeswoman Saturday took the unusual step of posting a statement on Facebook denying an anonymous blog report that the former Alaska governor was getting a divorce and moving to Montana .
“ Yet again , some so - called journalists have decided to make up a story , ” wrote Meg Stapleton on Palin ’s Facebook page .
“ There is no truth to the recent ‘ story ’ ( and story is the correct term for this type of fiction ) that the Palins are divorcing .
The Palins remain married , committed to each other and their family , and have not purchased land in Montana ( last week it was reported to be Long Island ) . ”
Actually , no journalists had reported the allegations .
They were made on an Alaskan blog called “ The Immoral Minority , ” and then repeated on other blogs , including Gawker , a well - trafficked New York gossip site .
The author of " The Immoral Majority " only goes by “ Gryphen ” and says on his blog that he ’s a 49 - year - old male in Anchorage .
He did n’t respond to an email message sent to the Yahoo account listed on the blog asking for his name .
By having her spokeswoman repeat the charges to rebut them in a public form , Palin effectively guaranteed coverage from the mainstream media that otherwise would not report claims attributed to unnamed sources on an anonymous blog .
Last month , just after announcing that she would resign , Palin similarly had her attorney issue a stinging letter threatening news organizations with defamation lawsuits if they reported on blog rumors that she was facing federal indictment .
In doing so , Palin ’s attorney recounted in detail the issue at the center of the accusations – that as Wasilla mayor she embezzled money from the construction of a town sports arena .
Until the letter , the rumor had been confined to blogs .
( Justice Department officials subsequently said there was no investigation ) .
Going public with denials of these sort of charges may represent an odd sort of preemptive defense .
But conflating such allegations by political opponents with the reporting of the mainstream media also endears Palin to her conservative base , as reflected in the comments below Stapleton ’s Facebook post .
“ The liberal media should be so ashamed of their lies ! , ” wrote an admirer .
Palin has railed against the media since she was selected to run for vice president on the GOP ticket last year and has ratcheted up her rhetoric since deciding to quit .
She bemoaned press coverage both in announcing that she would resign and in the speech she gave last Sunday when she actually stepped down , saying that freedom of the press was an important American right , that soldiers had died to protect .
“ So , how about , in honor of the American soldier , you quit making things up , ” Palin added , in a remark aimed at the press .
AURORA , Colorado ( CNN ) --
One of three men charged with lying to federal agents during a terrorism probe warned a co-defendant that their phone call was being monitored , according to court papers .
Najibullah Zazi is accused of making false statements to officials about an alleged bomb plot in the United States .
FBI agents included what they said was a transcript of the intercepted call in affidavits supporting the charges against Najibullah Zazi , his father Mohammed Wali Zazi and Ahmad Wais Afzali .
All three face court appearances Monday in a case that the Justice Department said stretches from Colorado and New York to Pakistan .
" I was exposed to something yesterday from the authorities , " Afzali told Najibullah Zazi in a September 11 call .
" And they came to ask me about your characters .
They asked me about you guys ... I told them that they are innocent , law - abiding . "
Afzali said , however , called the questions from police " a good sign . "
" The bad sign is for them coming to you guys and picking you up automatically , " he said .
And he told the younger Zazi , " Do n't get into the Afghanistan garbage , Iraq garbage ...
Listen , our phone call is being monitored . "
Watch Zazi being taken into custody by FBI agents »
The probe emerged after a series of raids in Queens last Monday , three days after the intercepted phone calls .
A police stop of Najibullah Zazi during a visit to New York had raised investigators ' concern that he would discover he was under surveillance , a former counterterrorism official familiar with the investigation told CNN last week .
Najibullah Zazi , who spent three days being questioned by FBI agents last week , and his father were arrested Saturday night in the Denver , Colorado , suburb of Aurora , the Justice Department said .
Zazi , 24 , and his 53 - year - old father are expected to make their first appearance in a Colorado federal court Monday , while Afzali , 37 , is scheduled to appear in a New York court the same day .
Watch why authorities wanted to talk with Zazi »
All three are originally from Afghanistan .
Muhammed Wali Zazi is a naturalized U.S. citizen , while Afzali and Najibullah Zazi are permanent legal residents .
If convicted , each faces eight years in prison .
The Zazis and Afzali , a Muslim cleric and funeral director from the New York borough of Queens , are among several people under investigation as part of a plot to detonate bombs in the United States , according to the Justice Department .
However , federal agents have " no specific information regarding the timing , location or target of any planned attack , " David Kris , the assistant attorney general for national security , said in a statement announcing the arrests Saturday night .
At the Queens residence where Najibullah Zazi stayed during his visit , FBI agents seized a black scale containing several AA batteries .
Zazi 's fingerprints were on both , the criminal complaint against him said .
And agents searched his rental car and laptop computer while he was there , turning up what they said were handwritten notes of his explaining how to make , handle and detonate explosives , according to the affidavit .
Both Najibullah Zazi and his attorney denied reports that bomb - making instructions were stored on the suspect 's computer .
That denial makes up the heart of the charge against him .
Afzali is accused of tipping off the father and son that investigators had approached him for information about them .
The criminal complaint against Afzali said he falsely asserted that he never told Zazi that agents were monitoring him on the phone , nor did he ask Zazi about evidence in his rental car .
And Muhammed Wali Zazi told investigators that he had not called , nor had he received a call , from anyone in New York asking him about his son 's activities .
He also said he did not know anyone named Afzali -- despite recorded phone calls that showed he did , the FBI stated .
An FBI handwriting expert determined the handwriting in the photographed document was similar to Najibullah Zazi's , according to the complaint .
But during an interview with investigators Wednesday , he denied seeing the instructions and said that if it was found on his computer , he must have unintentionally downloaded it as part of a religious book .
He said he deleted the book within days after he realized that its contents discussed a holy war , investigators said .
Authorities said he gave three days of interviews with the FBI as part of a proffer agreement -- a written understanding that allows a person to provide information about a possible crime without his words being used against him at trial .
During those interviews , investigators said Najibullah Zazi admitted he attended courses and received instructions on weapons and explosives at an al Qaeda training facility in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan during a 2008 trip there .
But Arthur Folsom , Zazi 's attorney , denied those claims .
And a source familiar with the investigation told CNN that no plea deal or proffer was made to Najibullah Zazi during his questioning .
The plot may have been targeting a major transportation center , like a large railroad or subway station , sources close to the investigation told CNN on Thursday .
There were plans for an attack , presumably in the New York area , where crowds are large and security screening for nonairport travelers is lax , the sources said .
Two sources familiar with the investigation said the younger Zazi had video of New York 's Grand Central Terminal , a massive junction of rail and subway lines , as well as shops and restaurants , which see an average of more than a half million visitors per day .
Speaking at an appearance with Mayor Michael Bloomberg , New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said the investigation " is only just beginning . "
And Bloomberg said the investigation is a reminder " that terrorism has n't gone away . "
" I feel safe walking the streets , " he said .
" I feel safe having my kids live here .
But that 's only because we keep our professionals trained and funded and up to strengths necessary to do the best jobs we can to protect us all . "
Najibullah Zazi left the United States for Peshawar , in northwestern Pakistan , in August 2008 and returned home the following January , according to affidavits .
Peshawar is the capital of the North West Frontier Province , which intelligence analysts say is a haven for Islamic militants who have launched attacks inside Pakistan and targeted U.S. forces in neighboring Afghanistan .
Zazi , a limousine driver for a Denver - area company , told The Denver Post he made trips to Pakistan to visit his wife .
CNN 's Kathleen Johnston and Alona Rivord contributed to this report .

Communism is dead .
Al - Qaida is n't as scary as it used to be .
But an American rightwing without a bogeyman to fear can't long survive .
Enter Acorn – the Association of Community Organisations for Reform Now .
Finally , something for the Republican party to use to stoke fear among its constituency .
Acorn is perfect .
The nationwide community group is full of scary black and poor people – who tend to support the Democrats .
And , most convenient of all , it registers millions of them , legally , to vote in US elections .
Spooky .
Stop Acorn , and you can stop the rise of citizen democracy altogether – you know , " government of the people , by the people , for the people " , as we used to like to say here in the US .
Or so the Republicans have convinced themselves .
Acorn has long been a target for Republicans , who have attempted to tar and feather it with accusations of " voter fraud " .
They pilloried the group before the 2008 election ( and several elections prior ) when names like Mickey Mouse , Donald Duck and Mary Poppins showed up on a handful of voter registration forms collected by Acorn .
( Never mind the fact that none of these fictional characters actually voted and that Acorn itself flagged the fraudulent registration forms and turned them in to election officials , as required by law . )
The Bush administration 's own department of justice was found to have been illegally helping to target the group for political prosecutions and even John McCain , before receiving his talking points , had keynoted an Acorn convention , declaring the group is " what makes American special " .
Oops .
But now the vilification of Acorn is in full swing again .
A couple of rightwing operatives , acting as a prostitute and her pimp , caught a few , dumb , low - level Acorn employees suggesting ways in which they could get around US law and avoid paying taxes on her " business " .
Acorn immediately fired the employees , of course , after the videotapes were made public .
But that has n't stopped Republican opportunists , led by Fox News , from calling for the entire organisation 's destruction .
The point of the demonising is to shut down their effective voter registration operation and , in the bargain , further the Republican push for state - issued photo ID requirements at polling places , even as they know full - well that some 20 to 30 million Americans – mostly urban , elderly , minority and student ( read : Democratic - leaning ) – voters do n't have such IDs and would not be allowed to exercise their legal franchise .
In fact , though you 're unlikely to hear about it on Fox News , Republicans themselves regularly engage in actual instances of voter fraud .
Superstar Republican pundit Ann Coulter narrowly avoided felony voter fraud charges in Florida and is being investigated for voter fraud in Connecticut .
The head of the California Republican party 's own voter registration firm , Mark Anthony Jacoby of Young Political Majors ( YPM ) , plead guilty to charges of voter registration fraud earlier this year .
Republican outfits like YPM have actually changed registration forms from Democratic to Republican without telling voters , and even shredded Democratic registration forms altogether , disenfranchising thousands of Americans .
It 's funny how when the American government itself – at its absolute highest - levels – was discovered to have tortured and abused prisoners at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere , resulting in actual death , the very same wingnut apologists write it off as the act of a few low - level " bad apples " .
No accountability for those who actually instituted the policies .
But when a few actual low - level bad apples – who happen to be African - American , and working for a group fighting for the American Dream for all Americans – commit petty stupidity , the entire organisation must be brought down in order to save the country .
And Democrats , as weak - kneed and foolish as they are , can't seem to come up with the courage to fight back .
Bloomberg
TIM GEITHNER , the treasury secretary ( left ) , has made overhauling finance a priority .
Instead he faces delay .
America has four federal bank regulators , including the Federal Reserve .
Mr Geithner wants to increase the power of the Fed to oversee not just banks and their holding companies but any firm that might imperil the financial system .
At the same time the Fed and the three other regulators would cede their consumer - protection duties to a new body .
Many in Congress are sceptical of making the Fed more powerful .
They say it did too little to monitor banks ' behaviour in the lead - up to the crisis .
Chris Dodd , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , has now proposed merging the bank regulators into a single agency , stripping the Fed of its supervisory duties .
This makes sense : the current set - up encourages banks to shop around for supervisors .
But the proposal will be fought by regulators and by small banks which fear that big banks would capture the new agency .
Mr Geithner has also proposed compelling banks to offer “ plain vanilla ” products , such as no-frills credit cards .
In the face of stiff opposition by bankers , Barney Frank , Mr Dodd 's counterpart in the House of Representatives , says he will not pursue this idea .
While Congress fiddles , the Fed is expanding its reach .
It plans to supervise bankers ' pay practices more closely , as well as the “ non- bank ” lending subsidiaries of bank - holding companies .
It may even use existing powers to limit banks ' positions in complex derivatives , says Karen Petrou , a consultant .
Medical journal Epilepsy and Behavior has a curious case study of a female patient who had the experience of changing sex when she had a seizure .
The patient in question had a small tumour near the right amygdala and showed abnormal right temporal lobe activity on an EEG .
Interestingly , when she had the experience of changing sex , she also experienced other females in the vicinity as also transforming into males .
She experienced a sensation of dull nausea rising from the epigastrium [ abdomen ] with concomitant fear , sometimes also accompanied by d√©j√† vu , in isolation , several times per week .
Occasionally this developed into a complex alteration of perception , which she explained as follows : ‚ ÄùI ‚Äôm no longer feeling to be a female .
I have the impression to transform into a male .
My voice , for example , sounds like a male voice that moment .
One time , when I looked down to my arms during this episode , these looked like male arms including male hair growth .
‚Äù
This particular kind of perceptual disturbance was not restricted to herself , but also characterized her perception of female persons nearby during the episode : ‚ Äú One time another woman , a friend of mine , was in the same room , I perceived also her as becoming a male person including changing sound of her voice .
‚Äù After introduction of anticonvulsive treatment with carbamazepine , only the elementary simple - partial phenomena of epigastric aura and d√©j√† vu persisted .
Secondary generalized tonic ‚Äìclonic seizures never occurred .
Sex change delusions have been reported in the medical literature before , but usually in longer - term psychoses in people with diagnoses like schizophrenia , rather than occurring as a short - term effect of a seizure .
In fact , sex change delusions were reported by one of the most famous psychiatric patients in history : Daniel Schreber , a 19th century German judge who wrote about his experience of insanity in his book Memoirs of My Nervous Illness .
Among other experiences he describes how he believed that his mind was attracting ‘ rays ’ from God causing him feminising sensations of ‘ voluptuousness ’ which he noticed as female body changes .
Temporary sex change ‘ delusions ’ have also been created using hypnosis in highly hypnotisable people in two remarkable studies that attempt to understand how the mind justifies a belief clearly contrary to reality .

Last Sunday , Terry Childs , a network administrator employed by the City of San Francisco , was arrested and taken into custody , charged with four counts of computer tampering .
He remains in jail , held on $ 5 million bail .
News reports have depicted a rogue admin taking a network hostage for reasons unknown , but new information from a source close to the situation presents a different picture .
In posts to my blog , I postulated about what might have occurred .
Based on the small amount of public information , I guessed that the situation revolved around the network itself , not the data or the servers .
A quote from a city official that Cisco was getting involved seemed to back that up , so I assumed that Childs must have locked down the routers and switches that form the FiberWAN network , and nobody but Childs knew the logins .
If this were true , then regaining control over those network components would cause some service disruption , but would hardly constitute the " millions of dollars in damages " that city representatives feared .
Apparently , I was n’t far off the mark .
In response to one of by blog posts , a source with direct knowledge of the City of San Francisco ’s IT infrastructure and of Childs himself offered to tell me everything he knew about the situation , under condition that he remain anonymous .
I agreed , and within an hour , a long e-mail arrived in my in box , painting a very detailed picture of the events .
Based on this information , the case of Terry Childs appears to be much more – and much less – than previously reported .
A man and his network
It seems that Terry Childs is a very intelligent man .
According to my source , Childs holds a Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert certification , the highest level of certification offered by Cisco .
He has worked in the city ’s IT department for five years , and during that time has become simply indispensable .
Although Childs was not the head architect for the city ’s FiberWAN network , he is the one -- and only one -- that built the network , and was tasked with handling most of the implementation , including the acquisition , configuration , and installation of all the routers and switches that comprise the network .
According to my source 's e-mail , his purview extended only to the network and had nothing to do with servers , databases , or applications :
“ Terry 's area of responsibility was purely network .
As far as I know ( which admittedly is not very far ) , he did not work on servers , except maybe VoIP servers , AAA servers , and similar things directly related to the administration of the network .
My suspicion is that you are right about how he was ' monitoring e-mail ' ; it was probably via a sniffer , IPS , or possibly a spam - filtering / antivirus appliance .
But that 's just conjecture on my part . ”
Like many network administrators who work in the rarified air of enterprise network architecture and administration , Childs apparently trusted no one but himself with the details of the network , including routing configuration and login information .
Again , from the source 's e-mail :
“ The routing configuration of the FiberWAN is extremely complex .
Probably more so than it ought to be ; I sometimes got the feeling that , in order to maintain more centralized control over the routing structure , [ Childs ] bent some of the rules of MPLS networks and caused problems for himself in terms of maintaining the routing .
“ Because the system was so complex ( and also because he did n't involve any of the other network engineers in his unit ) , Terry was the only person who fully understood the FiberWAN configuration .
Therefore , to prevent inadvertent disruption of this admittedly critical network , he locked everyone else out .
I know most of the networking equipment … does use centralized AAA , but I get the impression he may have configured the FiberWAN equipment for local authentication only . ”
Childs ' attitude toward other administrators is by no means unusual in the IT industry .
This is generally due to the fact that admins who are tasked with constructing and maintaining networks of this size and scope care for them like children , and eventually come to believe that no one else could have the knowledge and skills to touch the delicate configurations that form the heart of the network .
Sole administrator
A key point made in the e-mail is that Childs ' managers and coworkers all knew that he was the only person with administrative access to the network .
In fact , it was apparently known and accepted in many levels of the San Francisco IT department .
Again , quoting from the e-mail :
“ This is where it gets tricky for the prosecution , IMO , because the localized authentication , with Terry as sole administrator , has been in place for months , if not years .
His coworkers knew it ( my coworkers and I were told many times by Terry 's coworkers , ' If your request has anything to do with the FiberWAN , it 'll have to wait for Terry .
He 's the only one with access to those routers ' ) .
His managers knew it .
" Other network engineers for the other departments of the City knew it .
And everyone more or less accepted it .
" No one wanted the thing to come crashing down because some other network admin put a static route in there and caused a black hole ; on the other hand , some of us did ask ourselves , ' What if Terry gets hit by a truck ? '
If a configuration is known and accepted , is that ' tampering ' ? ”
My source appears to believe that Childs ' motivation was the antithesis of tampering , and that Childs did everything possible to maintain the integrity of the network , perhaps to a fault :
“ He 's very controlling of his networks -- especially the FiberWAN .
In an MPLS setup , you have ' provider edge ' ( PE ) routers and ' customer edge ' ( CE ) routers .
He controlled both PE and CE , even though our department was the customer ; we were only allowed to connect our routers to his CE routers , so we had to extend our routing tables into his equipment and vice versa , rather than tunneling our routing through the MPLS system . ”
Dedicated engineer
Like so many other high - level network administrators , Childs seems to have taken his job extremely seriously , to the point of arrogance and , perhaps , burnout .
“ Terry was very dedicated to his career as an engineer .
He is a CCIE ( probably the only one in the City government ) , and spent much of his free time studying and learning more -- the MPLS for the FiberWAN , VoIP some of the departments are rolling out , other new technologies for our 311 and E911 systems , etc .
He worked very hard , evenings and weekends in addition to full - time 8 - 5 work , and rarely took vacations .
His classification is ' professional , ' so he does n't earn overtime pay , only comp time -- which like many of us he never really had the opportunity to use .
He was on standby more or less 24 - 7 - 365 ; whereas in the private sector , in a company of 20,000 or more employees , you 'd expect to find multiple engineers rotating that standby status , I 'm pretty sure he was always the guy on call . ”
This attitude is , again , not uncommon among high - level IT administrators .
Neither is the fact that they tend to eschew what they perceive to be unnecessary questioning and bureaucratic “ nonsense . ”
“ Terry also , obviously , had a terrible relationship with his superiors .
I should point out that he's not just a network engineer -- he was the lead network engineer for the entire City .
His bosses were all managerial rather than technical , and while the other engineers did not actually report to Terry , they did defer to him in any technical matters .
Even the network architect left it to Terry to actually figure out implementation .
Terry felt that his direct superior was intrusive , incompetent , and obstructive , and that the managers above him had no real idea of what was going on , and were more interested in office politics than in getting anything done .
" [ Childs ] complained that they spent more time doing paperwork -- change requests , documentation , etc. -- than actually implementing or fixing anything ( a common complaint among engineers , I know ) .
He complained about being overworked ( which he was , and which his colleagues are even more now ) and that many of his colleagues were incompetent freeloaders ( also not entirely without basis ) .
" You could see him getting red in the face whenever he started talking about his department .
And once you were on Terry 's bad side ( which thankfully I never was ) , that 's where you stayed , and you 'd get only the most grudging assistance from him from then on .
Whether any of his complaints were valid or not , I can't really say , but I do n't think that 's as relevant as how Terry felt . ”
Keys to the kingdom
If Childs ' sole proprietorship of the FiberWAN network was normal operating procedure , how did the tensions between Childs and his managers come to a head ?
Why was Childs arrested on Sunday ?
There have been reports that the city ’s newly hired head of security may have pushed for Childs to open the FiberWAN doors to other admins .
My source does n’t know for sure , but offers some insight :
“ I do n't know much about his actions in the last few weeks .
It 's been a couple of months , at least , since I 've even spoken to him , and even then it was probably only in reference to some specific request or ticket .
But I can imagine that being the subject of disciplinary action by his supervisors for ' performance ' issues would be absolutely infuriating to him .
I can imagine that his response would be , ' How can you say my performance is poor when I 've been doing what no one else here was willing or able enough to do ? ' "
If Childs was pressured to give up the keys to the network that he had built and tended for so long , would he go so far as to explicitly prevent anyone else from tinkering with his charge ?
“ I can imagine that [ Childs ' ] response to a demand to open up authentication to the FiberWAN would be , ' Why ?
So you can screw it up and bring the City network crashing to a halt ? '
I can even imagine that , under so much pressure , he'd take steps ( deleting or hiding config backups , for instance ) to make sure he was the only one in control . ”
These tales offer significant insight into what may have occurred between Childs and the FiberWAN network hostage situation .
Rather than a case of a rogue administrator attempting to cause damage to the network by locking out other administrators , this may be a case of an overprotective admin who believed he was protecting the network – and by extension , the city – from other administrators whom he considered inferior , and perhaps even dangerous .
One important fact seems to be in Childs ' favor , if reports that the network has continued to run smoothly since his arrest are true .
My source corroborates this .
“ As for the impact of [ Childs ' ] actions to the rest of the City , the mayor 's statement basically has it right .
The network is completely up and running .
No servers that I 'm aware of are affected .
No one has had any downtime ( yet ) .
But until they get back into those routers , they can't make any changes .
I do n't know yet if Terry 's lockout applies only to the FiberWAN or also to the other routers , firewalls , switches , etc. in the City network . ”
Laying the blame
My source does n’t appear to harbor any ill will toward Childs for this situation , and even believes that the city may be worse off with Childs out of the picture and that some of the blame should be shouldered by Childs ' superiors .
“ It 's a real shame .
The city is losing a good network engineer -- probably the best , technically , that they 've ever had .
Ultimately he has no one to blame but himself , but it 's too bad his superiors were n't better about establishing and enforcing policies about authentication , backups , auditing , cross-training , and separation / rotation of duties .
" You 'll note the papers have referred to the new information security manager .
It 's only been a month or so since the City even had an information security policy , and even that is a bare , unmodified template from CCISDA that 's awaiting discussion and alteration by a committee that has n't been formed yet .
( When I asked Terry if we could get a copy of the City 's network security policy some months ago , he told me , ' I 've been trying to get them to approve one for years .
I 've written ones up and submitted them , but they do n't want to do it , because they do n't want to be held to it . ' ) ”
He also points out that by forcing the issue , the city may have significantly reduced its ability to use and control its own network .
“ The one impact they have n't mentioned is that Terry was one of only two engineers assigned to special projects and to do major routing changes and perimeter firewall configuration .
The service level , even after they regain control of the network , is going to be way down , until they can fill his mighty big shoes . ”
My source had many good things to say about Childs , but did not shy from negative comments , noting that Childs has a bad temper and can be very defensive .
“ As for Terry 's character , I can imagine this happening .
He takes great personal and professional pride in his work -- to a fault .
He can be very defensive if someone suggests there 's something wrong with the way his network is set up , and that 's been a problem for us ( as his customer ) a couple of times .
Terry has a bad temper .
" He 's the sort of person who , while his bile is up , wo n't budge an inch – and then will call you a couple of hours later and acknowledge that maybe your suggestion was right , after all , or maybe here 's an even better way to handle things . ”
La strategia
Ghedini : il Cavaliere spiegherà
che non è impotente
Il legale di Berlusconi : la controparte dimostri il contrario .
Frasi che offendono , per questo vogliamo andare in Tribunale
ROMA — « Senta , scusi : ma se io ora dicessi che lei è un gran porco ?
Eh ?
Un gran porco e , per giunta , impotente ?
E lo dicessi a tutti gli italiani ?
Mi risponda sinceramente : si arrabbierebbe o no ? » .
Niccolo Ghedini ( Eidon ) Avvocato Ghedini , è libero di dire ciò che vuole .
Per altro , io sono un cronista del Corriere , non sono il premier di questo Paese .
« Guardi , mi creda : stavolta ci siamo mossi per una pura questione di principio .
Un giornale , vale a dire l'Unità , non può scrivere che una persona è impotente , è un maiale , senza aspettarsi che poi la persona accusata si dispiaccia , e reagisca » .
( Niccolò Ghedini , deputato della Repubblica per il Pdl e avvocato personale di Silvio Berlusconi è , come sempre , rapido , con soprassalti di insospettabile ironia ) .
Va bene , lei dice che chiedete due milioni di risarcimento danni all '
Unità per una questione di principio : solo che ora tutti , e non solo noi , ma anche Libero e il Giornale , siamo qui , ancora costretti a parlare di certi presunti problemi sessuali del Cavaliere .
« È stata l'Unità a tirar fuori i problemi di erezione di Berlusconi » .
Ma perché , ce li ha ?
« Cosaaa ? Scherza ? » .
Comunque , l'opinione pubblica , tornata dalle vacanze , quasi se ne era dimenticata .
Ora invece con la vostra azione legale ...
« L' Unità ha passato il limite .
L'avvocato Fabio Lepri , citando gli articoli , è piuttosto preciso ... » .
Molto .
Riportando il contenuto di alcuni articoli scrive che « si spazia da " rapporti anali non graditi " , a " ore e ore di tormenti in attesa di una erezione che non fa capolino " » .
« Sì , sono queste alcune delle frasi che offendono il premier » .
Avvocato , scusi la brutalità : ma in aula il punto sarà fisico , e non politico .
« Può essere più chiaro ? » .
Bisognerà accertare se Berlusconi è potente , come lui lascia intendere quasi ad ogni comizio , o impotente .
« Ho capito .
Vuol sapere se noi dovremo fornire prove ?
No , noi assolutamente no .
La controparte , semmai , se crede ... » .
Ci sono così tante ragazze che dicono di aver frequentato Villa Certosa e Palazzo Grazioli ... « Vedremo . Vedremo in aula cosa riusciranno a dimostrare » .
In aula ci sarà Berlusconi ?
« Se il giudice lo riterrà opportuno , sì .
Il rito civile , di fatto , non impone la sua presenza » .
Ma poniamo che il giudice voglia ascoltarlo : Berlusconi dovrà spiegare se , davvero , come scritto dal direttore dell ' Unità , Concita De Gregorio , che riporta una frase della comica Luciana Littizzetto , « egli pratichi iniezioni nel corpo cavernoso che trasformano in una stecca da biliardo ... ».
« Vedo che anche lei è piuttosto affascinato da queste immaginarie iniezioni sul ... eh ? » .
Su questo argomento avete chiesto due milioni di euro di danni a un giornale .
Un po ' di curiosità , ammetterà , è legittima .
« Mah ... comunque , se è questo che vuol sapere , Berlusconi è pronto ad andare in aula a spiegare che non solo non è un gran porco , ma nemmeno impotente » .
Va bene , ha risposto a tutte le domande .
Ma io , se permette , insisto : davvero è convinto che questa citazione per danni sia stata una buona mossa ?
« Vede , non tutto è frutto di astuzia politica .
Ci sono anche mosse dettate dal puntiglio , dall ' orgoglio .
E perché mai , mi risponda lei , allora , perché mai Berlusconi non dovrebbe poter spiegare a venti milioni di italiani , suoi affezionati elettori , che è perfettamente funzionante ? » .
Real News Network -- On September 15 , 2009 -- Independence Day in Honduras and other Central American countries -- the National Resistance Front Against the Coup declared support for " real independence , both economic and social " .
It calls for a national assembly to rewrite the constitution .
This runs contrary to most media reports which depict the crisis in Honduras solely as a battle over the return of President Manuel Zelaya , who was ousted in a militray coup in June .
Resistance member Óscar Estrada told the Real News that after years of elections and no gains , the people of Honduras are out to fundamentally change the state .
Óscar Estrada is a filmmaker and radio producer from the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa .
He works with the Honduran organisation Arte Acción , and has written several screenplays for narrative films and documentaries .

By the National Resistance Front against the Coup
Comrades in solidarity with the Resistance ,
On behalf of the resistance in Honduras , we send combative and fraternal greetings to all those assisting us in this process of struggle for the restoration of constitutional order and for the installation of a National Constituent Assembly in Honduras .
The National Resistance Front against the Coup in Honduras calls together the first internationalist conference against the coup d'etat and for a National Constituent Assembly in Honduras .
The conference is to be held on October 8 , 9 and 10 , 2009 in Tegucigalpa , Honduras .
This conference aims to create a wider forum for discussion , to make debatable topics of international interest of social , political and economic importance and to investigate the consequences there - of , particularly in the Latin American community .
Furthermore , networks will be formed in each country , where many different organisations can integrate themselves in order to achieve more effective international solidarity , including putting the stream of information with alternative character at the service of all living forces in the region .
The transcendent importance of the internationalist ideal cannot be stressed enough at this moment , when the world is subject to a deep crisis of capitalism , which puts the lives of the people and the planet at risk .
In view of the irrationality of the system , which promotes consumerism , is dehumanising people and leads to suffering , caused by the dependence on transnational capital and the subordination of national oligarchies to the obscure interests of the imperialist policies in force in the US ( even with the change of governmental party ) , we stress the need for an international strategy to defend life and the acquired rights of peoples .
In our country , which is struggling under the shadow of a military coup , the scenario to which the ruling forces ( who control our economy ) have decided is already converted to reality , namely the revival of fascism .
Precisely for this reason it is essential that free men and women , liberals , democrats and revolutionaries put themselves at the service of the Honduran people and its resistance , to accompany them on the path to liberation .
With the help of our joint efforts we will win !
Venceremos !

The only thing that would change is that the time foreseen for international marches will be used for further discussions in working groups .
Obituary Richard Egan , the colourful and vigorous co-founder of EMC , went into a linen cupboard of his home at the Four Seasons condominiums on Boylston Street , Boston , and shot himself in the head with a shotgun on Friday , ending his fight against terminal lung cancer .
Egan had an amazing life , encompassing involvement in the Apollo space programme , the US Marines , starting and building the most successful storage company on the planet , and becoming the US ambassador to Ireland .
Finally , aged 73 and facing a lingering death , he ended the battle decisively and on his terms .
He was never a shrinking violet .
Richard ( Dick ) Egan was born in Milton , Massachusetts in 1936 , grew up in Dorchester , He has been described as a hardscrabble street kid .
US Marines
On graduating Boston Technical High School in 1953 , he joined the US Marine Corps reserves aged 17 , just before the end of the Korean War .
He became a helicopter pilot .
Dick Egan , 1936 - 2009
Three months after being assigned to active duty he was court - martialled for being absent without leave , and sentenced to forfeit pay and confinement for six months .
Five months of the confinement were suspended .
Egan was demoted to private .
Eventually he received an honourable discharge and was eligible for re-enlistment .
He chose instead to go to college .
Electrical Engineer
In 1962 , aged 26 , he graduated from Northeastern University with an Electrical Engineering degree .
Graduate work at MIT followed and Egan gained a master of science degree .
In 1963 he was a member of a team developing memory systems for NASA 's Project Apollo at the Draper Laboratory .
His work helped in the development of the Guidance Computer for real - time control of Apollo 's operations .
US astronauts travelled to the Moon in the Apollo space craft .
Egan subsequently worked for Lockheed Martin , Honeywell and Intel .
EMC
In 1979 , Egan co-founded EMC with Roger Marino - the ' E ' stands for Egan , ' M ' for Marino , and the ' C ' for corporation , maybe .
They saw that minicomputers were a growing business and that there was an opening for supplying memory expansion cards to these minicomputers .
The manufacturers sold them at high price , but Egan and Marino reckoned they could buy their own , sell them for half the minicomputer makers ' prices and still make a profit .
He and Marino sold office furniture to raise the starting cash needed for EMC .
The firm sold memory boards for Prime minicomputers , and added boards for IBM , Hewlett - Packard , Wang and Digital Equipment minis too .
The company then added the sale of hard disk drives .
Then there came the epochal shift into selling storage arrays for IBM mainframes .
The idea was to sell externally - attached storage arrays , built from commodity hard disk drives , to mainframe and server computers .
Until then the server manufacturers sold the storage needed , enjoying a captive market with customers locked into their products .
In the late eighties EMC ripped that cosy relationship apart .
The company sold better arrays for less money than the server manufacturers ' own products .
EMC sold its arrays for attachment to customers running IBM mainframes , and HP , Compaq and Sun servers , running both Windows and Unix operating systems .
The company grew rich as it won storage sales from these server companies .
EMC formed part of the Massachusetts high - tech business community , alongside mini-computer manufacturers Data General , Digital Equipment , Prime and Wang .
Mini-computers and workstations from Sun and Apollo were establishing themselves as alternatives to mainframes and green screen terminals .
The PC was about to be invented and the Internet did not exist except in nascent form .
Email was in its infancy .
EMC went public in 1987 with its shares selling for $ 21.50 .
At IPO time EMC had revenues of $ 66 m and profits of $ 18.6 m .
Four days after the IPO , on Black Monday , the price slumped to $ 16.00 .
Egan was president and CEO until 1992 , and became chairman of the board in 1998 .
EMC 's purchase of struggling mini-computer supplier Data General in 1999 gave it access to DG's Clariion array technology , which used commodity hard drives and RAID protection .
This provided EMC with its highly - successful mid-range storage products .
Users accessed EMC arrays through block - level protocols .
NetApp stepped into the network - attached storage ( NAS ) market with its appliances and built a NAS empire , EMC introduced its own Celerra NAS product line and eventually emerged as top dog in the NAS market .
In the tech boom EMC enjoyed explosive growth and the jobs it created helped Massachusetts emerge from the recession .
There were stories of aggressive leadership , hard - driving sales management and a generally macho style of running things .
The company was extraordinarily successful .
It the great bull market of the 1990s its share price rose an astounding 84,000 per cent .
Egan 's EMC involvement finished with his retirement in January 2001 as Chairman Emeritus .
He had sold most of his shares during the technology boom and was a very rich man .
Forbes magazine placed him at 285th in its list of rich Americans in 2005 , with a $ 1.3 Bn net worth .
When Egan retired , CEO Mike Ruettgers became the chairman and external hire Joe Tucci , who joined EMC in January 2000 , took over as CEO .
The Egan- Ruettgers - Tucci succession had apparently been planned for some time .
When a man in a Cartier watch stepped into the IWC Schaffhausen boutique in Beverly Hills recently , salesman Hua Huynh sprang into action .
He led the customer to a case of Aquatimers , the Swiss brand ’s line of self - winding dive watches .
“ What ’s the damage ? ” asked the customer , pointing at one model .
“ The value is $ 5,800 , ” replied Mr. Huynh .
“ Would you like to try it ? ”
Hovering nearby , Jean - Marie Brücker winced .
After ...
The Last Liberal Lion
Ted Kennedy is dead .
Expected , but somehow surprising nonetheless , as for my generation he ’s just someone who ’s always been there .
His life in the Senate was a long battle against onrushing twilight .
He may have been the last old , New Deal style liberal still in the Senate , and it was his duty to try and hold the line against what must have seemed to be an endless right wing surge of politicians who believed government ’s role was raise up the already rich and powerful and to crush under the heel the weak , poor and sick .
Many will speak of his lifelong desire to see universal health care passed , and what a pity it was that it did n’t occur before his death , but I do n’t think it was yet time .
The HELP bill , from his comitee , is nothing like his own bill , which was Medicare - for - all .
Such a bill cannot pass in this Senate , a Senate corrupted by money and steeped in conservative ideology which despises helping ordinary people .
Instead his legacy is simply that he fought the conservatives and their selfish , destructive ideology to the end of his life .
None of us want to spend our lives watching the ongoing destruction of everything we believe in , and the endless battles , so often occasioned by yet another retreat , must have been demoralizing .
Yet nonetheless he kept fighting .
If it is in defeat , rather than victory , that man is measured , then Kennedy measured up well , and always regrouped to fight another day and even won many victories .
His legacy is what remains of liberalism , which he fought for all his life .
The standard has fallen from his hands .
It will be up to others to pick it up and continue the fight he lived his life for .
If there is existence after life , I hope he will find it a time and place of renewal and hope .
Let the old lion rest , and let us hope there are young lions to take his place .
When one of your loved ones goes out of your life , you think of what he might have done for a few more years , and you wonder what you are going to do with the rest of yours .
Then one day , because there is a world to be lived in , you find yourself a part of it , trying to accomplish something –something he did not have time to do .
And , perhaps , that is the reason for it all .
I hope so .
- Joseph Kennedy , Ted Kennedy ’s father
Update : Mona Brooks has a good photo here from last year ’s convention , but what struck me more was her title “ Camelot loses another knight ” .
I would say it is more that Camelot ’s last knight has died , long after Camelot itself fell .
Of course , Camelot always falls , which only makes it more worth fighting for .
In a little village somewhere in Africa , a boy named Kirikou is born .
But he 's not a normal boy , because he knows what he wants very well .
Also he already can speak and walk .
His mother tells him how an evil sorceress has dried up their spring and devoured all males of the village except of one .
Hence little Kirikou decides , he will accompany the last warrior to the sorceress .
Due to his intrepidity he may be the last hope of the village .

Transgenderism and ObamaCare
August 10 , 2009
By Bryan Fischer Autumn Sandeen ( who is biologically a male in every cell of his body despite adopting a female name ) writes atthat it's all hokum that sex reconstructive surgery could wind up being mandated by ObamaCare , all in an effort to contradict Matt Barber 's assertion that it almost certainly will .
But as Peter LaBarbera has pointed out , the leftist Center for American Progress is already lobbying to ensure that the president explicitly adds " sex change operations to the list of medical procedures that all health insurance policies in the nation must cover .
"
In Idaho , a judge last week ordered taxpayers in the Gem State to pay for sex change hormone therapy for two inmates , even though the medical doctors and mental health professionals who evaluated these inmates concluded they were not in fact suffering from gender identity disorder .
But no matter to this arrogant , tyrannical judge who imposed his own medical and psychiatric judgment on Idaho taxpayers despite having not a single , solitary credential in either field .
Note the significance of this ruling for the current debate over ObamaCare : this took place in a single - payer , government - run health care system , which all prisons utilize .
Note too that this judge give himself complete liberty to decide what procedures will and will not be covered under government run health care .
Elected officials and taxpayers do n't want it in there ?
Fuhgedaboutit .
In this judge 's magical world , such policy decisions are no longer for elected officials , medical professionals , mental health care professionals , or even government bureaucrats to make .
Nope , says the judge , I get to decide what medical procedures poor benighted Idaho citizens have to subsidize whether it offends their moral sensibilities or not .
Now it 's obviously a very short jump from hormone therapy to surgery .
The difference is a matter of degree , not kind .
This gap can be bridged by an activist judge in a legal nanosecond without breaking a sweat in his black robe .
Sandeen goes on unwittingly to defeat his argument in two ways by calculating the cost per American to have gender reconstructive surgery included in ObamaCare .
Okay , if there 's no chance it 's going to be in there , why is he working so hard to convince us how cheap it will be ?
Sounds like he 's drumming up an argument to me .
He calculates that the cost , spread out over the entire population of the U.S. , would only be about $ 1.73 per person per year .
This is a self - defeating line of reasoning .
If that 's all it costs , why there should be plenty of compassionate , gay - friendly Americans who would happily pony up contributions to a charitable organization created to dispense vouchers to psychologically confused Americans who want to surgically mutilate themselves .
There is simply no reason to force American taxpayers who find such a procedure morally objectionable to subsidize this deviancy with their tax dollars .
According to an article in last week 's Boston Globe , the attempted suicide rate among transgendered individuals is many times higher than among the heterosexual population , certainly a reflection that the inner dissonance they live with is terribly self - destructive .
If any tax dollars are to be spent on transgenderism at all , they should be spent on reparative therapy , helping these tortured individuals reconcile their psychological identity with their biological identity .
True compassion , after all , liberates .
It does not enable . ©

More than 60 pc of TDs and senators believe corruption continues to corrode the Irish body politic , despite long - running efforts to grind out the truth
Corruption is continuing in the corridors of power , according to a confidential questionnaire of politicians .
Six out of 10 TDs and senators believe graft and payola , is alive and well , despite more than a decade of parallel tribunals into various scandals , according to new figures compiled by the University of Delaware .
More than a quarter ( 25.3 pc ) of Oireachtas members surveyed believed that " a few " of their fellow politicians are involved in corruption , according to the survey .
And 37.3 pc felt that a greater number than a few , being " some " , were cynically in politics for what they could get out of it for themselves .
Taken together , the figure indicates that 62.6 pc believe corruption continues to corrode the Irish body politic , despite long - running efforts to grind out the truth about alleged past episodes of bribery and backstairs deals .
The finding came in a broad - ranging survey by the University of Delaware of Irish legislators , a sample of among six European nations that included the Czech Republic , Netherlands , Belgium , Hungary and Slovakia .
There was a 23 pc response rate -- or 50 members of the Oireachtas -- out of 225 TDs and senators .
Just 28.2 pc thought " almost none " were involved in corruption , while a remaining 9.2 pc declined to indicate what they thought .
Yesterday , Labour TD Joanna
Tuffy confirmed she was one of the legislators that returned the questionnaire .
Honest
" I thought a few politicians in our country were involved in corruption .
I generally would believe that most politicians are honest . "
She said obvious corruption had emerged , but there had been no major changes in the law as a result .
" I would be inclined to think there is still some corruption going on even though I would hope there is not , " she said .
Speaking as one of the Oireachtas respondents , without knowing the identities of others , she said : " The majority of us replied that either ' a few ' or ' some ' were currently engaged in corruption .
" There would need to be some action on whatever recommendations come out of the tribunals for me to feel more confident that very few , if any , politicians would be involved in corruption in the future , going on our past history . "
Ms Tuffy added : " We need to reform the planning laws so that people can't make a fortune when politicians rezone land for development in future .
Because that did n't just give rise to corruption in the past , it has also wrecked our economy . "
Other countries reported lower levels of perceived possible corruption .
On a more positive note , 57 pc of Irish legislators believe that the treatment of people by public officials probably does not depend on who they know .
Meanwhile , 43 pc of TDs and senators supported tapping people 's telephones as an anti-terrorism measure , while 18 pc supported the authorities ' having a right to stop and search people on the street .
Some 16 pc of respondents felt that the security apparatus should " probably or definitely " have the right to detain people for as long as they want , without putting them on trial .
Legislators here are also split ( 38 pc vs 38 pc ) between further trade co-operation between states or the perceived need for more protectionism in the current economic crisis .
When I was browsing , I found these two photos .
Both of them are female body builder .
At the first time , I just can't shut my eyes , they are way too sexy ...
