Lucy Hotel is located at the coast of Chalkida , in the larger area of Euripus , and has been attracting distinguished guests for over half a century .
Politicians , royals , artists and other prominent personalities from Greece and abroad have been accommodated at the hotel , contributing to its unique reputation throughout the years .
The Agriculture Department has committed to buying 111.6 million pounds of milk powder at 80 cents a pound , for roughly $ 91 million , which includes some handling fees .
Before October , the last time the government bought milk powder was in June 2006 , and it was eventually used in government nutrition programs , given away as animal feed or sold on the open market , said Steve Gill , director of commodity operations for the department .
He said the agency has not decided what to do with the cache of milk powder in California .
Some critics of farm subsidies argue that price support programs are antiquated and allow farmers to continue producing even when the economics make no sense , as taxpayers will always buy up the excess production .
“ They do n’t want to downsize or respond to the market signal .
They want to keep producing , ” said Kenneth Cook , president of the Environmental Working Group , a Washington research organization that has long been critical of the government ’s farm policy .
“ Once you get in a jam like this , it becomes our collective problem . ”
The government purchases come after what the department calls a “ euphoric period of record prices and booming exports ” for the American dairy industry .
Since 2003 , dairy exports have increased from $ 1 billion a year to about $ 4 billion this year , with exports of powdered milk increasing sixfold during that period .
Milk powder is an attractive product to export because it does not require refrigeration , has a long shelf life and can be used to make numerous beverages and foods .
Much of the increase was caused by increased demand in developing countries , where a growing middle class replaced starch in their diets with protein sources like meat and dairy products .
Some Asian countries had little history of eating dairy products but were introduced to milk and mild cheeses by government nutrition programs or by restaurant chains like McDonald ’s and Pizza Hut .
In China , for instance , per-person dairy consumption nearly doubled in just five years , to 63 pounds in 2007 from 33 pounds in 2002 ( though it remains far below the per-capita consumption in the United States of about 580 pounds ) , according to the U.S. Dairy Export Council .
The growth translates into the need for nearly 40 billion pounds more milk each year , roughly equal to California ’s annual milk production .

Jeb Bush : GOP ' ca n't be the old white guy party ' David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Monday December 1 , 2008
Print This Email This Former Fla. gov says create ' a shadow government , ' focus on policy Jeb Bush says the Republican Party needs to adapt in the wake of wide - ranging defeat in the election and move beyond its traditional position as the " old white guy party . "
The former Florida governor told Newsmax correspondent Ashley Martella that Republicans should create " a shadow government " to challenge Democrats on policy grounds .
" In Washington we need to show humility and be the loyal opposition .
I actually think we need to organize ourselves in the form of a shadow government and make it based on policy and not on partisanship , " he said .
" People are sick and tired of the partisanship , just for partisan sake , but they are n't sick and tired of a loftier debate about policy . "
Bush argued that GOP positions were winners , although he noted that Florida Republicans had avoided sticking to the right 's hard - line views on issues like immigration , which alienate Hispanic voters .
" We can't be the old , white guy party , it 's not going to work , " he said .
" It means recruiting candidates that look like the population we are trying to attract to our cause , " Bush said .

It 's a strange world , but there you have it .
I 've been talking to friends of mine , former Palestinian Authority intelligence officials ( ejected from power by the Hamas coup ) , and they tell me that not only are they rooting for the Israelis to decimate Hamas , but that Fatah has actually been assisting the Israelis with targeting information .
One of my friends -- if you want to know why they 're my friends , read this book -- told me that one of his comrades was thrown off a high - rise building in Gaza City last year by Hamas , and so he sheds no tears for the Hamas dead .
" Let the Israelis kill them , " he said .

“ Best trading day in the history of Société Générale was September 11 , 2001 ″
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Friday , Jan 23rd , 2009
http://www.prisonplanet.com/rogue-trader-highlights-possible-911-and-77-insider-trading.html
According to an article in The London Times today , Société Générale rogue trader Jérôme Kerviel profited enormously on the day of the 7/7 London bombings .
He has also revealed how his company made huge profits on September 11th 2001 , prompting some to return to questions over insider foreknowledge of both terrorist attacks .
The article states :
“ The best trading day in the history of Société Générale was September 11 , 2001 , ” he said .
“ At least , that ’s what one of my managers told me .
It seems that profits were colossal that day .
“ I had a similar experience during the London attacks in July 2005 . ”
A few days earlier he had bet on a fall in the share price of Allianz , the German insurance giant , he told Le Parisien .
Everyone was losing money when the 7/7 bombings sent the insurance sector into a downward spiral “ except for me ” , he said .
“ Thanks to the positions I had , I earned € 500,000 in a few minutes .
It was the jackpot .
I was jubilant . ”
After the celebrations Mr Kerviel said he paused for thought .
“ I understood that I was having fun when people had just been hit by the bombs .
I ran to the toilet and I was sick .
But the moment of weakness did not last long .
I went back into the trading room and I returned to work . ”
Kerviel was charged almost exactly one year ago in the Société Générale trading loss incident which cost the financial services company an estimated € 4.9 billion .
Until the Bernard Madoff fraud incident last month , it was reported to be the largest fraud in banking history .
Société Générale claimed that Kerviel worked the trades alone , and without its authorization .
Kerviel told investigators that such practices are widespread and that huge profits routinely give the upper echelons of financial institutions cause to turn a blind eye .
Many questions have been raised regarding massive trades that foreshadowed the events of 9/11 , with put options placed in large quantities against American and United Airliners in the days immediately prior to the attacks .
The investigation as to who was responsible for authorizing the transactions led directly back to former CIA director Buzzy Krongard .
In the case of the London bombings , the pound fell 6 per cent against the dollar for no apparent reason in the days before the attack .
“ Currencies of established countries simply do not fall that fast based upon any kind of economic or financial analysis , ” said a 35 year veteran economist .
“ Somebody – somewhere – knew something .
Or maybe I should say ’ somebodies . ’”
It is considered that such anomalous activity betrays prior knowledge of the incidents .
We have since seen other suspicious trading incidents dovetailing with foiled terror attacks .
Specifically , in August 2006 , surrounding the infamous “ liquid bomb plot ” and one year later in August 2007 with the so - called “ Bin Laden trades ” when a mystery trader placed 245,000 put options on the Dow Jones Eurostoxx 50 index .
From WikiLeaks
By Tom Burghardt ( Antifascist Calling )
With " preemptive policing " all the rage in Washington , the whistleblowing website Wikileaks has done it again , exposing how repressive trends in the U.S. had real world consequences for democracy during September 's Republican National Convention ( RNC ) in St. Paul , Minnesota .
On November 15 , the global whistleblowers published a leaked planning document " Special Event Planning : 2008 Republican National Convention , " a dense schematic used by repressors who targeted activists , journalists and concerned citizens during the far - right conclave .
Labeled " Limited Distribution / For Official Use Only , " Wikileaks believes that the dossier is " potentially legally significant due to upcoming legal cases over the mass arrests at the convention . "
Compiled by Terri Smith ( terri.smith@state.mn.us ) the Branch Director for Response , Recovery and Mitigation at the Minnesota Homeland Security and Emergency Management agency ( HSEM ) , the 31 - page file offers a veritable bird 's - eye view onto the close coordination amongst federal , state and local law enforcement agencies , including the Pentagon's U.S. Northern Command ( NORTHCOM ) during a so - called National Special Security Event ( NSSE ) .
The enabling authority for squelching dissent during NSSEs is partially derived from the 2006 National Security Presidential Directive - 46 / Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 15 ( NSPD - 46/HSPD - 15 ) , a top secret dictate from President Bush .
According to a statement by Roger Rufe , Director of the Office of Operations Coordination and Planning ( OPS ) at the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , before the House Homeland Security Committee on July 9 , 2008 , NSSEs " are significant domestic or international events , occurrences , contests , activities , or meetings , which , by virtue of their profile or status , represent a significant target , and therefore warrant additional preparation , planning , and mitigation efforts .
The designation process for NSSEs is established by NSPD - 46 / HSPD - 15 , Annex II and HSPD - 7 . "
Rufe goes on to describe the " mission " of an NSSE Special Event Working Group ( SEWG ) as one which will
... support a unified interagency planning and coordination effort for Special Events and to ensure coordination of Federal support to the designated event .
The SEWG identifies events that may require a coordinated Federal response and collectively coordinates Federal assets to bridge any capability gaps identified by state and local partners that have not already been addressed by exhausting local mutual assistance agreements .
Within this process , the mission of OPS is to act on behalf of the Secretary and his HSPD - 5 responsibilities to integrate DHS and interagency planning and coordinate operations for designated Special Events in order to prevent , protect , respond to and recover from terrorist threats / attacks .
( Roger Rufe , " Statement , " House Homeland Security Committee , July 8 , 2008 , pp. 1 - 2 )
Several elements comprise the SEWG : five senior managers from DHS ' OPS , the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , the United States Secret Service ( USSS ) , and the DHS Office of Risk Management & Analysis ( RMA ) and , as revealed in the Wikileaks document , representatives from the Pentagon's U.S. Northern Command .
During the RNC , the " lead federal agencies " heading up repressive operations were the USSS , FBI and FEMA .
On Saturday , August 30 , 2008 , the Ramsey County Sheriff 's Department executed search warrants on three houses .
According to the Friends of the RNC 8 , the police seized personal items and arrested eight RNC Welcoming Committee organizers , charging them with " conspiracy to riot in the 2nd degree in the furtherance of terrorism , " a felony which may land these activists in prison for many years under provisions of Minnesota 's PATRIOT Act .
During the RNC , operations were coordinated by the Multi-Agency Communications Center ( MACC ) , described in the Wikileaks file as " a centralized communications and coordination center operated 24 hours a day during the NSSE . "
In St. Paul , the MACC was " staffed by representatives from all participating operational security entities , local government operations , and public and private institutions who are responsible for the critical infrastructures of power , gas and telecommunications . "
MACC's " Work Product , " according to the document ( p. 14 ) , will provide : " Timely dissemination of information to all entities participating in operational security , crisis management , and consequence management .
Provide the Common Operational Picture to support decision - making and command and control activities , " and " serve as the centralized coordination center for security - related activities . "
Described as " the coordination point where these resources could be used for a crisis or consequence outside of the NSSE , " the MACC was the organizational hub and speartip where federal , state , local law enforcement and " private institutions " interacted " at any time during the event to utilize the event 's public safety resources to assure that the normal delivery of public safety responses from their agency were uninterrupted . "
A perusal of the " MACC Seating Chart " ( p. 16 ) affords additional insight into the resources brought to bear against journalists covering the RNC and citizens protesting the crimes of the Republican party and their Bushist minions .
The first tier is comprised of the Minneapolis Police Department ( MPD ) , Minnesota Department of Transportation ( MN DOT ) , Minnesota State Police ( MSP ) , Hennepin County , Ramsey County , St. Paul Police Department ( SPPD ) , USSS and the FBI .
The second tier , in addition to representatives from the Minneapolis and St. Paul Fire Departments and Emergency Medical Service personnel , are staffed by three representatives from NORTHCOM .
Additional NORTHCOM " seats " appear on the " third tier " of the HSEM chart , along with proxies from the Minnesota National Guard 's Joint Task Force ( JTF - MN ) , FEMA , USSS and the FBI .
MACC 's fourth tier was staffed by a host of federal law enforcement entities including officers from the ultra-spooky National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency ( NGA ) .
As I have documented in several articles , most recently on November 9 , NGA provides mapping tools and imagery intelligence ( IMINT ) derived from America 's fleet of military spy satellites " flown " by the National Reconnaissance Office ( NRO ) .
In other words during the RNC , America 's spymasters were providing satellite intelligence to federal , state , and local law enforcement , some of which quite possibly , were used to target the homes of activists and media workers or coordinate attacks on demonstrations .
While there is no indication in the MACC " seating chart " that the National Security Agency ( NSA ) was directly involved in providing " lead federal agencies " with signals intelligence ( SIGINT ) , the fifth tier reveals that U.S. telecoms , all of whom are NSA private partners in warrantless wiretapping and driftnet data - mining were " present and accounted for " during the RNC .
Indeed , prominent places " at the table " were filled by Verizon Communications , Verizon Wireless , QWEST , Sprint and AT&T .
Attorneys involved in defending the RNC 8 and other protesters " preemptively " arrested , would be well - advised to subpoena these company 's records and determine whether or not corporate telecoms handed SIGINT over to federal , state and local repressors .
The Wikileaks dossier also reveals that Saint Paul Operations Center Command Posts were staffed by an entity labeled " other federal . "
Here one finds the FBI 's Joint Operations Center ( JOC ) and the Bureau 's Intelligence Operations Center ( IOC ) .
Both entities have been linked during NSSEs and the surreptitious surveillance of Americans to privacy - killing FBI " packet sniffing " operations formally called Carnivore ( DCS - 1000 ) .
Now called Red Hook or DCS - 3000 , software installed on America 's telephone , internet and wireless infrastructure can monitor all of a target 's internet , wireless and text messaging traffic .
Digital Storm , or DCS - 6000 , captures and collects the content of phone calls and text messages , while Magic Lantern is a keystroke surveillance tool that can be installed remotely via viral e-mail attachments .
Wired reported in 2007 , that Magic Lantern is a " computer and internet protocol address verifier or CIPAV , " one that
... gathers a wide range of information , including the computer 's IP address ; MAC address ; open ports ; a list of running programs ; the operating system type , version and serial number ; preferred internet browser and version ; the computer 's registered owner and registered company name ; the current logged - in user name and the last - visited URL .
The CIPAV then settles into a silent " pen register " mode , in which it lurks on the target computer and monitors its internet use , logging the IP address of every computer to which the machine connects for up to 60 days .
( Kevin Poulsen , " FBI 's Secret Spyware Tracks Down Teen Who Made Bomb Threats , " Wired , July 18 , 2007 )
According to documents released to the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) under a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit in 2007 , the Minneapolis Field Office was one of 57 sites for the Bureau 's collection of " post - cut through dialed digit information . "
Technological heavy - lifting originated from the FBI 's Science & Technology Law Unit , Engineering Research Facility located in Quantico , Virginia .
As security expert , whistleblower and CEO of Bat Blue Corporation Babak Pasdar disclosed in a sworn affidavit to the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) back in February , Verizon Communications allowed the Bureau and other security agencies virtually " unfettered " access to the carrier 's wireless network via the FBI 's so - called " Quantico circuit . "
Collectively , these highly - intrusive ( and patently illegal ) FBI programs are called DCSNet , an acronym for Digital Collection System Network .
As Wired revealed in 2007 , DCSNet " connects FBI wiretapping rooms to switches controlled by traditional land - line operators , internet - telephony providers and cellular companies .
It is is far more intricately woven into the nation 's telecom infrastructure than observers suspected . "
The profound interconnections amongst federal security agencies such as the FBI and the nation 's private telecoms acting in concert with securocrats is but one indicator of the breadth and scope of America 's high - tech corporatist police state .
Wired reports ,
The network allows an FBI agent in New York , for example , to remotely set up a wiretap on a cell phone based in Sacramento , California , and immediately learn the phone 's location , then begin receiving conversations , text messages and voicemail pass codes in New York .
With a few keystrokes , the agent can route the recordings to language specialists for translation .
The numbers dialed are automatically sent to FBI analysts trained to interpret phone - call patterns , and are transferred nightly , by external storage devices , to the bureau 's Telephone Application Database , where they 're subjected to a type of data mining called link analysis .
FBI endpoints on DCSNet have swelled over the years , from 20 " central monitoring plants " at the program 's inception , to 57 in 2005 , according to undated pages in the released documents .
By 2002 , those endpoints connected to more than 350 switches .
( Ryan Singel , " Point , Click ... Eavesdrop : How the FBI Wiretap Net Operates , " Wired , August 29 , 2007 )
Last week , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) revealed that the FBI no longer feels compelled to obtain judicial oversight or even the consent of cell phone operators when deploying base station - faking technology that it employs for the illegal geolocation of mobile users .
Known as Triggerfish , documents obtained by the ACLU in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Justice Department , detail how the technology pretends to be a cellular base station to which handsets connect and identify themselves .
By claiming to have " lost " the unique identifier of a targeted mobile phone , Triggerfish then " asks " the phone to resend its unique details .
It had been assumed that a warrant was necessary before the Bureau could begin tracking an individual 's cell phone .
However , as the ACLU clearly reveals in the documents , under provisions of the USA Patriot Act , the FBI has been able to obtain dodgy pen-trap orders from all - too - compliant judges on the FISA court .
During the RNC , these signals were probably routed via Triggerfish to the JOC / IOC : game over for " Text Mob " protest organizers .
When federal , state and local law enforcement entities raided the homes of activists and media workers in St. Paul , the Bureau knew which activists and which computers , cell phones and other electronic devices to preemptively seize .
On August 30 , 2008 , the FBI were joined by some 30 St. Paul police armed with tasers , pepper spray and automatic weapons when they surrounded the house where I - Witness Video and Democracy Now ! journalist Elizabeth Press were meeting .
People inside were forcibly detained and photographed , while police made a record of the journalists ' names and addresses .
A warrant was served , covering all the journalist 's equipment , including privileged notes , computers , cameras , video tapes and communications equipment .
Five other members of I - Witness Video who were not present during the home invasion were detained for more than three hours , preventing them from documenting three other simultaneous raids in Minneapolis and St. Paul .
Additionally , members of the Glass Bead Collective were also illegally detained and had their notes and equipment confiscated by the Minneapolis police .
The Wikileaks document also reveals that the Defense Department 's Joint Task Force Minnesota ( JTF - MN ) was a key player in the St. Paul Command Operations Center .
Indeed , Major Jon Dotterer , the Operations Officer attached to JTF - MN documented in a Power Point presentation , " As many of you may have scene [ sic ] on the news the MN National Guard was used in support of the St Paul Police Department at the Republican National Convention .
Our QRF [ Quick Reaction Force ] was used to give the local police forces the flexibility and freedom to use their assets at other critical points of interest . "
Dotterer 's briefing details how JTF - MN " coordinates with civil authorities , " primarily HSEM , and " provides [ a ] response element " and " activates for [ a ] major contingency . "
What Dotterer does n't reveal is that JTF - MN is also an active component of U.S. Northern Command .
To conclude , the Wikileaks document provides new and startling information how federal , state and local law enforcement entities acting in concert with corporatist " private partners " during September 's Republican National Convention , conspired to deny American 's their right to peacefully protest against the far - right Republican party .
With resources drawn from the FBI , USSS , DHS , NGA , FEMA and NORTHCOM , the repressive capitalist state coordinated its response to oppositional currents in the U.S. by launching preemptive attacks on RNC protest organizers and journalists .
Fully in step with the " countersubversive " mind - set underpinning the Bushist " war on terror , " one that equates dissent with terrorism , recourse to preemptive policing by our corporatist masters is indicative of the precarious state of a system facing total crisis as it stares into an abyss of its creation .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
You know the economy is in trouble when you have to go back to Herbert Hoover 's administration for an historical comparison , or when the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates to 50 - year lows , or when you run out of adjectives to describe how awful home building is .
We could see all of those in the coming week 's economic data , ( especially if I can't find my thesaurus ) .
The calendar starts off with the Fed meeting on Monday and Tuesday , and wraps up with the weekly jobless claims data on Thursday .
In between , we 'll get the latest on consumer prices , industrial production and home building .
" The week 's economic data should be lousy with stark recessionary readings across the board , " warned economists for Citigroup Global Markets .
See Economic Calendar .
The Fed
Looked at one way , the Federal Open Market Committee meeting will have all the suspense of yesterday 's newspaper .
Almost everyone expects the FOMC to cut its target for overnight interest rates from 1 % to 0.50 % , but almost no one thinks the rate cut will do much good in the current environment of fear and risk aversion .
Households and businesses are n't borrowing because interest rates are too high ; they are n't borrowing because they are afraid the recession will worsen , and because they can't get a loan from banks that are even more afraid than they are .
Looked at in a slightly different way , the Fed meeting could be an important milestone in the central bank 's history .
In a speech he gave more than six years ago , Chairman Ben Bernanke laid out all the nontraditional methods he 'll be using this year and next to fight the credit squeeze and escape from the liquidity trap .
The two - day meeting , Bernanke will try to get the rest of the committee formally on board with his strategy , which will be more and more focused on what 's called quantitative easing .
" We look for the accompanying statement to highlight that the main nexus of policy in the coming months will be quantitative easing operations , and we expect these operations to be aimed at lowering borrowing costs for households and businesses , " wrote Dean Maki , economist for Barclays Capital Management .
What exactly is " quantitative easing " ?
Simply put , it 's an attempt by the Fed to flood the financial system with so much cash that some of it will have to be lent out .
The Fed would do that by " purchasing long - term Treasuries and agency debt and possibly financing a wider range of asset - backed securities , " said economists for BMO Capital Markets .
At some point , all that loose cash would begin to be inflationary , and that 's the whole point .
The Fed is trying to avoid a sustained drop in asset prices that could leave every borrower under water .
Eventually , the Fed will have to mop up all that money , but as Bernanke said , that 's a worry for another time .
Inflation
The Fed has nothing to fear now about consumer price inflation .
On Tuesday , the Labor Department will report on the November consumer price index .
With gasoline prices falling another 30 % or so , economists surveyed by MarketWatch expect the CPI to fall 1.4 % after a 1 % drop in October .
A decline of 1.4 % would be the lowest since 1938 , and if it falls even a tenth more than expected , it would be the lowest since February 1933 , when Hoover was packing his bags to leave the White House .
If prices do drop 1.4 % in November , the increases in consumer prices over the past year would dip to 1.3 % .
By next summer , according to CIBC economist Meny Grauman , year - over - year inflation will turn negative for the first time since the mid-1950s .
Falling prices is surely good news for consumers .
But the cause of the disinflation is the global economic slump , which is certainly not good news for anyone tied to the globalized economy .
The other data
Jobless claims will be closely watched on Thursday after they hit a 26 - year high last week .
The data cover the survey week for the monthly employment report , so the initial and continuing claims data could provide an early clue about December payrolls .
Home building has fallen to the lowest levels at least since 1959 , but that does n't mean it can't fall some more .
Our survey says housing starts should drop about 7 % in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 738,000 .
That 's beyond bad .
" The housing construction freefall continues unabated , " said Citigroup economists .
" In fact , housing market indicators actually appear to have started another , steeper down leg in recent months . "
Industrial production likely fell 0.6 % in November after a 1.3 % gain in October that was largely due to a rebound from the hurricane damage of September .
Manufacturing payrolls dropped by 85,000 in November , and hours worked plunged 1.4 % , so it 's likely that output also dropped sharply .
Forward - looking indicators on the factory sectors in the New York and Philadelphia regions are likely to sink further , economists said .
" The outlook for the U.S. industrial sector is bleak , " wrote CIBC 's Grauman .
" A global economic recession means that demand is not only sluggish at home , but also abroad . "
And let 's not forget that the auto industry is hanging by a thread .
' Tis the night before Christmas and the season of goodwill .
The mood is forgiving .
Our faces warm with mulled wine , our tummies full , we 're meant to slump in the armchair , look back on the year just gone and count our blessings - woozily agreeing to put our troubles behind us .
As in families , so in the realm of public and international affairs .
And this December that feels especially true .
The " war on terror " that dominated much of the decade seems to be heading towards a kind of conclusion .
George Bush will leave office in a matter of weeks and British troops will leave Iraq a few months later .
The first , defining phase of the conflict that began on 9/11 - the war of Bush , Tony Blair and Osama bin Laden - is about to slip from the present to the past tense .
Bush and Blair will be gone , with only Bin Laden still in post .
The urge to move on is palpable .
You can sense it in the valedictory interviews Bush and Dick Cheney are conducting on their way out .
They 're looking to the verdict of history now , Cheney telling the Washington Times last week : " I myself am personally persuaded that this president and this administration will look very good 20 or 30 years down the road . "
The once raging arguments of the current era are about to fade , the lead US protagonists heading off to their respective ranches in the west , the rights and wrongs of their decisions in office to be weighed not in the hot arena of politics , but in the cool seminar rooms of the academy .
Not so fast .
Yes , the new year would get off to a more soothing start if we could all agree to draw a line and move on .
But it would be wrong .
First , because we cannot hope to avoid repeating the errors of the last eight years unless they are subject to a full accounting .
( It is for that reason Britain needs its own full , unconstrained inquiry into the Iraq war . )
Second , because a crucial principle , one that goes to the very heart of the American creed , is at stake .
And third , because this is not solely about the judgment of history .
It may be about the judgment of the courts - specifically those charged with punishing war crimes .
Less than a fortnight ago , in the news graveyard of a Friday afternoon , the armed services committee of the US Senate released a bipartisan report - with none other than John McCain as its co-author - into the American use of torture against those held in the war on terror .
It dismissed entirely the notion that the horrors of Abu Ghraib could be put down to " a few bad apples " .
Instead it laid bare , in forensic detail , the trail of memos and instructions that led directly to the then defence secretary , Donald Rumsfeld .
The report was the fruit of 18 months of work , involving some 70 interviews .
Most of it is classified , but even the 29 - page published summary makes horrifying reading .
It shows how the most senior figures in the Bush administration discussed , and sought legal fig leaves for , practices that plainly amounted to torture .
They were techniques devised in a training programme known as Survival , Evasion , Resistance and Escape or SERE , that aimed to teach elite American soldiers how to endure torture should they fall into the hands of pitiless enemies .
The SERE techniques were partly modelled on the brutal methods used by the Chinese against US prisoners during the Korean war .
Yet Rumsfeld ruled that these same techniques should be " reverse engineered " , so that Americans would learn not how to endure them - but how to inflict them .
Which they then did , at Guantánamo , Abu Ghraib and beyond .
The Senate report cites the memorandums requesting permission to use " stress positions , exploitation of detainee fears ( such as fear of dogs ) , removal of clothing , hooding , deprivation of light and sound , and the so - called wet towel treatment or the waterboard " .
We read of Mohamed al Kahtani - against whom all charges were dropped earlier this year - who was " deprived of adequate sleep for weeks on end , stripped naked , subjected to loud music , and made to wear a leash and perform dog tricks " .
Approval for this kind of torture , hidden under the euphemism of " enhanced interrogation " , was sought from and granted at the highest level .
And that does n't mean Rumsfeld .
The report 's first conclusion is that , on " 7 February 2002 , President George W Bush made a written determination that Common Article 3 of the Geneva conventions , which would have afforded minimum standards for humane treatment , did not apply to al - Qaida or Taliban detainees " .
The result , it says , is that Bush " opened the door " to the use of a raft of techniques that the US had once branded barbaric and beyond the realm of human decency .
For this Bush should surely be held to account .
And yet there is no sign that he will , and precious little agitation that he should .
A still smiling Cheney denies the Bush administration did anything wrong .
Note this breathtaking exchange with Fox News at the weekend .
He was asked : " If the president during war decides to do something to protect the country , is it legal ? "
Cheney 's answer : " General proposition , I 'd say yes . "
It takes a few seconds for the full horror of that remark to sink in .
And then you remember where you last heard something like it .
It was the now immortalised interview between David Frost and Richard Nixon .
The disgraced ex-president was asked whether there were certain situations where the president can do something illegal , if he deems it in the national interest .
Nixon 's reply : " Well , when the president does it , that means that it is not illegal . "
It is no coincidence that Cheney began his career in the Nixon White House .
He has the same Nixonian disregard for the US constitution , the same belief that executive power is absolute and unlimited - that those who wield it are above the law , domestic and international .
It is the logic of dictatorship .
But Nixon was forced from office , his vision of an unrestrained presidency rejected .
If Bush and Cheney are allowed to retire quietly , America will have failed to reassert that bedrock principle of the republic : the rule of law .
This is why there must be a reckoning .
Bush will do all he can to avoid it : and it is wholly possible that one of his last acts as president will be to cover himself , his vice - president and all his henchmen with a blanket pardon .
Even if that does not happen , Barack Obama is unlikely to want to spend precious capital pursuing his predecessor for war crimes .
But other prosecutors elsewhere in the world should weigh their responsibilities .
In the end , it was a lone Spanish magistrate , not a Chilean court , who ensured the arrest of Augusto Pinochet .
A pleasing , if uncharitable , thought this Christmas , is that Rumsfeld , Cheney and Bush will hesitate before making plans to travel abroad in 2009 .
Or indeed at any time - ever again .

Analysis
After being publicly outed issuing web credentials that were vulnerable to attacks that could allow criminals to spoof the encryption certificates of any website on the internet , VeriSign has issued assurances it has neutralized any real - world threat .
Tim Callan , vice president of VeriSign 's product marketing , has said that within hours of last week 's news that researchers had uncovered a devastating weakness in secure sockets layer certificates issued by VeriSign subsidiary RapidSSL , the company made changes to ensure all its SSL products were immune to the attacks .
As usual , the truth is a little more complicated .
To recap , an international team of researchers discovered that RapidSSL 's reliance on the MD5 algorithm to sign SSL certificates made the certification authority ( CA ) vulnerable to spoofing .
That meant that anyone with the know - how and computing power could buy an SSL certificate from the issuer , and with the flip of a few bits , generate the credentials to issue valid SSL certificates that would be accepted by Firefox , Internet Explorer , and other browsers .
It was analogous to someone acquiring a notary 's official stamp that could then be used to certify fraudulent documents .
What Callan meant was that all VeriSign SSL products issued on or after December 30 were immune to the attack .
But there 's nothing stopping anyone who might have used the attack before that date to masquerade as RapidSSL and issue counterfeit certificates for any website of their choosing ( think Bank of America , HMRC , or any other sensitive online destination ) .
Callan rightly concedes that it 's impossible to prove a negative , but he says it 's highly unlikely anyone besides the researchers has figured out how to execute the attack .
Mainly that 's because the sheer amount of brain and computing power required take the attack out of the grasp of the average internet criminal .
The attack used years ' worth of research into the shortcomings of MD5 and even then required more than a month of intense computational processing to generate a certificate that was vulnerable .
" Connecting all of these together , it certainly seems this would be an unprofitable and unappealing avenue for a criminal to pursue , " Callan told us the other day .
" With so many lucrative green fields staring at them , why are they exploiting this ? "
This line of reasoning has left some in the security world a little uneasy .
" They are betting that it took specialized knowledge to perform this attack and no one has independently exploited it before these researchers , " says Nate Lawson , principal of security consulting firm Root Labs .
" While the odds are probably good for VeriSign in this , betting the entire internet is a pretty big bet - one I would n't want to have to back up . "
To its credit , VeriSign has cryptographers in the process of investigating whether it 's possible to run previously issued certificates through some sort of collision detector that can identify any that may have been used to forge a CA certificate .
The company has also offered to replace free of charge any MD5 - hashed certificates issued before December 30 .
But no one is sure if such a collision detector is even possible , and even if it is , what if it comes too late ?
More generally , what Callan seems to gloss over is the truism VeriSign and the rest of the security community have repeated so many times that it 's become a cliche : Hacking is no longer the province of script kiddies , but rather sophisticated and well - funded criminal enterprises .
It 's hard to imagine these groups would n't spend huge amounts of money to buy the credentials that would allow them to spoof any website in the world .
If he 's correct that no one else stumbled upon the weakness the online world has dodged one hell of a bullet .
If he 's wrong and the internet suffers a crippling blow , we 'll have VeriSign to thank . ®
DALLAS –
They sang praises to a terrorist group , had telephone access to its leadership and deceived the public about their true ambitions , a federal prosecutor said Monday about the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development ( HLF ) .
Five former HLF officials are on trial for illegally routing millions of dollars in donations to Hamas through a series of Palestinian charities , known as zakat committees , that prosecutors say are controlled by the terrorist group .
In his closing argument , federal prosecutor Barry Jonas pointed to what he called the " highlights of the highlights " of the government 's six - week case .
It includes hundreds of exhibits , ranging from wiretapped telephone calls to audio and video conferences to stacks of bank records .
But the case likely hinges on whether jurors agree the zakat committees were controlled by Hamas .
Jonas pointed to instances in which some committee officials were identified as Hamas members in media interviews and by other Hamas officials .
Telephone records in evidence tied in other committee officials .
And a former HLF fundraiser testifying for the government said that the zakat committees were a part of Hamas .
It 's an assessment shared by the Palestinian Authority , Jonas noted .
The Hamas charter calls for the destruction of the state of Israel , to be replaced by a Palestinian state governed by Shariah , or Islamic law , Jonas said .
It also calls for providing charity " to everyone who is in need of it . "
Bruce Hoffman , a Georgetown University professor and terrorism expert , testified that a social wing has proven critical for successful terrorist movements throughout history .
Hamas has three branches , Jonas said , a military arm that carries out terrorist attacks , a social arm that wins hearts and minds of the population through charitable work , and a political arm that controls the money and sets policy .
Much of Jonas ' argument was spent reviewing audio and video tapes in evidence .
Rallies in which Hamas leaders appear or were praised were shown .
A skit featuring defendant Mufid Abdelqader , who performed in a band at many of these functions , ended with him pretending to strangle an actor portraying an Israeli civilian .
‘ I am Hamas o dear one , " he said on the video .
" That sums it up right there , " Jonas said .
Jonas told jurors they were not there to decide which side is right in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Nor were they to be swayed by a defense emphasis on the conditions of life for Palestinians under occupation .
There were three reasons why there were there .
Hamas received a lot of money from people in the United States .
Even if Hamas has not targeted us , the country should not be used as " a cash cow " for terrorists .
In addition , Hamas terrorism directly affects American foreign policy and national security by hindering U.S. efforts to broker Middle East peace deals .
Finally , and most simply , it 's against the law to provide support to Hamas , Jonas said .
" We all support and believe in charity .
But the charity that we believe in and support does not come with strings attached , " he said .
" If someone feeds you , you 're going to support them .
You 're going to do what they need , " Jonas said .
That could mean providing a safe house , serving as a driver or providing other services .
Telephone records show HLF officials were in contact with the " upper echelon of the ( Hamas ) organization .
Not everyone can do that , " Jonas said .
He also focused attention on a pattern of deception by HLF officials , notably former executive director Shukri Abu Baker .
It was Baker who told fellow Hamas supporters that " war is deception " during a secret 1993 meeting in Philadelphia called to discuss ways to " derail " the new Oslo Peace Accords .
" This is coming from a man running a charity whose whole purpose is supposed to be helping children .
Why would he say war is deception ? "
Jonas asked .
That meeting was called by the Palestine Committee , an entity created by the Muslim Brotherhood to help Hamas .
Internal records show HLF was the committee 's financial arm , working with the Islamic Association for Palestine ( which provided propaganda in the United States ) and a think tank called the United Association for Studies and Research ( UASR ) .
Hamas political chief Mousa Abu Marzook helped create the UASR .
In 1994 , Marzook sided with HLF in a dispute over who controls financial support for Hamas .
A challenge that was debated in the Philadelphia meeting was how to oppose the peace deal , which created the Palestinian Authority , without coming off as terror supporters , Jonas said .
He repeatedly cited a deposition and a sworn declaration by Baker in which Baker described the Philadelphia meeting as " a meeting of Islamic intellectuals , academicians , community leaders and representatives of American Islamic organizations , such as ours .
It was not a meeting of any organization . "
In that declaration , he also said : " I reject and abhor Hamas . "
FBI agents eavesdropped on the Philadelphia meeting .
Transcripts show Baker urged people not to even mention Hamas by name .
Instead , he flipped it around and asked that they refer to " Samah . "
In his declaration , Baker said that was intended to be " a whimsical and ironic play on
words .
" Samah " means " forgiveness " in Arabic , and , in my opinion , those who used the term were making ironic fun of Hamas , not adopting a secret term to disguise their references to the organization . "
This is the second trial for HLF .
A mistrial was declared in October 2007 after jurors could not reach unanimous decisions on most counts .
Prosecutors made a series of adjustments to their case , opting not to put in some exhibits and adding witnesses like Hoffman and the former HLF fundraiser Mohamed Shorbagi .
But the closing argument seemed closelyto track last year's .
Some of the lines , like this final statement from Jonas , were nearly identical to his argument in the original trial :
" Do n't let the defendants deceive you by saying they wanted to help widows and orphans .
By helping Hamas they helped create widows and orphans .
Find them guilty . "
The case is not about terrorism , but about charity , countered defense attorney Theresa Duncan , who represents Baker .
The violent images and dogma jurors saw in videotapes - some taken from HLF offices – reflected attitudes born of a " hard - fisted occupation " that created economic and welfare needs in the Palestinian territories that HLF merely sought to relieve .
Baker is heard on other tapes saying he intended to follow the law , she said , and hired accountants and lobbyists to try to keep his organization in line .
The Palestine Committee has been hyped by prosecutors , Duncan said .
" At most it was a loose affiliation " of organizations concerned about events in Palestine , and there was no evidence it was a secret Hamas arm in America .
Baker was mostly honest in his sworn declaration , she said .
The Philadelphia meeting was far in his past and he did consider it a gathering of intellectuals and others .
She also questioned whether it was actually a Palestine Committee meeting , since it appeared not all the participants were listed on committee phone lists .
When Baker urged people to refer to " Samah " instead of Hamas , she said it was because he feared being arrested by Israel while traveling on charity business .
No evidence to that point was ever offered .
Defense attorneys for the other four defendants will offer their arguments Tuesday morning – jurors are eager enough to complete the case that they will work on Veteran 's Day – and federal prosecutor James Jacks will make a final , rebuttal argument before deliberations begin .
The Dallas Morning News story on Monday 's arguments can be seen here .

UNDER normal circumstances a vice - presidential debate is a snooze .
Voters care about the top of the ticket .
Unless the running - mate goes berserk , all will be well .
But the conventional wisdom goes out the window when one of the candidates is a culture warrior in collapse .
The past few weeks have been hard on Sarah Palin , the running - mate of John McCain .
In one disastrous interview the Republican vice - presidential candidate was unable to name a Supreme Court decision other than Roe v Wade .
So interest in the debate on Thursday October 2nd between Mrs Palin and Joe Biden , the running - mate for Barack Obama , was unusually high .
Republicans girded themselves for grim news .
Democrats were cautiously optimistic .
Some sensed a trap .
Mr Obama 's campaign manager insisted that Mrs Palin was “ one of the best debaters in American politics . ”
The good news for the McCain campaign is that Mrs Palin was confident and assertive , and made no big errors .
The bad news is that a mediocre performance counts as good news .
But they will take what they can get at this point .
The McCain campaign had lobbied for a constricted debate format : two - minute questions , without long freewheeling exchanges .
This worked well for Mrs Palin .
It seemed that she had memorised some talking points and was determined not to deviate from them .
“ And I may not answer the questions the way that either the moderator or you want to hear , ” she said , near the beginning .
“ But I 'm going to talk straight to the American people and let them know my track record also . ”
This was effective , if blunt .
One telling exchange came when the moderator , Gwen Ifill , asked Mr Biden whether Americans have the stomach to put troops on the ground in Darfur , a war - torn region in western Sudan .
Mr Biden noted his early advocacy for an intervention in Bosnia , the objections that were raised and the eventual success of the mission .
He concluded that America should rally the world to intervene in Darfur .
Mrs Palin offered a response first to comments on Iraq .
“ Oh , yeah , it 's so obvious I'm a Washington outsider , ” said Mrs Palin .
“ And someone just not used to the way you guys operate .
Because here you voted for the war and now you oppose the war . ”
She went on , however , to agree that a no- fly zone should be supported in Darfur .
At other points Mrs Palin was baffling .
Mr Biden criticised the Republicans for having too much faith in drilling as a solution to the energy crisis .
“ John McCain has voted 20 times against funding alternative energy sources and thinks , I guess , the only answer is drill , drill , drill , ” he said .
“ The chant is ' drill , baby , drill ' , ” she corrected , playing some kind of gender card against herself .
Both of the vice - presidential candidates , like their running - mates , were sour on Wall Street and big on Main Street .
They tussled as they tried to prove their credentials .
Mr Biden said that he has a friend who cannot afford to fill his car with petrol .
Mrs Palin talked about sidling up to other parents at the football field and offered “ a shout - out to all those third graders at Gladys Wood Elementary School . ”
Mr Biden movingly defended his case : “ Look , I understand what it 's like to be a single parent , ” he said .
“ When my wife and daughter died and my two sons were gravely injured , I understand what it 's like as a parent to wonder what it 's like if your kid 's going to make it . ”
Mr Biden may also have benefited from low expectations .
Democrats had feared that he would seem condescending or pompous .
Republicans had chortled over the same possibilities .
No one gave him much credit .
But Mr Biden gave a strong and disciplined performance .
He was self - effacing and downplayed his past disagreements with his running - mate .
He shrugged off their mismatched votes on the bankruptcy bill by saying that “ Barack Obama saw the glass as half - empty .
I saw it as half - full ” .
He was affable but aloof to Mrs Palin , and kept his sights trained on the main target .
He said that he loves his friend John , but that Mr McCain has the same policies as George Bush and is not a real maverick .
The voters who were mesmerised by Mrs Palin may have been bored to hear so much about Mr McCain .
But as Mr Biden knows , boring is not such a bad trait in a running - mate .
The Republicans have learned that one the hard way .

Congress should do now what it should have done back in the fall : kill the Wall Street bailout program .
After wasting $ 350 billion on a program that was misrepresented from the outset , and investing hundreds of billions of dollars in failing financial institutions that it could have bought outright for less than it was investing in them ( AIG was worth only a few billion dollars in total at the time that the government bailed the company out with an initial investment of $ 85 billion and Citicorp today is worth less than the $ 45 billion the government has invested in that failing firm ) , the Treasury Department , now acting at the direction not of the Bush administration and outgoing Treasurer Hank Paulson , but the Obama administration , is asking for the other half of the Troubled Assets Relief Fund ( TARP ) .
Aside from the corrupt aspect of this $ 700 - billion boondoggle — the handing over of borrowed taxpayer money to the very bankers and investors who created the mess we ’re in today — the whole TARP program is premised on a false assumption : namely that the US economy ’s problem is a freeze in bank lending .
This is simply untrue .
Three economists at the Minneapolis Fed , in an article published on the Minneapolis Federal Reserve ’s website , show using the Fed ’s own data that at the very point in September that Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke were warning Congressional leaders in a secret session that the bank lending had entirely seized up and that US was “ days away ” from a meltdown that would lead to riots in the streets and the possible need to impose martial law , in fact interbank lending was at record levels , and that commercial lending was also flowing normally .
True , long - term bond interest rates were unusually ( though not unprecedentedly ) high , but then , that ’s what you would expect when the treasury is borrowing enormous sums and lowering interest rates , and thus raising inflation expectations long term .
The real point of the damning report by the Minneapolis Fed ’s plucky trio of economists , is that banks are n’t lending not because they do n’t have enough capital , but because for the first time in a decade , bankers are being prudent the way banks are supposed to be .
They are looking at companies seeking loans and saying , “ show me your balance sheet and your order book . ”
Companies that are in trouble financially , or that are seeing their sales plummet are being rightly turned away , but companies with solid balance sheets and sales are able to borrow what they need .
The other point is that contrary to the claims being made by both Bush and Obama economic teams about the allegedly urgent importance of the keeping credit flowing so that , as Paulson put it , companies will be able to meet payroll and so that they wo n’t start laying off employees , what is needed is not looser or cheaper credit but programs to protect the incomes of millions of workers who are losing their jobs .
( Unemployment , officially now at 7.2 percent , would actually be closer to 17 percent using the more honest methodology in use prior to 1980 , before the Reagan administration altered it to hide the impact of the recession of the early ' 80s . )
The record shows that even as the government has blown $ 350 billion on a Wall Street bailout , unemployment has soared , housing price declines have accelerated , and retail sales have continued on a six - month death march into the ground .
While administration touts are claiming that if there had been no bailout , things would be worse , there is no evidence to support this claim .
Things are terrible as it is — in fact the economic collapse is being called the worst since the onset of the Great Depression of the 1930s .
How the hell much worse could it have been ?
Which brings us back to the current Obama administration demand for the other $ 350 billion in TARP funds .
It seems clear that what the country is facing is not a unique credit freeze , but rather a classic recession ( or depression ) , in which spiraling industry layoffs of workers is leading to a collapse in spending , which in turn leads to a further slowdown in business and more layoffs .
Because the social safety net in America has been systematically shredded , with unemployment benefits only covering a minority of laid - off workers , and then only for a short period and at only a small fraction of their prior wages , the rise in unemployment is crippling the economy .
Being laid off in America is an unmitigated disaster : no health care , no income , and a nightmare struggle even to obtain food stamps .
( People with homes and savings can be screwed out of assistance because they have too many assets , for example . )
Nor is the other Obama rescue measure — the proposed $ 800 - billion so - called “ stimulus ” package -- adequately addressing the problem .
Focusing on tax breaks ( especially tax breaks for business ) and on large infrastructure projects , is once again wasting precious stimulus resources .
In the case of tax cuts , studies have repeatedly shown that business tax cuts do nothing to stimulate business activity but rather just enrich managers and shareholders , while tax cuts to consumers do not even return a dollar - for - dollar stimulus .
Meanwhile , investing in infrastructure projects only provides incomes to relatively skilled heavy equipment operators these days , not to the broad masses of people who need help .
Moreover , because the pool of workers trained to work on such projects is limited , all boosting that spending does is push up wages in that sector .
( Besides , the last thing America needs is more and better roads ; it needs a wholly revitalized and expanded mass transit system , inter - and intra-city , and that ’s getting short shrift in this proposal . )
A stimulus package that works would expand welfare and food stamp benefits for the chronically unemployed , would boost funding for education — K through college - - would provide grants to states and local governments to compensate for declining tax bases , with stipulations that the money be used to hire more teachers , more teachers ’ aides , more librarians , more trash collectors , etc. , not just lower taxes .
It would expand unemployment insurance coverage to all workers and extend those payments for the duration of the recession while raising the payments to provide a real subsistence wage .
It would fund government run programs to hire the unemployed , creating jobs that meet the skill - set of the unemployed .
The excellent CETA program , part of the grotesquely maligned War on Poverty of the late 1960s , would be a good model for this .
Meanwhile , of course , since we ’re talking about big bucks here , the new administration should be looking to the future and figuring out how to get the budget deficit back in check .
And there , a first target has to be the military , now chewing through well over $ 1 trillion a year , most of it wasted and wrongheaded .
For starters , the war in Iraq should be ended .
Period .
Ditto for Afghanistan — a doomed venture .
Then too , the 800 overseas military bases should be closed down , along with the nation ’s nuclear missile and bomb program ( okay , as long as China , Russia , France , the UK , Israel , India , Pakistan and a few other countries have the bomb , we could keep a few nukes for negotiating purposes , pending a global nuclear disarmament agreement , which should be a top priority ) .
The truth is , the US military budget could be cut in half or even more , without anyone really noticing .
The US would be the stronger for it , not weaker or more vulnerable .
Even at half strength , no potential enemy would want to threaten the US .
( In fact , arguably , a US that had pulled back from its current global stance would be far more formidable an opponent if directly threatened . )
We are facing a grave economic crisis , but the boneheads in the Bush and Obama economic teams are either clueless , or are too busy protecting their friends on Wall Street ( or in New York Fed Chief and Treasury Secretary nominee Timothy Geithner 's case , too busy figuring out ways to cheat on his taxes ) , to either know or care .
Only mass public action will set this right .
Hopefully , the public is getting scared enough now to pry their eyes away from the tube and start demanding that it be done , before another trillion dollars is thrown down a rat hole .

The Senate yesterday voted to confirm Tim Geithner as Obama ’s new Treasury Secretary – but the vote was narrower than expected , at 60 - 34 .
Apparently , it was the slimmest margin of confirmation for a Treasury Secretary since WWII .
Among those who voted nay were the Democrats Russ Feingold , Tom Harkin and Robert Byrd , as well as Bernie Sanders , the self - described socialist from Vermont who was elected as independent but caucuses with the Democrats .
I ’m generally a fan of Feingold and especially Sanders , and lukewarm about Geithner ( not so much about the tax issue as rather because he ’s too cautious and too involved in the current failings of the financial system ) .
So I ’m curious why they went all out and voted against him .
I tried searching for any statements from them on the matter , but there ’s nothing on any of their Senate homepages .
For Byrd , all I found ( in three zillion copies of a news agency report ) is that he commented after the vote , “ Had he not been nominated for treasury secretary , it ’s doubtful that he would have ever paid these taxes . ”
But Firedoglake has the statement from Feingold .
For him , too , it was the tax issue that did it :
“ I voted against the nomination of Timothy Geithner to be the next Secretary of the Treasury with some reluctance .
President Obama , like any other President , is entitled to have the Cabinet he wants , barring serious disqualifying issue , and Mr. Geithner is a very able nominee in many ways .
And while I am troubled by Mr. Geithner ’s track record on some of the issues that have contributed to the credit market crisis , I do not base my vote on what is , to a certain extent , a matter of policy disagreement .
“ Mr. Geithner ’s tax liability is a different matter , however .
I am deeply troubled by his failure to pay the payroll taxes he owed , despite repeated alerts from his employer at the time , the International Monetary Fund , that he was responsible for paying those taxes .
Moreover , his earlier interactions with the Internal Revenue service over his failure to pay sufficient payroll taxes for his household employees make Mr. Geithner ’s explanations of his failure to pay his own payroll taxes even less satisfactory .
The failure to comply with our nation ’s tax laws would be problematic for any Cabinet nominee , but it is especially disturbing when it involves the individual who will be charged with overseeing the enforcement of our tax laws .
“ With the condition the economy is in , and the state of our country ’s financial institutions , the stakes could not be greater for the next Treasury Secretary .
While I could not support his nomination , I respect Mr. Geithner ’s abilities and I look forward to working with him to address the serious problems facing our country . ”
Meanwhile , the Radio Iowa blog has the statement from Tom Harkin .
For him , the tax issue and Geithner ’s co-responsibility for the current crisis as chief regulator of the financial institutions weighed equally in his decision :
“ I strongly believe that , save in extraordinary circumstances , the President should have the right to select his own team .
President Obama believes that Mr. Geithner is the best person for this job , and it pains me to go against the President ’s wishes on this matter .
“ I believe that Mr. Geithner is a person of obvious talent and experience , and I bear no ill will toward him whatsoever .
However , after careful deliberation , I simply could not overcome my very serious reservations about this nominee for two reasons .
Mr. Geithner made serious errors of judgment in failing to pay his taxes , and he made serious errors in his job as chief regulator of the financial institutions at the heart of the current financial crisis .
“ Nothing would make me happier than for Mr. Geithner to prove me wrong by serving with distinction .
I wish him every success as Treasury Secretary – we will all be rooting for his success . ”
If anyone sees the statement by Bernie Sanders , do leave a link in the comments .
UPDATE : Sanders ’ statement is in the next blog post .

Well , maybe just one .
Here ’s a Christmas wreath so darling and dear , even Miss Crawford would approve .
Take one of these …
and bend it into the form of a circle .
Then , grab your glue gun and as many round ornaments in varying sizes as you can find .
You ’ll need about 80 in all .
Whenever I do my tree , I like the more unusual shapes , so it ’s always the round ones I have left over .
Even if you do n’t , though , you can always find them for reasonable prices at a discount retailer , especially after the holidays .
To secure the metal cap to the ball , dab a little hot glue and press .
That way , the cap will remain attached as the ornaments are strung .
Next , untwist the end of the hanger , then string one ornament at a time , making sure to alternate the placement and colors as desired .
Use smaller sizes to fill in the gaps !
Check out the final result !
To secure it to the door ( make sure it ’s on the interior ! ) , I used the hook end of the hanger , together with a little wire .
Then I covered it up with bubblegum pink satin ribbon and a bow .
How simple and beautiful is that ?
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Researchers believe they have found a potential way to regenerate nerves by stimulating a gene and said on Thursday they hope their work in worms may some day help people with spinal cord injuries .
The gene is part of a network , or pathway , of four genes that appear to be essential for nerve repair , they reported in the journal Science .
“ We found a pathway that not only regenerates nerves in the worm , but also exists in humans , and we think it serves the same purpose , ” Michael Bastiani of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City , who led the study , said in a statement .
Bastiani said the gene could serve as a target for a future drug that could “ vastly improve the ability of a neuron to regenerate after injury . ”
In humans , nerve fibers in the arms and legs can regenerate , but in the brain and spinal cord , they do not .
Many teams are working to understand why .
Bastiani ’s team looked to nematode worms for clues .
Using an advanced research technique called RNA interference , the team systematically blocked the action of 5,000 worm genes to isolate those important for nerve repair .
They found a gene called dlk - 1 was essential to the process at every stage of the worm ’s life .
When they used genetic engineering to block this gene network , the worms were unable to repair nerve damage .
But when they stimulated the gene -- making it more active than normal -- worms with damaged nerves recovered much more quickly .
Curiously , this network of genes is not used by the nervous system during normal development in the embryo , but it is essential for nerve repair after birth .
“ Most of us believed that virtually everything we found in regeneration also would be involved in development , ” Bastiani said .
Bastiani and colleagues noted that to be effective , the dlk - 1 gene must be stimulated soon after injury to make a protein that stimulates repair , suggesting there might be “ a time window in which you have to activate this pathway . ”
Many teams have been working on finding ways to block proteins that inhibit nerve repair in adults .
Last year , a team at Children ’s Hospital Boston reported in the journal Science they were able to stimulate nerve regeneration in mice with damaged optic nerves by turning off proteins that keep adult nerve cells from growing .
A separate team from the biotechnology firm Genentech Inc was able to stimulate nerve regeneration by blocking chemical signals that create a hostile environment for nerve repair .
At first we had to laugh when we got wind ( a tailwind no doubt ) of how Emirates Airlines Launches San Francisco Service With World ’s Longest Green Flight Trial .
Even in their posh business class that ’s a long flight and lot of CO2 going into the air .
But what ’s with the Green aspect ?
Are they going to sell us carbon credits during the in - flight service ?
We ’ll have two organic gin martinis and 20,000 carbon credits please .
Before we totally write this off as greenwashing , we took a look at their green flight .
Emirates created what they call “ the most environmentally - sophisticated route and trip possible to help save an estimated 2,000 gallons of fuel and 30,000 pounds of carbon emissions on the 16 - hour non-stop service . ”
The airlines worked with various countries to create a route that heads over Dubai , Russia , Iceland , Canada and the United States and other countries .
Maybe these guys should work for the UN .
We ’ll buy the distance thing .
Shorter distance , less fuel , less CO2 .
Besides the flight route , Emirates has created several fuel and emission - saving measures such as the new 777-200LR will be specially washed beforehand to minimize drag .
We ’re not aerodynamics experts but does washing a plane make that much of a difference toward fuel economy ?
Think of the precious water use ( unless they use graywater ) necessary to clean the jet .
The new 777-200LR operates at a 20 % better clip when compared to the Air Bus 340 - 500 , so that represents an immediate and tangible green plus .
Emirates also collects all on - board glass , newspapers , aluminum and paper for recycling .
Commendable .
It ’s what happens after the flight that worries us .
We have heard but have not yet confirmed that one US carrier that flies international routes collects recycling while in - flight but then the recyclables get burned because the cans and bottles came via an international flight .
We would n’t want to recycle those cans from Mexico or Canada would we ?
Maybe the bottles did n’t have there visas ?
A lot of the other green factors have to do with routing , wind currents and air traffic management .
That all makes sense but do n’t all carriers do this ?
Maybe they do n’t .
Maybe some airline pilots fly directly into headwinds just for kicks .
Because the flight just kicked off a couple weeks ago , we ’ll give it chance to see what the green savings are .
It ’s going to be difficult to convince us that jumping on a plane and flying half way around the world even remotely resembles anything green but if you gotta go you gotta go .

China 's central bank cut interest rates for the fifth time in four months yesterday in a desperate effort to revive the country 's flagging economy as fears over the world recession continue to deepen .
The decision by the People 's Bank of China to cut rates by 0.27 points came as Japan announced that exports had fallen to their lowest ever level .
The country 's economics minister said he found it " difficult to imagine " that Japan would see an improvement in the near future .
Yesterday 's rate cut in China , which follows a 1.08 percentage point reduction four weeks ago , was much less than most economists had expected .
Benchmark one - year lending and deposit rates are now 5.31 % and 2.25 % respectively .
" We would have thought that given the US action , and the ... central bank action around the world , the [ People 's Bank ] would have been inclined to go further , " said Ken Peng , an economist at Citigroup .
" Apparently they think this will be sufficient to maintain financial stability in the near term . "
China 's economy has slowed significantly since the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers in September .
The country 's factory output grew at a record slow pace for a non-holiday month in the year to November and exports declined for the first time in more than seven years .
Xing Ziqiang , economist at China International Capital Corp , said : " The economy is slowing more sharply than expected and I think that 's why the central bank rushed to cut rates again now . "
Economists at research group IHS Global Insight predicted China 's GDP growth would slow from 11.9 % in 2007 to 9.4 % this year and 7.4 % in 2009 .
Thousands of factories have closed as global demand for Chinese exports has continued to wane , leading to protests at rising unemployment .
Workers have clashed with police in protests over unpaid wages .
Domestic industries such as property and car sales have suffered in the credit crunch .
Japan has been hit hard by falling demand for its cars and consumer electronics products .
The finance ministry said yesterday that exports fell at a record pace last month , staying in the red for a second month for the first time since 1980 .
Global exports slumped 26.7 % , taking the country 's trade deficit to ¥ 223bn ( £ 22bn ) , while those to the US fell almost 34 % .
Both falls were the sharpest since current trade calculations were introduced in 1980 .
Exports to Asia , which had held up in the early days of the financial crisis , have now started to follow those to the US and Europe , falling 26.7 % in November .
Exports to China , where demand for semiconductors and consumer electronics helped lift Japan out of its last recession , dropped 24.5 % , their biggest fall since 1995 .
When economics minister , Kaoru Yosano , was asked whether there was any end in sight to the gloom , he replied : " God only knows .
" Now is not the time to talk about a bright tomorrow .
For now we are focused on how to present a bleak tomorrow . "
The government 's monthly economic report was equally pessimistic , warning that the rapid fall in production threatened to usher in an era of high unemployment .

Amy Winehouse is a Hero .... What ?
This is n't the kind of news we thought we would be writing about this morning but we could n't pass this up .
Singerwho has been on an extended vacation in St. Lucia , is being touted as a hero .
You heard it right ... a hero .
Winehouse savedfrom drowning .
We know what you 're thinking .
Is it safe for someone to get into the water when they are impaired ... but apparently when Amy saw Louise getting thrown from a sailboat , the singer dashed to rescue her .
Williams said , " A six foot wave caught the boat and I went flying and hit a rock .
Amy was on the beach 20 meters away and she ran across immediately and said ' let 's have a look at you . ' "
The very appreciative woman claims she would never have made it without the quick actions of Winehouse .
Williams reported that she was " bowled " by her kindness and that there is definitely another side to Amy .

Your Diet Is About To Meet It ’s Nemesis ( or why it ’s called Fat Tuesday in Detroit ) , photo by Derek Farr ( DetroitDerek ) .
Meet the Paczki , a 400 calorie deep - fried Polish Treat enjoyed in Detroit every year around this time .
Much larger than a bismarck or jelly donut ( about 2 times the filling ) , they are filled with fruit or custard and lines for this treat , traditionally sold / eaten on Fat Tuesday , can start 24 hours in advance in Polish suburbs of Detroit such as Hamtramck .
Hamtramck is the only city that has a Paczki Day Parade every year , although the day is also celebrated in Chicago , Milwaukee , and South Bend .
New Orleans celebrates it on a Thursday .
The good news is I got mine ( some places run out quick ) and they ’re Raspberry and they ’re delicious .
The bad news ?
I thought TODAY was Fat Tuesday , so now I have to eat 6 of these AND eat some more next week when it ’s actually Fat Tuesday .
Argh .
Get to know more about Draco , a fantastic illustrator and one of the best t- shirt design artists out there with designs being printed by the most famous online t- shirt websites Draco brings a Brazilian flavor into people 's closet .
Besides all that he has a great project that releases free t- shirt templates for you to put your designs on .
For more work from Draco visit www.dracoimagem.com
Who hides behind the name Draco ?
Well ,
My name is Edno Pereira Jr , I 'm from Nova Iguaçu - RJ - Brazil , I 'm self taught , and I always Ilustrated since a little kid , but being an illustrator or designer were n't exactly my dream as a child , but , I could n't run from my destiny and today I work on Hiperativa www.hiperativa.com.br , a web agency that has big clients Brazil such as americanas , shoptime , ig and more .
When and how did you first start getting into design and illustrations ?
Drawing was always a good way to pass the time , and the transition between fun and work happened naturally .
I do n't know exactly when I started my interest , but since a little kid I liked to see drawing cartoons and paintings .
I think it was one of the first things that messed with my curiosity .
How was this transition from drawing cartoons to start illustrating on a computer ?
It was when I first bought a PC , about 10 years ago , since I was already drawing , I started to produce some digital material , started with photoshop , not knowing anything .
By then I did n't have internet so no tutorials at all .
It took a while but I learned my way around the program , and after some time I started doing vectors , which is what I like the most , today 80 % of the work I do are vectors illustrations .
How was the transition of being an illustrator to becoming a t - shirt designer ?
It kinda started for no reason , one day I was surfing the web when I found www.camiseteria.com.br
( It 's kinda like threadless from Brazil ) I was very interested and started to post my illustrations in form of t- shirt designs , I started to like doing that when my designs began to get approved and was getting a good money out of it so I looked for other sites that had the same system of work and never stopped .
How long did it take to start getting noticed and actually selling your artwork to big companies ?
If I 'm not wrong , it took about 6 month .
At first the biggest challenge was to try to understand what kind of designs they liked the most , but after some time I realized that I had to do what I liked and not work on what other people would like , from tha point my work started getting bigger and better and my designs started getting acepted in a lot of places .
Tell us about other projects you have .
For more free templates visit www.imaginatee.com
As a right now I work in a design agency and that 's taking most of my time , and we all know that whoever works on an agency never has time for any personal projects , but slowly I 'm getting back to an old project I always had that is to create a studio to work on drawing cartoons like the ones we see on the newspaper .
It 's a complicated project but very soon you guys will hear about it .
Besides that another project that I have going right now is www.imaginatee.com which is a site where I put up free t- shirt templates to help the people who send works to any t- shirt contest website .
This project was born by the difficulty I had on finding photos of people wearing t- shirts where I could place my work in before it actually got printed , I believe everybody on this area needs those templates and I decided to create a place where we all can find what we need and help everyone .
What would you like to say to the young artists who are just starting to work on this area ?
For everyone that is just beginning their journey I have to say :
The first step is to keep an eye on good designers on the area , look up for designs to learn what is good and what is not , and bet on your on design feelings .
It 's important to understand the criticism that is always going to be there , and learn to separate things .
I do n't agree with that because before it 's called a design I think it 's an art and there is no such thing as something wrong when it comes to art , it depends on the taste of who is looking at it , you either like it or not but nothing is wrong , but always listen to suggestions , and the ones that hate on your work you can always ignore :)
A month ago , Harry Markopolos was an accountant unknown outside Boston 's financial community .
Now the slight , bookish 52 - year - old from Whitman is under siege .
Christmas week , he spent Monday being interviewed by " 60 Minutes , " Tuesday preparing to testify in Washington , and Wednesday sorting through pitches from book authors and movie producers .
His mother - in - law now answers the door at his suburban stucco house and shoos away the reporters who knock at all hours .
The man who spent nearly a decade trying to blow the whistle on what appears to be the largest Ponzi scheme in history has achieved a kind of hero status within the investment world .
He is poised to reap both fame and fortune from a disaster that has cost the investors of Bernard L. Madoff as much as $ 50 billion .
" You 've spent a good part of your life trying to expose a truth , in a way few men in modern history have , " one book author wrote in an e-mail to Markopolos .
Steven Pearl , a producer and writer in Los Angeles who wants to make a movie about Markopolos , said he sees " a remarkably compelling story about a guy who did n't want to be in the middle of this .
It 's like Cary Grant in ' North by Northwest , ' where he 's thrown into a case of subterfuge and espionage because of a random telephone call . "
But unlike the suave Grant , Markopolos is uncomfortable in the spotlight and reluctant to take the leading - man role .
He said he is uninterested in cooperating with many of the authors and moviemakers - and worries Hollywood will take liberties with the story .
" They 'll just add in sex and violence , " he said .
Already , the attention is getting to him .
Suffering from a cold , he backed out of testifying earlier this week before a congressional committee investigating the US Securities and Exchange Commission 's failure to heed Markopolos 's warnings about Madoff .
Markopolos is also particular about his work and felt he was n't prepared enough for what would be his first star appearance in public .
Now , the floor of his skylit home office is covered with documents and manila folders in which he 's organizing the papers from his crusade .
Worried about his privacy , he declined to have his picture taken anywhere near his home .
When James Segel , special counsel to US Representative Barney Frank , chairman of the House Committee on Financial Services , arranged to meet him at a pub in West Roxbury two weeks ago , Markopolos asked to see some identification before they sat down .
" You have to be sure who you 're talking to , " he said .
The bottom line is , Markopolos is n't eager to seize the moment .
" Why would people think I feel good about this ? "
Markopolos asked at one point in a series of recent interviews .
" People think I 'm a hero , but I did n't stop him .
He stopped himself . "
Harry Markopolos has never met Bernard Madoff .
Instead , he stalked the famous investor through computer analysis of Madoff 's supposed trading practices and returns .
A Pennsylvania native , Markopolos came to Boston in 1991 to join Rampart Investment Management , a firm that specializes in the trading of options - contracts that let investors buy or sell stocks and other financial instruments at set prices .
Soon , tales of how Madoff was delivering steady profits to clients regardless of market conditions had become a legend - and a mystery - in the investment world .
His bosses at Rampart were keen to learn how they could match Madoff 's double - digit returns .
As the office math whiz , Markopolos was assigned in 2000 to deconstruct Madoff 's strategy to see if he could replicate it .
When he could n't , the task became something of a running challenge around the office .
" I 'd say , ' Hey Harry , how come you can't run a program like this ? , ' " said Frank Casey , a former Rampart colleague who now runs a consulting firm for hedge fund investors .
For Markopolos , though , it was no joke .
Again and again he could not simulate Madoff 's returns , using information he had gathered about Madoff 's trades in stocks and options .
Madoff seemed to make money whether stock markets went up or down , a red flag to Markopolos .
" You ca n't dominate all markets , " Markopolos said .
" You have to have some losses . "
Also , Madoff seemed unusually secretive , even to his own clients - another warning sign .
Markopolos eventually decided Madoff was either running a Ponzi scheme - using money from new clients to pay off old ones - or he was " front running " stocks , improperly trading in investors ' private accounts ahead of orders the firm received from outside clients .
Through an SEC contact in Boston , Ed Manion , Markopolos began funneling memos and tips to the agency 's New York office , which had jurisdiction over Madoff 's company , Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC .
Despite receiving little response , Markopolos continued to send SEC officials memos and other notes about Madoff , even after he left Rampart in 2004 to start a business investigating financial fraud .
His latest communication with the agency was in April , just eight months before the scheme surfaced :
In it , he welcomed the SEC 's new director of risk assessment to his job with a note about his longstanding concerns about Madoff .
Markopolos allows that at times he was motivated partly by the opportunity to receive a bounty that the government pays to whistleblowers in successful prosecutions , if the fraud falls within certain categories - the front running issue , for example .
Depending on the size of the fraud , such payments could run into the millions of dollars .
But exposing a Ponzi scheme probably would n't generate such a bounty .
Statin Drugs Do n’t Save Lives and May Increase Your Risk for Diabetes
by Bill Sardi by Bill Sardi
DIGG THIS
Americans are being bombarded today by news reports of a breakthrough in the prevention of cardiovascular disease ( heart attacks , strokes and high blood pressure ) .
The hype is undeserved , the data less than compelling , and when it came to whether the statin drug used in the study ( Crestor ) actually saved lives , the headlines should have said the drug trial failed and that it raised the risk for diabetes .
Here is how the news media and health authorities portrayed the study ( New England Journal of Medicine , Nov. 9 , 2008 ) :
" A highly anticipated study has produced powerful evidence that a simple blood test can spot seemingly healthy people who are at increased risk for a heart attack or stroke and that giving them a widely used drug offers potent protection against the nation ’s leading killers . "
~ Rob Stein , Washington Post
“ The potential public health benefits are huge .
It really changes the way we have to think about prevention of heart attack and stroke . ”
~ Paul M. Ridker of the Brigham and Women ’s Hospital in Boston
“ It ’s a breakthrough study , it ’s a blockbuster .
It ’s absolutely paradigm - shifting . ”
~ Steven E. Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic
( These are the words drug companies want to hear . )
“ This takes prevention to a whole new level .
Yesterday you would not have used a statin for a patient whose cholesterol was normal .
Today you will . ”
~ W. Douglas Weaver , president of the American College of Cardiology
" These are findings that are really going to impact the practice of cardiology in the country . "
~ Dr. Elizabeth G. Nabel , director of the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute , which was not involved in the research
The drug companies now assert that normally healthy people should now take statin drugs , even if they have low - to - normal cholesterol levels , because Crestor reduced C- reactive protein , a marker of inflammation .
This claim would expand the use of statin drugs to millions more Americans and reel in billions of dollars of sales for the maker of Crestor .
For comparison , Crestor reduced C- reactive protein by 37 % , vitamin E lowers CRP by 32 % , and vitamin C by 25.3 % .
[ Free Radical Medicine & Biology Oct. 10 , 2008 ; American Journal Clinical Nutrition 86 : 1392 : 2007 . ]
These vitamins are not toxic to the liver .
Major efforts will likely be made to promote Crestor on TV , prodding healthy people with normal cholesterol levels to begin taking a drug known to cause liver toxicity and muscle problems , a drug that costs $ 3.45 per day ( $ 1259 a year ) .
The data shows about 120 patients would have to take Crestor for nearly two years to prevent just one stroke or heart attack .
Translation : the drug is effective among less than 1 % of the patients over this time period .
The 4 - year study of 18,000 patients was stopped suddenly prior to the 2 - year mark because it allegedly showed startling improvements in cardiovascular health .
But generally studies are halted when greater risk is identified .
Halting the study prematurely may have hidden the occurrence of the characteristic side effects caused by the drug ( liver toxicity and muscle problems ) .
The drug also increased the risk for diabetes , which represents disease substitution , not disease prevention .
John Abramson , a Harvard professor and author of Overdosed America , said : “ We ’re already struggling to provide health services for the 46 million Americans who do n’t have health insurance in the United States .
This is going to drain away a lot of money from the system for little or no benefit .
We know that there are lifestyle interventions that are effective . ”
Dr. Abramson ’s own analysis of major statin drug studies did not reveal any significant reduction in mortality , regardless of whether statin drugs lowered cholesterol or C - reactive protein .
The drug companies know their long - standing cholesterol - ruse is over .
So they have now found another useless marker to make Americans phobic over — inflammation and C - reactive protein .

Police in Switzerland have stumbled across a gigantic marijuana plantation while using the Google Earth internet search .
The head of Zurich police 's narcotics unit , Norbert Klossner , said the marijuana was hidden inside a field of corn .
But officers using the satellite mapping software to locate two farmers suspected of involvement in a large drug ring quickly spotted the illegal crop .
Mr Klossner told reporters in Zurich that the plantation measured almost two acres .
Authorities are questioning 16 people over alleged offences linked to the sale of up to seven tons of hashish and marijuana between 2004 and 2008 .

A visit to Disney World was the inspiration behind the Minoru webcam 3D films may soon no longer be the sole province of movie studios with big budgets .
At CES , two firms have been showing off ways for home users to make and share their own 3D films .
One is a webcam with two lenses that mimics human sight and turns the images it captures into 3D footage .
Another firm is producing software that it hopes will make it far easier for home users to show 3D movies on many different types of screen .
Manchester - based PDT has created the Minoru webcam that has two lenses set roughly the same distance apart as human eyes .
Software included with the webcam turns the two images into what is known as an anaglyph .
If someone gave you an iPod with one ear piece you would think they were nuts
David Holder
Minoru
To see the resultant footage in 3D , viewers must wear the familiar spectacles with red and blue lenses .
This ensures that only one of the two images being shown is seen by each eye and forces the brain to turn them into a moving 3D image .
DIY 3D movies shot with the Minoru can be shared on YouTube .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .

The webcam can also be used as a more conventional 2D image grabber or as a video conferencing tool with Windows Live , Skype , AOL and many others .
David Holder , the creator of the Minoru webcam , said his children were the inspiration for the gadget .
" I took my kids to Disney World two years ago and they loved the 3D attractions there , " he said .
" They just loved the idea of things coming out of the screen , even though they had to wear the glasses . "
Explaining why he embarked on the project to create the camera , he said : " If someone gave you an iPod with one ear piece you would think they were nuts . "
He added : " I 've never made anything that 's grabbed so much attention . "
Diverse screens
Also at CES , American firm TD Vision showed off a software codec that makes it much easier to show 3D movies on many different screen types .
Ethan Shur , spokesman for TD Vision , said the company had also developed a prototype 3D camcorder that would work with the software to turn footage into a 3D movie .
To ensure the film can be played back on different screens , it stores information about the anaglyphic characteristics of each scene separately from the standard images .
The firm 's breakthrough is finding an economic way of storing only information about the parts of each frame that change to evoke the 3D effect .
" The magic is in the method of how it compares the left and right view , " he said .
" It takes only the differences , the delta , the changes . "
Having the 3D information stored separately means that the footage can be played back as 2D on a normal television or as 3D on more capable screens .
Initially , said Mr Shur , TD Vision was working with broadcasters and DVD makers to use the 3D codec but had plans to address consumers in the future .

Mr Murdoch said the paper had made a mistake in printing the cartoon
The owner of the New York Post , Rupert Murdoch , has apologised for a cartoon which critics said was a racist depiction of President Barack Obama .
Newspaper cartoonist Sean Delonas drew police shooting dead a chimp , while remarking " they 'll have to find someone else to write the stimulus bill " .
But Mr Murdoch said the cartoon was meant to mock Mr Obama 's legislation and was not intended to be racist .
The newspaper had apologised to readers last week after widespread criticism .
The cartoon , published on 18 February , came a day after Mr Obama signed into law a $ 787bn ( £ 548 bn ) economic stimulus package approved by Congress after weeks of wrangling .
The image referred to a gruesome incident earlier that week , when a pet chimp in Connecticut attacked and disfigured a woman before being shot dead by police .
' A mistake '
In an editorial in Friday 's edition , Mr Murdoch said the paper had made a mistake in publishing the cartoon and that he was sorry for any offence .
The cartoon brought criticism from anti-racism campaigners " As the Chairman of the New York Post , I am ultimately responsible for what is printed in its pages .
The buck stops with me . "
" Last week , we made a mistake .
We ran a cartoon that offended many people .
Today I want to personally apologize to any reader who felt offended , and even insulted . "
He said he had spoken to a number of people since the publication and that he could now " better understand the hurt this cartoon has caused " .
But he added that " the only intent of that cartoon was to mock a badly written piece of legislation " .
" It was not meant to be racist , but unfortunately , it was interpreted by many as such . "
Mr Murdoch said the New York Post would " seek to be more attuned to the sensitivities of our community " in the future .
Commentators , blog writers and politicians had widely denounced the cartoon and demonstrators picketed the newspaper 's New York City headquarters .
Mr Delonas had denied that the chimp resembled Mr Obama , and the paper initially defended the cartoon as a " parody of a current news event " but later apologised .

Private prosecutions are already being prepared .
" We are building files on war crimes throughout the chain of command from the top to the local level , " said Raji Sourani of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights .
" We are convinced these have been the most bloody days for Gaza since the occupation and that war crimes were perpetrated against Palestinian civilians . "
The world really does need more Canada .
For years , we 've been told Canada 's banks are too puny to survive in a globalizing world .
That our governments are not sufficiently frugal .
That we stint on research and development .
That we have something of a monopoly on lax regulatory protections for investors .
So let 's look around .
Banking :
The global banking system has effectively failed .
After losing upward of $ 1 trillion ( U.S. ) by taking leave of prudent practices in pursuit of a quick buck , it continues to function only by the grace of emergency government bailouts in the U.S. and throughout Europe .
Rank mismanagement has characterized the operations of the world 's most prestigious banks this decade .
The pantheon of the world 's most prestigious banks engaged in cowboy antics .
They amassed ultimately unmanageable risk , as they created and traded in " collateralized debt obligations " and other fancy new financial instruments that even the chief executives of Citigroup Inc. , Wachovia Corp. , Merrill Lynch & Co. , Royal Bank of Scotland PLC , HSBC PLC and UBS AG either did n't understand or realize their institutions held in their portfolios .
Public finances :
By now , it 's well known that U.S. President George W. Bush , abetted by a Congress controlled by fellow Republicans during his first six years in office , somehow managed to more than double the U.S. national debt to about $ 11 trillion .
No mean feat , considering it took the republic 224 years prior to Bush 's first inauguration to accumulate the $ 5 trillion debt that Bush inherited .
And about two - thirds of U.S. state governments , including California and New York , cannot balance their budgets and are appealing to President - elect Barack Obama for a bailout .
The phenomenon of spendthrift governments is widely evident in Europe , as well .
Earlier this week , Standard & Poor 's said Spain 's triple - A ratings might soon be downgraded .
S&P also issued similar warnings to Greece and Ireland .
Debt - laden Italy and Portugal are expected to soon follow .
Even Britain , the most robust of European economies earlier this decade , is facing a downgrade on its government paper with the collapse of the overheated British housing market and the expense of nationalizing a crippled RBS , the nation 's largest bank , and other financial institutions .
Iceland is effectively insolvent , the victim of a local banking collapse brought on by reckless overexpansion .
Ireland deserves special attention .
Personal - computer maker Dell Inc. last week announced the relocation of its Irish operations to lower - cost Poland .
Ireland 's magic elixir of huge tax breaks and corporate subsidies was for years urged upon Canadian policy - makers by right - wing think - tanks that faulted Canada for being too costly a jurisdiction to do business .
Well , here 's some news for the Chamber of Commerce keynoters from Belleville to Kelowna , and authors of the Fraser Institute scripts they read from : Ireland , whose own overheated housing market has imploded , is now a basket case .
Out-migration of the kind James Joyce bemoaned has resumed .
R&D : American government financing of research – and most basic research in the U.S. is financed by government – has dropped every year since 2004 in real dollars for life sciences , and for much longer in the physical sciences .
The private sector – everyone from Merck & Co. to Hamburger U. at McDonald 's Corp. , which exploit that research – is suffering a long - term decline in global competitiveness as a result .
Forty - nine Nobel laureate scientists have signed an urgent plea to Obama to restore basic - science research funding " to the levels needed to maintain the vitality and leadership of U.S. scientific research . "
Investor protection : Recall that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was so understaffed in the late 1990s that it could not scrutinize the flood of prospectuses from Enron Corp. , WorldCom Inc. and the hundreds of upstart dot -coms .
So soon after that epic loss of about $ 8 trillion in shareholder value when those firms collapsed , the SEC was AWOL again as America 's leading banks and brokers hid ungainly risks in the same off - balance sheet devices that Andy Fastow used at Enron .
The SEC first learned about Bernard Madoff 's recently uncovered $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme in the papers .
And where was the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. while depositors ' funds were being put in jeopardy ?
Where was Britain 's Financial Services Authority when RBS and mortgage leaders HBOS PLC and Northern Rock PLC were playing with fire ?
So much for the unassailable virtues of national securities regulators .
No argument is made here that Canada is an oasis of best practices in these matters , not after the fiascos of Livent Corp. and Bre -X Minerals Ltd .
But consider : none of our Big Five banks is in the slightest danger .
In fact , each is poised to pluck off weakened U.S. banks at deep - discount prices , possibly with U.S. government assistance .
Why ?
Because our legislators and banking regulators are n't in the back pocket of a powerful banking lobby .
They 're more assiduous about scrutiny .
They take a dim view of mortgages with no down payment , no collateral and no proof of income .
And they are n't shy about demanding that banks increase their capital to cover writeoffs , well ahead of trouble .
Each of the Big Five is blessed with a stable retail - banking franchise .
Each is truly national , while even after several rounds of consolidation , the U.S. has not one bank that can boast the geographic diversification of the Toronto - based banks .
And because back in 1998 , then - finance minister Paul Martin killed the Big Five 's ardent desire to merge .
We now know that the so - called " money centre " banks on Wall Street were so preoccupied with Pac - Man acquisitions they lost sight of their basic business .

There is such a thing as getting too big to be able to manage yourself , as General Motors Corp. has learned and Wal - Mart Stores Inc. eventually will .
" Martin should get some of the credit for the current soundness of Canada 's banks , " says Michael Bliss , University of Toronto professor emeritus and a leading business historian .
Bliss , incidentally , is a conservative who otherwise found little to admire in Martin at Finance or at 24 Sussex .
" Martin and Parliament stopped the banks from merging , and I would bet my house that if we had created a couple of superbanks here they would have flown high and now been a ghastly mess , " Bliss said .
" Parliament and Martin rightly realized they needed to save the bankers from themselves . "
Robert Kelly , chief executive of U.S. banking giant Bank of New York Mellon , spoke recently at the Canadian Club of Toronto on what to expect of the Obama administration .
The former TD Bank executive , noting the strength in product - line diversity and geographic reach of his former Canadian peers , said one of the lessons learned by the roughly 7,000 U.S. banks is the virtue of branch banking and a stable retail - deposit base .
The upshot , he said , is that in post - recovery mode , the U.S. banking system will be more modelled on ours .
And what of our public finances , as current Finance Minister Jim Flaherty prepares a stimulus budget to be unveiled late this month that might push Canada into deficit of $ 30 billion ( Canadian ) or so ?
To start with , it 's almost quaintly modest relative to the triple - figure stimulus packages in America , Europe , China and Russia .
Using the usual rule of 10s in comparing Canada and the U.S. , Obama 's imminent stimulus proposal should be on the order of $ 300 billion ( U.S. ) , but will clock in at above $ 1 trillion by the time Congress lards it up .
That 's in addition to America 's $ 700 billion banking bailout of late last year .
Fact is , after a decade of consecutive federal budget surpluses – a record unmatched among our G8 peers – Ottawa is in far better fiscal shape than other industrialized nations to cushion the blow for Canadians of the U.S. - originated global recession .
Problems we have in abundance , perhaps none more disgraceful than the estimated 900,000 Canadian children living in poverty , the wretched conditions in many aboriginal communities , and our failure to take a leadership role in curbing global warming .
But in crucial ways that other nations can only envy , this country is built on a rock .
Amid the daily headlines of a world gone haywire , the continued blessings of this country remain an untold story .

The residents of Broward County , Florida have recently received misleading robocalls telling them that they can vote by phone on Election Day , according to a report in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel on Friday .
The report did n’t provide many details , other than the fact that the voice fallaciously identified itself as Elections Supervisor Brenda Snipes .
When asked whether she had heard about the calls , the supervisor ’s public service director said that she had n’t , and that of course voting by phone is not an option .
The call is just one of a number of dirty tricks being pulled off around the country just before record numbers of voters are expected to turn up at the polls on Election Day .
Another unknown group is distributing flyers ( see the flyer after the jump ) with official - looking letterhead around the area of Hampton Roads , Virgina that erroneously inform recipients that because of the crowds at the polls , the Virginia State Board of Elections is scheduling Republicans to vote on November 4th , and Democrats on the 5th .
Democratic congressmen Jerry Nadler of New York , John Conyers of Michigan and Bobby Scott of Virginia on Thursday asked the Justice Department to launch an investigation into the matter and to bring criminal charges against the originators of the flyers .
Meanwhile , the Pittsburgh Tribune - Review reports that people in the area have been receiving robocalls with the same message .
This particular trick is an old one :
In 2004 , the New York Times reported the same message going out in the Pittsburgh area via flyers .
The New York Times ran a full page advertisement today in the front section of the paper featuring an attack on ACORN , or the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now , whose voter registration practices have come under fire this election season .
Directing readers to the Web site www.rottenacorn.com, the ad accuses ACORN of a list of abuses that suggest hypocrisy on some of the groupâs signature issues : intimidating and firing its own employees if they try to unionize , misappropriating millions of dollars from taxpayer - funded government grants and advocating minimum wage hikes while paying its own employees less than minimum wage .
The ad does not indicate who or what organization paid for it , but a click to the Rotten Acorn Web site reveals the source — the Employment Policies Institute .
The Institute , not to be confused with the Economic Policy Institute , a liberal think tank , is connected with Rick Berman , a Washington lobbyist who for several years has been fighting ACORNâs efforts to increase the minimum wage at the state and federal levels .
The nonprofit Employment Policies Institute styles itself as a research organization , but recent IRS filings show a combined $ 1.4 million in payments from the nonprofit to Berman and Company , Bermanâs lobbying firm , in 2005 and 2006 .
The Institute , which reported spending $ 4.5 million during those two years , has produced numerous reports arguing that boosting the minimum wage hurts teen workers and frustrates job creation .
Other recent studies assert that increasing the minimum wage would not reduce poverty rates and would benefit two - income families that arenât actually poor .
Berman could not be reached for comment .
Among clients listed on his firmâs web site are the American Beverage Institute , a trade group of bars and restaurants , and the Center for Union Facts , which opposes âcheck cardâ organizing drives by labor .
A USA Today profile compared Berman to a hard - boiled lobbyist lampooned in the movie â Thank You for Smoking , â and the news show â 60 Minutesâ profiled Berman under the title â Dr. Evil.â 
Tim Miller , spokesman for the Employment Policies Institute , said his group timed the ad to take advantage of the flurry of negative publicity about ACORN thanks to attacks from GOP presidential candidate Sen.
John McCain , running mate Sarah Palin and the Republican National Committee .
â While that is important , we wanted to highlight some of their other misdeeds , â Miller said .
â The fact is , on Nov. 5 , a lot of the coverage on ACORN is going to go away , but they are going to continue the same corrupt and fraudulent practices.â 
With less than a week before the election , the appearance of the Times ad is curious for the people at ACORN , who have battled Berman and his clients over minimum wage ballot initiatives in Florida , Missouri , Colorado , Ohio and Arizona , but not over presidential politics .
â What weâve been told is heâs a Republican Party operative above all else , â said Steve Kest , executive director of ACORN .
â He must have been recruited into this effort .
Somebody is paying them to run this ad.â 
Miller said his Institute was not trying to influence the presidential election , but simply point to what he calls ACORNâs continuing misdeeds .
ACORN has had a rough few weeks .
Earlier this month the head of the groupâs Project Vote , Michael Slater , admitted that 400,000 of its new registered voters were rejected by elections officials as duplicates or fraudulent .
Some of the criticism focused on the brother of ACORNâs founder , who was revealed this summer to have embezzled $ 1 million from the group eight years ago .
Kest said accusations of hypocrisy in the ad were untrue .
â At one point there were workers at one of our offices who wanted to form a union , and we invited all of our workers in and pledged complete neutrality , â  he said in response to the union busting charge .
â They decided not to the pursue [ the union ] , so nothing came of it.â 
Kest said ACORN has never paid its workers less than a minimum wage or sued to be exempt from minimum wage laws .
â In the mid 80s , we were involved in some litigation with the state of California around how to count overtime , but none of that was about the minimum wage .
We even eventually withdrew that lawsuit.â 
ACORN has already answered the charges of registration fraud and increased quality control , he said .
Organizers make up to three attempts to contact and verify the identity of people on a registration form .
Problematic forms â like those with Mickey Mouse or other ficticious names , are separated out , he said , but the law in most states requires ACORN to turn them over .
â Itâs not our job to determine if someone is a valid person or not , â  Kest said .
â When the charges first came out I think people were asking questions .
But the facts have come out .
There have been a whole slew of editorials that have put all this in perspective , â  Kest said .
â What I really think is going on is ( the GOP is ) trying to use this as a smokescreen to try to distract from the voter suppression efforts they have been engaged in.â 
Steph Jespersen , director of advertising acceptability for the Times , said the paper does not run âblindâ ads – those without an identifiable sponsor .
If an ad only lists a web site , as did the attack on ACORN , â we insist the ( sponsorâs ) address be on the web site , â Jespersen said .
( Disclosure : The Sandler Foundation , the primary funder of ProPublica , has given money to ACORN , according to tax filings .
The Foundation lists a $ 300,000 contribution in fiscal 2007 to expand ACORN field operations .
Kest estimated that ACORNâs budget last year was $ 20 million . )
What I want to focus on in this essay is one particularly compelling argument for ethanol as a fuel , and to address some common misconceptions .
Ethanol has a high octane rating ( 103 ) , which means it does not easily pre-ignite .
This has the potential to translate into higher fuel efficiencies than can be obtained with gasoline – despite ethanol 's BTU deficit versus gasoline .
I sometimes have to pause and remind people that I am not anti-ethanol .
I think I first made that clear over two years ago with my support for E3 Biofuels ' attempt to produce corn ethanol in a more sustainable fashion .
They were attempting to create a closed - loop system that minimized fossil fuel inputs into the process , but they ultimately went bankrupt ( the move toward sustainability is n't cheap ) .
But politics being what they are , corn ethanol is not going away .
So I do appreciate it when efforts are made to push the process toward higher sustainability .
I believe corn ethanol can be sustainably produced , but probably not on a massive scale .
It will also take a radical shift away from the way most corn ethanol is produced today .
It is known that ethanol added to gasoline normally causes the fuel efficiency of the blend to drop .
A gallon of ethanol contains about 2/3rds of the BTUs ( heating value ) as a gallon of gasoline , and gasoline / ethanol blends normally show the drop in fuel efficiency one would expect .
However , because of ethanol 's resistance to preignition , it should be theoretically possible to design an engine with a much higher compression ratio , which could then extract more useful work from the ethanol .
Diesel engines are designed with high compression ratios , which is the key to their engine efficiencies of 40 - 45 % , versus 25 - 30 % for a gasoline engine .
Let 's take a simple example , to show how ethanol 's BTU deficit could be made up with an increase in engine efficiency .
Gasoline contains about 115,000 BTUs / gallon .
If the engine efficiency is 25 % , then 28,750 BTUs / gallon ultimately power the vehicle .
The rest are expelled as heat .
Ethanol contains about 75,000 BTUs / gallon .
One could in theory achieve the same fuel efficiency with ethanol as with gasoline if an engine was designed with an efficiency that resulted in the same 28,750 BTUs / gallon powering the vehicle ( assuming same weight , frictional losses , etc . )
That means that if the efficiency of the ethanol - powered car was 28,750 / 75,000 - or 38.33 % , then 1 gallon of ethanol could provide the same power to the vehicle as 1 gallon of gasoline could at a 25 % efficiency .
And of course if the efficiency of the ethanol vehicle could be increased further , it is possible to use 1 gallon of ethanol to travel farther than one could travel on 1 gallon of gasoline - despite the BTU deficit .
This has been true in theory , and some small scale engines have been created .
The Saab Biopower , which debuted a couple of years ago , showed that the BTU - deficit could be partially compensated for .
The Saab engine was designed with a higher compression ratio , so that on E - 85 it showed a 12.5 % drop in fuel efficiency instead of the typical 20 - 30 % drop that one typically sees on E - 85 .
The Saab also achieved a reported 20 % extra power and 15 % extra torque from this engine .
But I was recently made aware ( in fact , right here on TOD ) that Swedish automaker Scania has been producing ultra-high compression ratio engines designed for ethanol usage , and they reach engine efficiencies as high as 43 % :
Scania ’s Ethanol Diesel - Engine , Runs On Biodiesel Too
Scania ’s compression - ignition ( CI ) ethanol engine is a modified 9 - liter diesel with a few modifications .
Scania raised the compression ratio from 18:1 to 28:1 , added larger fuel injection nozzles , and altered the injection timing .
The fuel system also needs different gaskets and filters , and a larger fuel tank since the engine burns 65 % to 70 % more ethanol than diesel .
The thermal efficiency of the engine is comparable to a diesel , 43 % compared to 44 % .
That means that if all else was equal ( no significant weight penalty from the high - compression engine ) , a gallon of ethanol could enable a vehicle to travel farther than it could on a gallon of gasoline .
In reality , the comparison is not quite apples and oranges , as these Scania engines are used in heavy , commercial applications .
I wrote to the company a couple of months ago and asked them some questions about any possible plans to produce a smaller engine for passenger vehicles , but they never responded .
While this is all true in theory , it wo n't be achieved with a massive roll - out of E85 capable vehicles .
Why not ?
Because these engines are designed to run on either gasoline or ethanol blends up to E85 .
Therefore , the compression ratio can't be too high , or the ability to run on gasoline would be lost .
The best way to take advantage of the high compression issue would be to develop a fleet of vehicles that can run on pure ethanol , and whose compression ratios are designed specifically for ethanol .
That would mean that these vehicles would be incapable of running on gasoline ( but could perhaps be made to run on diesel ) .
Caveats
I will point out for those who are particularly anal retentive that there are many factors that complicate a comparison of thermal efficiencies of engines to fuel efficiency .
While one fuel may have fewer BTUs and get better fuel economy , the reverse is true as well : A fuel could contain more BTUs and get worse fuel economy .
Fuel economy is a function of the thermal efficiency of an engine , but one must also consider the BTUs in the fuel , the frictional losses throughout the power train , and the size of the vehicle .
I compared thermal efficiency to thermal efficiency in this essay as an approximation , but it is a fair approximation .
Conclusions
As I have said numerous times , my primary opposition to corn ethanol is that only a small fraction of the ethanol that is produced can actually be called renewable .
We primarily recycle fossil fuel into ethanol , and encourage that practice by paying massive subsidies to do it .
This is the norm for corn ethanol , and it is a false solution to our fossil fuel dependence , rife with undesirable consequences .
If we could produce corn ethanol with minimal fossil fuel inputs – as the Brazilians and Indians do with sugarcane ethanol - that would address the majority of my ethanol objections .
There are still thorny issues surrounding soil erosion , aquifer depletion , and the food supply , but let 's not kid ourselves .
Because of the politics of the situation , we are going to continue to produce corn ethanol .
But I would like to see major modifications in the way we subsidize so that we encourage more sustainable practices .
If we do n't , for the next 30 years we will continue to subsidize as we have for the past 30 years – and there wo n't be much incentive for producers to minimize fossil fuel inputs .
That is , until we run short of fossil fuel inputs quicker than we should have because we have been using them to expand the ethanol industry .
But the point of this essay was to address a legitimate urban legend , which is that BTUs tell the whole story .
In reality a modified compression ratio has the potential to give the counter - intuitive result that a fuel with fewer BTUs per gallon can actually provide better fuel efficiency than another few with more BTUs per gallon .
Darryl Hannah , who once played a mermaid , will be joining the hard - line anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd on their annual chase of Japanese whaling ships .
Sea Shepherd is the focus of an Animal Planet Series ,
“ Whale Wars ” .
Hannah will be joining Sea Shepherd on their flagship , the Steve Irwin , as they left yesterday to chase down Japanese whalers and attempt to use non-violent means to stop the whaling .
Sea Shepherd is known for their hard - line stance against whaling and for their pirate - like tactics .
They have in the past been labeled “ eco-terrorists ” and confrontations between whaling ships and the Steve Irwin have sometimes turned violent .
The “ Splash ” star criticized Greenpeace for failing to join in the chase this year .
They are instead shifting towards a focus on changing the attitudes of the Japanese people , where whaling is considered a cultural tradition .
Paul Watson , the Sea Shepherd founder and captain , was an original founder of Greenpeace , but left in 1978 to pursue more aggressive tactics .
Watson is also highly critical of Greenpeace .
“ I call them ‘ the other whaling industry , ” he said .
“ They ’ve raised millions of dollars off the whales for this campaign — and now they ’re not sending a boat .
They should be ashamed . ”
Sea Shepherd spends nearly 5 months every year chasing down Japanese whaling ships , which can bring in over 1000 whales on a good year .
The Sea Shepherd crew uses stink bombs and propeller foils to stop the whaling ships from being able to operate .
Last year , two Sea Shepherd crewmembers boarded a Japanese whaling ship to drum - up media attention .
Animal Planet premiered “ Whale Wars ” on November 7th , a seven - part , hour - long , weekly series , that follows the exploits of Sea Shepherd .
Darryl Hannah , who is joining the whale chase this year , will not be in the series , which follows the chase from last year .
Japanese crew , which whale primarily in Australian waters , are allowed to kill whales in a loophole allowed for scientific research .
The ships often even have signs in English stating that they are doing research , in an attempt to ward of anti-whaling groups .
Whale , however , is a delicacy in Japan .

Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2008 December 18
Explanation : Y Canum Venaticorum ( Y CVn ) is a very rare star in planet Earth 's night sky .
It 's also very red , exhibiting such a remarkable spectrum of light , 19th century astronomer Angelo Secchi dubbed it La Superba .
Located 710 light - years away in northern constellation Canes Venatici ( the Hunting Dogs ) , the star varies in brightness over a period of about half a year .
Near maximum , it becomes just bright enough to see with the unaided eye , but the star 's beautiful red hue is easy to see in binoculars or a small telescope .
In fact , La Superba is among the brightest of the carbon stars - cool , highly evolved red giant stars with exceptional abundances of carbon .
The carbon is created by helium fusion near the stellar core and dredged up into the stars ' outer layers .
The resulting overabundance of simple carbon molecules ( like CO , CN , C2 ) in the atmospheres of carbon stars strongly absorbs bands of bluer light and gives these stars a deep red color .
La Superba is losing its carbon - rich atmosphere into the surrounding interstellar material through a strong stellar wind , and could be near the beginning of a transition to a planetary nebula phase .
Men who are very sexually active in their twenties and thirties are more likely to develop prostate cancer , especially if they masturbate frequently , according to a study of more than 800 men published in the January issue of BJU International .
However the UK research team also found that frequent sexual activity in a man 's forties appears to have little effect and even small levels of activity in a man 's fifties could offer protection from the disease .
Most of the differences were attributed to masturbation rather than sexual intercourse .
The study , led by the University of Nottingham , looked at the sexual practices of more than 431 men who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer before the age of 60 , together with 409 controls .
Men who took part in the study were asked about all aspects of their sex life from their twenties onwards , including how old they were when they became sexually active , how often they masturbated and had intercourse , how many sexual partners they had had and whether they had had any sexually transmitted diseases .
" We were keen to look at the links between sexual activity and younger men as a lot of prostate cancer studies focus on older men as the disease is more prevalent in men over 50 " says lead author Dr Polyxeni Dimitropoulou , who is now at the University of Cambridge .
" Hormones appear to play a key role in prostate cancer and it is very common to treat men with therapy to reduce the hormones thought to stimulate the cancer cells .
A man 's sex drive is also regulated by his hormone levels , so this study examined the theory that having a high sex drive affects the risk of prostate cancer . "
The study participants , who were recruited by their family doctors , were asked to fill in a questionnaire about their sexual habits in each decade of their life since their twenties .
All the men with prostate cancer had been diagnosed in their fifties .
Most of the men who took part in the study ( 97 % ) were white and the majority were currently married ( 84 % ) or widowed , separated or divorced ( 12 % ) .
A number of interesting points came out of the study :
59 % of the men in both groups said that they had engaged in sexual activity ( intercourse or masturbation ) 12 times a month or more in their twenties .
This fell steadily as they got older , to 48 % in their thirties , 28 % in their forties and 13 % in their fifties .
39 % of the cancer group had had six female partners or more , compared with 31 % of the control group .
Men with prostate cancer were more likely to have had a sexually transmitted disease than those without prostate cancer .
More men with prostate cancer fell into the highest frequency groups in each decade when it came to sexual activity ( intercourse and masturbation ) than men in the control group .
40 % of men in the cancer group fell into the highest frequency category in their twenties ( 20 or more times a month ) compared to 32 % in the control group .
Similar patterns were observed in the men's thirties and forties .
By the fifties it had evened out , with 31 % in each group falling into the most frequent category ( ten or more times a month ) .
Men with prostate cancer were also more likely to masturbate frequently than men in the control group , with the greatest difference in the twenties ( 34 % versus 24 % ) and thirties ( 41 % versus 31 % ) .
The differences were less pronounced in their forties ( 34 % versus 28 % ) and by the fifties the cancer group was slightly lower ( 25 % versus 26 % ) .
" What makes our study stand out from previous research is that we focused on a younger age group than normal and included both intercourse and masturbation at various stages in the participants ' lives " says Dr Dimitropoulou .
" Overall we found a significant association between prostate cancer and sexual activity in a man 's twenties and between masturbation and prostate cancer in the twenties and thirties .
However there was no significant association between sexual activity and prostate cancer in a man 's forties .
" A possible explanation for the protective effect that men in their fifties appear to receive from overall sexual activity , and particularly masturbation , is that the release of accumulated toxins during sexual activity reduces the risk of developing cancer in the prostate area .
This theory has , however , not been firmly established and further research is necessary . "

They said , “ Go west , ” but many Californians are going north and east .
For the fourth year in a row , more residents left the Golden State than moved here from other states , according to a report released Wednesday by the California Department of Finance .
The outflow -- last seen during the economic and social struggles of the 1990s -- started when it became too expensive for most people to buy homes in the state , and has kept going throughout the bust with the loss of so many jobs .
The trend underscores the state ’s sour economy as layoffs continue , the fiscal strain on government grows and home values continue to decline .

Though more births and rising international immigration helped boost California ’s population a modest 1.16 % last year , the state continued its steady stream of domestic out - migration -- the movement to other states of people who live here .
During the last fiscal year , 135,173 more people moved out of California than moved in from other states .
Though just a drop in the bucket for a state of 38 million people , the trend remains significant because such declines usually occur when working Californians decide better opportunities lie elsewhere .
“ I just gave up , ” said Grace Bryant , a former Glendora resident who fled to Texas after 18 months without consistent employment as a residential appraiser .
“ California is too much of a struggle . ”
Like Bryant , many of those who left California went to Texas , according to truck rental company U - Haul International Inc. ; other popular states were Nevada , Arizona and Washington .
Advertisement
The company said that , as of late November , 0.5 % more rentals were hired this year to leave the state than to move into it -- 0.2 percentage points higher than last year ’s figure .
Before writing the state ’s obituary , however , critics might note that a study released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center bolsters the notion of California ’s high desirability , showing that most native Californians prefer to remain in the state .
Though California is often depicted as a bastion for the rootless , 69 % of native residents 18 and over still live here -- showing stability exceeded only by Texas , North Carolina and Georgia .
Still , the departure for other states of so many residents is serious enough to concern policymakers , who worry about the drubbing that California is taking in the recession .

The current spate of domestic out - migration began in 2005 after six years of continual domestic growth .
The trend coincided with the developing housing bubble , which peaked in 2007 when median home values in Southern California reached $ 505,000 .
“ This was the epicenter of the housing meltdown , ” said John Husing of Economics & Politics Inc. , a regional economic research firm .
“ People started leaving California because of housing prices -- particularly younger couples that just could n’t afford to buy a house . ”
But then the bubble burst and Californians were faced with a new crisis -- joblessness .
The state ’s 8.2 % unemployment rate is 1.5 percentage points higher than the national rate .
Advertisement
The Riverside , San Bernardino and Ontario area -- one of the areas hit worst by the real estate collapse -- features the highest unemployment rate of any large metropolitan area in the country at 9.5 % .
The Los Angeles , Long Beach and Santa Ana area is fifth - worst at 7.7 % .
“ I think [ last year ’s out - migration ] was because of the very high unemployment , ” Husing said .
“ That ’s what will be driving it now .
There ’s no question we ’ll continue to see people leave . ”
Fourteen years ago , California was in the middle of another job crisis .
The aerospace industry had folded , jettisoning highly trained workers and crippling the local economy built around them .
Advertisement
In 1994 , 362,374 more people left the state than moved in .
The decline would not reverse course until 1998 .
Husing said more people left California during that downturn compared with the current one because there were aerospace jobs in other states .
But workers in construction , real estate and related fields hurt in the current downturn have no place to go .
“ Where are you going to work in construction anywhere in the country now ? ” Husing said .
Bryant , the residential appraiser who moved to Texas , said she did not want to leave California .
She simply could no longer afford to stay .
Advertisement
“ I miss Old Town Pasadena and the dog park in San Dimas , ” said Bryant , 51 , whose sister and former husband also left Southern California for Frisco , a suburb of Dallas .
“ But what else am I going to miss ?
The traffic ?
Graffiti ? ”
The string of out - migration has added fuel to a decades - old debate about California ’s perceived decline .
In an article last month in the American magazine , urban historian Joel Kotkin contended that the loss of residents reflected a state in trouble .
He blamed a Byzantine state government system , a failure to identify the housing crisis and a growing division between rich and poor .
“ Today our Golden State appears headed , if not for imminent disaster , then toward an unanticipated , maddening and largely unnecessary mediocrity , ” Kotkin wrote .

Historian and author Mike Davis , whose 1990 book “ City of Quartz ” seemed to foreshadow the social chaos that erupted with the 1992 L.A. riots , said he felt a similar undercurrent of anxiety today because of a dearth of reliable jobs .
“ There ’s a very large population who are trapped with nowhere to go forward , ” Davis said .
Husing dismissed the pessimism .
The native Californian said the state had always priced out the working class and been an expensive place to do business , yet it continued to reinvent itself through innovation and entrepreneurship .

“ It ’s the hallmark of the California economy , ” Husing said .
“ We attract risk takers .
Immigrants from all over the world come here . ”

The first Dunkirk : 200 years ago , the entire British Army was almost obliterated in a horrific retreat .
One man 's courage saved the day - so why has his name been erased from history ?
Starving , bitterly cold and exhausted , the British soldiers trudged on through the snow .
Their uniforms hanging in tatters , they hobbled barefoot along a road strewn with the dead and dying .
Officers , themselves in rags , urged on their men , sometimes at bayonet point .
For if anyone fell behind or lay down to rest he would soon join the corpses at the roadside , killed by the cold or the enemy who pursued them relentlessly .
That enemy had already overrun most of Europe .
Country after country had fallen to its armies , commanded by a dictator determined to conquer the continent .
Now Napoleon stood ready to claim his ultimate prize - the utter destruction of the British Army .
Death march : During the retreat , men stumbled over their comrades as they walked
Vastly outnumbered and weakened after weeks of trudging through the cold , the British expeditionary force that had been sent to challenge the French Emperor was facing almost certain death .
Their only hope was to reach the coast and escape by ship .
But that was a journey of 250 miles , through some of the most gruelling terrain on the continent .
Enfeebled as they were , it would be an almost suicidal voyage .
Yet it was the only plan
they had .
And so began an ordeal as horrific as it was inspiring - an epic race from annihilation every bit as remarkable as that at Dunkirk , more than a century later .
But outside military circles , the Corunna retreat - as it came to be called - is little known .
That seems a great injustice .
What took place in those desperate weeks , almost exactly 200 years ago , was an extraordinary feat of endurance and one that should be recognised as among the finest - and the darkest - hours of the British Army .
The British troops who marched into Spain at the beginning of November 1808 were in high spirits .
They had beaten the French three months earlier at the Battle of Vimiero in Portugal .
Now they were to be allowed another crack at them .
Napoleon had sent his army into Spain some months earlier , putting his brother Joseph on the throne in place of the Spanish royal family .
But he had reckoned without the Spanish people , who rose up violently against their French occupiers .
The British government pledged to help the Spanish drive the French from their land .
To that end , Lieutenant General Sir John Moore was given command of a force of 20,000 to head for Spain , with 12,000 more to follow .
It was , as the Foreign Secretary
Lord Canning remarked : ' Not merely a considerable part of the dispensable force of this country .
It is , in fact , the British Army . '
This haunted Moore .
General John Moore :
Why have his name and brave deeds been forgotten ?
He had other reasons to be anxious .
Moore was a successful career soldier , handsome and intellectual with a reputation for bravery and humanity .
But he was also a blunt speaker who had alienated the very politicians whose support he needed .
His instructions from Lord Castlereagh , the War Secretary , were vague , telling him merely to ' co- operate ' with the Spanish .
The Treasury had not given him enough money to buy essential supplies , while a lack of transport carts meant that much heavy baggage had to be left behind when they landed in Portugal .
The Commissariat , the civilian department in charge of procuring and distributing rations for the troops , was , he complained , hopelessly inexperienced : ' They talked of going into Spain as if going into Hyde Park . '
Equally worrying , many of his soldiers had become drunken and unfit during the weeks of inaction .
Moore 's maps and intelligence were just as unreliable : he was fed conflicting information about the whereabouts , strength and intentions of his Spanish allies and the French .
The farther he went into Spain , the less evidence he saw of the Spanish resistance fighters he had been promised would help him tackle the French .
' If the British Army were in an enemy 's country , it could not be more completely left to itself , ' he wrote .
After much deliberation , he pressed on , heading north to attack a French army under Marshal Soult , the ' Duke of Damnation ' .
He hoped to distract the French , relieving pressure on Spanish rebels in the south while striking a blow for British honour .
Meanwhile , Napoleon was pouring more soldiers into Spain , taking personal command of his armies to challenge Moore , whom he decreed was ' the only general now worthy to contend with me ' .
His plan was to overwhelm the British through sheer force of numbers and wipe out the Army for good .
' If only these 20,000 were 100,000 ! ' Napoleon exclaimed .
' If only more English mothers could feel the horrors of war !'
By mid-December , the British had reached the village of Sahagun , where they planned to rest before the battle that awaited them .
The men had been marching 11 hours a day , through thick snow , carrying 60 lb each on their backs .
Already , many had dropped dead from fatigue .
With them marched 1,200 soldiers ' wives and children , who had accompanied the Army into Spain , ignoring Moore 's order to stay behind .
But morale remained high .
On the night of December 23 , the Army began heading out of Sahagun to tackle Marshal Soult 's forces .
' We longed for blood , ' a young Rifleman , Benjamin Harris , said later .
But a few hours into their march , messengers were seen galloping furiously down the column .
Moments later , officers gave the order to halt and turn around .
The men , furious at being denied a battle , marched in a surly silence back to Sahagun .
The soldiers were not told the reason for the sudden change of plan : Moore had just learned that on top of the threat from Soult 's army , Napoleon was heading towards him with 40,000 men .
Isolated and outnumbered , he felt he had no choice but to run for the safety of the coast , 250 miles away .
War secretary Lord Castlereagh , whose instructions were too vague for accurate interpretation
So early on Christmas Eve , the Army , and its women and children , began their long retreat .
Some men had frostbite , others had been four days or more without food .
It was , recalled an officer , ' the most miserable Christmas Day I ever passed ' .
On they pressed , the roads growing ever more potholed , the soldiers soaked to the skin .
There were no rations as the Commissariat lagged far behind , so they resorted to taking food by force .
Word soon spread , and far from helping the British , the locals in every town took to burying their possessions in the ground to prevent them being seized .
As for other essential army equipment , it was burnt because it could not be transported over the steep mountain roads that came next .
Shoes , stockings , blankets , salted meat and biscuits , all of which would be needed in the following days , were thrown on bonfires to deny them to the pursuing French .
Yet remarkably , the men still hungered for battle .
Indeed , as the Army left the town of Benavente , the hussars fought a bloody but victorious battle against a small contingent of 600 French Imperial Guard .
Given such success , the soldiers could not understand why they were not allowed to face the French in a proper battle .
Moore refused to explain the reason for his retreat - that they had not one , but two armies on their tail .
The mood in the ranks grew mutinous .
General ' Black Bob ' Craufurd , the stern commander of the 1st Light Brigade , kept his men in check by flogging those who disobeyed orders , but in many units discipline fell apart .
Those too exhausted to go on simply lay down in the snow to await death .
At each town they came to , finding no food and hostile inhabitants , starving soldiers would go on the rampage .
At one rare halt beside a field , Rifleman Harris and his comrades scrabbled in the frozen earth for turnips .
Soon after , Harris saw a soldier 's wife , reduced to a ' moving corpse ' , dragging along a little boy of seven or eight who was screaming with exhaustion .
' The mother could no longer raise the child in her arm .
At last the little fellow had not even the strength to cry .
But , with mouth wide open , they stumbled onwards , until both sank , to rise no more . '
Another sergeant remembered seeing women who , 'in the unconquerable energy of maternal love , would toil on with one or two children on their back ; till on looking round , they perceived that the hapless objects of their attachment were frozen to death ' .
But still , on they marched .
On New Year 's Day the rearguard finally reached the town of Bembibre .
The divisions that had passed through earlier had left a trail of destruction and a thousand men , women and children lying in the streets , many of them too enfeebled or drunk to move , abandoned as the column marched on .
Shortly afterwards , a regiment of French dragoons galloped through the stragglers , slashing swords at the drunken forms on the ground .
Fleeing in terror , a few horribly butchered survivors , their ears lopped off , flesh ' hanging off in collops ' , managed to catch up with their comrades on the road ahead .
Moore had them paraded as a warning against straggling .
By now Napoleon had returned to Paris , leaving the pursuit to Soult 's army alone .
Every time Soult 's troops came up against the British , they were beaten back .
Even the
British stragglers fought bravely when faced with the French enemy , who nicknamed them les squelettes feroces ( the fierce skeletons ) .
Emboldened by such skirmishes , Moore finally decided to make a stand and face his pursuers in formal battle at the town of Lugo .
The morale of his bloodthirsty troops soared .
But Soult , awaiting reinforcements , would not give battle .
Desperately short of food , Moore could not wait .
So , to his men's disgust , he pushed on through the mountains , determined to reach the coast before his troops fell apart entirely .

Corunna was now only 60 miles away , but this would be the worst stretch of the retreat .
One night , the Army became separated in a hailstorm on a mountainside ; hundreds perished .
Another night , many were lost on a 36 - hour forced march .
The roads became streaked with blood from barefoot soldiers and shoeless horses .
Men stumbled over the corpses of their comrades .
It had become a march of death .
Rifleman Harris passed a soldier 's wife and her husband , collapsed from exhaustion , lying in each other 's arms in the snow .
' I knew them , but it was impossible to help , ' he later recalled .
Augustus Schaumann , a supplies commissar , saw a woman fall up to her waist in a bog .
Rather than help her out , the men behind marched over her head as she sank .
Other women took shelter in a barn , but were found by an enemy patrol and raped .
Yet amid such horrors , there were moments of humanity .
One officer , unable to continue , was about to shoot himself when he saw the body of a soldier 's wife and beside it a tiny baby , still alive .
He covered her body and took the baby on to Corunna .
Other soldiers came across a young woman lying dead , her six - month - old baby trying desperately to feed at her frozen breast .
' Tears filled every eye , but no one had the power to aid , ' one of them later recorded .
A staff officer duly gathered the baby up in his cloak , saying : ' Unfortunate infant , you will be in my future care . '
On January 11 , what remained of the Army finally hobbled into Corunna , shoeless , ragged , suffering dysentery and hunger , but buoyed by thoughts of home .
Five thousand lives had been lost on the retreat .
Alas , the evacuation fleet was stuck at sea and it was four days before the embarkation could begin .
The cavalry were due to board first , but most of the horses were too weak to travel .
They were shot , pushed over cliffs or had their throats slit .
Then , just as the infantry were about to embark , Soult 's army appeared on the horizon .
Moore was delighted : here was his chance to salvage some glory from the horrors of the march .
When the fighting began , he galloped from one position to the next , directing the battle , issuing orders and encouragement .
As he was urging on one regiment , he was hit by a cannon shot that carried away his left shoulder , leaving his arm hanging by the flesh .
He did not utter a sound , but was carried from the field bleeding profusely .
By nightfall both sides had fought each other to a standstill , though French losses were twice those of the British .
It was not a victory , but it had bought the British enough time to secure their evacuation .
As Moore lay dying , he was told his army was saved .
The second Dunkirk : Men wait to be rescued from the beaches , similarly to the British retreat led by General John Moore
Hours later , the evacuation at last began .
As the men clambered aboard the ships , Moore 's body was buried , wrapped in his military cloak , beneath the city 's ramparts .
It was left to Marshal Soult himself , who entered the town two days later , to order a plinth to be erected over the spot where Moore had fallen .
Back in England , when the filthy , emaciated troops landed on the beaches after two weeks at sea , their wounds crawling with maggots , suffering typhus and dysentery , an outcry was raised .
Once those who had fallen in that final battle were counted , 7,000 men had been lost , not to mention women and children .
What had gone wrong ?
Politicians who had sent Moore 's army to war so ill - equipped heaped opprobrium on the General , distancing themselves from the disaster .
Yet despite the appalling losses , Moore had , to a degree , succeeded in his mission .
He had distracted and exhausted the French , enabling the Spanish rebellion to gather strength .
And the remnants of the British Army were preserved to fight another day .
A few months later the Army returned , this time under Sir Arthur Wellesley ( later the Duke of Wellington ) and , after five more years of fighting , chased the French from Spain and defeated Napoleon for good .
Wellington acknowledged the debt he owed Moore , saying : ' We 'd not have won , I think , without him . '
Napoleon himself admitted : ' It was only Moore 's action which stopped me taking Spain and Portugal . '
Yet today , few outside his native Glasgow have even heard of him .
Honouring his memory is left instead to the townspeople of Corunna who this year , as every year , will commemorate his courage and his sacrifice in a special ceremony .

A state lawmaker says she will propose a ban on lead bullets for hunting in Minnesota .

Beth Siverhus has hunted deer since 1976 .
The Warroad , Minn. , woman also spends time rehabilitating injured birds .
She 'd never really connected those two activities until this year , when she saw several eagles die from lead poisoning .
She believes they likely ingested the lead while eating piles of deer guts left in the woods by hunters .
" It 's a pretty sick feeling to realize I could have been doing something to both contaminate the food we eat , and make wildlife sick that are feeding on the gut piles , " said Siverhus .
" It 's heartbreaking to see these eagles reduced to nothing .
They can't stand , they can't fly .
It 's no way to die . "
Some Minnesota food shelves stopped accepting venison this year after lead fragments were found in the meat .
Despite that , Siverhus was skeptical of the danger posed to humans by lead fragments in venison .
But dying eagles , added to potential danger to humans , changed her mind .
Starting next year , she will use copper ammunition .
" This is within our environment , and we need to find a way to curtail it . "
" From what I 've read on the Internet , copper works quite well as a substitute but it 's more expensive .
However , I shoot one or two bullets a year so it 's not much of a sacrifice for me , " said Siverhus .
" I understand that hunters find this difficult .
I found it difficult .
But I believe it 's time to change . "
But should lead bullets be banned ?
State Rep. Sandy Masin , DFL - Eagan , says yes .
Masin has n't worked out the details of her legislation , but she thinks there should be a ban or significant restrictions on the use of lead bullets .
" We know that it 's impacting the death of birds , and we also know we 've been working really hard to keep lead from our children , " said Masin .
" Somehow there has to be a way .
This is within our environment and we need to find a way to curtail it . "
Mark Johnson , executive director of the Minnesota Deer Hunters Association , does n't agree .
" I do n't think there 's a need for government regulation , and I do n't think there 's a traumatic influence here that is needing government regulation , " Johnson said .
Johnson says there 's no question that lead is a neurotoxin , but he says there 's not enough research to show lead bullet fragments are poisoning people .
" Yeah , we have lead fragmentation in venison .
It 's in small amounts .
The exposure is limited .
So is it really a problem ?
The answer seems to be no at this point , " said Johnson .
For the 2008 deer hunt , Johnson used a type of copper covered bullet .
He says it worked well , but was less accurate than lead bullets he used in the past .
Some hunters Johnson has talked with are happy with the copper bullets , while others still have a strong preference for lead ammunition .
Until there 's stronger evidence of the danger posed by lead fragments in venison , the choice should be up to hunters , not the state , in Johnson 's opinion .
He would like to see more research before there 's talk of banning lead bullets .
Rep .
Masin agrees there should be more research .
But for her , there 's already enough evidence that lead fragments are a danger to humans and to birds such as eagles .
Masin expects to have a bill restricting the use of lead bullets ready to be heard early in the upcoming legislative session .
Midlife coffee drinking can decrease the risk of dementia / Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) later in life .
This conclusion is made in a Finnish Cardiovascular Risk Factors , Aging and Dementia ( CAIDE ) Study published in the January 2009 issue of the Journal of Alzheimer 's Disease ( Volume 16:1 ) .
This study has been conducted at the University of Kuopio , Finland in collaboration with Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden , and the National Public Health Institute , Helsinki , Finland .
The study included participants from the survivors of population - based cohorts previously surveyed within the North Karelia Project and the FINMONICA study in 1972 , 1977 , 1982 or 1987 ( midlife visit ) .
After an average follow - up of 21 years , 1409 individuals ( 71 % ) aged 65 to 79 completed the re-examination in 1998 .
A total of 61 cases were identified as demented ( 48 with AD ) .
" We aimed to study the association between coffee and tea consumption at midlife and dementia / AD risk in late - life , because the long - term impact of caffeine on the central nervous system was still unknown , and as the pathologic processes leading to Alzheimer 's disease may start decades before the clinical manifestation of the disease , " says lead researcher , associate professor Miia Kivipelto , from the University of Kuopio , Finland and Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden .
At the midlife examination , the consumption of coffee and tea was assessed with a previously validated semi-quantitative food - frequency questionnaire .
Coffee drinking was categorized into three groups : 0 - 2 cups ( low ) , 3 - 5 cups ( moderate ) and > 5 cups ( high ) per day .
Further , the question concerning tea consumption was dichotomized into those not drinking tea ( 0 cup / day ) vs. those drinking tea ( ≥1 cup / day ) .
The study found that coffee drinkers at midlife had lower risk for dementia and AD later in life compared to those drinking no or only little coffee .
The lowest risk ( 65 % decreased ) was found among moderate coffee drinkers ( drinking 3 - 5 cups of coffee / day ) .
Adjustments for various confounders did not change the results .
Tea drinking was relatively uncommon and was not associated with dementia / AD .
Kivipelto also notes that , " Given the large amount of coffee consumption globally , the results might have important implications for the prevention of or delaying the onset of dementia / AD .
The finding needs to be confirmed by other studies , but it opens the possibility that dietary interventions could modify the risk of dementia / AD .
Also , identification of mechanisms of how coffee exerts its protection against dementia / AD might help in the development of new therapies for these diseases . "

After years of bemoaning the decline of a literary culture in the United States , the National Endowment for the Arts says in a report that it now believes a quarter - century of precipitous decline in fiction reading has reversed .
The report , “ Reading on the Rise : A New Chapter in American Literacy , ” being released Monday , is based on data from “ The Survey of Public Participation in the Arts ” conducted by the United States Census Bureau in 2008 .
Among its chief findings is that for the first time since 1982 , when the bureau began collecting such data , the proportion of adults 18 and older who said they had read at least one novel , short story , poem or play in the previous 12 months has risen .
The news comes as the publishing industry struggles with declining sales amid a generally difficult economy .
The proportion of adults reading some kind of so - called literary work  just over half  is still not as high as it was in 1982 or 1992 , and the proportion of adults reading poetry and drama continued to decline .
Nevertheless the proportion of overall literary reading increased among virtually all age groups , ethnic and demographic categories since 2002 .
It increased most dramatically among 18 - to - 24 - year - olds , who had previously shown the most significant declines .

TOKYO ( Reuters Life ! ) -
When Koji Nakamura mixes up a margarita cocktail , he adds a special ingredient -- mayonnaise .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
“ Mayogarita ” , a white drink with a hint of the creamy dressing , is one of several cocktails Nakamura serves in his “ Mayonnaise Kitchen ” restaurant in suburban Tokyo , which features mayonnaise on everything from toast and spaghetti to fondue .
Despite its Western heritage , mayonnaise has become the condiment of choice for many young Japanese , who add it to everything from sushi , noodles and tempura .
While older Japanese might gag at the thought of mayonnaise on rice or savory pancakes , the young are slathering it on .
They even have a name for mayo fanatics : “ mayolers ” .
“ People keep discovering various ways to cook food with mayonnaise , ” Nakamura said .
“ If you put it on raw tuna fish with red flesh , it tastes like medium - fatty tuna fish .
That kind of unpredictability makes it interesting and popular . ”
In 2006 , Japanese consumed 1.65 kg ( 3.6 lb ) of mayonnaise per person , down from a peak of 1.90 kg in 2000 , according to the Japan Mayonnaise and Dressing Makers ’ Association .
Nakamura ’s tiny restaurant , with fewer than a dozen tables and decorated with cut-outs shaped like mayonnaise bottles , also offers “ Mayoty Dog ” , which tastes like the vodka - based cocktail Salty Dog but is served in a glass with mayonnaise on its rim instead of salt .
Patrons of the seven - year - old restaurant can buy their own bottle of mayonnaise for 300 yen ( $ 2.53 ) -- similar to bars that keep regular customers ’ bottles of whisky or sake .
“ I know it ’s rich , but I like the taste , ” said 22 - year - old Mayumi Kameoka .
“ My friends and I used to put a lot of mayonnaise on bite - sized fried chicken at our school cafeteria . ”
“ MAYOLER ” MANIA
Japanese mayonnaise , first produced in 1925 , is creamier and tangier than its Western counterpart , and includes only egg yolks , not whites , with varying amounts of oil and vinegar to alter the taste .
Manufacturers provide a constant stream of recipes that involve the dressing , helping to make it a staple in most Japanese refrigerators .
“ It has a good flavor , ” said Akira Omori , 32 , who likes to put mayonnaise on dried squid and other snacks .
Health - conscious Japanese are , however , starting to eat less of the dressing , prompting manufacturers to introduce low - calorie versions , including one that says it reduces cholesterol levels .
Mayonnaise lovers also got some bad news when No.1 Japanese mayonnaise maker Q.P. Corp ’s lifted prices in June for the first time in 17 years due to higher vegetable oil prices .
Right now , though , Nakamura of “ Mayonnaise Kitchen ” is more worried about a summer heat wave seems to be dampening customers ’ appetites than the future .
“ I see people going into a soba noodle shop downstairs .
I can understand that , ” he said .
During the 2004 federal - election campaign , I interviewed a brainy economic consultant named Kwangyul Peck , who was running for the Liberals in Port Moody - Westwood - Port Coquitlam .
Peck suggested that if Stephen Harper became prime minister , some residents of the riding would lose their homes .
It was an astonishing claim -- and it was ridiculed by his Conservative opponent , James Moore , now the Minister of Canadian Heritage .
Today , the Harper government will include a $ 34 - billion deficit in its budget .
Some right - of - centre governments - - notably the George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan administrations , as well as the Brian Mulroney regime -- have demonstrated a knack for running up huge deficits , forcing future politicians to take draconian actions to address the imbalance .
These right wingers bled the beast -- which is how they see government -- so there was nothing left for their successors to work with .
It appears as though Stephen Harper is no different --- though , to be fair , he is being egged on to go into deficit spending by the federal Liberals , NDP , and Bloc Quebecois .
On budget day , I felt it was worth reviewing Peck 's key points during the 2004 campaign :
* Harper 's proposed tax cuts at that time would sharply reduce government revenues .
( After becoming prime minister in 2006 , Harper cost the treasury billions by shaving two points off the Goods and Services Tax .
Expect more tax cuts in today 's budget . )
* Peck predicted that Harper would jack up military spending and increase health spending .
* As a result , Peck claimed , the economy would have to grow by 38 percent per year to keep the country out of deficit after the expenditure increases and tax cuts .
Peck said that this was not likely to occur .
That meant deficit financing : the government would have to borrow to pay for its operations .
* " The minute Harper gets into power and starts borrowing money , the interest rate will go up , " Peck predicted .
" The minute people in New York realize what Harper 's up to , they start dumping Canadian dollars . "
* Peck forecast that the Bank of Canada would have to defend the Canadian dollar by increasing interest rates .
This is exactly precisely what happened during the Mulroney years , which hammered real - estate markets when homeowners were faced with higher monthly mortgage payments .
* Peck suggested that interest rates could double or triple thanks to Harper 's fiscal policies , causing people in Port Moody - Westwood - Port Coquitlam to lose their homes .
Four years later , the stakes are very high with this budget .
Some economists , such as Princeton 's Paul Krugman , have argued that massive stimulus packages are necessary to prevent a depression .
Others have expressed fears that governments around the world will dump taxpayers ' money into dying industries , offering few long - term benefits .
We saw that in B.C. in the late 1990s when Glen Clark 's NDP government poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Skeena Cellulose , which operated a pulp mill in Prince Rupert .
Can Harper be trusted to do the right thing for the country or will he choose the politically expedient thing when he brings in his deficit ?
To date , he has n't demonstrated a great appetite for the types of expenditures that stimulate employment and boost productivity , such as daycare and postsecondary education .
So far , we have n't seen any indication that he 's ready to move in any new direction in these areas .

Michelle Malkin , and her commenters , are complaining that Obama supporters have desecrated the flag .
She ’s right , of course – that ’s technically flag desecration , and she ’s got the Flag Code section quoted to prove it .
But if you ’re all pissed off about that , how about Olympic athletes wrapping themselves in the flag ?
Or flag napkins ?
Or a car painted as a flag ?
Flying a flag in the rain or leaving it up overnight unlit ?
Flag beach towels ?
Flags on campaign buttons ?
In every case , that ’s mistreatment of the U.S. flag , according to the Flag Code .
According to the US Code , Title 4 , Chapter 1 , Section 8 , “ Respect for the flag ” :
( b) The flag should never touch anything beneath it , such as the ground , the floor , water , or merchandise .
So much for those beach towels .
(d) The flag should never be used as wearing apparel , bedding , or drapery
( j) No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform .
And so much for flag clothing .
(h) The flag should never be used as a receptacle for receiving , holding , carrying , or delivering anything .
( i) It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like , printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard .
And there goes those campaign buttons , napkins , cups , and plates .
(e) The flag should never be fastened , displayed , used , or stored in such a manner as to permit it to be easily torn , soiled , or damaged in any way .
And given how dirty cars get ( pigeons , insects , road grime , slush ) , you ’d think that a flag paint job on a car would qualify as “ easily soiled . ”
As for displaying the flag , let ’s not forget that all - weather flags are OK in bad weather , but no flag should be displayed unlit overnight – it ’s disrespectful , and against US Code Title 4 Chapter 1 Section 6 .
Tell you what – you do n’t question the patriotism of Obama ’s supporters and I wo n’t question the patriotism of all the Olympic athletes who have soiled a flag with their sweat , of all the swimmers who have lain on a flag beach towel , of all the patriots who throw millions of flags away on the Fourth of July every year .
Deal ?

Once again , Schlitz is being brewed and bottled in Milwaukee - at the MillerCoors brewery .
That 's the word from Pabst Brewing Co. , which owns the Schlitz brand and contracts with MillerCoors LLC to brew it .
Pabst in 2007 test marketed the old formula for Schlitz , which Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co. changed in the 1970s - a factor that contributed to that company 's demise in 1982 .
Pabst dubbed it " Classic 1960s formula , " and made it available in bottles in Minneapolis and Tampa , Fla .
That marked the first time Schlitz was sold in bottles in several years .
The bottled Schlitz has a fuller flavor than the Schlitz sold in cans , and the formula change - along with a nostalgia - driven marketing campaign - drew attention .
In 2008 , Pabst rolled out bottled Schlitz in more local markets , including Chicago and Milwaukee .
Pabst still contracts to brew canned Schlitz at other facilities .
But the bottled version is replacing canned Schlitz as it's introduced in local markets , said Pabst spokesman Mark Treichel .
Most of those are in the Midwest , within relatively close proximity of the Milwaukee brewery .
The " classic " Schlitz markets include Columbus , Ohio , and Detroit .
In Wisconsin , it can be found in Madison , La Crosse , Eau Claire and Wausau , Treichel said .
The " classic " Schlitz had been brewed and bottled at the MillerCoors facility in Eden , N.C. Production this month shifted to Milwaukee , where special equipment to provide the beer 's hops was installed last fall , Treichel said .
The production shift has not resulted in any new jobs at the Milwaukee brewery , said MillerCoors spokesman Julian Green .
Bottled Schlitz sales in the second half of 2008 helped Pabst mark its best sales trend since 1999 , according to trade publication Beer Marketer 's Insights .
Also helping was the continued revival of Pabst Blue Ribbon .
Schlitz sales totaled an estimated 115,000 barrels in 2007 , with a slight increase in 2008 because of the launch of bottled Schlitz in Chicago and Milwaukee , said Eric Shephard , executive editor of Beer Market 's Insights .
That 's a pittance compared to the brand 's peak sales of over 15 million barrels annually in the mid-1970s .
Those sales , however , began tumbling after the formula change and other changes affected the taste of Schlitz and led many of its customers to switch to other beers .
Based in suburban Chicago , Pabst is now a marketing company that owns dozens of old - line beer brands , which are brewed under contract by MillerCoors and others .
The company 's brands include Heileman 's Old Style , Old Milwaukee and Stroh's .
ANAHEIM , Calif . --
The city of Anaheim is dropping its legal challenges to the name of the Angels .
Mayor Curt Pringle says the City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to give up its battle to restore the team 's name to the Anaheim Angels .
The city had argued that team owner Arte Moreno violated the city - owned stadium lease agreement when he changed the name to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in 2005 .
A California appeals court ruled against the city last month , and an Orange County Superior court jury sided with the team in 2006 .
Pringle says city leaders believe the wrong court decision was made twice , but says " it 's in everybody 's best interest to take no further action . "

OJO DE AGUA , Mexico , Jan 23 ( Reuters ) - A Mexican drug suspect has confessed to dissolving the bodies of 300 rivals with corrosive chemicals near the U.S. border , in a claim highlighting the brutality of Mexico 's drug war .
Santiago Meza , known as " The Stew Maker , " told journalists he did away with bodies in industrial drums on the outskirts of the violent city of Tijuana .
More than 700 people died in Tijuana last year as rival gangs battled for control of the city 's lucrative drug trade .
Many others are missing and believed dead after being abducted .
The suspect , who was paraded before journalists by the army on Friday , said he was paid $ 600 a week by a breakaway faction of the Arellano Felix cartel to dispose of slain rivals with caustic soda , a highly corrosive substance .
" They brought me the bodies and I just got rid of them , " Meza said at a construction site where he said he dissolved 300 corpses last year .
" I did n't feel anything . "
The bodies took 24 hours to dissolve but left some remains that were dumped in a nearby pit , Meza said .
A high - ranking army officer told Reuters he believed Meza , who was arrested with three other people on Thursday , was telling the truth .
Police have previously recovered human remains burned with acid in and around the city .
Meza , 45 , said he had been getting rid of bodies for 10 years .
" May they forgive me , " he said , surrounded by heavily armed soldiers .
The spiraling violence of Mexico 's drug war has cast a pall over the country and presents a huge challenge to President Felipe Calderon , who has deployed thousands of troops to crush the cartels .
The drug war claimed 5,700 lives across Mexico last year , more than double the number of victims in 2007 .

The sea change often comes at night , its signals to the sailor subtle ones , but sometimes large and sudden .
This has been a pre-inaugural period of extravagant speculation by Barack Obama supporters , with an unprecedented investment of hope - and also of anxiety , as if , after this , there might not be another chance .
More than one Obama supporter has warned himself , or secretly assumed , in the aftermath of the celebration of Obama 's victory , " now prepare to be disappointed . "
Obama has luck , but on the record of his career it has been earned luck , the best kind .
For that reason , the most heartening news item I have seen during the entire pre-inaugural period was published in the International Herald Tribune on Jan. 14 , six days before the presidential inauguration .
It reported that the president - elect " has signaled to top military commanders that he is not satisfied with their timetable for a reduction of American troops in Iraq and has asked for options to accelerate the withdrawal . "
Obama campaigned on a promise to have all American combat troops out of Iraq by May 2010 , 16 months after he takes office .
Last month , a Pentagon delegation discussed the matter with the president - elect , and afterward its members said they had told him that his schedule was not realistic .
The Iraq government had to be protected , American troops were needed for security , the future was uncertain .
...
This was not the first instance of military defiance .
Under George Bush , there were calculated leaks from the military to the press that the deadlines for departure agreed to by the Bush administration in its negotiation of an Iraq status - of - forces agreement were unsatisfactory .
That document required all U.S. combat troops to be out of Iraq 's cities by May of this year , and the rest of American troops gone by the end of 2011 .
After it was signed , there were off - the - record comments to the press that " combat troops " is an elastic category ; removing equipment would take much longer than the document called for ; and after all , this deal was with a fragile Iraq government facing elections , and agreements can be renegotiated .
The status - of - forces agreement was presented off the record as something to keep Iraqi politicians happy and give Bush the exit he wanted , but in fact the United States would remain in control of Iraq , as it had meant to do from the beginning .
Shortly afterward , the biggest American embassy ever built , or even ever imagined , was opened with pomp and ceremony in the ( fortified ) Green Zone .
When Pentagon officials met with Obama last month , there again were winks and nods to the press .
Obama was a naive and inexperienced politician from Flyover Land .
He could and would be " handled . "
Now Obama has handled them .
He has said , no doubt very politely , that he is the president and the military services are constitutionally required to carry out his policy , not their own .
This naturally has produced journalistic murmuring of " clashes " between Pentagon and White House .
If there should be clashes , the Pentagon will lose .
The military have become accustomed to getting whatever it wants from presidents and Congress .
That must end , and it is essential that the new president and his military advisers make this clear , however politely .
I began with a comment on luck .
That referred to the plunge into the political abyss by the Israeli rightist forces , which are accustomed to claiming that they " own " the U.S. Congress .
Israel 's useless , senseless and self - destructive assault on the people of Gaza , and upon the U.N. 's headquarters and warehouses of food and medicine , has proved globally devastating to the reputation and moral credit of Israel .
Even in the United States , there has been a precipitous drop in support for what Israel has been doing , and for Israeli policy in general .
In international political circles , there is disbelief that Israel could imagine that this attack on Hamas , with its civilian casualties and physical destruction of Gaza , would " strengthen " the position of the Palestine Authority and of Mahmoud Abbas and his Fatah Party .
It is a death blow to them .
Israel behaves as if it has completely lost touch with reality .
Thus Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert 's arrogant utterance that he personally caused the United States to reverse its position on the U.N. Security Council resolution last week demanding a Gaza cease - fire .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had helped organize support for that resolution and had committed the United States to vote in its favor .
Olmert told an Israeli audience that , last Friday , upon hearing of Rice 's position , he immediately telephoned George W. Bush .
Told that Bush was delivering an address in Philadelphia , Olmert replied , " I 'm not interested , " demanding to speak to Bush .
Bush then left his Philadelphia podium and , according to Olmert , the Israeli prime minister instructed the American president that " the U.S. cannot possibly vote in favor of this resolution . "
Bush then telephoned Rice and ordered her to abstain from the vote .
That 's Olmert 's story , or Israeli megalomania , presented to the Israelis with pride , but unlikely to be received by Americans with pleasure .

SACRAMENTO — California has filed suit against the Bush administration to block last - minute endangered species regulations that are intended to reduce input from federal scientists , Attorney General Jerry Brown announced Tuesday .
Brown said the president is trying to gut the Endangered Species
Act before he leaves office next month .
“ Unfortunately , the Bush administration has had an antipathy to using sound science , ” Brown said Tuesday in a telephone interview with The Associated Press .
“ This is the latest assault as Bush goes out the door .
It ’s intolerable . ”
The state ’s lawsuit was filed late Monday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco .
The Interior Department issued the revised rules earlier this month .
They allow federal agencies to issue permits for mining , logging and similar activities without getting a review from federal wildlife biologists .
The changes also block agencies from using the Endangered Species
Act to consider the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on ecosystems when reviewing projects such as new roads or coal plants on federal land .
Interior Department spokeswoman Tina Kreisher declined to comment on the California lawsuit .
She said the revised rules will continue to protect threatened and endangered species .
“ The law says that all federal agencies will ensure that no take occurs of a listed species whatever it is they are doing , ” she said .
Brown is asking the court to block the new rules , which could give the incoming administration of President - elect Barack Obama time to review them .

A Brief History of HIV / AIDS
Early 1980s : New illness first identified in San Francisco as G.R.I.D. ( Gay Related Immune Deficiency ) .
No treatment available .
Mid 1980s : Name changed to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) as populations other than gay men affected .
Worldwide pandemic declared with particularly high numbers of infection in sub-Saharan Africa .
UN AIDS founded to respond .
As no effective treatment yet discovered , massive prevention efforts undertaken including screening blood supply for HIV ( begins 1985 in Canada ) .
Late 1980s : Human Immuno - deficiency Virus ( HIV ) identified by French and American scientists as virus that leads to AIDS .
AZT and DDI identified as treatment options .
Early 1990s : Decrease of new HIV infections among gay men demonstrates effectiveness of gay community prevention efforts .
Mid - late 1990s :
*
Significant increase in HIV incidence among injection drug users , aboriginal populations , women , and street - involved youth .
*
H.A.A.R.T. ( Highly active anti-retroviral therapy ) emerges and is touted as a precursor to a cure for AIDS .
*
No one is certain where HIV came from .
HIV may have been around for years before it was discovered and , like many viruses , simply needed the right combination of factors to emerge as a global health threat .
*
A variety of factors have led to the rapid spread of HIV around the globe .
These include increased travel and tourism ; increased injection drug use ; ongoing wars - particularly civil wars - throughout much of the world ( soldiers get exposed to HIV and transmit it to sex partners , rape victims and drug buddies ) ; increasing poverty rates and the subsequent social conditions that include lack of access to medical information and care ; conservative social values that prohibit and limit sex education programs , harm reduction programs , and access to treatment ; and insufficient resources to battle the AIDS pandemic - particularly in the developing world .
*
In Canada the federal government sponsors the Canadian Strategy on HIV / AIDS ( CSHA ) to help coordinate a pan-Canadian effort to prevent the spread of HIV and to help ensure that those living with HIV / AIDS and those affected can access up - to - date information , as well as treatment , care and support services .
*
The CSHA has an annual budget of $ 42.2 Million .
These dollars are used to support a variety of programs including community - based HIV / AIDS initiatives , national non-government organizations working with HIV / AIDS issues , the development of best - practice models for prevention , care , treatment and support , etc .
*
The Krever Inquiry investigated allegations from what is commonly referred to as the " tainted blood scandal . "
Recommendations were made to ensure an efficient and effective blood system in Canada for the future .
*
During 1994 and 1995 a community consultation in Manitoba was conducted with input from community leaders , persons living with HIV / AIDS , Aboriginal stakeholders , health care providers and 5 government departments to inform the development of the Manitoba Provincial AIDS Strategy .
*
In 1996 the provincial government accepted and endorsed the goals and principles of Manitoba 's Provincial AIDS Strategy PDF .
2000 - current :
* In 2001 , the provincial government released the Provincial Sexually Transmitted Diseases Strategy .
* In 2005 , the provincial government released " As Long as the Waters Flow : An Aboriginal Strategy on HIV / AIDS " PDF .
* There has been a continual creation and availability of more HAART medications .
* In 2004 , Canada 's first supervised , safe injection site - Insite - opened in Vancouver , B.C .

A less ideological reader might be tempted to divvy them up into the categories Charming , Insufferable and Inappropriate .
Let ’s get Charming out of the way first .
In 1939 , under the pseudonym “ A. Redfield , ” Hoff wrote and illustrated “ Mr. His , ” a book about a portly capitalist with a top hat , a tuxedo and a droopy mustache — like the Monopoly man but more personable .
Though elsewhere Mickenberg and Nel warn against trafficking in “ the stereotype of the fat capitalist , ” they ’re lenient with Hoff , perhaps because the rotundity of Mr. His is so charismatic .
Mr. His owns a whole town , Histown , where he lives in luxury and the workers in squalor .
He gets away with it because “ there were no strikes in Histown — and no picket lines and no unions .
The newspapers , which Mr. His owned too , said that these things were wicked . ”
Since this is a children ’s story , the workers manage to defy Mr. His despite the false consciousness foisted on them by his mass media , whereupon he temporizes by trying to foment race hatred : “ Wuxtry ! ” he exclaims , hawking issues of his newspaper in person .
“ Blondes — your real enemy is brunettes ! ”
Unable to resist a villain who shouts “ Wuxtry ! ” I wandered off to the Internet to try to buy a copy of “ Mr. His ” for my niece .
None were for sale .
By their reprinting , Mickenberg and Nel have rescued Mr. His from near - complete oblivion .
Image  Mr. His ,  by A. Redfield ( a k a Syd Hoff ) , 1939 .

From “ Tales for Little Rebels ”
It is not their only success .
In “ The Story of Your Coat ” ( 1946 ) , Clara Hollos elaborates an idea from “ Das Kapital ” by tracing a coat from its origins on the backs of Australian sheep through a unionized textile mill and into a department store .
The writing is simple but not simplified ; it reminds me of the casual but illuminating way V. S. Pritchett explains the leather trade in his memoir “ A Cab at the Door . ”
In Yehoshua Kaminski ’s tale “ A Little Hen Goes to Brownsville ” ( 1937 ) , translated from the Yiddish , a chicken sets out to use her near - superhero - caliber egg - laying skills to help the Brooklyn neighborhood ’s babies , which she hears are “ small and pale , thin and weak . ”
So unstoppable is her nutritional charity that she lays an egg in Times Square , gets arrested , pays her fine with another egg , and then pays her bus fare with yet an­other .
The moral , Mickenberg and Nel infer , is that “ justice is best served by a system that is not defined by the strict and inflexible administration of a legal code . ”
Also , that children should not go hungry .
It ’s harder to say exactly what ’s politically radical about Lydia Gibson ’s “ Teacup Whale ” ( 1934 ) , in which a boy finds in a puddle a tiny whale , which his mother persistently mistakes for a polliwog , and which in time must be carted to the wharf in a truck .
Does the whale represent the proletariat ?
Is the boy the opposite of Captain Ahab ?
The story is , in any case , pleasant to read , and the illustrations are lovely .
As much cannot be said of the Insufferable .
I hasten to say there are a lot of stinkers in children ’s literature , and I suspect capitalism is responsible for more of them than socialism is .
The real culprit is n’t political economics ; it ’s morality .
There seems to be a slightly higher propensity for self - consciously virtuous books to be written by people whose personalities have been paved over by their superegos .
In Oscar Saul and Lou Lantz ’s insipid “ Revolt of the Beavers ” ( 1936 ) , for example , a rebel beaver explains his campaign to a couple of 9 - year - olds thusly : “ All the beavers were very sad . . . and me too , so I said why do n’t you make a club for sad beavers to become glad .
So all the beavers say Yayy ! ”
Language so insipid risks turning a sensitive 9 - year - old to a life of orthodoxy if not reaction .
When I was a child , I felt guilty that I was never able to read more than a few pages of a beautiful edition of Carl Sandburg ’s “ Rootabaga Stories ” ( 1922 ) , given to my sister and me by our parents .
But Mickenberg and Nel reprint a story from the book ’s 1923 sequel , and I am at last set free .
I did n’t read the stories because no child could — they are stomach - churningly , almost incomprehensibly saccharine .
Here , for example , is how Sandburg describes the cost of an episode of militarism : “ And the thousand golden ice tongs the sooners gave the boomers , and the thousand silver wheelbarrows the boomers gave the sooners , both with hearts and hands carved on the handles , they were long ago broken up in one of the early wars deciding pigs must be painted both pink and green with both checks and stripes . ”
Last but not least among Mickenberg and Nel ’s selections are the Inappropriate .
For all their caution about the fatness of capitalists , no warning is given that Julius Lester ’s “ High John the Conqueror ” ( 1969 ) , a retelling of several African - ­American folk tales , deploys the N - word with gusto .
Another stumper is a 1954 retelling and reillustration by Walt Kelly , of “ Pogo ” fame , of an episode from Lewis Carroll ’s novel “ Alice ’s Adventures in Wonderland . ”
The King of Hearts is drawn as a burly , sinister cat with the face of Senator Joseph McCarthy .
To show that the McCarthy cat is evil , Kelly gives its eyes no pupils .
It has a 5 o’clock shadow , and there ’s hair — fur ? — on the backs of its hands .
The effect is grotesque , of a feline Tony Soprano brutalizing and carnalizing Carroll ’s delicate surrealism .
I imagine it would give children nightmares .
As might the verses of Ned Donn ’s 1934 “ Pioneer Mother Goose ” : “ This bloated Pig masters Wall Street , / This little Pig owns your home ; / This war - crazed Pig had your brother killed .
. . . ”

Why I Am Not a Jew
by David Dvorkin
Note : A slightly different version of this essay was published in Free Inquiry magazine in 1990 .
Another Note :
You might also find my short book Once a Jew , Always a Jew ? interesting .
Introduction
Recently , in downtown Denver , I was accosted by an earnest , smiling young man who wanted to save my soul .
When I told him that I was an atheist , he looked at me in astonishment and confessed that he had never actually met such a person .
He was fascinated .
He wanted to know all about this wonderful belief system .
( I was in a hurry , unfortunately , and could n't spare the time to satisfy his spiritual hunger , but I like to think that I planted a seed , and that from that tiny acorn etc . )
What a relief , then , to turn to atheist and humanist journals and encounter no such blindness , no such singlemindedness , no such ignorance that other views exist !
No , unfortunately , not quite .
Atheists , agnostics , humanists , freethinkers — call them whatever they prefer , virtually all of them share one very large blind spot : they are almost all ex-Christians , and therefore they measure their shiny new non-belief not against belief in general , but against Christianity in particular .
It is thus ex-Christians who write the literature that , to the world at large , represents the views of non-believers .
Literature that is specifically intended to present the arguments against religious belief tends in fact to present the arguments against Christian belief .
Now , this presents both practical and philosophical problems .
Consider a believing Jew who reads such literature or hears a talk given by a spokesman for the non-believer movement .
The arguments against Christian belief will have no effect on him .
Of course Christianity is all nonsense !
He knew that all along ; he 's been told that all his life .
In all likelihood he 'll go away confirmed in his religious belief .
After all , he 's been taught that the two religious alternatives are Judaism and Christianity , and now he 's just heard the opposition demolished — and by a former Christian , at that !
He has not heard non-belief presented as an alternative to Judaism .
It is in the nature of traditional Jewish culture to believe itself innately superior to all others , and an ex-Christian , intent on explaining his own journey from belief to disbelief , is not the one to attack that sense of superior difference .
Thus , speaking pragmatically , there is a need for an attack on Jewish beliefs which will make an appeal to both the emotions and the intellect of the Jewish believer .
This is a challenge I accept happily .
At the end of this essay , I 'll have something to say about the need for atheists to attack all religions , religion in general .
But for now I will limit myself to attacking Judaism .
Becoming an Ex-Jew
I 'll begin with a few words about the process whereby a Jew becomes an ex-Jew .
Naturally , I will really talk about the process I experienced .
I am , after all , the ex-Jew I know most intimately .
I remember that I first rejected my religion emotionally , and only later went through the intellectual process of rationalizing my break with my upbringing .
For me — and I suspect for many other nonbelievers — the need and the desire not to believe preceded any rational analysis of belief .
At the time , though , the result was not liberation , but guilt .
I 'm sure Christians feel guilt , but I 'm just as sure that few of them can feel the intensity and depth and sheer quantity of guilt that Jews feel .
Christians , after all , have only been working on guilt for two thousand years .
Mere pikers !
Jews have had far more practice .
In particular , Jews are beset all their lives with guilt at not having lived up to parental expectations .
How much more is this true for ex-Jews , who have betrayed and broken the hearts , not only of their physical parents , but also of their spiritual parents , their ancestors — Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and those ancient fathers ' wives , whatever their names were .
And of course the Big Father , the one at the top of Jacob 's ladder .
So the process of breaking away from their religion is a long and difficult one for Jews , a battle between growing dislike for the faith and growing guilt at what the young man ( as it usually seems to be ) is contemplating .
Finally , when the tension grows too great and the emotional bond snaps ( and I 'm talking only about those for whom the bond does snap , not for those who surrender and meekly reenter the fold ) , the intellectual examination of the whole question of belief begins .
This process of reasoning — often a relentless chewing over — may last a lifetime or only a decade , but its main purpose is to find a solid , intellectual , non-emotional basis for the former Jew 's now being a former Jew .
For you must understand that , to the ex-Jew , the rejection of Judaism because of boredom or distaste is indeed reason to feel guilty , while coldly rational grounds for such rejection are a defense against guilt , an answer to those who still call themselves Jews and who accuse the ex-Jew of betrayal .
Who can argue against logic ?
To be effective armor , though , the result of the rational process must also guard the ex-Jew against the smug assertion of his former coreligionists that there is no such thing as an ex-Jew .
" Once a Jew , " they will proclaim , " always a Jew . "
This assertion is such a powerful emotional weapon against the ex-Jew that I think it appropriate to subject it to a fairly detailed examination .
Once a Jew , Always a Jew
What does it mean to say , " I was a Jew but now am not " ?
Inevitably and unfortunately , this leads to the question , " What is a Jew ? " I say " unfortunately " because this is a very old question , indeed , one for which Jews , non-Jews , ex-Jews , and , yes , anti-Semites have all produced their own self - serving answers .
Still , perhaps we can say enough about it to satisfy our purposes here .
The assertion that a Jew is always a Jew rests on two bases : first , that Judaism is a racial identity and not just a religion , and that one cannot therefore shrug it off or reject it on an intellectual level ; and second , that no matter how the ex-Jew chooses to identify himself , the world , the others , the goyim , will persist in identifying him as a Jew , and so he might as well give up the fight and accept his Jewishness .
Let 's deal with the second idea first .
For the past half - century , everyone 's favorite example of the evil goy has been the Nazi .
Or , if one prefers the rhetorical device of using a specific individual , then the favorite example becomes that personification of evil , Adolf Hitler .
They — he — did more than kill six million Jews ; they killed the delusion that a Jew can ever fit in to the surrounding gentile society .
How often I was told about the German Jews , those idolatrous seekers after assimilation , who looked and acted German and thought that was enough .
But when the time came , the Nazis remembered who was who , who was a real German and who was in fact a Jew , and then ...
I was always struck most strongly not by the historical fact being related , but rather by the smug voice in which the tragic tale of the German Jews was told .
The unspoken message was that the Holocaust was the German Jews ' punishment for forgetting that they were really Jews , not Germans .
The spoken message was that the bogeyman will surely return — not German , this time , but no less Nazi — and then all of those modern Jews who have tried to forget who and what they really are will suffer the appropriate punishment .
So you might as well accept your dreary fate and go to shul on Friday evening and Saturday morning , because you 're trapped anyway , no matter how much you may twist and turn and try to escape .
In this view , the evil goyim are simply God 's tool , his method of punishing those Jews who get uppity and forget their proper place in the world .
It 's interesting to me that this whole attitude rests upon the ghetto attitude that the Jew really does belong on the bottom of the heap , and that those Jews who forget this fact and get above themselves will suffer for it .
In short , this might be called the argument from intimidation .
To all of this , I say that I 'd rather be a free man and take my lumps than accept the subservient , averted - face posture of the slave .
No low profile for this atheist .
If it 's true that the goyim see me as a cur , why should I live down to their expectations and live a life of physical deprivation and mental imprisonment ?
More realistically , why should I deprive myself of a life of freedom and openness just because some day someone might try to reduce me to the status of a cur ?
The first argument used against the self - proclaimed ex-Jew — that Judaism is a racial identity that one cannot unilaterally shed — at least has the appearance of intellectual grounding .
But does it really ?
I suppose that to answer this argument , one should first consider the question , What is a race ?
I think this would be a fruitless approach , however , since the word " race , " as most of us use it , means whatever we want it to in the heat of the moment .
Just what do Jews mean by this fuzzy concept when they use it in the argument we 're considering ?
Surely not that Jews have been separate from other human beings since we all split away from our apish ancestors and became human beings !
Obviously , Jews ( and ex- Jews ) are not a separate species from other humans .
We are , after all , cross- fertile ( as some of us have enthusiastically proven over the centuries ) .
Much more to the point , history demonstrates the futility of trying to trace the racial bloodlines of any Europeans .
European history is in large part a story of invasion , conquest , and the resulting ethnic and sexual mixing .
Some Jews may still hold to the myth that their ancestors managed to hold themselves aloof from all of this homogenizing , but this is to choose mythology over history .
After all , if the myth of racial purity were true , modern European ( and American and Australian and South African , etc. )
Jews would look ( and act ) just like those Jews whose ancestors remained in the Middle East and never joined the Diaspora .
But instead , those Middle Eastern Jews look and act very much like ( surprise ! )
Arabs .
I 've been told ( but never confirmed ) that there are very old Jewish communities in the Orient whose members look quite Oriental .
Then there are the Falashas of Ethiopa , Jews who claim to trace their ancestry directly back to the Jews of biblical Israel ; they are quite black .
Even the Levantine nose is not universal among European Jews .
It is , on the other hand , common in the Levant , and not just among Levantine Jews .
Certainly it 's true that a lot of Jews look like the stereotypical idea of what a Jew looks like ; it 's also true that a lot of Jews do n't .
There is no Jewish mark of Cain .
Thus the myth of a Jewish racial identity is precisely that , a myth .
( And given the history of this century , it is a myth that Jews should be particularly eager to see discredited . )
We are left , then , with Jewry as an ethnic community as well as a religious one .
This is undeniably the case .
Any group that holds itself generally aloof from its neighbors , that has or at one time had its own language , that has its own music and literature and cultural ways , can be called an ethnic group .
But I can't see that anything significant follows from this admission .
So ex-Jews were brought up in a particular ethnic community ; so what ?
Why does this mean that they must always consider themselves part of that group ?
Is an individual to be pigeonholed for the rest of his life by an accident of birth ?
If Western civilization has made one single important contribution to the world , it is the concept of individuality : the idea that a man is what he chooses to be , not what his community ordains him to be ; that each of us represents only himself and is not a mere cell in some familial or ethnic organism .
This , to my mind , is the true essence of humanism .
I can't resist commenting here on a particularly silly rationalization that is becoming popular among American Jews .
Some of them , uncomfortable with the religious dogmas they were brought up with , but unable to overcome the guilt they would feel if they simply declared themselves ex-Jews , have chosen to call themselves " ethnic Jews . "
This seems to mean that they can hold on to ethnic pride and ethnic identification , and they can wear various newly invented ethnic medallions around their necks , but at the same time they are excused from obeying Judaism 's onerous dietary laws .
Just think of it : they can say proudly that they are Jews , but nonetheless they can eat pork !
In a curious twist , some " ethnic Jews " do n't eat pork , but they do celebrate a version of Hannukah which is indistinguishable from Christmas .
( " Oh , well , it 's the Holiday Season . ... ")
One wonders if they have ever heard of moral courage or intellectual integrity .
They seek the comfort of belonging to the group .
They cannot imagine the freedom , the feeling of liberation , one gains by leaving the group and by defining oneself purely on one 's own terms .
Ethnic Pride
Since we 've already touched on this idea of ethnic pride , let 's pursue it a little further .
Ethnic groups are very given to falling into this trap , and I suppose that the more an ethnic group knows itself to be despised by its neighbors , the more it resorts to ethnic pride in self - defense and self - justification .
Certainly Jews are prone to this particular bit of self - deception .
Thus every Jewish child is told about outstanding musicians ( usually violinists , sometimes pianists ) who are Jews , or outstanding scientists ( usually physicists ) , and the child is instructed to take pride in the fact of these famous people 's Jewishness .
Because they are Jews , the child can walk a little taller .
But why so ?
Why should I be proud of the accomplishments of someone else who comes from the same ethnic group I do ?
Let 's say that Mr. A is a famous violinist and also a Jew ( or possibly an ex-Jew , although Mr. A is unlikely to say so in public ) .
If I brag about his Jewishness , I am either saying that Mr. A accomplished his virtuosity because of his Jewishness ( because of some talent for the violin which he inherited along with his surname and facial features — i.e. , something " in his blood " ) , and so his accomplishment is yet another proof of the innate musical superiority of all Jews , or else I 'm saying that Mr. A accomplished what he did due to his own efforts but that because he and I are both Jews , I shine in his reflected glory .
That is , either his blood deserves credit for his virtuosity , in which case he proves the superiority of Jewish blood , or he himself deserves the credit , in which case he has added to the cosmic credit of his entire " race " — which still proves the superiority of Jewish blood .
If I 'm saying the first thing — that Mr. A's Jewish blood deserves the credit for his virtuosity on the violin , and not Mr. A himself — then I 'm really devaluing the years of hard work and practice Mr. A. surely put into developing that virtuosity .
I 'm implying that virtually any Jew who was willing to work the same way could develop into just as brilliant a violinist .
I suspect that Mr. A feels otherwise : he knows just how unique he and his talent are , just how much work and self - discipline went into attaining his present technical and artistic level , and just how many others he passed on the way , others who were not willing to discipline themselves to the degree he did .
How thoughtlessly cruel to ascribe what he has achieved to the spiritual superiority of his ancestors to the goyim around them !
But , just for the sake of argument , let 's assume that Jewish blood really does confer superior talent for the violin and physics .
( My own tin ear is a strong counterargument to the first assertion , and my college grades in physics to the second , but let 's let that pass . )
Let 's assume that there really is some genetically determined superiority , retained within the group because of the supposed avoidance of intermarriage over the ages .
This is then a pure accident of heredity , no more meaningful than a Levantine nose .
Why should one be proud of it — any more than one should be ashamed of inherited drawbacks , such as Tay - Sachs disease for Jews , sickle - cell anemia for blacks , and so on ?
Perhaps the superior talents of Jews are not due so much to genetics as to ethnic traits .
For example , Jewish culture has always demonstrated a great respect for learning , and so Jewish children are encouraged from an early age to read , to accumulate knowledge , and to accumulate the outward confirmations of superior knowledge which universities confer .
As a result , at all levels of school , Jewish children , as a group , usually rank at or near the top of the grade ladder .
If we are proud of this trait , if we see it as a proof of our superiority to other peoples , then we 're really saying that we can rank ethnic groups along a spectrum from inferior to superior , and moreover that the traits possessed by our ethnic group are the very traits which determine how a group ranks .
This is , to say the least , self - serving .
Another ethnic group might feel , for example , that excellence in certain sports is a more proper basis for locating ethnic groups on this spectrum .
Under such a method , Jews would not rank well at all .
The same Jewish culture which encourages intellectual exercise , discourages the physical variety .
The very idea of such ranking of ethnic cultures is a socially dangerous one , as Jews should know all too well ; they should be the last to indulge in it .
Now , let 's consider the second possibility : that when I remind everyone of Mr. A's Jewishness , I 'm really reminding my listeners that , as a fellow Jew , in some sense I partake of his achievement .
This is of course absurd .
Was I in the practice room with him during all of those hours and years ?
Did I share in his frustrations and disappointments , his struggle to pay for lessons , his self - denial while he worked his way through school ?
This claim of kinship is nothing but a cheap and scurrilous attempt to take credit for what someone else has done , and it deserves no further discussion .
The whole nonsense of ethnic pride does n't even take into account the lone genius , such as Gauss , who stands out so strikingly from his family and their immediate culture ( which in Gauss ' case was that of a small German village , not that of the great professors of Goettingen ) .
The greatness of a such a man is clearly an utterly individual thing , an accidental combination of genes and personal inclinations , that makes a mockery of the idea that his ethnic group , because of genes or cultural traits , can take any credit at all for his genius .
We should indeed honor such men as Gauss for their accomplishments , but we should honor them and not their cousins or their ancestors .
The Flip Side of Pride
Near the beginning of this essay , I said that the internal intellectual critiquing of one 's childhood faith is preceded by an emotional turning away from that faith .
This emotional revulsion may arise from various causes , but for me , an early spur came from the distasteful attitudes towards themselves and others that I detected in my fellow Jews .
More than they seem to today , anti-Semites used to accuse Jews of harboring the belief that they are indeed God 's chosen people and are therefore destined to rule all other peoples .
( Just where are those Elders of Zion , and how do I get in touch with them ?
I think I could rediscover my faith very quickly if rewarded with my own country to rule . )
I 've never encountered any Jews who expressed a desire to rule the world .
Most of the Jews I know worry a lot more about how they 'll pay next month 's bills — in contradiction to the most durable of the stereotypes about Jews .
The sad secret of Jewish culture , however , is that the first part of that old anti-Semitic charge is essentially true .
Indeed , Jews do believe themselves spiritually superior to the rest of the world .
Call it being
God 's chosen people or call it belief in the innate superiority of Jewish blood , the result is the same : contempt for the goyim .
This is simply the converse of ethnic pride , its morally reprehensible flip side .
If others display physical skills superior to yours , then denigrate the value of such skills , sneer that they are proof of their owners ' brutishness .
You are built of too fine and pure and delicate a fiber to indulge in such nonsense ; yours is the world of the mind and the spirit .
In the same way , you must discount the value of lack of inhibition or of high libido : a cultured and refined people ( guess who ) hide their light under a bushel because they actually prefer to do so and because to do so is , well , nicer .
This just hints at the number of bizarre misconceptions traditional Jewish society believed and still believes about non-Jews .
Jewish parents of old - fashioned , and especially European , background are still convinced that every non-Jewish husband beats his wife , does not provide for his family , drinks to excess , and spends his ( remarkably copious ) spare time with prostitutes and other women who are not socially admirable — and moreover that these are crimes of which no Jewish husband in the history of the world was ever guilty .
Jewish boys were always told ( and perhaps still are ) that , as a consequence of all of these Christian social institutions , non-Jewish girls , shiksas , are always on the lookout for eligible young Jewish men , since they know that these will work hard to provide for them , will be good husbands , will not beat them , drink , chase women , and so on .
But beware , all good Jewish boys who consider marrying one of these bewitching Gentile females !
At heart , every shiksa is a slut , an unfaithful wife , a spendthrift , and , worst of all , a disobedient and disloyal anti-Semite who , at the first sign of an argument with her spouse , will call her faithful , loyal , hardworking Jewish husband " a dirty Jew . "
In short , in the heat of anger ( a failing to which goyim are far more susceptible than Jews ) , her true feelings will emerge .
The irony of this indoctrination , inevitably , is to make shiksas creatures of considerable fascination to every Jewish boy .
When I was young enough to believe what I was told , I swallowed all of this nonsense .
( Took it as Gospel , you might say . )
I knew all about goyim because I had been told all about them by the one set of authorities a young child believes without question : his parents .
Later , through experience , I discovered something amazing : goyim of my age were remarkably much like me .
It was a short step from there to the realization that what I was being told was simply the Jewish equivalent of anti-Semitism .
I think it 's significant that we do n't have a word for this virulent and widespread form of ethnic hatred , so I might as well coin one right now : it 's anti-goyism .
This word is particularly appropriate , since in the original Hebrew , a goy is a people , and goyim was used to refer generally to the nations of the world .
Thus the converse of anti-Semitism is a hatred and fear of all of the rest of the world .
Is it true , as I was taught , that virtually every goy is an anti-Semite ?
I 'll satisfy the stereotype by answering that question with another question : is it true that virtually every Jew is an anti-goy ?
Answer : not quite , but almost .
Am I overdoing it ?
Am I seeing anti-goyism everywhere , even where it does n't exist ?
Blame that on my Jewish upbringing , on my training in keeping a sharp eye on my neighbors for signs of anti-Semitism .
But then , anti-Semitism is so useful .
Here 's why I say that .
Just as much as the Jews in the rest of the European world , American Jews are quick to see anti-Semitism everywhere .
Perhaps this is simply a manifestation of the old Jewish persecution complex and the despicable cultural tendency toward what can only be called excessive self - pity .
If this is so , it 's repellent enough , and the self - pity and the persecution complex , both of which struck me forcibly as an adolescent , surely explain the turning away from Judaism of many a young Jew .
After all , no one with much self - respect and ego - strength wishes to be identified with an ethnic group which indulges in such contemptible mental habits .
But I 'm afraid this whole matter of calling every critic an anti-Semite is a deeper and more sinister matter .
It is quite simply a deliberate , fully conscious ploy , a way of silencing critics .
Consider how many years it took before American Jews gathered the nerve to criticize Israeli policies in the occupied territories .
They were afraid of being labelled " Jewish anti-Semites , " a wonderfully designed phrase — designed to make Jews who criticize their own people feel particularly guilty .
And even now , a non-Jew who dares to criticize the policies of Israel or of any official Jewish body can expect to be attacked with the " anti- Semite " label .
And it works .
Who can forget the Six Million ?
Who can forget the Holocaust ?
( You can't , because we wo n't let you ! )
Criticize anything Jewish , and we 'll link you to the Nazis .
And you 'll run for cover .
If you write anti-religious essays , you probably already limit yourself to anti-Christian rhetoric and leave the Jews and their religion alone ; that is to say , you avoid even the risk of being labelled an anti-Semite .
Thus , the effectiveness of the label in stifling criticism is precisely why Jews are so overly quick to use it .
In my case , I realized at a fairly early age that I was uncomfortable being part of a group which revelled in such distasteful attitudes .
The intellectual rationalization came years later , but the disgust began early .
Rites , Rituals , and Spurious Justifications
In the end , Jews , just as do members of other religious groups , retreat into spurious justifications of their rituals and dogmas .
Trying desperately to reconcile their intelligence and Western education with their need to still call themselves Jews , to make various gestures to salve their guilty consciences , they insist that the nonsense they were brought up to believe in has some objective justification .
The dietary laws , for example , are said to have provided Jews in Biblical times with protection against rampant illnesses of the day .
These were really health rules , not religious dogmas after all !
How can anyone argue with them , then ?
My response probably deserves a book of its own .
The whole rigamarole of the laws of kashruth , the dietary laws , is so arcane and convoluted that it provides endless opportunities for scorn and logical attack .
However , let 's stick to the more general substance of this argument .
First , the bulk of the dietary laws are not of Biblical origin at all , but rather were decreed by medieval rabbis , based on their interpretations of the Old Testament .
Are we moderns really to believe that the twisted , hair - splitting reasoning of those men is a valid health guide now , in the twentieth century ?
I am unaware of any objective proof that the dietary laws benefited the Jews of the Middle Ages , that their health was better than that of the goyim among whom they lived .
Second , I defy anyone to provide a sound reason why , for example , meat and milk should not be mixed in the same meal — or , even more bizarre , why the utensils used to eat meat and milk dishes should not be interchanged !
The same can be said for any of the other innumerable , and equally bizarre , dietary laws .
Finally , even if we accept for the sake of argument that these laws once had utility , pragmatic justification , what is their relevance to us today ?
I must add a very personal slant on all of this .
When I was a boy in South Africa , my father , as one of his duties , was a shochet ; i.e. , he performed the kosher killing of beef animals and chickens .
I watched him do the latter in our back yard quite often , and once ( and only once ) I went with him to the slaughterhouse to watch him do the former .
More than thirty years have passed , and the sights and smells and horror of it all are still seared into my memory .
I invite today 's earnest young Jews — neo - Jews , one might call them — to visit a kosher slaughterhouse and watch the ghastly agony of animals bleeding to death through their slashed throats , choking on their own blood .
Who would wish to worship a God who ordained this abomination ?
Sabbath laws are similarly justified as wisely providing humans with a needed one day of rest after six days of labor .
One day out of every seven !
What a very humane God this must be !
He may consider one day out of seven sufficient rest ; I do not .
I remember , when I was a teenager in Indiana , hearing Christian fundamentalists using the very same justification for blue laws , Sunday closing laws .
Clearly , the real motivations are quite different .
On the political level , both Jews and Christians are simply trying to find ways to justify incorporating the Bible into human law .
Emotionally , they are rejecting human autonomy — the heart of humanism — and finding reasons for subordinating themselves to the rule of an imaginary father in the sky .
The latter motivation , the emotional one , is beneath the contempt of a self - respecting adult ; the former , or political , motivation is both laughable and frightening , for who can say where it would end ?
Circumcision is touted as providing protection to the circumcised man 's wife ( " wife , " of course ; not his " sexual partner " ) against cervical cancer .
Statistics seem to bear this out , although I gather the picture is not so clear as we used to think it .
Assuming it to be true , can anyone really believe that the ancient Jews knew this ?
In ancient times , circumcision was a common ritual in various religions ( and it still is among various primitive peoples ) .
Just like other ancient peoples , the ancient Jews practised this particular form of self - mutilation because of their religious fantasies .
Any health benefits were unknown to them and were a fortunate byproduct .
Indeed , one wonders how many Jewish male babies in those ancient times died awful , agonizing deaths because of infected penises , due to lack of sterilization of the instruments used to perform the circumcision .
I suspect the number of dead babies was higher than the number of Jewish wives spared cervical cancer because their husbands had survived their babyhood surgery .
Ex -Jews and Other Odd People
I 've always found it interesting and annoying that , while the literature of disbelief is quite nasty enough toward Christianity and its dogmas , that literature handles other religions with kid gloves .
This is especially true of Judaism .
I suppose this attitude arises from a fear on the part of the writers of sounding anti-Semitic .
If they were to attack Judaism head - on , with the same hostility and scorn they display toward Christianity , I can assure you that the charge of anti-Semitism certainly would be used in response .
As I explained above , this charge has proved itself very useful .
Even when I still considered myself a Jew , I grew increasingly uncomfortable with the use of that ploy to silence critics of Jews , Judaism , and Israel .
Now that I am a member of the community of nonbelievers , the ploy more than discomfits me : it angers me .
The use of the " anti-Semite " label cannot be allowed to continue to undermine the efforts of those who see all religion as a mental trap and a social danger .
Philosophically , there 's a broader issue involved in this matter of supposedly anti-religious arguments being actually no more than arguments against Christianity .
In my mind , at least , the issue is not whether or not Christianity is a philosophically acceptable belief system , but rather whether any form of superstition is acceptable .
If we undertake to show the believer the illogic and mental bondage of superstition , then we must be not only ruthless in our argument , but also general .
No matter whether he subscribes to Christianity , Judaism , Islam , Buddhism , astrology , or such recent pseudo - archaisms as the New Age and Wicca , we must show him how fundamentally silly it is to accept on faith the existence of invisible forces no one has ever measured or quantified , and for whose existence there is not a single item of objective proof .
It is not enough to inveigh against one set of dogmas ; rather , we must assert to the world our belief that no intelligent , self - respecting man should put his faith in that which is invisible , unmeasurable , and undetectable .
Under any name , no matter how old and entrenched , superstition remains superstition .
It is surely true that the need and desire to believe precede belief .
That may be due to a personality failing about which we can do nothing .
We can , however , make our case plain enough so that the hard - headed , clear - eyed position begins to seem a virtue in itself .
We atheists must adopt a non-apologetic approach .
We must shed the self - effacement which has too often characterized us .
We must assert the moral and ethical superiority of our position .
Indeed , we must be as ready to do so as the religious are with regard to their position .
We must tell the world of the robustness and joyfulness of the intellectual , moral , and emotional freedom which atheism represents .
By the Way , I 'm Not a Nazi , Either
Over the years , I 've noticed that this essay gets quite a few hits from neo -Nazi sites , both here in the US and abroad .
Apparently those vile wretches , contemptible creatures who laughably imagine that they 're part of some master race , think that criticism of Judaism by an ex-Jew somehow supports their fecal philosophy .
One can expect nothing better from people with shit for brains .
Both of my parents had family members in Eastern Europe who were murdered in the Holocaust .
Other family members were in the British Army , fighting against the Nazis , and some of them lost their lives .
At the same time , Nazi airmen were dropping bombs on England , slaughtering innocent civilians .
I was born in England during the war , so I was one of their targets .
It should be obvious that I despise the subhumans in the original Nazi Party and their modern successors .
So if you are one of those bottom feeders who has followed a link here from one of those neo -Nazi sites , and if you have managed to read aaaaalllll the way down to this point , let me make something clear :
Nazis suck circumcised donkey dong .
With less than 48 hours to go before Election Day , talk of the usually reliable red state of Montana going Obama is being seen as a real possibility .
Both CNN and NBC have moved the Big Sky state from leaning McCain to toss - up .
Yee -haw
This is n't the first time Montana has been in the news this election cycle .
You 'll remember Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer was the surprise hit of the Democratic National Convention two months ago .
The Governor electrified the crowd causing the networks -- which normally ignore whom they consider b- listers -- to stop their blabbering pundits to carry the high - spirited speech .
“ We need all of you to stand up , ” he yelled .
“ Colorado !
Stand up !
Florida !
Stand up !
Pennsylvania !
Get off your hind end !
In the cheap seats !
Stand up !
We want to hear you from Denver to Detroit , from Montana to Mississippi , from California to Carolinas . ”
You want to talk about folksy ?
Montana 's governor makes Sarah Palin sound like the Queen of England .
( See one of his campaign ads below ) .
Obama leading
Regardless , the state 's in play .
A new CNN poll released on Friday shows Obama actually leading by a point .
" Montana 's usually a reliably Republican state in presidential campaigns .
It 's been won by the Democrats only twice in the past half century .
If you 're a Republican and you 're fighting for Montana in the last few days of the campaign , you 're not in good shape , " said CNN Senior Political Researcher Alan Silverleib .
Florida 2000
Get this .
The Obama campaign has shipped 300 lawyers to the Big Sky state to assist with the election .
What will they do ?
The Billings Gazette reports they will make sure that voters are n't " turned away or discouraged from voting . "
Not only that but the Obama effort already " has 40 paid field directors , 14,000 volunteers and more than 60 ' staging locations ' statewide , where workers will coordinate a final get - out - the - vote push that began Friday and culminates Tuesday , Election Day . "
" We are mounting a massive field effort to turn out voters , in a way that this state really has n't seen before , " said Caleb Weaver , an Obama spokesman .
Obama win
With Montana moving to toss - up status , CNN says if the election were held today , Obama would win with 291 electoral votes .
A candidate needs only 270 to win .
If Obama were to grab Montana , part of the credit would go to Texas congressman Ron Paul .
He 's on the ballot representing the Constitutional party .
And he 's polling at four percent of the vote .
This has caused the Republican National Committee to dump $ 300,000 to $ 400,000 to stop the state from turning blue .
McCain needs more
But even if Montana and the rest of the toss - ups go McCain it 's not enough .
That 's why you see McCain and Palin practically living in Pennsylvania .
As NBC's Chuck Todd explained to Tom Brokaw this morning , if McCain gets all the toss-ups as they currently stand ( Indiana , North Dakota , Missouri , Montana , North Carolina , Ohio , Florida , and Nevada ) , that totals only 252 electoral votes .
Pennsylvania is his path to crossing the 270 threshold .
But , it 's still not that easy .
As Todd explains , if Nevada goes Obama ( which is where the state currently leans ) , McCain 's got to get New Hampshire .
" [ Pennsylvania and New Hampshire ] is the only path he 's got left , " Todd said .
" They know this and that 's why they had to figure out how to put Pennsylvania back in play .
We do n't know if it really is .
We know he 's spending a lot of time there and they had to figure out if New Hampshire , a state that 's been incredibly kind to McCain 's political career in the past , to see if it can resurrect him one more time . "
Where 's John McCain today ?
Campaigning in Pennsylvania and New Hampshire .
A Palestinian father has claimed that he saw two of his young daughters shot dead and another critically injured by an Israeli soldier who emerged from a stationary tank and opened fire as the family obeyed an order from the Israeli forces to leave their home .
Khaled Abed Rabbo said Amal , aged two and Suad , seven , were killed by fire from the soldier 's semi-automatic rifle .
His third daughter , Samer , four , has been evacuated to intensive care in a Belgian hospital after suffering critical spinal injuries which he said were inflicted in the attack early in Israel 's ground offensive .
Mr Abed Rabbo stood near the wreckage off his subsequently destroyed home on the eastern edge of the northern Gaza town of Jabalya yesterday and described how a tank had parked outside the building at 12.50 pm on 7 January and ordered the family in Arabic through a megaphone to leave building .
He said his 60 - year - old mother had also been shot at as she left waving her white headscarf with her son , daughter in law and her three grandchildren .
" Two soldiers were on the tank eating chips , then one man came out of the tank with a rifle and started shooting the kids , " Mr Abed Rabbo , who receives a salary as a policeman from the Fatah - dominated Palestinian Authority in Ramallah said .
The family say they think the weapon used by the soldier was an M16 and that the first to be shot was Amal .
Mr Abed Rabbo said that Suad was then shot with what he claimed were 12 bullets , and then Samer .
The soldier who fired the rifle had what Mr Abed Rabbo thought were ringlets visible below his helmet , he said .
The small minority of ultra-Orthodox Jews who serve in the army are in a unit which did not take part in the Gaza offensive and only a very small number of settlers who also favour that hairstyle serve in other units .
It has so far been impossible independently to verify Mr Abed Rabbo 's claim and the military said last night Israeli Defence Forces " does not target civilians , only Hamas terrorists and infrastructure " .
It added : " The IDF is investigating various claims made with regard to Operation Cast Lead and at the end of its investigation will respond accordingly . "
The district is named Abed Rabbo after the clan who live in most of it .
The dense concrete roof of the house now hangs at more at more than a 45 - degree angle , and at least three other substantial buildings have been flattened in the agricultural , semi-rural immediate neighbourhood .
Khaled Abed Rabbo said that there had been a delay before the ambulance could reach the building because the road from the west had been made impassable by the churning of the tanks .
The soldiers had in the end let the family leave on foot , he said .
He added that they walked two kilometres before finding a vehicle to take them to Kamal Adwan Hospital .
He said : " I carried Suad , who was dead , my wife carried Amal and my brother Ibrahim carried Samer . "
He added : " We are not Hamas .
My children were not Hamas .
And if they were going to shoot anyone it should have been me . "
He added : " I want the international community and the International Red Cross to ask Israel why it has done this to us .
They talk about democracy but is it democracy to kill children ?
What did the kids do to them ?
What did my house do to them ?
They destroyed my life ?
Gaza City is showing signs of returning to a form of normality as more shops reopen .
The offices of the main Palestinian telephone company Jawwal reopened though this has not eased severe problems of connectivity on the Palestinian mobile network .
Some Hamas policemen were back directing traffic , though in smaller numbers than before the offensive .
Unconfirmed figures are that 270 Hamas policemen were killed , mainly in the air attacks during the first week .
In a victory rally in Gaza city yesterday , Hamas supporters converged on a square near the remains of the bombed parliament building ..

[ This is the first of several pieces on my thoughts at the Rebooting Computing summit , held January 12 - 14 in San Jose , California .
Later articles talk about image of CS , thoughts on approach , thoughts on personal stories and , as always , a little of this and that . ]
This was unusual : a workshop with no laptops out .
Some participants broke the rule almost immediately , including some big names , but I decided to follow my leaders .
That meant no live note - taking , except on paper , nor any interleaved blogging .
I decided to expand this opportunity and take advantage of an Internet - free trip , even back in the hotel !
The workshop brought together 225 people or so from all parts of computer science : industry , universities , K - 12 education , and government .
We had a higher percentage of women than the discipline as a whole , which made sense given our goals , and a large international contingent .
Three Turing Award winners joined in : Alan Kay , Vinton Cerf , and Fran Allen , who was an intellectual connection to the compiler course I put on hold for a few days in order to participate myself .
There were also a number of other major contributors to computing , people such as Grady Booch , Richard Gabriel , Dan Ingalls , and the most famous of three Eugenes in the room , Gene Spafford .
Most came without knowing what in particular we would do for these three days , or how .
The draw was the vision : a desire to reinvigorate computing everywhere .
The location was a perfect backdrop , the Computer History Museum .
The large printout of a chess program on old green and white computer paper hanging from the rafters near our upper - floor meeting room served as a constant reminder of a day when everything about computers and programming seemed new and exciting , when everything was a challenge to tackle .
The working replica of Charles Babbage 's Difference Engine on the main floor reminded us that big dreams are good -- and may go unfulfilled in one 's lifetime .
The Introduction
Peter Denning opened with a few remarks on what led him to organize the workshop .
He expressed his long - standing dissatisfaction with the idea that computer science == programming .
Dijkstra famously proclaimed that he was a programmer , and proud of it , but Denning always knew there was something bigger .
What is missing if we think only of programming ?
Using his personal experience as an example , he claimed that the outliers in the general population who make enter CS have invested many hours in several kinds of activity : math , science , and engineering .
Throughout much of the history of computer science , people made magic because they did n't know what they were doing was impossible .
This gave rise to the metaphor driving the workshop and his current effort -- to reboot computing , to clean out the cruft .
We have non-volatile memory , though , so we can start fresh with wisdom accumulated over the first 60 - 70 years of the discipline .
( Later the next day , Alan Kay pointed out that rebooting leaves same operating system and architecture in place , and that what we need to do is redesign them from the bottom up , too ! )
A spark ignited inside each of us once that turned us onto computing .
What was it ?
Why did it catch ?
How ?
One of the goals of the summit was to find out how we can create the same conditions for others .
The Approach
The goal of the workshop was to change the world -- to change how people think about computing .
The planning process destroyed the stereotypes that the non-CS facilitators held about CS people .
The workshop was organized around Appreciative Inquiry ( AI , but not the CS one -- or the one from the ag school ! ) , a process I first heard about in a paper by Kent Beck .
It uses a an exploration of positive experiences to help understand a situation and choose action .
For the summit , this meant developing a shared positive context about computing before moving on to the choosing of specific goals and plans .
Our facilitators used an implementation they characterized as Discovery - Dream - Design - Destiny .
The idea was to start by examining the past , then envision the future , and finally to return to the present and make plans .
Understanding the past helps us put our dreams into context , and building a shared vision of the future helps us to convert knowledge into actions .
One of our facilitators , Frank Barrett , is a former prof jazz musician , said an old saying from his past career is " Great performances create great listeners . "
He believes , though , that the converse is true : " Great listeners create great performances . "
He encouraged us to listen to one another 's stories carefully and look for common understanding that we could convert into action .
Frank also said that the goal of the workshop is really to change how people talk , not just think , about computing .
Whenever you propose that kind of change , people will see you as a revolutionary -- or as a lunatic .
An unusual complement to this humanistic approach to the workshop was a graphic artist who was recording the workshop live before our eyes , in image and word .
Even when the record was mostly catchphrases that could have become part of a slide presentation , the colors and shapes added a nice touch to the experience .
The Spark
What excited most of us about computing was solving a problem -- having some something that that was important to us , sometimes bigger than we could do easily by hand , and doing it with a computer .
Sometimes we enjoyed the making of things that could serve our needs .
Sometimes we were enlivened by making something we found beautiful .
Still , a lot of people in the room " stumbled " or " drifted " into CS from other places .
Those words carry quite different images of peoples ' experiences .
However subtle the move , they all seemed to have been working on real problems .
One of the beauties of computer science is that it is in and about everything .
For many , computing is a lens through which to study problems and create solutions .
Like mathematics , but more .
One particular comment made the first morning stood out in my mind .
The gap between what people want to make with a computer and what they can reasonably make has widened considerably in the last thirty years .
What they want to make is influenced by what they see and use every day .
Back in 1980 I wanted to write a program to compute chess ratings , and a bit of BASIC was all I needed .
Kids these days walk around with computational monsters in their pockets , sometimes a couple , and their desires have grown to match .
Show them Java or Python , let alone BASIC , and they may well feel deflated before considering just what they could do .
Computing creates a new world .
It builds new structures on top of old , day by day .
Computing is different today than it was thirty years ago -- and so is the world .
What excited us may well not excite today 's youth .
What about what excited us might ?
( Like any good computer scientist , I have gone meta . )
Educators cannot create learning .
Students do that .
What can educators provide ?
A sense of quality .
What is good ?
What is worth doing ?
Why ?
History
A lot of great history was made and known by the people in this room .
The rest of us have lived through some of it .
Just hearing some of these lessons reignited the old spark inside of me .
Consider Alan Turing 's seminal 1935 paper on the Halting Problem .
Part of the paper is Turing " thumbing his nose " at his skeptical mathematician colleagues , saying " The very question is computation .
You ca n't escape it . "
One time , Charles Babbage was working with his friend , the astronomer Herschel .
They were using a set of astronomy tables to solve a problem , and Babbage became frustrated by errors in the tables .
He threw the book at a wall and said , " I wish these calculations had been executed by steam ! "
Steam .
Ada Lovelace referred to Babbage 's Difference Engine as a machine that " weaves patterns of ideas " .
Alan Kay reminded us of the ultimate importance of what Turing taught us :
If you do n't like the machine you have , you can make the machine you want .
AI -- the computing kind , which was the source of many of my own initial sparks -- has had two positive effects on the wider discipline .
First , it has always offered a big vision of what computing can be .
Second , even when it struggles to reach that vision , it spins off new technologies it creates along the way .
At some point in the two days , Alan Kay chastised us .
Know your history !
Google has puts all seventy - five or so of Douglas Engelbart 's papers at your fingertips .
Do you even type the keywords into the search box , let alone read them ?
About Computing
A common thread throughout the workshop was , what are the key ideas and features of computing that we should not lose as we move forward ?
There were some common answers .
People want to solve real problems for real people .
They want to find ideas in experience and applications .
Another was the virtue of persistence , which one person characterized as " embracing failure " -- a twisted but valuable perspective .
Yet another was the idea of " no more black boxes " , whether hardware or software .
Look inside , and figure out what makes it tick .
None of these are unique to CS , but they are in some essential to it .
Problem solving came up a lot , too .
I think that people in most disciplines " solve problems " and so would claim problem solving as an essential feature of the discipline .
Is computer science different ?
I think so .
CS is about the process of solving problems .
We seek to understand the nature of algorithms and how they manipulate information .
Whichever real problem we have just solved , we ask , " How ? " and " Why ? "
We try to generalize and understand the data and the algorithm .
Another common feature that many thought essential to computing is that it is interdisciplinary .
CS reaches into everything .
This has certainly been one of the things that has attracted me to computing all these years .
I am interested in many things , and I love to learn about ideas that transcend disciplines -- or that seem to but do n't .
What is similar and dissimilar between two problems or solutions ?
Much of AI comes down to knowing what is similar and what is not , and that idea held my close attention for more than a decade .
While talking with one of my table mates at the summit , I realized that this was one of the biggest influences my Ph.D. advisor , Jon Sticklen , had on me .
He approached AI from all directions , from the perspectives of people solving problems in all disciplines .
He created an environment that sought and respected ideas from everywhere , and he encouraged that mindset in all who studied in his lab .
Programming
While I respect Denning 's dissatisfaction with the idea that computer science == programming , I do n't think we should lose the idea of programming whatever we do to reinvigorate computing .
Whatever else computing is , in the end , it all comes down to a program running somewhere .
When it was my turn to describe part of my vision for the future of computing , I said something like this :
When they have questions , children will routinely walk to the computer and write a program to find the answers , just as they now use Google , Wikipedia , or IMDB to look up answers .
I expected to have my table mates look at me funny , but my vision went over remarkably well .
People embraced the idea -- as long as we put it in the context of " solving a problem " .
When I ventured further to using a program " to communicate an idea " , I met resistance .
Something unusual happened , though .
As the discussion continued , every once in a while someone would say , " I 'm still thinking about communicating an idea with a program ... " .
It did n't quite fit , but they were intrigued .
I consider that progress .
Closing
At the end of the second day , we formed action groups around a dozen or so ideas that had a lot of traction across the whole group .
I joined a group interested in using problem - based learning to change how we introduce computing to students .
That seemed like a moment when we would really get down to business , but unfortunately I had to miss the last day of the summit .
This was the first week of winter semester classes at my university , and I could not afford to miss both sessions of my course .
I 'm waiting to hear from other members of my group , to see what they discussed on Wednesday and what we are going to do next .
As I was traveling back home the next day , I thought about whether the workshop had been worth missing most of the first week of my semester .
I 'll talk more about the process and our use of time in a later entry .
But whatever else , the summit put a lot of different people from different parts of the discipline into one room and got us talking about why computing matters and how we can help to change how the world thinks -- and talks -- about it .
That was good .
Before I left for California , I told a colleague that this summit held the promise of being something special , and that it also bore the the risk of being the same old thing , with visionaries , practitioners , and career educators chasing their tails in a vain effort to tame this discipline of ours .
In the end , I think it was -- as so many things turn out to be -- a little of both .

The US could replace all its cars and trucks with electric cars powered by wind turbines taking up less than 3 square kilometres , says the study ( Image : Larry MacDougal / Rex Features )
The US could replace all its cars and trucks with electric cars powered by wind turbines taking up less than 3 square kilometres – in theory , at least .
That ’s the conclusion of a detailed study ranking 11 types of non-fossil fuels according to their total ecological footprint and their benefit to human health .
The study , carried out by Mark Jacobson of the atmosphere and energy programme at Stanford University , found wind power to be by far the most desirable source of energy .
Biofuels from corn and plant waste came right at the bottom of the list , along with nuclear power and “ clean ” coal .
Watch a video of Jacobson discussing his findings .

The energy sources that Jacobson found most promising were , in descending order :
• Wind
• Concentrated solar power ( mirrors heating a tower of water )
• Geothermal energy
• Tidal energy
• Solar panels
• Wave energy
• Hydroelectric dams
To compare the fuels , Jacobson calculated the impacts each would have if it alone powered the entire US fleet of cars and trucks .
He considered not just the quantities of greenhouse gases that would be emitted , but also the impact the fuels would have on the ecosystem – taking up land and polluting water , for instance .
Also considered were the fuel ’s impact on pollution and therefore human health , the availability of necessary resources , and the energy form ’s reliability .
“ The energy alternatives that are good are not the ones that people have been talking about the most , ” says Jacobson .
“ Some options that have been proposed are just downright awful , ” he says .
“ Ethanol - based biofuels will actually cause more harm to human health , wildlife , water supply , and land use than current fossil fuels . ”
Biofuel concerns
Jacobson says it would take 30 times more space to grow enough corn to power the US fleet than would be needed to erect enough wind turbines , while bioethanol would produce more greenhouse gases than wind power .
Biofuels have received a considerable amount of political backing in recent years with the US and Europe setting targets to phase in their use and gradually replace oil .
Energy and wildlife experts have expressed concerns about biofuels and the EU last year appeared to reconsider its position .
Nuclear is another energy source whose merits have been debated by European and US leaders alike in the past 12 months .
“ It results in 25 times more carbon and air pollution than wind , ” says Jacobson .
Half of those emissions are caused by the time it takes to plan and build a nuclear power plant – time during which fossil fuels have to be burnt for energy .
“ Clean ” coal – the process of burning coal then capturing the emitted carbon dioxide and storing it underground – is another political favourite .
Jacobson ’s calculations show that building and using enough clean coal power plants would emit up to 110 times more carbon than building and using wind turbines only .
Focused efforts
“ The philosophy that we should try a little bit of everything is wrong , ” says Jacobson .
“ We need to focus on the technologies that provide the best benefit .
We know which these are . ”
Jacobson acknowledges that politicians are calling for a massive jobs programme to pull the economy out of recession , but says investment in renewable energy is one way to do that .
“ Putting people to work building wind turbines , solar plants , geothermal plants , electric vehicles , and transmission lines would not only create jobs but also reduce costs due to healthcare , crop damage , and climate damage – as well as provide the world with a truly unlimited supply of clean power , ” he says .
Jacobson presented his results to the chairman of the Senate energy and Natural Resources Committee in October last year .
They are published in Energy and Environmental Science this month ( DOI : 10.1039/b809990c ) .

' This may be the most thought - provoking film I 've seen all year , ' Xan Brooks says of Ari Folman 's inventive animated documentary about the Sabra and Shatila massacre of 1982
Despite the bitter cold , over a million people crowded on the streets of Washington , DC in rapture to watch as Barack Hussein Obama II became the 44th President of the United States on Tuesday .
Obama ’s rise to power can only be described as meteoric .
He became the New Hope of the Democratic party following a rousing speech at the 2004 convention  especially after the candidate nominated at the said convention , John Kerry , was trounced that fall by George W. Bush , who had already committed the vast majority of his gaffes and blunders as emperor .
For a while in late 2007 it looked as if Hillary Clinton might triumph in the primaries ; but Obama offered a message ( " Yes we can ! " " Hope " and " Change " ) and fundraising ability that Clinton could not match .
As the price of nomination , the self - proclaimed outsider surrounded himself with Washington insiders , from VP Joseph Biden to , yes , Hillary Clinton .
Opinions may vary on how much , if anything , Obama has actually done during his one term in the Senate and three terms in the Illinois state legislature , but there is no doubt that the man is a charismatic and superbly talented orator .
His first inaugural address , reportedly penned by 27 - year - old Jon Favreau , was an exercise in Ciceronian art .
But when we look past the pomp and circumstance of the inauguration day , the cheering crowds and the blasphemous panegyrics in the press , the question remains : what did President Obama ’s speech actually mean ?
Breaking the Faith
Obviously , the function of Obama ’s inaugural address was to deliver a message of hope and inspiration to a country hit hard by an economic crisis , mired in an endless war against an ethereal enemy , and worn down from eight years under a regime that believed its will alone could shape reality .
But any inaugural speech also serves to set the tone for the coming presidency .
Amid the paternal praise and encouragement that Obama offered to the American people , there were glimpses of his beliefs and intentions  none of them reassuring .
For example , does Obama honestly believe that " we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebears , and true to our founding documents " ?
It is extremely unlikely the Founders would recognize what became of the Republic they created , if they could see it today .
Here is how Thomas Jefferson articulated the Founders ’ sentiment in drafting the document adopted in 1787 :
" In questions of power , then , let no more be heard of confidence in man , but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution . "
Yet the government of which Obama became the chief executive this week has become an omnipresent busybody that considers the Constitution " just a damn piece of paper "  when it remembers it at all !
Remaking America
Equally disconcerting is the declaration that , " Starting today , we must pick ourselves up , dust ourselves off , and begin again the work of remaking America . "
One could make a good argument that the country that emerged from the 1861 - 1865 war was already radically different from what was set out in Philadelphia in 1776 and 1787 .
Major changes certainly took place in 1913 , when a slew of legislation established the income tax , direct election of Senators , the Federal Reserve , and a nationwide prohibition on alcohol .
So , the government in Washington has been " remaking " America for almost a hundred years  sometimes for the better , often for the worse , but always by force .
" The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small , but whether it works , " said Obama .
Fine , it does n’t matter what color the cat , so long as it catches mice .
But what does Obama see as the government ’s job ?
To help " families find jobs at a decent wage , care they can afford , a retirement that is dignified . "
This is n’t the state - as - necessary - evil view of a classical liberal ( such as Jefferson or even Hamilton ) , but a state - as - parent belief of modern collectivists .
There was a system that promised a job for every worker , free healthcare and a guaranteed state pension .
It died in 1989 in Eastern Europe .
Back to 1999
Those that hoped against hope that Obama would be a president , not an Emperor , were in for a disappointment .
His messages to the rest of the world in the inaugural speech suggest that he does not intend to abandon the foolish idea of American global hegemony , only to revise its image to that of the ( supposedly ) more appealing 1990s .
" [ O ] ur spirit is stronger and cannot be broken ; you cannot outlast us , and we will defeat you , " could have just as easily come from Bush the Lesser  though perhaps from him it would not have seemed nearly as convincing .
Much more ominous was Obama ’s announcement that , " we are ready to lead once more . "
Last January , in a Washington Post op - ed , Foreign Policy editor in chief Moises Naim put forward an argument that the Bush administration was one of " disengagement and distraction , " and that the world actually wanted American " leadership " and needed American hegemony .
At the time , it looked like Naim was stating the case for Empress Clinton ; now Emperor Obama appears to have embraced his argument .
And though she missed out on the White House , Hillary Clinton looks set to take control of U.S. foreign policy within days .
It is in that light that one should interpret Obama ’s statement that , " We can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders . "
This is nothing else than a blanket endorsement of " humanitarian intervention , " a specious concept pioneered in the years of Bill Clinton ’s presidency to justify American military involvement in other countries .
Under the banner of preventing humanitarian disasters such as " ethnic cleansing " and " genocide , " the Clinton regime invaded , bombed and occupied , international law be damned .
Bush the Lesser ’s " disengagement and distraction " in Iraq was rightly seen as a continuation of Clinton ’s imperial adventures .
The only difference is that Bush launched expensive , all - out wars he chose to justify by naked assertion of American power ( " So what ? " ) , while Clinton preferred his wars to be by proxy or from 15,000 feet , masquerading as charity .
One is compelled to wonder what happened to the " tempering qualities of humility and restraint . "
Perhaps they mean as much as Bush II ’s campaign pledge to abandon " nation - building " and engage in a " more humble foreign policy . "
Not that there is any reason to fear that Obama ’s administration would engage in nation - building , not after he said :
" [ W ]e can not help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass ; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve ; that as the world grows smaller , our common humanity shall reveal itself ; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace . "
Same as the Old Boss
Obama finished the speech by quoting George Washington ’s words about the endurance at Valley Forge , and warning Americans that " we have duties to ourselves , our nation , and the world , duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly . "
Those duties , as the speech suggests , apparently include " remaking " America , making the federal government the exact opposite of what it was supposed to be ( while pretending to have stayed faithful to the ideals of the Founders ) , and " leading " the world into a new age of post- ethnic , post- national prosperity .
On September 14 , Bush II also spoke of a " historical responsibility " of Americans  to " rid the world of evil . "
How is this different ?
Barack Obama came to the White House on a promise of change .
Everything he has done , however , from his staff and cabinet appointments to his inaugural speech , indicates that he is all about continuity .
No matter what he calls it , to the recipients of his " leadership " in the months and years to come , it will be the same old American Empire .
Melody Morales : " Ghetto " Bikini Girl Sues Hawaiian Tropic Zone ( PHOTOS )
21 - year - old , a former Hooters girl , is suing Hawaiian Tropic Zone in New York City , citing " racism . "
Managers at the Times Square restaurant allegedly refused Morales a job , saying she was " too ghetto . "
The suit alleges that Morales went to the restaurant with her mom in March seeking a job .
" You do n't speak white , " Morales claims she was told by one manager .
" I am not going to ruin my business with your Latin accent . "
She then returned months later , still in search of a job , and was allegedly told by another manager , " We will not hire you because you have a speech problem , " and " You have a Latin accent . "
According to Morales ' lawyer , " Melody certainly has the assets for this job . "
" Not to brag , but I look good in a bikini , " Morales said Tuesday .
" I could have done a perfect job there . "
A spokesman for Hawaiian Tropic Zone issued a statement saying Morales ' suit is baseless .
The restaurant is currently facing a $ 600 million federal suit from four former female workers accusing an ex-boss of sickening sexual antics .

Landtagswahl in Hessen :
Votum gegen die Große Koalition
Von Peter Schwarz
20 . Januar 2009
Das Ergebnis der hessischen Landtagswahl vom Sonntag ist eine schallende Ohrfeige für die Große Koalition in Berlin .
Von den 4,4 Millionen Wahlberechtigten haben nur 1,6 Millionen oder 36 Prozent ihre Stimme der CDU oder der SPD gegeben , die seit dreieinhalb Jahren gemeinsam die Bundesregierung bilden .
Der seit langem zu beobachtende Verfall der so genannten Volksparteien setzt sich auch in Hessen unvermindert fort .
Rund 1,8 Millionen Wahlberechtigte blieben den Urnen fern oder stimmten ungültig .
Mit 61 Prozent erreichte die Wahlbeteiligung einen historischen Tiefstand .
Vor einem Jahr waren noch 64 Prozent zur Urne gegangen .
Die SPD erzielte mit 23,7 Prozent der abgegebenen Stimmen das schlechteste Ergebnis ihrer Geschichte .
Im Vergleich zur letztjährigen
Wahl verlor sie fast 400.000 Stimmen , ein Minus von 13 Prozentpunkten .
155.000 davon blieben der Urne fern , 120.000 wechselten zu den Grünen .
Die Verluste der SPD waren allgemein erwartet worden , nachdem der Versuch der SPD - Vorsitzenden Andrea Ypsilanti , entgegen ihrer ursprünglichen Wahlaussage eine Regierung mit Unterstützung der Linkspartei zu bilden , zweimal gescheitert war .
Überraschend war dagegen das Ergebnis der CDU .
Sie konnte entgegen allen Erwartungen nicht vom Niedergang der SPD profitieren und verlor erneut 46.000 Stimmen , nachdem sie bereits vor einem Jahr dramatische Verluste erlitten hatte .
Lediglich wegen der geringeren Wahlbeteiligung konnte sie prozentual um 0,4 Punkte auf 37,2 Prozent zulegen .
Hauptgewinner der Wahl waren die FDP und die Grünen , die beide über 6 Prozentpunkte hinzugewannen und mit 16,2 , bzw .
13,7 Prozent Rekordergebnisse erzielten .
Gemeinsam mit der FDP , die sich schon im Wahlkampf für eine Koalition mit der CDU ausgesprochen hatte , verfügt der amtierende Ministerpräsident Roland Koch nun wieder über eine sichere Mehrheit .
Die meisten Wahlanalysen erklären das Ergebnis der Hessenwahl mit den " politischen Turbulenzen der vergangenen Monate " ( Infratest dimap ) , den Auseinandersetzungen um eine von der Linkspartei unterstützten Koalition von SPD und Grünen , die schließlich an vier Abweichlern in der SPD - Fraktion scheiterten .
Das mag das Ergebnis beeinflusst haben , war aber letztlich nicht der entscheidende Faktor .
Die diesjährige Landtagswahl fand unter völlig anderen Bedingungen statt als die Wahl vor einem Jahr .
Es war die erste Landtagswahl nach dem Ausbruch der schwersten Wirtschaftskrise seit den dreißiger Jahren .
Seit dem Platzen der amerikanischen Sub - Prime - Immobilienblase im vergangenen Sommer haben die Banken Milliardenverluste gemeldet und die Bundesregierung hat gigantische Summen zur Verfügung gestellt , um den Finanzspekulanten unter die Arme zu greifen .
Inzwischen steht außer Zweifel , dass die Weltwirtschaft 2009 durch eine schwere Rezession geht .
Unter diesen Umständen zeigt die Hessenwahl die enorme Kluft , die sich zwischen den etablierten Parteien und breiten Schichten der Bevölkerung aufgetan hat .
Die massive Stimmenthaltung und die hohen Verluste von SPD und CDU sind Ausdruck des Misstrauens und der offenen Feindschaft gegenüber Parteien , die seit Jahren soziale Errungenschaften und demokratische Rechte abbauen und dabei aufs Engste mit den Chefs der Banken und großen Konzerne zusammenarbeiten .
Die Stimmengewinne von FDP und Grünen stehen dazu nur scheinbar im Widerspruch .
Eine Umfrage im Auftrag der ARD hat ergeben , dass weit über die Hälfte der Wähler diesen Parteien ihre Stimme nicht gegeben haben , weil sie ihnen trauen , sondern weil sie allen anderen Parteien noch stärker misstrauen .
Das heißt , der Erfolg von FDP und Grünen ist Ausdruck des allgemeinen Misstrauens unter Umständen , unter denen keine ernsthafte Alternative zur Wahl steht .
Beide Parteien unterscheiden sich inhaltlich kaum von SPD und CDU .
Der Spitzenkandidat der hessischen FDP , Jörg - Uwe Hahn , ist derart konturlos , dass er selbst am Wahlabend nicht zu sagen wusste , was seine Partei von der CDU unterscheidet .
Und die Grünen sind längst bereit , sowohl mit der SPD und als auch mit der CDU in eine Koalition zu gehen .
Ein weiteres bemerkenswertes Ergebnis der Hessenwahl ist das Abschneiden der Linkspartei .
Obwohl die SPD weit über ein Drittel ihrer Wähler verloren hat , konnte die Linkspartei keine hinzugewinnen .
Sie zieht zwar mit 5,4 Prozent der Stimmen erneut in den hessischen Landtag ein , erhielt aber 1.700 Stimmen weniger als vor einem Jahr .
Dabei ist sie eigens zu dem Zweck gegründet worden , Teile der SPD aufzufangen , wenn diese auseinander bricht .
Das ist ihr gründlich misslungen .
Oberflächliche Analysen erklären dies damit , dass die Wähler " keine Extreme " mögen .
Das Problem ist nur , an der Linkspartei ist nichts " extrem " .
Sie hat sich während des vergangenen Jahres redlich bemüht , den etablierten Parteien ihre Verlässlichkeit zu beweisen , und der geplanten rot-grünen Koalition Ypsilantis einen Blankoscheck ausgestellt .
In den neuen Bundesländern und der Stadt Berlin hat sie sich längst als staatstragende Partei bewährt .
Die Stagnation der Linkspartei hat andere Ursachen .
Nur Wenige glauben , dass ihr Programm - ein aufgewärmter Sozialreformismus im Stile der siebziger Jahre - eine Antwort auf die globale Wirtschaftskrise gibt .
Die meisten Arbeiter sind realistisch genug , um zu verstehen , dass sich die tiefste Krise der kapitalistischen Wirtschaft seit über 70 Jahren nicht durch eine " Steigerung der Massenkaufkraft " und andere Maßnahmen lösen lässt , die die Linkspartei verspricht , ohne sie jemals durchzuführen .
Sie suchen nach einer radikaleren Antwort , und die sehen sie gegenwärtig noch nicht .
Daraus erklären sich die massenhafte Stimmenthaltung und das Aufblähen von FDP und Grünen , die selbst kaum verstehen , wie ihnen geschieht .
Doch das ist ein vorübergehendes Phänomen .
Das Ausmaß der Krise , die sich täglich weiter verschärft , macht heftige Klassenkämpfe unausweichlich .
Die herrschende Klasse und ihre Parteien - CDU , FDP , SPD , Grüne und Linke - sind entschlossen , die Folgen der Krise auf die arbeitende Bevölkerung abzuwälzen .
Auf diese Kämpfe gilt es sich vorzubereiten durch den Aufbau einer unabhängigen , wirklich sozialistischen Arbeiterpartei .
Teeth could be repaired or regrown Scientists believe they have found a way to grow teeth in the laboratory , a discovery that could put an end to fillings and dentures .
The US team from Oregon have located the gene responsible for the growth of enamel , the hard outer layer of teeth which cannot grow back naturally .
Other scientists are already growing the inner parts of teeth in animals - but they have no hard enamel coatings .
The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences work may plug this gap .
Experiments in mice have shown that the gene , a " transcription factor " called Ctip2 , has several functions involving immune responses and the development of skin and nerves .
A lot of work would still be needed to bring this to human applications , but it should work
Lead researcher Dr Chrissa Kioussi
The work at Oregon State University made the link with enamel by studying mice bred to lack Ctip2 .
Lead researcher Dr Chrissa Kioussi said : " It 's not unusual for a gene to have multiple functions , but before this we did n't know what regulated the production of tooth enamel . "
The scientists found that Ctip2 was crucial for the enamel - producing cells , called ameloblasts , to form and work properly .
Dr Kioussi said : " This is the first transcription factor ever found to control the formation and maturation of ameloblasts , which are the cells that secrete enamel . "
Controlling the gene in conjunction with stem - cell technology could make the artificial creation of functional teeth a real possibility .
Alternatively , the knowledge could be used to strengthen existing enamel and repair damaged enamel , cutting decay and the need for fillings .
Dr Kioussi said : " A lot of work would still be needed to bring this to human applications , but it should work .
It could be really cool , a whole new approach to dental health . "
Paul Sharpe , an expert on tooth development at the Dental Institute at King 's College London , said : " If you could find some way of growing ameloblasts that make enamel , you could find a way to repair teeth .
" Any gene like this is worth understanding .
The more we learn about it the more we can use the information to make biological models of tooth repair . "

Like many people , Jaya Kumar wanted an e-book reader that was a little more capable than Amazon.com 's Kindle .
So he built one .
Kumar 's custom - built e-book reader has a fully capable web browser — it can even handle Google Maps — and the same " electronic ink " display used by the Kindle and the Sony Reader .
" It offers an opportunity to get involved with a disruptive technology that is at the tipping point of having a huge impact in the real world , " says
Kumar , an embedded Linux developer who lives in Malaysia .
" It is also exciting to be using something that 's cutting - edge but accessible in an open way so that a hobbyist can take the kit and manipulate it . "
Kumar is one of a community of developers building e-book readers using prototype kits from E Ink , whose paperlike displays power both Amazon 's and Sony 's e-book readers .
E
Ink 's kits allow do - it - yourself hackers and engineers to create their own applications and products .
It may not be as pretty as the neatly packaged Amazon Kindle or the Sony Reader .
And at a whopping $ 3,000 , the E Ink kit is n't going to threaten Amazon 's market share ( the Kindle 2 costs $ 350 ) .
But for the Lego - minded , the kits can offer an experience that pre-packaged e-readers will find difficult to beat .
E Ink launched the prototype kits about eight months ago targeted at product designers and hobbyists who want hands - on access to its display technology .
The company 's lower power , sunlight - readable , thin displays already power the Kindle and Sony Reader .
The prototype kit offers buyers a production sample of a glass - based display , a display controller and all the hardware and software necessary to produce a fully functional e-reader .
The kit supports 5 " , 6 " , 8 " and 9.7 "
displays .
" The primary advantage is you can take it apart and look at each individual piece , like a block diagram , " says Sri Peruvemba , vice president of marketing for E Ink .
" You can do your own design and put together your own device or applications based on our technology . "
For e-book enthusiasts , it offers what a Kindle or a Sony Reader can't .
" If you buy one of those units you wo n't be wo n’t be able to reprogram it to your satisfaction , " he says .
" You can't copy the electronics or change the chipset or use a different software . "
The kit is based around the open source Gumstix single - board computer , which combines a 400 - MHz Marvell processor with a Bluetooth transceiver , USB , a serial port and a card reader .
( In contrast , the Kindle 2 has a 532 - MHz processor and no ports , but does include a built - in wireless access card . )
The board comes installed with Linux .

Ink also offers software display drivers that are open source and sample applications to help developers and hobbyists get started .
The prototype kits are pre-configured to operate as a simple e-book reader .
So out of the box , users can download page images from their PC to the included multimedia card and view them on the display with no further programming or assembly .
But the ability to hack and tweak has made it a dream gadget for developers like Kumar .
Kumar has written several drivers for the kit that would make typical Linux applications run transparently on it .
" It 's more than just an e-book reader then , " says Kumar .
Kumar 's programming efforts allow Fennec , an Mozilla Firefox web browser for mobile phones and smaller non-PC devices , to run on the kit .
( See video here . )
Kumar can even have Google maps on his e-reader .
So far most of the applications are Linux - based , but there are users trying to run Windows CE and other operating systems on the kits , says E Ink's Peruvemba .
Earlier this month , product development firm Moto Development Group showed off the first E Ink display powered by the Google Android operating system .
( See video here )
The community of DIYers keep the buzz alive on the prototype kits but companies also use them to create new products .
" A number of people are building the next - generation browsing device , tablet PC or handheld , " says Peruvemba .
" Those devices could run our display and companies want to experiment with it . "

Farmer America has only two million farmers , and their average age is 55 .
Since sustainable agriculture requires small - scale , local , organic methods rather than petroleum - based machines and fertilizers , there is a huge need for more farmers — up to tens of millions of them , according to food guru Michael Pollan .
Modern farmers are small businesspeople who must be as skilled in heirloom genetics as marketing .

Forester Modern forestry is a complex combination of international project finance , conservation , and development .
According to the World Bank , a staggering 1.6 billion people depend on the forest for their livelihoods .
Foresters help local people transition from slash - and - burn to silviculture –teaching cultivation of higher - value , faster - growing species for fruit , medicine or timber , for example , while carefully documenting the impact on the environment .
Deforestation , which causes around a quarter of all global warming , is also likely to be a leading source of carbon credits worth tens of billions of dollars .

Energy Efficiency Builder
Buildings account for up to 48 percent of US energy use and greenhouse gas emissions .
LEED , the major green building certification , has over 43,000 accredited professionals .
But the cutting edge in efficient buildings goes far beyond LEED .
Buildings constructed according to Passivhaus and MINERGIE -P standards in Germany and Switzerland , respectively , use between 75 % and 95 % less heat energy than a similar building constructed to the latest codes in the US .
Greening the US building stock will take not only skilled architects and engineers but a workforce of retrofitters who can use spray foam insulation and storm windows to massively improve the R- value ( thermal resistance ) of the draftiest old houses .
A study by the Apollo Alliance recommended an $ 89.9 billion investment in financing to create 827,260 jobs in green buildings — an initiative supported by the Obama stimulus package , which specifically mentions energy retrofits .

The total number of recycling jobs in the United States is at more than 1 million , according to recent reports ( PDF , right click to save ) .
Although the market for paper and plastic has slowed down recently due to the economic downturn , demand for steel is still strong — 42 percent of output came from scrap in 2006 — and recycling remains the economical alternative to high disposal fees .
Worldwide more than 200,000 people work in secondary steel production , and the US is a major center of production .
New laws and regulations are also creating a need for specialized companies that can close the loop by recycling and repurposing e-waste , clothing , plastic bags , construction waste , and other materials .

There ’s a saying , “ animals make us human . ”
It ’s because the way we treat the creatures in our care shows what kind of people we are .
If you care about your own health , what you eat and what kind of home you live in , it ’s important that you care about the health and happiness of the animals that share your home .
Love is important for your pet , but so is proper care and mental stimulation .
Here are the essential basics of providing a good life for your pet :
Spay or neuter your pet .
With an overabundance of animals in shelters who already need loving homes , there ’s no need for you to supply your neighborhood with more puppies or kittens .
Why take the risk of filling the world with more unwanted animals ?
Feral animals breed like wildfire and usually end up hungry , sick and diseased .
Besides , your local bird population will thank you , as a few feral cats is all it takes to hunt them into neighborhood extinction .
Feed them what they really need .
If you care about the kind of food you put into your own body , you ’ve got to care about your animal ’s diet too .
You do n’t have to buy the most expensive stuff , but take a few minutes to look at the ingredients .
Dogs and cats eat meat , and although it ’s perfectly fine to include vegetarian items in their food , the first few ingredients need to be real meat .
Not “ chicken by - product meal ” ( which means ground up bones , beaks and feathers ) , but actual chicken .
Your pet ’s long term health is worth it .
Avoid grains and fillers .
Appreciate what they bring to you .
You take care of your pet , but your pet takes care of you , too !
The unconditional adoration from your dog is pretty hard to find anywhere in the human world , and a cat ’s satisfied purr as it naps on your belly has got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world .
Take time to appreciate their personalities and companionship – being a good human requires more than just feeding them and taking them to the vet .
Exercise with your dog .
Part of the responsibility you chose when you decided to keep a dog is to make sure they get plenty of daily exercise .
Unless your dog is blessed with a huge yard and a few other doggy companions , you need to make sure you schedule in trips to the dog park , a vigorous game of fetch , some rough and tumble wrestling or a brisk jog through the neighborhood .
The active lifestyle will do both of you a lot of good .
Consider your dog your best workout partner !
Play with your cat .
If you share your life with a cat , you know they like to sleep for hours , but cats get bored too .
They need playtime and stimulation , and it ’s easy to create simple , inexpensive toys ( a feather on a string , a ball with a bell inside ) to keep them active and entertained .
Most cats go nuts chasing the light from a laser pointer !
Adopt from animal shelters .
If you ’re looking for a new animals to expand your pet - family , I urge you to adopt from a shelter .
The reasons not to buy from a pet store are numerous , and you ’ll really be saving an adopted critter ’s life by letting them into your heart and home .
As much as you can , go green .
From carpet cleaners to flea control , it ’s always best to reduce the amount of chemicals in your personal environment .
Guest writer Kathryn Hawkins has a whole list of ways to green your pet ’s life ( which is part of greening yours ) .
Regular check - ups .
I know , I know , it ’s not easy getting your animal friends to the vet .
They always seem to know what you ’re up to and hide out in the hardest to reach corners of the house .
But it ’s important they get checked out regularly , because a condition caught early on is much easier to treat than something full blown .
Remember the adage : “ An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure , ” ( this goes for you too ! ) .
Do n’t be afraid to explore alternative treatments like animal acupuncture and pet massage .
Teach kids respect for animals .
If you have children or kids that visit your home often , it ’s important you teach them how to care for and respect your pets .
Take the time to show them how to gently pet , and not pester , these critters who are trying to relax in their own home .
Kids always learn best by example .

A Voice From The Wilderness ..... And A Must - Buy Record
While there has been little activity on the old Shotgun these days , I was compelled to provide a quick note about one of the best new albums in the last decade - " Hearts From Above " - the new album by standout Texas band Micky & The Motorcars .
Apart from 2 or 3 tracks , this album is consistently solid and represents the best of the Americana / Alt - Country / Red Dirt genre this side of Jason Isbell .
In short , grab this album .

This advice has served me well .
It was propounded to me by my late father , who often said , “ Be prudent . ”
MY work as a freelance writer in Hollywood some time ago prepared me for extreme uncertainty .
This is the most insecure existence imaginable .
It mandates saving , ingenuity and nonstop work and creativity .
Freelancers never have a day off .
Never .
They know that they can go months without a check .
They absolutely have to save .
They have to have five different levels of fall - back plans and financial escape hatches .
I am well past that now .
Decades past .
( I hope . )
But the habits of thought linger , at least a bit .
I wish I could teach that work ethic to those close to me .
I wish I could teach them that money is a scarce good , worth fighting for and protecting .
But I very much fear that my son , more up - to - date than I am in almost every way , is more of a modern - day American than I am .
To hustle and scuffle for a deal is something he cannot even imagine .
To not be able to eat at any restaurant he feels like eating at is just not on his wavelength .
Of course , that ’s my fault .
( I have learned that everything bad that happens anywhere is my fault . )
And I hope to be able to leave him well enough provided for to ease his eventual transition into some form of self - sufficiency .
But I keep thinking of my friend in California , and what a perfect specimen of what we have become that she has become .
I keep lecturing my son , as Pop lectured me , to learn prudence .
I keep lecturing myself to learn it ; I am far from a small player in the extravagance game .
Maybe , upon second thought , I did not learn well about prudence .
Then I think that maybe it ’s too late for far too many of us .
The age when money was a free good , available in unlimited quantities just for signing a note , may well be over .
What the heck will we do when we have to start acting like mature adults ?
How will we cope with limits ?
With reality ?
America , a nation of free - spending Peter Pans .
Where are our moms and dads when we need them ?
It ’s their fault .
BANGKOK , Thailand ( CNN ) -- A
Thai judge fined dozens of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar who pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges of illegal entry after escaping from their own country a month ago -- amid allegations that other Rohingya have been dumped at sea by the Thai army .
Male refugees show scars they say were caused by beatings at the hands of the Myanmar navy .
The Ranong Provincial Court judge ordered each of the 66 ethnic Muslim refugees to pay 1,000
Thai baht ( less than $ 30 ) .
He imposed the fines via a closed - circuit television link to Ranong Provincial Prison , where the refugees will continue to be held until they can pay the court .
Twelve additional refugees , all teenagers , were being detained at a police station and are exempt from prosecution .
The 78 refugees will be handed over on January 31 to immigration police , who will deport them .
It is unclear where they will be sent .
The refugees arrived by boat on the Thai shore , and Thai police said many had severe burns from a fire that broke out on board their craft after it left neighboring Myanmar , also known as Burma .
Members of Myanmar 's Rohingya minority have been fleeing the country for years , saying they are persecuted by its military government .
One refugee , who called himself Mohamed , told CNN that their boat had been at sea for a month , and that Myanmar 's military had detained and attacked them before setting their boat on fire .
The refugees are unwelcome in Thailand , where authorities say about 20,000 have settled illegally .
Other boatloads of Rohingya have allegedly been set adrift after being towed out to sea by Thai authorities .
A recent CNN investigation found evidence of such activity .
Photos obtained by CNN include one that shows the Thai army towing a boatload of some 190 refugees .
Watch Dan Rivers ' BackStory on the investigation »
CNN also interviewed a refugee who said he was one of the few who had survived after a group of six rickety boats was towed back to sea and abandoned by Thai authorities earlier this month .
The Thai government has launched an inquiry .
The Thai army has denied the allegations .
But after extensive questioning by CNN , one source in the Thai military confirmed that the Thai army was operating a dump - at - sea policy .
The source defended it , saying that each boatload of refugees is given sufficient supplies of food and water .
That source said Thai villagers had become afraid of the hundreds of Rohingya arriving each month , and they had accused the refugees of stealing their property and threatening them .
The Thai government has said that " there is no reasonable ground to believe " that the Rohingya are fleeing Myanmar because of persecution .
" Their profile and their seasonal travel further support the picture that they are illegal migrants , and not those requiring international protection , " the Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued Tuesday .
One of the refugees who came ashore Tuesday said they will be killed if returned to Myanmar because of their minority status .
He said the Rohingya are stateless because they lack bribe money to obtain identification cards in Myanmar .
In Tuesday 's statement , the Thai government said it deals with all illegal migrants in accordance with its laws and international guidelines .
It said " basic humanitarian needs " such as food and water are met among the migrants before they are returned home .
Their boats also are fixed , officials said .
The Thai government said that " accepting those arriving in an irregular manner would simply encourage new arrivals . "
The government denied media reports alleging that Thai authorities mistreat the illegal migrants and intentionally damage their boats .
CNN 's Dan Rivers and Kocha Olarn contributed to this report .

Gunman Mohammed Ajmal Amir Qasab was remanded in custody on Tuesday Pakistan has said the only surviving gunman from November 's attacks in Mumbai ( Bombay ) is a Pakistani citizen .
After weeks of refusing to confirm the allegations , the foreign ministry said : " We have just been informed ... that Ajmal Qasab is a Pakistani national . "
Mohammed Ajmal Amir Qasab was detained on the first night of the attacks .
India says all 10 gunmen were from the Pakistan - based militant group Lashkar - e - Taiba .
Relations with Pakistan , which denies any role , are under strain .
More than 170 people died when 10 gunmen attacked Mumbai on 26 November .
Meanwhile , Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani has dismissed his national security adviser , Mehmood Ali Durrani , amid the tensions with India .
It is not entirely clear why Mr Durrani lost his job .
One report suggested it was because he had made unauthorised comments to the media that the surviving gunman was Pakistani .
A prime ministerial statement said Mr Durrani had been sacked " for his irresponsible behaviour for not taking the prime minister and other stakeholders into confidence , and a lack of co-ordination on matters of national security " .
' Investigations '
It is the first time Pakistan has acknowledged any links to the gunmen after weeks of refusing to confirm Indian claims .
" We are confirming that Qasab is Pakistani but investigations are still ongoing , " Information Minister Sherry Rehman told the BBC on Wednesday .
Pakistan had previously said Mohammed Ajmal Amir Qasab 's name was not listed in the national database of citizens .
The BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad says that it is not clear why the Pakistani authorities have taken so long to admit publicly what many officials long ago conceded in private .
But our correspondent says the Pakistani security establishment in particular has a reputation for dragging its feet when it comes to making any sort of military or political concessions to India .
Confirmation of the suspect 's nationality comes after India provided Pakistan with a dossier of evidence which it said linked the Mumbai attackers and elements in Pakistan .
On Tuesday , Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that because of the " sophistication and military precision of the attack it must have had the support of some official agencies in Pakistan " .
Pakistan rejected Mr Singh 's allegations and accused India of raising regional tension .
Mohammed Ajmal Amir Qasab faces a number of charges including murder , attempted murder , waging war against a country and criminal conspiracy .

Now Gordon Brown 's own MPs brand him a ' headless chicken ' over recession
Headless chicken ?
Gordon Brown was attacked by David Cameron at Prime Minister 's Questions
Labour ministers and MPs have echoed David Cameron 's jibe that Gordon Brown is behaving ' like a headless chicken ' over the recession , it emerged today .
Downing Street has been told that the blizzard of initiatives to boost the economy have failed to have their expected impact on voters .
The criticism came as the Labour - dominated Treasury Select Committee warned that the Government 's ' piecemeal measures ' to restore bank lending may be inadequate given the scale of the crisis .
Lord Mandelson 's help for the car industry was also under fire as unions and the Tories claimed the move was ' small beer ' and could take months to be implemented .
Mr Cameron used his ' headless chicken ' barb last week as he clashed with Mr Brown at Prime Minister 's Questions .
But it turned out today that both Labour backbenchers and ministers have warned No 10 that the public is becoming confused and have lost track of how much the measures cost and whether they are working .
One backbencher , Greg Pope , today said that there had been too much ' frenetic activity ' from the Government in recent weeks .
Labour complaints about No 10 and the Treasury 's stream of initiatives increased after last week 's announcement of a fresh bank rescue was immediately overshadowed by a collapse in banking shares .
MPs are increasingly anxious that Mr Brown 's autumn ' bounce ' has ended and that voters have started to turn against the Government .
A Guardian / ICM poll yesterday gave the Conservatives a 12 - point lead over Labour , with the Tories on 44 points , up six , and Labour on 32 .
Mr Brown 's supporters say his initiatives - allow him to claim he is working flat - out and to portray the Tories as the ' do nothing ' party .
But Labour MPs at a parliamentary meeting on Monday were ' anxious ' with one backbencher saying that a ' blizzard ' of measures was doing nothing to settle the mood .
Cameron on the attack at last week 's PMQs : Brown 's own MPs have now stolen the Tory leader 's ' headless chicken ' jibe
Mr Pope said : ' The Government needs to slow down and take stock rather than having to react every time to the latest crisis . '
Ministers also expressed alarm at the Government 's communication strategy at a secret meeting in Downing Street last Thursday .
Some believe health secretary Alan Johnson should have a higher profile .
The British Social Attitudes Survey today showed the public 's appetite for spending is at its lowest for years .
For the first time since 1984 there is no majority support for more tax and spending on health , education and other public services .

In honor of Inauguration Day , Krispy Kreme is giving away a free doughnut on Tuesday .
Here ’s what they say in their press release :
Krispy Kreme Doughnuts , Inc… is honoring American ’s sense of pride and freedom of choice on Inauguration Day , by offering a free doughnut of choice to every customer on this historic day , Jan. 20 .
By doing so , participating Krispy Kreme stores nationwide are making an oath to tasty goodies — just another reminder of how oh - so - sweet “ free ” can be .
Cutesy , opportunistic , whatever .
If there ’s a Krispy Kreme nearby , you know you ’ll want to take them up on the offer .
A Catholic pro-life group sees things differently .
They think Krispy Kreme is telling you to abort babies .
No , really .
The headline of the American Life League ’s press release is “ KRISPY KREME CELEBRATES OBAMA WITH PRO - ABORTION DOUGHNUTS . ”
It seems they do n’t like the use of the word “ choice ” … :
Just an unfortunate choice of words ?
For the sake of our Wednesday morning doughnut runs , we hope so .
The unfortunate reality of a post Roe v. Wade America is that “ choice ” is synonymous with abortion access and celebration of ‘ freedom of choice ’ is a tacit endorsement of abortion rights on demand .
President - elect Barack Obama promises to be the most virulently pro-abortion president in history .
Millions more children will be endangered by his radical abortion agenda .
Celebrating his inauguration with “ Freedom of Choice ” doughnuts — only two days before the anniversary of the Supreme Court decision to decriminalize abortion — is not only extremely tacky , it ’s disrespectful and insensitive and makes a mockery of a national tragedy .
Yes .
Krispy Kreme was just trying to be subtle about their baby - killing agenda .
At least we now know why their doughnuts taste so delicious …
Maybe I should be worried .
I gave my students a multiple - choice exam last week .
Clearly , I was telling them to go have several abortions …
Now , I ’ll have to respond to angry parent phone calls …

WARSAW ( AP )  Construction workers in northern Poland have unearthed a World War II - era mass grave containing what are believed to be the bodies of 1,800 German men , women and children who disappeared during the Soviet Army 's march to Berlin .
Poles digging at the site of a planned luxury hotel in Malbork — which was called Marienburg and was part of Germany during the war — excavated a bomb crater at the foot of the city 's famous 13th century Teutonic Knights fortress , authorities said Monday .
The workers found a small group of bodies in late October and halted digging to allow prosecutors to investigate .
After resuming work weeks later , the workers turned up dozens , and then hundreds , more corpses .
They believe more may be found .
It was not immediately clear how the bodies ended up in the crater but initial examinations by Polish and German experts have concluded that they are likely the remains of German citizens still classified as " missing " more than 60 years after the end of the war , town official Piotr Szwedowski told The Associated Press .
Millions of civilians were killed or declared missing during World War II .
Many of those who disappeared in the chaos of wartime Europe are still unaccounted for .
" Examination of the remains and the circumstances confirm that these are the missing German inhabitants of Malbork , " Szwedowski said .
" I have no doubt it is them . "
As the Red Army was advancing in early 1945 , the inhabitants of Malbork were ordered to evacuate .
Some refused , while others were prevented from doing so by the general chaos of the nearing front .
The Soviets bombarded the city with heavy artillery in their assault .
After the defeated German military retreated , the remaining civilians found themselves at the mercy of Red Army troops .
There are no known living witnesses of what happened , Szwedowski said .
The bodies were buried naked without any possessions , he said .
" We found no trace of any clothes , shoes , belts , glasses — not even dentures or false teeth , " he said .
Some 100 skulls — primarily of adults — have bullet holes in them , suggesting these people could have been executed , but it is still unclear how the others were killed , Szwedowski said .
" We do n't know if these ( civilians ) are direct or indirect victims of the artillery barrage but the bullet holes suggest executions in some cases , " he said .
More forensic tests will be carried out before the remains are laid to rest either in Malbork or a German military cemetery in Stary Czarnow , near the northwestern city of Szczecin .
" These people died in such an inhuman way , were dumped so inhumanely , that we need to bury them in dignity and respect , " Szwedowski said .

Does God tell us when He made Tyrannosaurus rex ?
Many would say no .
But the Bible states that God made all things in six normal days .
He made the land animals , including dinosaurs , on Day 6 , so they date from around 6,000 years ago — the approximate date of creation obtained by adding up the years in the Bible .
So , since T. rex was a land animal and God made all the land animals on Day 6 , then God made T. rex on Day 6 .
Furthermore , from the Bible we see that there was no death , bloodshed , disease , or suffering before sin .
If one approaches Genesis to Revelation consistently , interpreting Scripture with Scripture , then death and bloodshed of man and animals came into the world only after Adam sinned .
The first death of an animal occurred when God shed an animal ’s blood in the Garden of Eden and clothed Adam and Eve .
This was also a picture of the Atonement — foreshadowing Christ ’s blood that was to be shed for us .
Thus , there could not have been bones of dead animals before sin — this would undermine the gospel .
This means that the dinosaurs must have died after sin entered the world , not before .
Dinosaur bones could not be millions of years old because Adam lived only thousands of years ago .

Calling Noel Coward
Blithe Spirit by Noël Coward is a comedic play about a man who goes to a seance and is visited by his dead wife ... who then refuses to leave .
She causes trouble and tries to get him to leave his second wife .
In the real world , the only people that refuse to leave are the so - called psychics themselves , who continue to bilk the public and mislead the curious .
There is a new production of Blithe Spirit , one with a bit of a twist : they 're holding auditions for actual psychic to join the cast .
According to the Entertainment Weekly article :
Open auditions will take place on Jan. 22 at the famous theater district restaurant Sardi's in New York City .
All hopefuls will have -- get this -- just two minutes to either " conjure the spirit of Noel Coward or to display any psychic abilities . "
Talk about pressure !
I just hope Coward 's spirit has left the premises on Jan. 22 so patrons can enjoy their steak tartare in peace .
Hey , we 've been holding auditions for nearly 40 years , and we pay more !
And despite our efforts , we 've found no one who 's been able to meet the above qualifications .
Somehow , I think this Broadway production may succeed in actually finding someone they think fits the bill , but on behalf of the JREF , I 'd like to invite them to have us test the winning candidate .
After all , $ 1,000,000 could fund much of the production .
It should be noted , however , that the JREF will take no responsibility if Noël Coward should decide to follow suit and not return to the netherworld .
Blithe or not , he who calls up spirits is ultimately responsible for them .
And given Coward 's atheism , he might stick around just to annoy those who proffer an afterlife that he probably did n't believe in .

Hollywood now classifies iTunes as a competitor to television networks .
That ’s the seeming reason behind Apple yanking a number of movies from its online video rental and sales , according to a recent report .
When Hollywood licenses movies for TV network airing , they provide a “ release window ” during which the broadcast is exclusive .
In other words , if CBS buys rights to a movie , it can be sure NBC wo n’t air the same show during that timeframe .
But since first - release DVDs are also a lucrative revenue stream for Hollywood , that “ release window ” restriction has never been applied to brick - and - mortar retailers , such as Blockbuster or BestBuy .
CNET now reports Hollywood enforced its “ release window ” against iTunes and Netflix , an action that had some iTunes users scratching their heads as “ Michael Clayton ” , “ Atonement ” , “ Charlie Wilson ’s War ” and other flicks mysteriously vanished from shopping carts .
“ If they say they do n’t want Apple , Netflix or any other Internet retailer selling or renting films inside their window then that ’s the way it is , ” the report quotes two unnamed studio executives .
Online movie distribution is just the latest venue to be added to the “ distribution window ” rule , according to Mike McGuire , media analyst at Gartner .
“ It has to do with the advertising model that is the bedrock of TV business models , ” McGuire told Cult of Mac .
When it comes to your life , what do you want ?
How does your money fit into that ?
If you can't answer these two questions , you wo n't ever know when you 've been successful
In fact , it might be worse than that : you might achieve what you thought you wanted , or what all of your friends want , and suddenly realize that it does n't satisfy you .
In order to make sure you 're going the right direction for you , it 's important to figure out what you want from your life ( to find your definition of " success " ) .
Why It Works
We 're all going after something .
That 's part of being alive .
As long as we 're living and acting , we are headed towards something .
Even if we do n't want to live , we 're going towards our goal ( yes , death is a goal ! ) .
Our lives are going somewhere .
We 're caught up in the stream of living and we 'll end up somewhere .
Luckily for us , we have some say about where we can end up .
Sure , we all die in the end , but we have the abilitiy to decide what is important and make choices towards that end .
If you 're saying , " Sure , Sarah , we all know that .
Make this entry worth reading , already ! " then tell me what you 're living for .
Go ahead , tell me what your life 's goal is .
Tell me why you 're on this earth and how all the different parts of your life fit into that .
If you can do that , you 're ahead of most of us .
Deciding what we want , what we 're about , takes a lifetime of deliberate , focused introspection .
But we can figure out different parts of this whole at different times in our lives , and we can live deliberately towards them .
How it Works
If you 're not sure how to get started in this process , here is a process that helps .
1 . Take out a blank sheet of paper .
In 10 minutes , list as many things as possible that you have not done , that you would regret not doing if you died tonight .
To the best of your ability , do n't stop writing and do n't censor or even think too hard about anything .
Just write .
You might find some crazy things coming out the end of your pen , and that 's OK .
Let them be .
2. Read your list .
Notice any internal reactions you have to different items on the list .
Note these in the margins next to your list so you can remember them later .
3 . Step away from the project for 3 - 7 days , except to read your list once a day .
This lets the list percolate in your mind .
Often , writing down our desires brings to the forefront things that we have n't thought about in a while , or voices things we avoid voicing any other time .
It can take us a few days to become accustomed to these thngs being a reality in our lives .
We learn to accept , " Yes , I am the person whose life wo n't feel complete if I never help the refugees in Darfur , " or , " Yup , I 'm the busy entrepreneur who really wants a desk job so I can spend more time with my kids before they leave home . "
4 . Come back to the project and read the list again .
Note any internal reactions that have changed as you let the ideas percolate .
5 . Start pulling the different items on your list together and write a statement that encompasses what you 're about .
In the beginning , this can be a list of more general cateogories that cover all of the items on your list .
For instance , my list would containg such items as " helping people grow " and " working with groups to help them better understand and support each other . "
My larger category might be , " working with people , as individuals and in groups , to help them better understand and support the growing process in themselves and others .
Eventually , this statement will be less like a list and more like a sentence or two , but the list is fine to start .
6 . Write down and commit to one step you can take this week !
today !
right now ! to help move your life more in line with your statement .
Make sure that this is small enough to be achievable and is something you can maintain .
7. Repeat stps 3 - 6 until you have a statement that feels right .
Most people know when they 've hit on the one that 's right for them .
It moves many to tears , but some also feel joy or peace when they find it .
Continue with the small goals until your life looks like what you want it to be .
8 . Live the life you 've designed .
Achieve your definition of success .

When emotions get heated among those who disagree on abortion rights , it can be easy to settle the conversation by calling on adoption as a " compromise . "
Is treating adoption as a solution to abortion the best way to craft sensible adoption policy ?
When emotions get heated among those who disagree on abortion rights , it can be easy to settle the conversation by calling on adoption as a " compromise . "
According to the " adoption consensus , " whatever one thinks about the justness of abortion or the reasonability of expecting a person to raise a child she ’s not prepared for , we can at least agree to support policy that will better facilitate adoption .
This is utterly uncontroversial .
Right ?
There are plenty of inconsistencies in adoption law from state to state , and plenty of ways policymakers could streamline adoption for women who wish to relinquish and parents who wish to adopt .
But is any of the legislation that purports to facilitate adoption really going to do that ?
And even if it did , would it have any affect at all on the abortion rate ?
One of the most heated debates in adoption policy is over original birth certificates , says Adam Pertman , executive director of the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute and author of Adoption Nation .
Adults who have been adopted often cannot obtain their original birth certificates because most states keep them sealed .
" This is a policy issue that treats adopted people differently from their non-adopted counterparts , " Pertman says .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .
The latest news , delivered straight to your inbox .
SUBSCRIBE
In some cases , this policy has been reversed .
Since 1996 , Alabama , Delaware , Maine , New Hampshire , Oregon and Tennessee changed their policies so that adults who were adopted can have access to their birth certificates .
Those records in Alaska and Kansas have always been open for adults .
Unsealing records is crucial for adopted adults and , more generally ,
for a compassionate and sensible adoption system .
It does n’t , however ,
appear to have any particular affect on whether a woman chooses to place her
child for adoption , according to Pertman .
" These are wildly different
states , geographically and politically , " Pertman says .
" And their
adoption rate is similar to any other state , which indicates that sealing
or not sealing records does n’t really influence a mother ( who is
considering relinquishing her child ) . "
According to Pertman , the principal argument for keeping birth certificates inaccessible to adopted people is that unsealing records will violate anonymity promised to the birthmother .
But , Pertman says , the historical record reveals that ’s not the reason records were sealed in the first place ; rather , they were sealed to protect the adoptive family from the birthmother , who feared she would show up at their doorstep .
A report issued last year by the Donaldson Institute found that states that opened records to adopted persons saw no evidence of negative consequences predicted by opponents of the change , such as stalking by adopted persons or damage to birthmothers .
Abortion is implicated in this policy issue by those who fear that
unsealing birth records will cause more women to choose an abortion
who ’d otherwise only place their child for adoption if they were
promised
total anonymity .
Pertman says this argument ’s popularity is
" diminishing greatly "
because it has " no basis in reality . "
" From a statistical and
evidence - based point - of - view , it simply is not true , " he says .
" But
viscerally , it has influence . "
That influence begs conflict among those who agree to better facilitate
adoption when some are primarily motivated by a desire to reduce
abortions ; improved adoption policy that does n’t seem to lead to
reduced abortions may not be championed by them .
However , that does n’t
mean that improved adoption policy is n’t essential for its own sake .
" It is important to improve the adoption systems and policies because there are problems with them and they ’re not serving any of the parties involved with it as well as they should be , " says Jessica Arons , director of the Women ’s Health and Rights program at the Center for American Progress .
But Arons questions the usefulness of focusing on adoption policy as a " compromise " on disagreements about abortion rights , because improving adoption will have little to no impact on the U.S. abortion rate .
" There are very few women who would ’ve given up a child for adoption , but then say to themselves that , ‘oh , well , the system ’s messed up , so I ’ll go ahead and have an abortion , ’ " Arons says .
" That ’s just not the conversation going on in people ’s heads . "
Democrats for Life say they have a bill that would reduce the
abortion rate by 95 % in 10 years ( reproductive health advocates
strongly dispute that characterization of the bill ) .
Part of the way
they plan to do that is by increasing the adoption tax credit , and
making it permanent .
But would making adoption more affordable for families – undoubtedly a social good in its own right – really affect the decision - making of
American women facing unintended pregnancy ?
Regardless of what effect it might have on the abortion rate , much of the work of making adoptions affordable currently falls to charities .
Becky Fawcett , a New York City mother who adopted her son , Jake , co-founded Helpusadopt.org , which offers grants of up to $ 15,000 to people interested in adopting , with her husband .
" Adoption is not for the faint - hearted , and when you put a $ 40,000 price tag on it , that ’s frightening for people , " Fawcett says .
" It ’s not that people who ca n’t afford adoption were irresponsible with their money .
But who has $ 40,000 - $ 50,000 in their savings to just write out for an adoption ? "
In its first year , Fawcett reports that Helpusadopt.org has met with an extraordinary response .
" This need is n’t going away – adoptions can be expensive and difficult and emotionally hard for everyone involved .
If we can make it a little easier or people , then I ’m proud of that , " Fawcett said .
On Rewire ,
Cory Richards of the Guttmacher Institute lauds strategies that , like
Helpusadopt.org , make adoption a real and viable option for people .
But
he calls out adoption advocacy that ’s born of the desire to see the
abortion rate drop .
" Politicians
from both parties frequently promote tax credits and other incentives
to ease the way for adoptive parents to demonstrate that they want to
‘ do something ’ about abortion , " Richards writes .
" Facilitating
adoptions , especially of hard - to - place children , deserves our strong
support .
But it does nothing to affect the abortion rate .
… we know
that very few women actually place their infants for adoption . "
Richards
noted that in the US , fewer than 14,000 infants were given up for
adoption in 2003 –a less - than - 1 % rate that ’s been consistent for almost
two decades , halting there after a decline that the US Department of
Health and Human Services attributes to the rising social acceptance of
single parenthood .
For those in the 1 % who want to place their
child for adoption , for the thousands of children in foster care who
need permanent homes , and for potential parents who want to adopt a
child , we might hope for common sense public policies on adoption .
Yes ,
let ’s increase the adoption tax credit , and make it permanent .
Let’s
ensure birth certificates are accessible for adopted persons , as they
are for any other adult .
Let ’s ensure that minors who want to give
their child for adoption can do so safely and compassionately , without
undue legal interference .
But we should n’t pretend it ’ll have an effect
on the abortion rate .
Policy that ’s designed to make adoption a " compromise , " implying that adoption will replace abortion or parenting for those with unintended pregnancies , is more than unhelpful : it ’s dangerously simplistic .
Is your firewall IP v6 aware ?
Posted by Steve on Thu 8 Jan 2009 at 23:14
If , like many people , you 've started to experiment with enabling , configuring , and using , IPv6 it might not have crossed your mind to update your firewall .
This could lead to surprises if you 're unlucky .
Read on for a simple overview .
The standard userspace firewall tool upon Debian GNU / Linux is iptables .
This tool lets you add , list , and update your firewall rules and is documented both upon this site and in many online guides .
If you were to execute the following rules you 'd disallow incoming connections to your server on port 22 except from a single trusted IP ( 1.2.3.4 ) :
# allow me to connect from my static IP iptables -A INPUT - p tcp -- dport 22 --src 1.2.3.4 -j ACCEPT
# drop the rest of the world iptables -A INPUT - p tcp -- dport 22 -j DROP
You might think that this is sufficient to stop connections hitting your machine , but if it is accessible over IP v6 you 'll soon discover this is n't the case :
telnet -6 www.example.org 22 Trying 2002:5f10 : fff::1... Connected to www.example.org
Escape character is ' ^ ] ' .
SSH -2.0- OpenSSH_4.3p2 Debian - 9etch3
Here we see that we 've been allowed access to port 22 , even though we should n't have been .
Why ?
Because iptables only cares about IPv4 .
To configure rules for IP v6 you need to use the ip6tables tool as well :
ip6tables -A INPUT -p tcp -- dport 22 -j DROP
Now you 'll be safe , and incoming IP v6 connections to port 22 will be rejected .
ip6tables works in exactly the same way as iptables does , so you do n't need to learn anything new .
If you 've already got a simple firewall script that you 've put together yourself it might not be too much work to update it - if you 're using an existing firewall package such as shorewall then you might not even need to do that , but you should certainly test it and find out !

Who has n't put a perfectly good fax machine on the curb ?
In those hasty moments of purging , you think , " I do n't need this dinosaur .
Who faxes anymore ? "
Hope it was n't a really nice one you junked , because someday you 'll wish you had it back .
The facsimile is n't going anywhere .
Patented in 1843 and mainstreamed sometime between the 8 - track and the CD , the technology is like a B - movie zombie that keeps lurching forward — clumsily , relentlessly — long after it should be in the ground .
Fax machines are everywhere : doctors ' offices , delicatessens , brokerage firms , even souvenir shops in the developing world ( for verifying tourists ' credit cards ) .
The device 's particular skill is well known :
It makes a replica of a document appear in another location in seconds .
When machines dropped in price in the late ' 80s , their closest competitor was hand delivery — not a tenable solution for people trading paper over long distances .
Soon , courts gave the tech a crucial blessing by certifying that a facsimile of a signature was legally valid .
By 1990 , faxes were the way to take care of everything , from securing a mortgage to ordering a ham on rye .
The fax 's real rival today is the PDF — essentially the same idea , but with far more complex hardware .
But even with the prevalence of email , the number of people who can send and receive faxes is still increasing .
According to market research firm Gartner , sales of stand - alone fax machines may have plummeted , but sales of multifunction printers — which also copy , scan , and , yes , fax — increased 340 percent from 2001 to 2007 .
Although the fax function of millions of those machines is all but ignored , it can be a lifesaver in an emergency .
Say you break down on some lonesome road in Pennsyltucky and call your insurance company for roadside assistance .
Progressive will probably fax an authorization to the tow company — not drop Joe the Wrecker an IM .
Why not just email him ?
They might not have his address , and he might not be able — or inclined — to open a PDF .
But he almost certainly has a fax number , it 's probably listed , and his machine can receive a transmission from any source — a brand - new multitasking office bot or a 25 - year - old thermal - paper fountain .
This universal utility is the technology 's competitive edge .
Faxing is easy .
" It 's a self - contained appliance , and that 's a lesson to us as information technologists , " says Ken Anderson of market research firm Burton Group .
In other words , it 's still the most elegant solution .

Owning a business challenges you to give the best space to your employees with the best amenities .
This includes having the right resources , working environment and WiFi .
You read that right .
Having the perfect WiFi varies over the company and the space the company has .
Bad WiFi can mean trouble to your sales , customer relations or your employees ’ workability efforts .
Here are effective ways to boost the performance of your business WiFi network and assure the best for your company .
Find The Best Spot
Depending on the size and shape of your office , finding the best spot to set up your WiFi router can be tricky .
For this , you will have to determine the range and the interference you might run into .
Always aim to place your router in a central spot of your office , and if you have more than one floor — plan for the middle floor .
Having more than one floor could be the main cause of interference .
Multiple floors include thick walls , fans , large electronic objects , and all of these could be blocking or eating your connection .
Try avoiding placing your router close to any of these things to secure the best location .
Boost The Range
Having multiple floors or a large space wo n’t be covered by a single router .
While placing it in the center of your space will help , considering repeaters or range extenders will be key .
Wireless repeaters re-broadcast your WiFi signal received to a limited localized area .
On the other hand , range extenders ensure coverage in the area between your router and the extender , allowing all of your employees to connect and work with the best internet speed possible .
Secure your signal
Making your connection and your signal private is one of the best steps to follow after setting it up .
Not only will the connection will faster if only your employees are connected , but your files and document will maintain save and guarded .
Public , or free , signals will only cause you pain and drain your bandwidth .
To ensure and improve the performance of your business WiFi , consider privatizing your signal with a strong password .
Save your bandwidth
To protect your business ’ bandwidth — or information per unit of time a WiFi is capable of processing — pinpoint the possibilities that might hog at your network .
Think about users , apps , and programs .
It ’s best if your employees work connected with ethernet cables , or limit the number of devices they connect to the server .
If you plan on having customers or invited people over , consider setting up a guest network .
This way your employees wo n’t be affected , your bandwidth wo n’t diminish and your files will stay protected .
In terms of apps and , have your employees identify all the programs they will use and identify the ones that might pull or require more demand .
After identifying these , have those specific employees use those high - demanding apps or programs on certain hours .
This will allow other employees to work around those hours and get their jobs done effectively .
WiFi Analyzer
If you have done everything above and you have yet to see improvement in your WiFi ’s performance , consider having WiFi analytics .
A system doing WiFi analytics automatically pinpoints the issues and contacts the designed personnel within your company to change , fix or modify between it gets worse .
This is a great service to outsource , which will boost your business ’s wifi .
Importance of Your Business WiFi
At the end of the day , having a functional and fast network is an investment .
Your employees will have no problem working and your customers will receive communications and files with no problems .
If you have guests , they will benefit from a fast , reliable network as well .
These five ways to boost your business wifi can be executed within minutes , and are important to execute on a monthly basis .
Now that you know how to improve your WiFi , give it a try !
Only about 2 percent of all child deaths are from war injuries , the report said .
In wealthy countries , indigenous peoples like American Indians , Australian aborigines and New Zealand Maoris have injury rates more than double the country ’s average .
In the United States , accidents kill 12,175 children a year  more than all diseases combined , according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control based on hospital records , which was released in conjunction with the W.H.O. and Unicef report .
Car crashes were the leading cause , except for infants under 1 year of age , who more often died of suffocation , and those age 1 to 4 , who more often drowned .
The three changes that would save the most lives of American children , said Ileana Arias , the Centers for Disease Control ’s chief of injury prevention , would be for more states to pass “ graduated driver ’s license ” laws , which forbid teenagers to drive at night or with teenage passengers , to enforce seat - belt laws on teenagers and to make all children younger than 8 ride in booster seats .
Domestic fatal injury rates were highest for American Indians , lowest for Asians and about equal for blacks and whites in the United States .
Twice as many boys as girls died accidentally .
When the global data are divided by sex , boys die more often than girls in all accidents , except burns .
That anomaly occurs , Dr. Krug said , because most burns happen in the kitchen and because girls in Asia are more likely to wear long garments of flammable material .
Also , he said , it is impossible to be sure , but some of the burn deaths reported may not have been accidental , but attacks by suitors or families settling scores .
The report emphasizes the growing death toll from road accidents as globalization enriches poorer nations .
In many poor countries , the streets are choked with a mix of large trucks , small motorcycles and bicycles and sometimes animal carts , often barely visible to truck drivers because of dust and a lack of daytime running lights .
Helmets are not universally used , and it is common to see only a male driver on a moped wearing one while a wife and child sit sidesaddle on the back , bareheaded .
Accidents involving overloaded buses , minivans and even dump trucks used to transport people often lead to multiple deaths in a single collision .
The new Yankee Stadium is currently being finished up in time for Opening Day , which is scheduled for an April 16th game pitting the Yankees against the Cleveland Indians .
Built at an astounding cost of $ 1.3 billion , it ’s going to be a state - of - the - art facility -- and you probably wo n’t be able to walk two feet inside it without seeing something advertising Sony .
This afternoon , the team announced a deal with Sony to bring “ a corporate marketing and high - definition technology relationship ” to the House that Ruth Steinbrenner Built .
What does that entail ?
Well , there are plans to install over 550 BRAVIA LCD HDTVs around the building -- in luxury boxes , administrative offices , suites , lounges , restaurants , and along the concourses -- as well as “ Sony HD branding elements ” everywhere .
In addition , fans will have access to PlayStation 3 units and VAIO laptops around the stadium .
Presumably , Sony ’s equipment will be an addition to Cisco Systems ’ extensive high - tech systems , which were unveiled in November .
The agreement does n’t just apply to the building ; the right - field wall will feature a Sony ad , and Sony has now been named the official LCD , HDTV , and consumer electronics manufacturer of the team .
Such endorsements are common for entire sports -- Samsung is the official HDTV of the NFL , and Sharp is the MLB ’s official HDTV -- but I ca n’t recall an individual team having a deal like this .
Still , I would n’t be surprised if this was n’t the first time .
While I personally would n’t go to a baseball game to play a baseball videogame , I ’m sure it ca n’t hurt to have Sony ’s MLB 09 The Show playable for fans -- fans who might end up liking the experience enough to pick up a PS3 ( and maybe even a BRAVIA HDTV while they ’re at it ) .
[ Thanks , power - glove ! ]

DRIVING through the countryside south of Hanover , it would be easy to miss the GEO600 experiment .
From the outside , it does n’t look much : in the corner of a field stands an assortment of boxy temporary buildings , from which two long trenches emerge , at a right angle to each other , covered with corrugated iron .
Underneath the metal sheets , however , lies a detector that stretches for 600 metres .
For the past seven years , this German set - up has been looking for gravitational waves – ripples in space - time thrown off by super - dense astronomical objects such as neutron stars and black holes .
GEO600 has not detected any gravitational waves so far , but it might inadvertently have made the most important discovery in physics for half a century .
For many months , the GEO600 team - members had been scratching their heads over inexplicable noise that is plaguing their giant detector .
Then , out of the blue , a researcher approached them with an explanation .
In fact , he had even predicted the noise before he knew they were detecting it .
According to Craig Hogan , a physicist at the Fermilab particle physics lab in Batavia , Illinois , GEO600 has stumbled upon the fundamental limit of space - time – the point where space - time stops behaving like the smooth continuum Einstein described and instead dissolves into “ grains ” , just as a newspaper photograph dissolves into dots as you zoom in .
“ It looks like GEO600 is being buffeted by the microscopic quantum convulsions of space - time , ” says Hogan .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Health care workers in emergency departments are often carriers of the methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , or ( MRSA ) , potentially putting patients at risk , according to two reports in the Annals of Emergency Medicine .
Testing positive for MRSA is sometimes transient among health care workers , but unfortunately the results of this study , along with the findings of the second report , reinforce concerns that MRSA carriers are an important part of the transmission of MRSA among patients , Dr. Elise O. Lovell from Advocate Christ Medical Center , Oak Lawn , Illinois , told Reuters Health .
Lovell and colleagues collected nasal swabs from a sample of 105 emergency department staff at their institution .
Sixteen subjects ( 15 percent ) tested positive for MRSA , including 12 nurses , 2 physicians , and 2 technicians .
The MRSA positivity rates in our emergency department health care workers is “ much higher than that found in the general US population , but is similar to rates seen in other studies of non-ED medical personnel , ” Dr. Lovell said .
In the second report , Dr. Brian P. Suffoletto and colleagues from the University of Pittsburgh Department of Emergency Medicine measured the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA in 255 emergency department health care workers .
Just under one third of nasal cultures ( 31.8 percent ) were positive for S. aureus , the researchers report , and the overall prevalence of MRSA 0was 4.3 percent .
None of the demographic and exposure characteristics examined were significantly associated with MRSA colonization , the investigators say , but MRSA colonization was restricted to nurses , nursing assistants , and radiology and respiratory technicians .
“ The varying prevalence among the different health care workers was unexpected , ” Suffoletto told Reuters Health .
The relationship between MRSA - positive ED personnel and patient transmission is “ still largely unexplored , ” Suffoletto continued .
First we will need to establish if MRSA in ED personnel is transient or persistent .
“ Then we wish to determine the rate of unprotected contacts between ED personnel and patients . ”
Both Lovell and Suffoletto stressed the importance of using universal infection control practices in the emergency department .
“ It ’s been demonstrated repeatedly that these hygiene techniques are poorly followed in the ED , yet they represent the best ( and simplest ) way to minimize the spread of MRSA between our patients and to keep our patients and ourselves safe , ” Lovell said .
“ The findings in these reports may have important implications for infection control practice , ” agrees Dr. John A. Jernigan from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Atlanta , writing in a related editorial .
“ Better implementation of current recommendations for preventing transmission of MRSA and other multidrug - resistant organisms will likely yield important benefits for both patients and health care personnel . ”

Fans of Top Gear might want to prepare themselves for another Stig death soon .
When " Black Stig " Perry McCarthy revealed himself , Clarkson , Hammond and May offed him .
Now , according to the UK's Telegraph , the " White Stig " has apparently ended the mystery , revealing himself as 33 year - old Ben Collins .
Collins has raced professionally in everything from NASCAR to LeMans , and most recently served as Agent 007's double for sequences of Quantum of Solace that required fancy wheel work .
It 's been such a secret for so long , how did the veil of silence come to be broken ?
Collins himself apparently revealed his day job to the owner of an art gallery in Bristol , England when asking for help producing a limited - edition print of The Stig plying his trade .
A builder had also come across the famed white suit and gloves on display in a cabinet while doing work at Collins ' home , and there has been conjecture in the past that Collins is The Stig .
Now that the cat is out of the bag , we wonder if there 's much wailing and gnashing of teeth in the halls of Top Gear 's offices .
Secret identity or no , Collins has proven himself as a fantastic driver as The Stig , and with this latest revelation , he potentially faces " The Sack " as they say in Merry Old .
No confirmation yet from Clarkson , Hammond or May on this revelation , and the only word out of Top Gear is that they " ... never comment on speculation as to who or what The Stig is . "
Hmm .
In any case , we are left to wonder ... what color will a new Stig be ?
Red ?
Gold ?
Blue ?

Change is the only thing that never changes .
In this fast moving world fashion keeps on changing .
This holds good for your tastes and preferences too .
With new cars flooding the consumer market , there is every chance that you feel like shedding your old car and get a new one .
But most times people end up selling their old car for a lower price .
This is because they do not know how to increase the resale value of their car .
There are several ways in which the resale value of your car can be increased .
Let us see about them in this article .
You should keep your car clean .
If your car is clean it will appeal more to the buyer and it may interest him to buy your car .
Keeping your car clean should not be only for the purpose of selling .
But it may help when you decide to sell .
You should vacuum clean your car regularly .
Cleaning the upholstery and shampooing the floor can help in maintaining your interiors .
Maintenance of your car as per the regulations and schedule of the manufacturer is vital .
Timely inspections and oil changes should be done .
Any repairs should be done for maintaining the efficiency of the car .
This way you can enjoy your rides and also get a good return when you sell your car .
Even if your car encounters a small repair , correct it as and when it happens .
This is because no car is immune to repairs .
But you should not postpone any repair thinking that it is a small one and something you can get way with .
But sometimes that small problem may lead to some thing big and it may prove expensive .
You should subject your vehicle to annual check ups or annual inspections .
This can help you to understand the performance of your car and its overall efficiency .
An annual inspection is a rule in most states and it is a rule you should abide with if you want a good value for your car .
You can try parking your car at less congested parking areas even if you end up making a long walk .
This is because by doing so you can save your car from damages , scratches etc. that happen due to various incidents in the populated parking areas .
You should maintain a separate file for all the paper works relating to your car .
Paper works such as warranties relating to car or car parts should be kept safely .
This can be of great use to the future buyers .
Also it may instill confidence in them .
Going this extra mile to offer paper works will make your car a healthy contender in the used car market .

Tragically , over the Thanksgiving holiday , the world was reminded how evil and cruel people can be .
According to emerging accounts of the events in India , about a dozen well - armed and devastatingly well - trained terrorists laid siege on the city of Mumbai , killing almost two hundred people , and terrorizing thousands .
Regardless of the reasons , the indiscriminate shooting on masses of unarmed and defenseless people is chilling and reprehensible .
How were these terrorists able to continue so long , relatively unchallenged , killing so many ?
India ’s gun laws are her business , of course .
However , once the shock of these events and the initial reaction of fear passes , Americans should take away a valuable lesson about real homeland security and gun control from this tragedy .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Gun control advocates tell us that removing guns from society makes us safer .
If that were the case why do the worst shootings happen in gun free zones , like schools ?
And while accidents do happen , aggressive , terroristic shootings like this are unheard of at gun and knife shows , or military bases .
It bears repeating that an armed society truly is a polite society .
The fact is that firearm technology exists .
It can not be uninvented .
As long as there is metalworking and welding capability , it matters not what gun laws are imposed upon law - abiding people .
Those that wish to have guns , and disregard the law , will have guns .
Gun control makes violence safer and more effective for the aggressive , whether the aggressor is a terrorist or a government .
History shows us that another tragedy of gun laws is genocide .
Hitler , for example , knew well that in order to enact his “ final solution , ” disarmament was a necessary precursor .
While it is not always the case that an unarmed populace WILL be killed by their government , if a government is going to kill its own people , it MUST disarm them first so they can not fight back .
Disarmament must happen at a time when overall trust in government is high , and under the guise of safety for the people , or perhaps the children .
Knowing that any government , no matter how idealistically started , can become despotic , the Founding Fathers enabled the future freedom of Americans by enacting the second amendment .
In our own country , we should be ever vigilant against any attempts to disarm the people , especially in this economic downturn .
I expect violent crime to rise sharply in the coming days , and as states and municipalities are even more financially strained , the police will be even less able or willing to respond to crime .
In many areas , local police could become more and more absorbed with revenue generating activities , like minor traffic violations and the asset forfeiture opportunities of non-violent drug offenses .
Your safety has always , ultimately been your own responsibility , but never more so than now .
People have a natural right to defend themselves .
Governments that take that away from their people should be highly suspect .

Op - Ed : No more mismanagement with bailout money - Obama By By Paul Wallis Jan 23 , 2009 in Business
In any other country on Earth , America ’s corporate cretins would be facing lengthy jail terms , bankruptcy , and be utterly discredited .
Now the problem is to get them to stop redecorating their offices with bailout money .
Fine , but there ’s another problem .
Nobody imagines that the last couple of years have been an example of America at its best .
But the meltdown has made a horribly difficult question unavoidable :
How did these clowns ever get jobs which did n’t involve selling hot dogs ?
Of all the many crimes perpetrated on the American public by its stunningly incompetent financial executive class , so many of them have their roots in this apparent obliviousness to reality .
On that basis , “ The business is going down the tube , so spend a few million building a commemorative urinal ” , actually makes sense .
At least it does insofar as it ’s consistent with the total lack of talent and awareness that created the mess in the first place .
How is it possible that people who are supposed to have been the absolute top in the professional investment sphere went so far off the beam ?
Why are they still walking around outside institutions , penal or mental ?
The response to the meltdown was another example of the sheer lack of transparency which corporate shills and spills used to cover the trail of destruction .
They could get away with total silence .
In most countries disclosure rules alone prevent that .
Huge firms fell over and the first the investors knew was a headline .
They had no access to even coherent rumors , let alone facts .
Lehmann Bros. was a shock to the financial system , not because of why it fell over , but because its condition was a shock to people who thought they knew what was going on .
Madoff , who ’s accused of operating a type of scheme which has never worked in recorded history , came as a shock because again , people thought they knew him , personally .
One of his friends said bitterly he ’d been friends for 20 years with “ a person who apparently did n’t exist ” .
It ’s starting to look very much like the whole corporate myth never really existed .
If credibility is the basis of business life , a lot of these guys are actually long dead , they just happen to be still running America ’s finances .
The President ’s words come after a long and bitter saga of complaints that the executive enemas are still living the high life as the country suffers .
Congress is also now demanding more oversight .
Fine , but there ’s another problem .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The second week of December was another brutal one for jobs , as Bank of America and at least 20 other companies announced more massive cuts .
" The recent news does not bode well , " said Rich Yamarone , director of economic research at Argus Research .
" This is the reason it 's going to be the longest recession we 've had in post World War II history . "
The week got off to a rough start on Monday when Dow Chemical ( DOW , Fortune 500 ) said it would eliminate 5,000 positions and close 20 plants .
In addition , Belgian - based brewer Anheuser - Busch InBev said it would reduce 1,400 positions ; 3M ( MMM , Fortune 500 ) also reported 1,800 cuts .
On Tuesday Sony ( SNE ) , Danaher Corp. ( DHR , Fortune 500 ) , Wyndham Worldwide ( WYN ) , the National Football League and Principal Financial Group ( PFG , Fortune 500 ) announced job cuts totaling another 14,400 positions .
Novellus Systems ( NVLS ) and electronics gaming company EA ( ERTS ) also announced staff reductions without specifying a number of employees .
On Wednesday , Office Depot ( ODP , Fortune 500 ) unveiled its plan to cut about 2,200 jobs ; British mining company Rio Tinto said it would cut 14,000 jobs worldwide ; and SKF , a Swedish manufacturer of bearings , revealed plans to lay off 2,500 workers globally .
Thursday was particularly bad , thanks to news that Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) plans to slash up to 35,000 jobs over the next three years as it absorbs Merrill Lynch and contends with the deepening recession .
On Friday came the announcement that specialty chemicals maker Chemtura ( CEM ) will cut about 500 people , or 20 % of its staff , because of declining sales .
Fairchild Semiconductor ( FCS ) said it plans to cut about 1,100 jobs worldwide , or about 12 % of its work force , to reduce payroll expenses .
All in all , 19 big - name companies announced 81,500 job cuts , according to company reports .
That figure is likely larger , however , because it does not reflect layoffs happening at small - and mid-sized businesses .
This follows a slew of bad news the previous week , when AT&T ( T , Fortune 500 ) , Credit Suisse Group ( CS ) , DuPont ( DD , Fortune 500 ) and Viacom Inc. ( VIA ) , among others , announced about 34,000 cuts .
Midway through the month , December 's job cut total stands at 115,416 .
In terms of job losses , December could be even worse than November , when 533,000 jobs were lost , according to the Labor Department .
That was the largest monthly loss since December 1974 .
" Generally companies like to make their cuts by the end of the year , " explained David Wyss , chief economist at Standard & Poor's .
As such , he expects there to be many more cuts announced over the rest of the month .
2009 and beyond
Going forward , " the job market will continue to deteriorate for the next couple of months , " said Bernard Baumohl , chief economist at the Economic Outlook Group .
Baumohl expects monthly job loses of 550,000 to 600,000 , but " it may very well exceed 600,000 too because of the severity and speed this economy is sinking into a recession , " he said .
In terms of job losses , 2008 is on pace to be the worst since 1982 , according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data .
But if Baumohl 's 600,000 + prediction is accurate , 2008 could show the greatest number of layoffs since 1945 , when the economy shed 2.75 million jobs .
" These job - loss announcements are going to impact the job reports in January , February , March and April , " said Lakshman Achuthan , managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute , because that 's when many of the announced layoffs will actually occur .
Economists say the unemployment rate , which stands at 6.7 % , will also rise over the course of next year and into 2010 .
Wyss predicts it will be 8.5 % by December of next year .
Baumohl said the jobless rate will peak close to 10 % by the end of next year or early 2010 .
" A lot depends on what happens with the auto bailout , " Baumohl added .
" If that does not come through , then obviously the situation becomes even more dire in terms of layoffs and claims for unemployment insurance . "
The Senate failed to pass a $ 14 billion bailout plan on Thursday , but the White House said it may tap the $ 700 billion bailout approved by Congress in October to help the auto industry .

Russia ’s biggest yes - men do their utmost to flatter Putin
Russia ’s Kommersant Vlast Journal made an unofficial list of Russia ’s biggest yes - people in 2008 .
The list includes most flattering remarks , which Russian politicians made about Prime Minister Putin and President Medvedev .
The journal already published such a list before , in 2007 – the chairman of the Russian Central electoral Committee , Vladimir Churov was named the biggest yes - man with his rhetoric question – “ Can Putin be ever not right ? ”
This year ’s list mostly includes flattering remarks about Vladimir Putin , but was slightly extended with appraisals of Dmitry Medvedev .
Politicians , human rights activists , culture activists and journalists – they all flatter Putin , the Prime Minister and Medvedev , the President .
Russia ’s biggest yes - men do their utmost to flatter Putin
Ten best yes - people in 2008
1 . “ Your democratism has no limits ! ” – St. Petersburg Governor Valentina Matviyenko said October 7 during the celebration of Putin ’s birthday .
2 . “ I thank God for Putin and I respect Yeltsin for two things which he did in his life .
The first one of them is the moment when he placed his Communist Party card on the table .
The second one is the fact that he brought Putin to power , ” Russian film director Nikita Mikhalkov said November 25 at his press conference in Kiev .
3. “ Vladimir Vladimirovich , it ’s very good that you were born ! ” writer Daniil Granin said October 7 at Putin ’s birthday .
4 . “ After the victory of the Russian national team at the World Hockey Championship , Russian officials have a right to ask their Western colleagues : “ Do n’t you understand that Putin was doing everything right ? ” State Duma deputy Sergei Markov said May 19 in an interview with Rosbalt news agency .
5 . “ If one asks our opposition what they do n’t like about Putin and Medvedev they will say something like this : “ They are both made of gold , it is true , but this gold is not enough , ” a senior official spokesman for United Russia party , Oleg Morozov said June 30 in an interview with Itogi magazine .
6 . “ We were listening to Vladimir Putin ’s suggestions with a lot of attention and respect , ” Ekaterinburg Mayor Arkady Chernetsky said February 3 at a local meeting to support Medvedev as a presidential candidate .

High - bandwidth Digital Content Protection ( HDCP ) — you can't live with it , but you practically can't buy an HD - capable device anymore without it .
While HDCP is typically used in devices like Blu-ray players , HDTVs , HDMI - enabled notebooks , and even the Apple TV in order to keep DRMed content encrypted between points A and B , it appears that Apple 's new aluminum MacBook ( and presumably the MacBook Pro ) are using it to protect iTunes Store media as well .
When my friend John , a high school teacher , attempted to play Hellboy 2 on his classroom 's projector with a new aluminum MacBook over lunch , he was denied by the error you see above .
John 's using a Mini Display Port - to - VGA adapter , plugged into a Sanyo projector that is part of his room 's Promethean system .
Strangely , only some iTunes Store movies appear to be HDCP - aware , as other purchased media like Stargate : Continuum and Heroes season 2 play through the projector just fine .
Attempts to play Hellboy 2 or other HDCPed films through the projector via QuickTime also get denied .
Other movies that do n't work include newer films like Iron Man , Star Wars : Clone Wars , and Love Guru , but older films like Shawshank Redemption are restricted as well .
The technology in Apple 's MacBooks that prevents a seemingly arbitrary collection of iTunes Store files from being played on HDCP non-compliant devices is perhaps more accurately called DPCP , or DisplayPort Content Protection .
As we 've covered in the past , DisplayPort was designed as an open , extensible standard for computers that offers lower power consumption over DVI ( especially in the Mini DisplayPort format that Apple uses on the new MacBooks ) .
But more importantly , DisplayPort also beats DVI in the studios ' books by offering the option of 128 - bit AES encrypted copy protection .
Overcome Fear in the Economic Crisis
Photo by Lucia Holm
It seems that you ca n’t go even one day without hearing a comment , a remark , a report , or an article highlighting the current economic downturn .
How can we keep a positive attitude during these tough economic times ?
It has become an unavoidable topic that comes up during business meetings , lunches , and social gatherings .
A friend recently was forced to sell his house , and shared with me the tales of money lost and his many frustrations .
Another friend jokingly remarked , “ my 401 K has turned into my 201k , I might as well have not worked for the past two years . ”
I ’ve done my best not to focus any energy on this topic , until I recently started receiving email from readers asking for advice on how to deal with the current economic situation , emotionally .
Here is one such email from a generous reader that encapsulates the topic nicely :
“ I am a recent graduate from a Masters program , have a very good job , but am constantly worried about what the future holds for me financially .
Since most of the troubles in the world are out of my hands , how can I keep an upbeat attitude about life in general , during these tough times that are affecting so many hard working people . ”
– James Richter
In this article , I will give my own perspective on this topic , and relay specific tips on dealing with fear during an economic downturn .
Finding Control , Again
I left my day job four months ago , and now rely on income from various investments .
Interestingly , the majority of my investments are in the stock market .
When the market crashed this year , I watched as my portfolio declined by as much as 50 % .
It is still below 50 % .
Suddenly , my hard earned , frugally saved , carefully budgeted savings appeared to have been chopped in half .
Given that I do n’t have guaranteed income , I am a single woman , and my net worth just declined significantly , conventional wisdom would say that I should be worried .
I should be freaking out !
But I ’m not .
I ’m pretty happy , actually .
Why ?
What can I change by becoming upset , anxious , or nervous ?
Nothing .
By complaining or allowing my body to suffer through anxiety , I will accomplish nothing .
I choose not to focus any energy on something that puts me in an un-resourceful state .
Remember , what we focus on expands .
We will get more of whatever we focus our attention on .
We get more of what we think about , talk about , and listen to .
I know that when I focus on fear , I experience more fear , and I find more reasons to become more fearful .
It ’s a downward and bottomless spiral , until I consciously and proactively interrupt that pattern and deliberately choose to focus on something else more productive and conducive to my wellbeing .
First , recognize that there are many things out of our control ; things like , the weather , the past , other people , and the economy .
Anxiety , worry and fear usually come when we focus on these external things that we cannot control .
Recall the last time you were really worried or nervous about something .
What were you focused on ?
Was it something external that was beyond your control ?
Second , recognize that we do have choices .
We always have choices .
We may feel that we do n’t have a choice , because we do n’t want to face the options – our pride and ego becoming hurt .

There is one thing we definitely have control over , and that is , we have control over the meaning which we give to things and circumstances .
We have a choice in the perspective which we use to interpret a given situation .
When we shift what something means to us , we shift our interpretation of it , and therefore we shift our emotions .
Thus , we hold the key to our own emotional wellbeing .
For me , it also helps to remember that regardless of what is happening to me financially or emotionally , the most precious of things – my true inner self , the essence of my Being , the divine presence within me that occasionally reveals itself with infinite wisdom – will never be threatened .
It is a blessing to be reminded that we are not our job titles , we are not the things we own , we are not our circumstances and we are not our thoughts .
And we certainly are not the fear running through our minds .
A full life is one that ’s rich with experiences .
Opportunities for deeply rewarding and high - growth experiences often present themselves , initially , in the form of adversities .
It is through overcoming these adversities and challenges that we develop personal strengths , character and wisdom – without which , we ’d be pretty boring and we ’d be pretty bored with life .
What if we looked for the gift in the perceived adversity ?
Try asking different questions .
Instead of asking “ Why me ? ” or complaining “ Poor me ” , consider asking yourself the following .
What can I learn from this situation ?
How can I use this adversity to become a better person ?
How can I use this opportunity to serve others and myself ?
What can I do to get to where I want to be ?
to get to where I want to be ?
What can I do to gain the clarity I need , to shift into a more resourceful state ?
How can I benefit from this situation ?
What if we focused on things that really matter to us , instead of things beyond our control that “ might ” happen at some distant future ?
Focusing on the fear of something that might happen is a waste of resources on several accounts .
For one , the thing you fear may never happen , meaning the times you ’ve spent worrying about it have been a waste of energy , a waste of emotion , and a waste of attention .
For another , the energy used on worrying could have been spent on doing something more proactive and actually helpful to your situation .
Imagine , instead of spending time finding and reading news stories on why we should be fearful , use that time and energy to do something more meaningful to you and that can actually benefit you ; things like , spending time developing relationships with the people you love , connecting with another human being , communing with nature , reading something uplifting , listening to something empowering , learning a new skill , or brushing up on an old skill .
You are the author of your life story .
Make it worthwhile !
1. Focus on What You Can Control
What we focus on can drastically change how we feel .
I know how tough it can be to focus on anything other than the present pain in front of us .
I ’ve been there , it sucks !
But it is possible to shift our focus with the intention of shifting our emotional state .
It is worthwhile to note that it ’s nearly impossible to skip emotional levels .
For example , we ca n’t suddenly go from resentment to excitement .
Emotionally , it ’s easier to shift from resentment to anger , from anger to being upset , from being upset to indifference , from indifference to fondness , etc .
With baby steps , gradually , we really can shift how we feel .
Recognize that you are in control .
You can choose to focus on a perspective that helps you .
See how you can change the meaning of an external circumstance to one which will benefit you ?
For example , we ca n’t control the up and down movement of a particular stock , but we can choose to see that this stock is just money , and money is a replenish - able resource that we can always make more of .
We can choose to see that our health is worth more than stressing over something we cannot control .

2. Eliminate or Drastically Reduce News Consumption
When was the last time popular news sources reported something uplifting , empowering and conflict - free ?
This rarely happens because it is not “ newsworthy ” , and almost never will you find uplifting news on the front page .
Newsworthy means : conflict , wars , gossip , suffering , and fear .
It may not be a news agency ’s sole intent to instill fear within us but it is the job of reporters to create content that highlights problems and exaggerates the stress of current situations .
If it was n’t emotionally disturbing , people would n’t read or watch the news , and the agencies would soon be out of business .
When was the last time you felt good after watching the nightly news or reading the front page stories ?
How does constantly reading about the credit crisis , the mortgage crisis , the stock market crash , or the recession empower us or uplift us or increase our wellness ?
How does it help us ?
The constant reminders keep us focused on fear , instead of solutions and hope .
Even people who should n’t be worried are worrying , unnecessarily .
3. Gratitude
What are the most important things in your life ?
What are you grateful for ?
Who do you love ?
List them out on a piece of paper , then close your eyes and see them in your imagination .
Feel the feelings of gratitude .
Do this regularly .
For me , what matters most are my relationships with my close friends and family .
The intimate moments of connection with another soul are one of the most precious , uplifting , and fulfilling things we can experience .
I treasure that beyond anything else .
Focusing on the priceless and intangible things that grace my life helps me to put things into perspective .
When put into perspective , I realized that I would trade all my material possessions in exchange for my health and relationships .
And even if I lost all my money and possessions , I know that with the support of those I love , good health and determination , I can always bounce back .
See how a shift in perspective can suddenly make you feel wealthy ?
4. Stop Spreading Fear
Stop complaining about your economic pains , stop forwarding news articles of fear to your friends , stop talking about it , and start doing things within your control .
If your immediate basic needs are threatened ( ie. loss of job , shelter and food ) , take action , massive action , to help yourself .
The only exception to talking about your economic situation is when you ask for help from others during a time of need .
5. Things Will Bounce Back
You are not alone .
We are all in this together .
History will repeat itself , and our economy will bounce back .
Winters will come and will eventually pass .
Hang on tight , and in the meanwhile , do whatever it takes to sustain yourself .
6. Enhance Your Assets
In alignment with doing things within your control , see if there are a set of skills for your trade that you could improve upon or learn .
The easiest route to job security is to become an invaluable , flexible and multi-skilled team player .
Commit to becoming undeniably outstanding in what you do , and never stop learning .
7. Emergency Fund
Just because we choose to not focus on fear , does not mean that we will not prepare for a rainy day .
Building an emergency fund is a must practice at all times , not just during the recession .
If you are not struggling to sustain your basic needs , make it a priority to build your emergency fund .
Regardless of how little money you can set aside each month , do it .
It ’s the practice of saving that ’s important here .
Do so diligently , and you will reap the rewards in a time of need .
8. Focus on the Benefits
There are benefits from the economic crisis .
Here are some :
Lower gas prices
Real - estate prices are lower , if you ’re in the market to buy and have the capital to do so , you ’re likely to get great deals .
Stock prices are cheaper .
Warren Buffet , said : “ Now is the time to buy ! ”
Reduced consumption and travel is having a positive effect on landfills and reduces ones carbon foot print .
Reduced consumption also means owning less stuff that we do n’t need , which can benefit our mental wellbeing .
9. Choose Happiness
Choosing happiness does not mean becoming vulnerable or ignorant to world issues .
It does n’t mean painting a fake smile on our faces , either .
It simply means that we are deliberately choosing to focus on things that are beautiful , things that give us joy , that make us smile , and that make us feel grateful to be alive .
Every day , we are surrounded by these pockets of miracles and opportunities for happiness .
Just like fear , the capacity to experience joy and the recognition of miracles is also a choice .
Which do you choose ?

Living a life filled with obstacles , in what some consider impossible conditions , Nick has excelled and now travels the world to bring tales of hope and inspiration to millions .
Now , think of your worst problems .
Now , look at Nick ’s attitude toward life .
Suddenly , with a little shift in perspective , life is n’t that bad after all .

Exclusive to STR
December 17 , 2008
Times are tough and getting much tougher .
Stocks are down as well as the number of decent jobs .
This is bad news for everyone but the government and its war machine .
All branches of the military are meeting or exceeding their recruitment goals .
They openly give credit to the poor economy for their success .
I guess when the corrupt government and its beneficiaries can't keep from destroying the economy and destroying millions of peaceful civilian jobs , there 's really not much else a worker can do than to support that corrupt government and its cronies by becoming a member of its war machine .
Before deciding to join the government 's military , a person should look past the hype the recruiter dishes out and also look past the cold , hard cash the government promises them .
They need to ask themselves what the bottom line will be if they decide to join the military .
The inescapable reality of being a member of the government 's armed forces is that you serve some of the most corrupt and incompetent politicians known to history .
You put your life on the line and take the lives of others for cheaters , thieves and liars who infect the halls of Congress and the White House .
Why would anyone knowingly do such a thing ?
In addition to the disgusting reality of actually being a servant to the dishonest and shady politicians , you run the real risk of killing innocent civilians and of being killed yourself .
Currently the number of dead Americans killed in the unnecessary war in Iraq is 4,209 , while the number of dead Americans killed in the unnecessary war in Afghanistan is rising fast with no end in sight .
For the reasons both wars are unnecessary , please read this column .
When making your decision to sign up , you should look past the heroic and romantic images of being a proud warrior that the recruiter 's office and Hollywood are full of and realize that there is a very real chance you may not come home as you left .
You may , as is evidenced in the picture to the left , return home without any hands or with only one complete arm , or worse .
A fellow former Marine , Fred Reed , who spent time fighting in Vietnam , wrote an outstanding column about the realities of offering yourself up to the politicians as a member of their war machine .
He mentions things the government and its recruiters do n't like to talk about , things like colostomy bags and wheel chairs .
Another important reality to keep in mind when thinking about signing up is the reality that the big shots who run the show could n't care less about you or yours .
A great example of this that flies squarely in the face of all the hollow and meaningless speeches given by the war pigs about how they honor and respect the troops is made clear by the documented fact that years prior to the war in Iraq , Pentagon officials knew that roadside bombs would be a very deadly and serious threat to American troops .
What did they do to protect their dear troops ?
NOTHING !
Are these the people who you want to serve ?
Instead of serving the corrupt and crooked , you should do what is truly important and desperately needed : work and organize others to bring down the rotted and self - serving system .
As the economy continues to crumble , people are going to be asking tough questions that require real answers and which the government is not capable of answering .

John Smoltz has pitched his entire major league career with the Atlanta Braves , but he is on the verge of a deal with the Boston Red Sox , according to sources .
Smoltz , 41 , has pitched in 708 games for the Braves , winning 210 games and earning 154 saves .
He has been rehabilitating his shoulder since having surgery last season , and there have been reports that he has made excellent progress .
Smoltz 's departure from Atlanta would come in a winter in which the Braves have struggled to fill holes in their rotation ; Atlanta was unable to land Jake Peavy , after extensive trade talks , and was unable to sign free agent A.J. Burnett .
Boston 's proposed deal with Smoltz is for $ 5.5 million in base salary , and $ 5 million in incentives .
Assuming the Red Sox close out negotiations with Smoltz , they will go into spring training with six veteran starters -- Josh Beckett , Daisuke Matsuzaka , Jon Lester , Tim Wakefield , Brad Penny and Smoltz .
Penny agreed to terms on a one - year , $ 5 million deal and will be in Boston Thursday for his physical examination .
But the Red Sox have come to believe in the idea of going into each season overloaded with starting pitching ; their assumption is that , at some point , injuries will factor in the equation , or some members of the rotation will need rest .
The signings of Smoltz and Penny also give the Red Sox the flexibility to consider trading one of their young starting pitchers -- most notably Clay Buchholz , whose name has come up in trade talks with the Texas Rangers , for catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia , as well as with other teams .

A couple of University of Iowa fans took a break from Saturday ’s game at the Metrodome against the University of Minnesota to have some illicit sex in a Dome restroom , police said .
The duo — a 38 - year - old woman and a 26 - year - old man from Carroll and Linden , Iowa , respectively — turned a handicapped toilet stall into their love nest about 8:30 p.m. , late in the Hawkeyes ’ 55 - 0 trouncing of the Gophers .
A crowd of intoxicated fans gathered in the restroom to laugh and cheer the off - the - field action , until an Avalon Security guard tipped off University of Minnesota police to the ruckus .
Officers had to interrupt the intimate moment to cite the couple for indecent conduct , a misdemeanor .
University of Minnesota Police Chief Greg Hestness said similar citations at the Metrodome or on campus usually involve public urination .
He said it was the first time in his six years at the U that his force has interrupted a sex act during a Gophers game .
Hestness assumed the woman was embarrassed about being caught :
She initially gave a false name to officers and had to be identified by her husband before she was released .
The man was attending the game with his girlfriend , according to police .
“ It ’s a long ride back to Iowa , ” Hestness said .

Pat Bowlen must dread the process of hiring a head coach .
He kept Mike Shanahan around for 14 years , even though the last 10 had just one playoff win .
For his next head coach , Bowlen hired someone half his own age , perhaps an indication that if all goes well , the Broncos ’ owner may have made the last big hire of his life .
Bowlen , 64 , has chosen Josh McDaniels , a 32 - year - old understudy of New England ’s Bill Belichick , to become the Broncos ’ new head coach .
Broncos chief operating officer Joe Ellis confirmed Sunday night the team had reached an agreement with McDaniels .
The Broncos will hold a news conference today at 5 p.m. to announce the hiring of McDaniels , who was the coordinator of the prolific New England Patriots offense the past three years .
Bowlen picked McDaniels even though there ’s not a responsible bartender in Colorado who would n’t first greet the Broncos coach by asking to see his ID .
McDaniels is three years younger than Broncos center Casey Wiegmann and five years younger than injured center Tom Nalen , who is expected to retire anyway .
“ It ’s not about how old you are ; it ’s about experience , ” said Kenny Peterson , the Broncos defensive end who was a freshman backup tight end at McKinley High School in Canton , Ohio , when McDaniels was the starting quarterback .
“ His dad was a great football coach .
His grandfather was a great football coach .
Josh has been around football coaching all his life .
“ I was hoping Josh would get it because I want good things to happen to great people .
And Josh is a great person .
Obviously , Mr. B sees something in Josh that will lead this team to a world championship . ”
As the interview process played out , it appeared McDaniels was the favorite almost from the time Shanahan was fired nearly two weeks ago .
The Broncos ’ five - man search committee of Bowlen , Ellis and front - office executives Jim Goodman , Brian Xanders and Jeff Goodman interviewed six other candidates .
Only McDaniels got a second interview , which he received Thursday night during a six - hour meeting with Ellis , who in recent years has become Bowlen ’s most trusted confidant .
Because Bowlen is obligated to pay Shanahan about $ 20 million over the next three years , money was a consideration while seeking a replacement .
First - year coaches with no previous head coaching experience typically receive a salary around $ 2 million .
McDaniels is expected to receive a four - or five - year contract .
The Broncos ’ search committee also gave serious consideration to defensive coordinators Leslie Frazier of the Minnesota Vikings and Steve Spagnuolo of the New York Giants and Dallas offensive coordinator Jason Garrett .
But Bowlen saw the most potential in McDaniels .
Bowlen ’s instincts aside , McDaniels was a surprising choice for several reasons .
First , his youthful appearance .
Not only is he 32 , but at 5 feet 10 inches tall and 160 pounds , the clean - shaven McDaniels appears much younger .
“ If he were going to get the job , I would say without exception the players would be surprised when he walks through the door , ” former Patriots tight end Kyle Brady said in a Denver Post interview last week .
“ Their first thought will be , ‘ Who is this kid ? ’
Because even for a 32 - year - old , he looks 25 .
“ But what wins you over is his knowledge , his expertise , his thoroughness , his preparation .
These are all preached and practiced by the Patriots organization as a whole .
But beyond all that , his ability to relate to players is exceptional . ”
Another reason to question the decision to hire McDaniels is it seemed the Broncos already had the same kind of coach in Jeremy Bates .
Like McDaniels , Bates is 32 .
Like McDaniels , Bates called the offensive plays during the 2008 season .
Unlike McDaniels , Bates was publicly endorsed by Broncos quarterback Jay Cutler after Shanahan was fired .
Bates and McDaniels have become acquainted in recent years during the NFL scouting combines in Indianapolis .
Bates is one of six Broncos coaches held over from Shanahan ’s staff who will interview with McDaniels , but the new coach will have the final say on whom to retain .
“ I know Jeremy , ” McDaniels said at last year ’s Super Bowl media day .
“ We have never really talked scheme or anything like that , but we have a cordial relationship .
I think he ’s very bright . ”
Another reason McDaniels was a surprise :
He comes from a Belichick - led Patriots team that has excelled with a 3 - 4 defense .
The Broncos have built their personnel around a 4 - 3 system , but after the team ’s disastrous performances the past two seasons , this would be the time to make the conversion to the 3 - 4 .
Longtime defensive coordinator Dom Capers , who is currently with the Patriots , and former Broncos defensive coordinator Mike Nolan will receive strong consideration to become the Broncos ’ new defensive boss .
McDaniels ’ father , Thom , is an Ohio high school coaching legend .
An undersized quarterback , McDaniels later converted to receiver at John Carroll University in Cleveland .
McDan iels got his first coaching job on Nick Saban ’s staff at Michigan State in 1999 , got out of coaching in 2000 but returned at an entry level on Belichick ’s staff in 2001 .
By 2006 , McDaniels became the Pats ’ offensive coordinator , and in 2007 his team set NFL records by scoring 75 touchdowns and 589 points .
Although New England lost star quarterback Tom Brady in the first quarter of the first game this season , McDaniels helped guide career - long backup Matt Cassel to 11 wins .

Build your own stabilizer out of string
Shooting long exposures without something to prop your camera on is a pain in the ass , not to mention a blurry mess .
So is carrying a tripod .
This video shows how to build a pretty effective foot - looping camera stabilizer out of some string , a bolt and a washer .
The results are surprisingly good .

Build your own L - bracket , for serious stability , vertical mounting
If you 're doing portrait photography , or have a dumpy old tripod that can't accommodate vertically oriented cameras , you can build a sturdy L - bracket for about $ 30 .
It 's a bit more involved than the piece - o - string stabilizer , but it 's also a lot better , and much cheaper than something you 'd pick up at Wolf .

The " David Pogue Special " :
Use a lamp as a tripod
To round out the camera - steadying tools , here 's what I call the David Pogue Special , and it 's great :
Many lampshade mounts share a diameter and thread size with the tripod mount screw on the bottom of your camcorder , point - and - shoot or DSLR , providing quick and dirty stabilization in a bind .

Scrounge up household flash diffusers
Shooting with flash indoors is often necessary , but can wash out your subjects , making them look sheet - white , greasy and demon-eyed .
With a diffuser , the light is softened and the photos are dramatically improved .
Commercial flash hoods and diffusers cost money , but are n't much more effective than what you can make yourself .
A coffee filter held in front of a flash , a translucent film canister with a notch cut into it , a simple piece of A4 paper or even a piece of matte Scotch tape over the flash lens will measurably improve your drunk party photography .

Calibrate color temperature with free flooring samples
Shooting a piece of paper , gray notecard or painted wall can give you OK white balance calibration , but this guy has a better idea : snag some free floor laminate samples and built a proper calibration board .

Make flash deflection umbrellas from actual umbrellas
If you really want to go pro-hobo , you can repurpose old umbrellas into flash - directing photography umbrellas .
After all , there are always plenty lying around .
Here 's how you do it .
If you 're feeling lazy , you can even get away with just an old sheet and some tape .

Build still - life photography studio for free ( ish )
Ever wonder how that creepy old photographer got such a soft , vivid , dreamy picture of you and your prom date all those years ago ?
This is how .
The project does n't call for much more than large pieces of paper and tape — relying on indirect sunlight for the adequate lighting — but the results are impressive .
It is just a small - scale testbed though , so you 'll be limited to shooting Lego models , action figures and the like , but what else were you going to shoot anyway ?

Snap magazine - style portraits , beautiful macros with a homemade ringlight
Flickr user jedrek has written out a detailed how - to guide for converting your external flash into a ringlighting rig , mostly using kitchen wares .
If you 've never heard of ringlighting , have a look at this .
The technique is usually reserved for professional photographers , because real ringflashes are comically expensive .
This one costs a few bucks .

Foam - fit an old bag to hold your gear
If you 're packing a DSLR with lenses and accessories , carrying a full - fledged camera bag is usually ideal , but they 're expensive and tend to draw attention to your cargo .
With some foam , cardboard and a ratty old military - surplus bag , you can put together a stylish , stealthy and highly - functional camera bag that wo n't make you feel like a snap - happy father of four .

Advertisement Surgical procedures could soon be helped along with tiny robots , according to researchers .
Miniaturisation of motors has not kept pace with that of electronics , leaving such tiny robots with no means to get around in the body .
Now , research reported in the Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering has demonstrated a motor about twice the size of a human hair .
The motors could be used to power mini robots to fly around inside the body .
Some surgical procedures are hindered by the size or inflexibility of current instruments .
For example , the labyrinthine network of blood vessels in the brain prevents the use of catheters threaded through larger blood vessels .
Researchers have long envisioned that trends of miniaturisation would lead to tiny robots that could get around easily in the body .
The problem until now has been powering them .
Conventional electric motors do not perform as well as they are scaled down in size ; as they approach millimetre dimensions , they barely have the power to overcome the resistance in their bearings .
This has been the significant bottleneck in the development of microtechnology such as tiny surgical robots , according to James Friend at the University of Monash in Australia .
" If you pick up an electronics catalogue , you 'll find all sorts of sensors , LEDs , memory chips etc that represent the latest in technology and miniaturisation , " he says .
All the other concepts to do this are very complex
Mettin Sitti
Carnegie Mellon University
" Take a look however at the motors , and there are few changes from the motors available in the 1950s . "
Push to turn
To address that , research in recent years has seen the use of so - called piezoelectric materials .
These are typically crystals that expand and contract when a voltage is applied to them .
That makes " linear motors " - which simply move back and forth at high frequency - easy to produce , and Professor Friend published work last year about a motor the size of a grain of salt .
But for real motion within the body , the micro-motors need to be able to rotate .
Many kinds of bacteria , for instance , have tail - like structures called flagella .
Rotating the flagella at their base whips them into a helical structure that propels them through fluid .
The new research leverages this same approach , by transforming the linear motion of tiny piezoelectric motors into rotation .
That is accomplished by coupling the motors to a structure with a helix - shaped cut in it .
Because the structure is held in place along the helical groove , a push at one end is turned into a rotation .
The reverse case : rotation of a helical thread drives a bulb into a socket The researchers ' prototype measures is a quarter of a millimetre wide - not much more than a couple of hairs side - by - side , and 70 % smaller than the previous record holder .
And the fact that it is a conceptually simple , self - contained approach is promising for future applications , says Metin Sitti , who heads the NanoRobotics Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University .
" All the other concepts to do this are very complex , " he says .
" We can already use electromagnetics and external coils to spin them inside a liquid , but then you need all these off - board coils .
" The advantage of this concept is having an on - board rotary actuation , " he says .
" This could make for a mobile robot with no other equipment . "
However , experts in such microelectromechanical systems from QinetiQ told BBC
News that while the prototype provides impressive performance in a lab , its efficiency in moving through fluids is yet to be demonstrated .
If it proves successful , however , the approach could be used in applications outside the body , according to Professor Sitti .
" These are high - frequency , lightweight motors , and those are specifications that would be advantageous for flying robots too . "

US economists have relentlessly harangued the Japanese for their supposed mismanagement of their post bubble era , which has lead to nearly 20 years of low growth , borderline deflation , with a not - much - discussed , robust export sector .
Along with others , we complained in the early days of the Fed / Treasury emergency response that they were taking one of the worst elements of the Japanese playbook , namely , trying to prop up the value of dud assets , rather than figuring out how to do more price discovery and ameliorate the attendant reaction ( not damage , mind you , the damage was already done when the bad loans were made ) .
Yes , the Treasury has made some capital injections into banks , but without cleaning up the balance sheets , the benefits are limited .
Even with supposedly more aggressive action on realizing losses , our banks act a lot like their Japanese pre-writedown zombie counterparts .
So in yet another “ putting lipstick on a pig ” initiatives , the authorities , having unwittingly copied the heretofore - seen - as - failed Japanese playbook , are now trying to reposition Japan as a source of valuable lessons .
Trust me , you would never have seen anything along these lines two year ago , starting with the title of the New York Times story “ Japan Offers a Possible Road Map for U.S. Economy . ”
Pretty soon , we ’ll have our very own Ministry of Truth ( I kid you not , read the article ) .
From the New York Times :
The Bank of Japan kept rates near zero for most of the last decade in an effort to end a long economic stagnation , and raised them only two years ago .
Many economists say they believe that the zero interest - rate policy finally worked in Japan after regulators took aggressive steps that succeeded in restoring faith in Japan ’s financial system and Tokyo ’s ability to oversee it .
Now , with the Fed and President - elect Barack Obama turning to the same sorts of unconventional policy tools to battle the worst global economic crisis since the Depression , economists and bankers say they hope that Japan ’s lessons are not lost on Washington .
They say the United States needs to take the same kinds of confidence - building steps , and much more quickly than Japan did … .
Yves here .
Why does this remind me of that phase of the Iraq war when the US claimed the problem was not how the war ( notice how we never say occupation ? ) was going , but the perceptions of the war within Iraq , and launched a PR campaign ?
That was such an astounding success that it gets nary a mention these days .
Back to the article :
Economists and former Bank of Japan officials say the biggest lesson they learned was that cutting rates alone has almost no effect when the financial system has fallen into a crisis as deep as the one Japan faced in the 1990s .
Japanese banks simply refused to lend in an environment where borrowers could suddenly go bankrupt , saddling lenders with huge , unforeseen losses .
The Bank of Japan tried even more extreme measures , like using its powers to create money to essentially stuff cash into the nation ’s commercial banks in hopes they would start lending again .
Exasperated central bankers found that commercial banks just let the money pile up instead of lending it out .
Economists say the United States faces a similar situation , after the sudden collapse in September of Lehman Brothers created fears of additional failures .
Economists also fault Washington for its inconsistency in dealing with the financial crisis , leaving the impression that it does not have a clear strategy for dealing with ailing lenders .
In Japan ’s case , economists and former bankers say , credit began to flow freely again only after 2003 , when regulators adopted a tough new policy of auditing banks and forcing weaker ones to raise new capital or accept a government takeover .
Economists said the audits finally removed paralysis in credit markets by convincing bankers and investors that sudden failures were no longer a risk , and that the true extent of problems at banks and other companies was finally being revealed .
Economists say Washington needs to do something similar to make banks and financial companies more transparent , and reassure investors that there were no more collapses like that of Lehman Brothers on the horizon .
Yves here .
The need for writedowns along with recapitalization was the lesson of the widely - touted Swedish approach , in the wake of its early 1990s financial crisis .
But Sweden went even further .
It nationalized dud banks , replaced management , spun out bad assets into an independent company .
That entity was deliberately overcapitalized ,
It was able to do triage on borrowers , liquidating ones that were goners , but more important , restructuring loans and often extending new credit to ones who looked viable .
Back to the Times , this time for comic relief :
Economists and former central bankers said another lesson from Japan ’s experience was the importance of consistency .
This became apparent in 2000 , they said , during one of the bank ’s more embarrassing episodes , when it raised interest rates , and lowered them back to zero a year later when the economy faltered .
It ’s a little late to worry about consistency … .
[ Note for TomDispatch Readers :
With this post , TD is closing down for the holidays .

Until then , take care . ]
Thank heavens the Nation magazine exists .
Otherwise , subjects that should matter to us might simply disappear into the void , along with key aspects of our history .
Recently , for instance , the magazine produced Nick Turse 's major historical investigation , " A My Lai a Month , " on the pattern of U.S. war crimes during the Vietnam War .
Important and startling as that piece was , it 's hard to imagine what other magazine might have carried it .
In its latest issue , the Nation ( with the help of the Nation Institute 's Investigative Fund ) turns to a more recent set of crimes that , until reporter A.C. Thompson investigated , few paid the slightest mind to .
It 's appropriate that Thompson 's shocking , must - read revelations of vigilante killings carried out against blacks in devastated New Orleans in 2005 , " Katrina 's Hidden Race War , " began with a TomDispatch writer , the irrepressible Rebecca Solnit .
On hearing of some of these murders while visiting New Orleans back in 2006 , she went in search of someone who would report on them , and the rest is now , as they say , history .
For the last two years , Solnit has helped to close down this site for the holiday season .
In December 2007 , she laid out a twelve - book " secret library of hope " for TD readers .
The year before , she wrote a wonderful " retrospective " on our time to come , " The Age of Mammals : Looking Back on the First Quarter of the Twenty - First Century . "
As ( unfortunately ) befits the closing moments of the Bush era and the carnage it let loose across the globe , her 2008 site - closing piece has a grimmer tinge to it .
But perhaps there is something seasonally hopeful simply in acknowledging , as fully as we can , what these last murderous eight years have meant .

Their criminal acts were no secret but they never became part of the official story .
The media demonized the city 's black population for crimes that turned out not to have happened , and the retractions were , as always , too little too late .
At one point FEMA sent a refrigerated 18 - wheeler to pick up what a colonel in the National Guard expected to be 200 bodies in New Orleans 's Superdome , only to find six , including four who died naturally and a suicide .
Meanwhile , the media never paid attention to the real rampage that took place openly across the river , even though there were corpses lying in unflooded streets and testimony everywhere you looked -- or I looked , anyway .
What do you do when you notice that there seems to have been a killing spree ?
While the national and international media were working themselves and much of the public into a frenzy about imaginary hordes of murderers , rapists , snipers , marauders , and general rampagers among the stranded crowds of mostly poor , mostly black people in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina , a group of white men went on a shooting spree across the river .

The widely reported violent crimes in the Superdome turned out to be little more than hysterical rumor , but they painted African - Americans as out - of - control savages at a critical moment .
The result was to shift institutional responses from disaster relief to law enforcement , a decision that resulted in further deaths among the thirsty , hot , stranded multitude .
Governor Kathleen Blanco announced , " I have one message for these hoodlums :
These troops know how to shoot and kill , and they are more than willing to do so if necessary , and I expect they will . "
So would the white vigilantes , and though their exact body count remains unknown , at least 11 black men were apparently shot , some fatally .
The parish of Orleans includes both the city of New Orleans on one side of the Mississippi and a community on the other side called Algiers that can be reached via a bridge called the Crescent City Connection .
That bridge comes down in another town called Gretna , and the sheriff of Gretna and a lot of his henchmen turned many of the stranded in New Orleans back at gunpoint from that bridge , trapping them in the squalor of a destroyed city , another heinous crime that was largely overlooked .
On the Gretna / Algiers side of the river , the levees held and nothing flooded .
Next door to Gretna , Algiers is a mostly black community , but one corner of it down by the river , Algiers Point , is a white enclave , a neighborhood of pretty little , well - kept - up wooden houses -- and of killers .
What do you do when you notice that there seems to have been a killing spree ?
By my second visit to New Orleans almost a year and a half after the hurricane that devastated the place , I had more than enough information to know that something very wrong had happened in Algiers Point .
In a report on New Orleans for TomDispatch in March of 2007 , I wrote :
" During my trips to the still half - ruined city , some inhabitants have told me that they , in turn , were told by white vigilantes of widespread murders of black men in the chaos of the storm and flood .
These accounts suggest that , someday , an intrepid investigative journalist may stand on its head the media hysteria of the time ( later quietly recanted ) about African - American violence and menace in flooded New Orleans . "
I found that journalist in my friend A.C. Thompson who , backed by the Nation magazine , launched an investigation just concluded this week , 21 months after I first approached him .
His courageous and meticulous investigation tracked down victims and persecutors , clarified what happened on those days of mayhem in Algiers Point , sued to gain access to , and sifted through , the coroner 's records that mentioned some bulllet - riddled bodies , and dug up some previously unreported police crimes .
His stunning report in the Nation , " Katrina 's Hidden Race War , " suggests that there 's still more there to find .
A lot of the pieces of the Algiers Point killing spree were out in the open .
Several weeks after Hurricane Katrina , community organizer and former Black Panther Malik Rahim had told Amy Goodman on her nationally syndicated program Democracy Now ! , " During the aftermath , directly after the flooding , in New Orleans hunting season began on young African American men .
In Algiers , I believe , approximately around 18 African American males were killed .
No one really know [s ] what 's the overall count . "
Rahim 's count seems high , but the real toll remains unknown .
The young medics who staffed the Common Ground Clinic , co-founded by Rahim , also knew that there had been a spate of killings : like everyone else who came in , the killers and their associates had felt the need to tell their stories , as well as get their tetanus shots or blood pressure meds .
The medics , whom Rahim credits with defusing a potential race war in Algiers by reaching out to everyone equally , told me they 'd heard murder confessions from the vigilantes and their cohorts ( but respected their confidentiality by not passing along names or identifying information ) .
CNN and the Times Picayune , New Orleans 's paper of record , both published a photograph of a member of the " self - appointed posse " in Algiers Point napping next to five shotguns , an AK - 47 assault rifle , and a pistol , but they never got around to asking if the band of white guys had actually used the guns .
As it happened , not only did they use the guns , but they confessed -- or boasted -- on videotape to their shootings and killings , tape that ended up in a little - seen documentary called " Welcome to New Orleans . "
I passed along what I knew to A.C. , but a lot of it had n't been a secret , just easily visible dots no one was connecting .
None was more visible than the attempted murder of Donnell Herrington .
What It 's Like to Be Murdered
One balmy September afternoon , under the shade of the broad - armed oaks of New Orleans 's City Park , Donnell Herrington told us what it 's like to be murdered -- for the men who attacked him shortly after Hurricane Katrina drowned his city intended to kill him and nearly succeeded .
Donnell is a soft - spoken guy now in his early thirties and he worries the question of why they shot him , of what they thought they were doing .
On what possible grounds could you blast away with a shotgun at a guy walking down a public street who had n't even seen you , let alone threatened you ?
He knows they consider themselves justified , and he wrestles with the question , but each time it comes up he finally concludes it was a hate crime .
It was because he was black .
" I did n't approach these guys in any way possible for them to react the way they did .
It was n't a reaction at all it .
It was just a hate crime , because a reaction is when somebody try to bring bodily harm on you and you react in self - defense .
When the guy actually stepped out and pulled the trigger , I did n't see him , I did n't even know what happened to me .
The only thing I can remember is feeling a lot of pressure hit my neck and it literally knocked me off my feet . "
The close - up shotgun blast had punctured his jugular vein and he had only a little time to get help before he bled to death .
He told his friend and cousin to run , found his way to his feet , only to be shot in the back yet again .
He fell down again , got up again -- a former athlete , Herrington is many kinds of strong -- and stumbled away , one hand to the blood spurting from his neck .
Herrington had been desperate to get out of the ravaged city where , two days earlier , he 'd seen his grandparents ' neighborhood flood , rescued them and a lot of neighbors by boat , left them to be evacuated from the elevated Interstate , walked across the Crescent City Connection to his home in Algiers on the other side of the Mississippi , found its roof crushed by a huge bough , and decided there was nothing left to do but get out himself .
On September 1st , day three of the catastrophe , he had set out with his teenage cousin and a friend for the ferry landing in Algiers Point .
There , they had been told , you could actually be evacuated when so many people were stranded in the heat and chaos of a drowned city .
Not long into that flight they ran into the white men with guns .
On the one - year anniversary of the catastrophe , millions of Americans watched Spike Lee's When the Levees Broke : A Requiem in Four Acts on HBO .
Most of the film is made up of people talking straight into the camera about their Katrina , and one of the talkers is a sweet - voiced , brown - skinned guy : Herrington .
He tells the camera :
" We walking down the street , which was in Algiers and I 'm talking to my cousin .
I had a bottle of water in my hand , and I 'm talking to him , we 're talking about different things and before you know it , I heard a boom , a blast .
My body lifted up in the air , and I hit the ground , and , you know , my cousin was standing over me and he was howling and he hollering my name and asking if I was okay , and he was hysterical at this time , and looking at the blood on my shirt and my arms .
" And I looked up and saw a white guy with a white t- shirt in his hands coming toward me , so I managed to get up by the grace of God .
I managed to get up , and they had some debris in the street , and so when I turned away from the guy he turned toward me with the shotgun , looked like he was trying to reload .
So as I turned away from him I jumped over the debris and I heard another bang .
Some of the buckshots hit me in the back , and I hit the ground again . "
In the film , Herrington pulls up his shirt and shows his torso , peppered with lumps from the buckshot .
And then he gestures at the long , twisting , raised scar wound around his neck like a centipede or a snake : " And this is the incision from the surgery from the buckshots that penetrated my neck and hit my jugular vein . "
A victim of a horrific attempted murder told his story in a national television special and , though I 'm sure lots of viewers wanted to do something , those who really could have done something did nothing .
Lee 's film cut away to then governor Kathleen Blanco vowing more law and order against the supposedly rampaging African - American menace of New Orleans .
Herrington is a kind man ; one of the first things he said to us was , " I asked God to forgive those guys that done this thing to me .
It was kind of hard to even bring myself to that but I know it 's the right thing to do , but at the same time those guys have gotta answer for their actions . "
He was a Brink 's truck driver at the time of Katrina , a man with a clean record routinely in charge of hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash , and he attempted to evacuate Katrina with a pocketful of his own cash -- which only underscores how preposterous it was for his prospective murderers to see him as a thief .
He nearly bled to death before a local couple drove him to the nearest medical center , where his throat was sewn up .
More than three years later , it 's clear that the trauma is still with him .
His friend and cousin were chased down , threatened with pistols , called " nigger , " but finally allowed to go , traumatized by their own brush with men who made it clear they'd be happy to kill them .
" Like Pheasant Season in South Dakota "
In 1892 , Homer Plessy , a light - skinned black man , was arrested in New Orleans for riding a streetcar then reserved for whites only .
A precursor of Rosa Parks , he pursued a landmark lawsuit that went all the way to a racist Supreme Court , which issued the infamous " separate but equal " doctrine that stood until the civil rights battles of the postwar era .
That same year Charles Allan Gilbert drew a picture of a beautiful woman sitting in darkness at her dressing table , her head with mounded hair and its reflection arranged so that if you look at the celebrated drawing another way you see a grinning skull whose teeth are the rows of bottles of perfume and powder .
For a year or more -- Katrina was one of the biggest news stories of the past century -- journalists swarmed like ants over New Orleans .
The national and international news media , left , right , and center , big and small , print and radio , television and film , saw the beautiful woman and saw as well bogeymen in the shadows of their own lurid imaginations .
And they declined to see the big white skull laughing at them .
That death grin can , however , be caught on the faces of the tipsy white people who confess on camera to murdering their neighbors .
Separate but equal may have been abolished in the courts , but these people were gunning down African - American men just for walking in the streets in the aftermath of the storm -- segregation by bullet -- gunning them down on the grounds that no black man had the right to be there and any of them was a menace .
On one of my visits to New Orleans after Katrina , I met with Rahim , a solid older man with long dreadlocks who told me in his rumbling voice of the bodies he'd seen in the streets of Algiers and gave me a copy of the documentary Welcome to New Orleans .
It showed one of the corpses rotting , in plain sight , under a sheet of corrugated sheet metal .
It also showed white vigilantes whooping it up and talking openly about what they had done .
At a barbeque shortly after Katrina struck , a stocky white guy with receding white hair and a Key West t- shirt chortles , " I never thought eleven months ago I 'd be walking down the streets of New Orleans with two .38s and a shotgun over my shoulder .
It was great .
It was like pheasant season in South Dakota .
If it moved , you shot it . "
A tough woman with short hair and chubby arms adds , " That 's not a pheasant and we 're not in South Dakota .
What 's wrong with this picture ? "
The man responds happily , " Seemed like it at the time . "
A second white - haired guy explains , " You had to do what you had to do , if you had to shoot somebody , you had to shoot .
It 's that simple . "
A third says simply , " We shot 'em . "
I vowed to Rahim then that I would get the murders investigated .
After all , it was n't just rumors ; it was a survivor telling his story on national television and apparent murderers telling theirs in a documentary .
Despite the solid evidence , no one was following up -- not the Pulitzer - winning journalists I contacted through friends , nor the filmmaker who captured Herrington , nor the national radio host Rahim spoke to of mass murder , nor the coroners who had some very interesting corpses on their hands , nor the New Orleans police who talked to Herrington in the hospital and whom he approached afterward , no one until the Nation provided A.C. the resources to do it right .
The worst crimes in disasters are usually committed by institutional authorities and those aligned with them .
They fear an unpoliced public and believe private property so sacred a right that they 're willing to kill to defend it , or in this case , just on the off - chance that a passerby might fancy their television set .
This is the conclusion of the sociologists who have been studying disasters for decades , many of whom I 've spoken with in the past few years .
And this is the pattern of disasters , like the 1906 San Francisco earthquake , in which the public behaved well but the military -- which essentially became a hostile occupying army -- terrorized the public in the name of preventing looting , shot many innocents , and may have killed scores overall .
( In some outrageous incidents , New Orleans police evidently gunned down unarmed African - Americans themselves in the wake of Katrina . )
Looting is a term that should be abolished .
In major disasters , when the monetary economy evaporates and needs are desperate , taking water , or food , or diapers , or medicine from shuttered stores -- which is what much of the so - called looting consisted of -- is largely legitimate requisitioning .
The rest is theft , and in the days after Katrina there was also some theft -- by the New Orleans police , for example , who cleaned out a Cadillac dealership and helped themselves to goods in a WalMart , as well as by stranded citizens who figured they 'd been abandoned or imprisoned in the ruined city and that all rules were gone .
Looting is an incendiary , inexact word , suggesting mayhem far beyond the acquisition of commodities .
One Algiers Point vigilante claimed to fear that they would come for his elderly mother , but most of the flooded - out evacuees were looking for food , water , information about family members , and a way out of the wreckage .
Another vigilante told A.C. that they could tell the three black men they blasted with a shotgun were looters because they were carrying sports apparel with them .
That the victims might be evacuating with their own clothing did not occur to these homicidal fabulists , nor did they seem to think that shooting men who might possibly have taken something of modest value from elsewhere was an overreaction .
The vigilantes of Algiers Point seem to have killed , by their own admissions -- or boasts -- several African - American men .
A.C. was able to get first - hand accounts of eleven shootings , and my initial sources had told me they heard admissions of about seven killings .
One militia member shot a black man dead at close range as he attempted to break into a corner store , another member told A.C. , the only time one of the shootings seems tied in any way to a potential property crime .
The police and coroner produced almost no record of what went on there and then .
The vigilantes of Algiers Point were classic white - flight people .
They had spent decades regarding the central city with terror and resentment , and so saw Katrina not as a tragedy that happened to the neighbors , but as a moment when the dangers confined to the other side of the river were swarming across it .
Because the riot was already in their heads , they became the crazed murderers they claimed to fear -- though fear may not have been the driving motive for all of them .
A.C. was told that they turned themselves into an informal militia after one of their number was brutally carjacked by a black man , but another source told me that her relatives were gleeful about the chance to fight a race war against African - Americans and encouraged to do so by law enforcement .
Like Rahim , she calls what went on " hunting " and spoke of a photograph she was sent of a vigilante posing like a big - game hunter next to a black murder victim .
Which suggests the catastrophe of Katrina was just cover for getting away with a Klan - style killing spree .
" Look Away , Look Away , Look Away , Dixie Land "
Why could n't anyone in the mainstream see the story of vigilantes on a rampage ?
Why did n't anyone want to see it ?
Racism is the obvious answer , the racism that made the killings invisible to some and made others think they were n't an issue .
The racism and corruption of the New Orleans law enforcement system is old news , and it's not surprising , though it is shameful , that stories like Herrington 's did n't even trigger police reports , let alone investigations .
But the whole world was watching New Orleans and , at one point or another , every major news outlet in the country had someone on the ground there .
Maybe a deeper racism made these crimes unimaginable , even when enough evidence was there , even when the skull was laughing out loud .
Certainly the murderers have , until now , lived with a strange sense of impunity that has made them cocky and candid about what went down in Algiers Point in the wake of the storm .
These were the people who broke down in the aftermath of Katrina , who reverted to savagery , not the crowds stranded in the Superdome , or the Convention Center , or on the elevated freeways , or in schools and other inadequate refuges from the flooding that overtook New Orleans .
It 's important to keep in mind , despite the false stories the media spread in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane , and this grim , true story three years later , that the response to Katrina was mostly about altruism , courage , and generosity .
That was the case whether you are considering people like Herrington , who stayed behind to take care of others , or the " Cajun Navy " of white guys with boats , who headed into the city immediately after the storm to rescue the stranded , or the many who took in evacuees or otherwise tried to help , or what , by now , must be hundreds of thousands of volunteers who arrived in the months and years after the storm to cook and build and organize to bring New Orleans back .
It 's also important to keep in mind that , while the small minority who became a freelance militia murdered casually , the catastrophic loss of life in Louisiana -- about 1,500 people , disproportionately elderly -- was largely due to decisions made by another small minority : elected and appointed government authorities , from Mayor Ray Nagin , who hesitated to call a mandatory evacuation and never provided the resources for the most destitute and frail to evacuate , to FEMA director Michael Brown , who posed and dithered while tens of thousands suffered , to New Orleans 's police chief and Louisiana 's governor , both of whom chose to regard a drowned and overheated city as a law - enforcement crisis rather than a humanitarian relief challenge .
In many , many cases , supplies and rescuers were kept out of the city , hospitals were prevented from evacuating the dying , and the ability of civil society to do what the government would not -- save the stranded , succor the sick -- was hindered at every turn .
But this story we know .
Now , it 's time to know the other half , the grinning skull , the version that turns everything we were told in the first days upside - down and inside out , the story of murders in plain sight almost no one wanted to see .
Look at them .
Now , may some measure of justice be done .
Rebecca Solnit 's book about disaster and civil society , A Paradise Built in Hell , will be out in time for Katrina 's fourth anniversary .

MEXICO CITY , Mexico ( CNN ) --
An American anti-kidnapping consultant was kidnapped in Mexico , according to the Houston - based security firm he works for .
Felix Batista was abducted outside a restaurant December 10 in Saltillo , the capital of Mexico 's Coahuila state , the firm said .
The former U.S. military officer is a contract consultant for ASI Global LLC and was in Mexico " on personal business , " ASI Global President Charlie LeBlanc told CNN .
He said the FBI is investigating the incident along with Mexican authorities .
Kidnappings and violence reached record levels in Mexico this year .
Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora said this month that organized - crime killings soared to 5,376 in 2008 , more than double the 2,477 deaths in Mexico in 2007 .
Mexican President Felipe Calderon met over the summer with the country 's 32 governors to unveil a plan to combat the nation 's staggering rise in kidnappings .
The plan includes building special prisons for kidnappers , bolstering the justice system , cleaning up corrupt police forces and clamping down on kidnapping tools such as prepaid cell phones and money - laundering .

Government fails to provide proof that the former attorney general was not pressured to change his initial opinion that 2003 invasion could be illegal
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
Fresh questions over the legality of the Iraq war were raised today after the government admitted it could not substantiate its claim that Lord Goldsmith had changed his mind over the legal basis for the invasion before a highly controversial meeting with two of Tony Blair 's closest allies .
The admission has revived allegations that the former attorney general was pressured to revise his opinion that an invasion could be illegal without an explicit UN resolution .
Opposition MPs have renewed calls for a full Iraq inquiry in light of the new information .
The revelation comes ahead of a ruling on whether the government should publish minutes of two prewar cabinet meetings at which Goldsmith 's advice was discussed .
Two weeks before the invasion , in March 2003 , Goldsmith gave Blair a detailed legal opinion that doubted its legality .
Six days later , on 13 March , Goldsmith met Lord Falconer , then a junior minister , and Sally ( now Lady ) Morgan from Blair 's office .
On 17 March , he published a single - page parliamentary answer , asserting that the war would be legal on the basis of existing UN resolutions .
In 2006 Richard Thomas , the information commissioner , ordered the government to disclose details of the process by which Goldsmith had come to his revised conclusion .
However , rather than requiring the publication of actual documents , Thomas allowed the government to publish a narrative account and include material that was not based on documentary evidence .
The Cabinet Office then issued a " disclosure statement " which claimed Goldsmith had informed his legal secretary of his new opinion before he met Morgan and Falconer .
But in response to a new freedom of information request , it has admitted it has " no information " to support this sequence of events .
The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman , Ed Davey , told the Guardian : " This latest revelation shows there is no evidence to back up government claims that Lord Goldsmith was not leant on by Blair 's inner circle before deciding the war would be legal .
" We may never know the full truth but , as the official version slowly unravels , the credibility of Goldsmith 's changed legal position is further called into question .
A full inquiry is our only hope that we can force the full truth out . "
The Tory shadow foreign secretary , William Hague , said : " It is surprising that the Cabinet Office is unable to supply further information on this matter .
" This adds yet further weight to the case for a proper privy council inquiry into the origins and conduct of the Iraq war . "
Last November , Lord Bingham , a former senior law lord , said Goldsmith 's view was " flawed " and called the invasion " a serious violation of international law and of the rule of law " .
Critics of the war have alleged that Goldsmith had been pressured by Blair 's allies to change his mind , which he has repeatedly denied .
The information tribunal is due to rule shortly on the government 's appeal against Thomas 's decision that it must publish the minutes of two cabinet meetings , on 13 and 17 March 2003 .
It emerged during the tribunal hearing in November that the minutes could prove there was insufficient cabinet discussion of the legality of the war .
The attorney general missed the first cabinet meeting , on the day that he reached his new conclusion , but attended the second , at which the cabinet was presented with his single - page view .
Most ministers were not shown Goldsmith 's original advice or told that he had expressed doubts on the issue .
The former minister Clare Short has claimed that she was prevented from asking Goldsmith why he had taken so long to provide an opinion and whether he had any doubts .
The Cabinet Office declined to comment further on the disclosure .
Zimbabwe 's so - called global political agreement , intended to achieve a coalition government between Morgan Tsvangirai and Robert Mugabe , was never worth the paper on which it was written .
Soon after the agreement was signed on 15 September last year , it became clear that it was not a matter of " if " but when it would all collapse .
Even as the two leaders delivered their speeches at the signing ceremony , the philosophies of Tsvangirai and Mugabe were like oil and water .
They simply cannot mix .
While the opposition leader , Mr Tsvangirai , was lucid on how Zimbabwe could pull back from the precipice , Mugabe did what he knows best : blaming Britain and everyone else except himself for all of Zimbabwe 's past and future problems .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
That the agreement has come down crashing before any attempt to implement it is not surprising .
What is more surprising is why Mr Tsvangirai ever lent his signature to such a flawed arrangement in the first place .
Having experienced President Mugabe 's crude tactics to keep him at bay over the years , Mr Tsvangirai ought to have known better .
Investing any trust in his ruthless adversary through an outline document was never a workable option .
Now Mr Tsvangirai has given Mr Mugabe what he wanted on a silver platter ; an excuse to blame the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) leader - at least in the eyes of regional African leaders - for the failures of the agreement .
It should have been obvious to Mr Tsvangirai that all his promises of adding flesh to the skeleton deal in a just and equitable way were not to be believed .
It should also have been obvious to the MDC leader that Mr Mugabe 's regional peers , who have stood by and watched while he destroys a once prosperous Zimbabwe , were never going to drop his support for him when the crunch time arrived .
The issues here are straightforward .
Mr Mugabe is a callous and heartless dictator who is prepared to cling to power at all costs .
He will never endorse a deal that effectively negotiates him out of power .
Having lost the elections in March and shamelessly defied the will of the people , Mr Mugabe has effectively closed down the democratic process of achieving change in Zimbabwe .
He thus is not going to be removed from power via democratic means .

Just two of the 19 dishes on the dinner menu at the G8 food shortages summit
As the food crisis began to bite , the rumblings of discontent grew louder .
Finally , after a day of discussing food shortages and soaring prices , the famished stomachs of the G8 leaders could bear it no longer .
The most powerful bellies in the world were last night compelled to stave off the great Hokkaido Hunger by fortifying themselves with an eight - course , 19 - dish dinner prepared by 25 chefs .
This multi-pronged attack was launched after earlier emergency lunch measures - four courses washed down with Château - Grillet 2005 - had failed to quell appetites enlarged by agonising over feeding the world 's poor .
The G8 gathering had been seen as a " world food shortages summit " as leaders sought to combat spiralling prices of basic foodstuffs in the developed world , and starvation in the developing world .
But not since Marie Antoinette was supposed to have leaned from a Versailles palace window and suggested that the breadless peasants eat cake can leaders have demonstrated such insensitivity to daily hardship than at the luxury Windsor hotel on the Japanese island of Hokkaido .
After discussing famine in Africa , the peckish politicians and five spouses took on four bite - sized amuse - bouche to tickle their palates .
The price of staple foods may be soaring , but thankfully caviar and sea urchin are within the purchasing power of leaders and their taxpayers - the amuse - bouche featured corn stuffed with caviar , smoked salmon and sea urchin , hot onion tart and winter lily bulb .
Guests at the summit , which is costing £ 238 m , were then able to pick items from a tray modelled on a fan and decorated with bamboo grasses , including diced fatty tuna fish , avocado and jellied soy sauce , and pickled conger eel with soy sauce .
Hairy crab Kegani bisque - style soup was another treat in a meal prepared by the Michelin - starred chef Katsuhiro Nakamura , the grand chef at Hotel Metropolitan Edmont in Tokyo , alongside salt - grilled bighand thornyhead ( a small , red Pacific fish ) with a vinegary water pepper sauce .
They have told their people to tighten their belts for lean times ahead , but you feared for presidential and prime ministerial girdles after the chance to tuck into further dishes including milk - fed lamb , roasted lamb with cepes , and black truffle with emulsion sauce .
Finally there was a " fantasy " dessert , a special cheese selection accompanied by lavender honey and caramelised nuts , while coffee came with candied fruits and vegetables .
Leaders cleverly skated around global water shortages by choosing from five different wines and liqueurs .
Earlier , the heads of state had restricted themselves to a light lunch of asparagus and truffle soup , crab and supreme of chicken served with nuts and beetroot foam , followed by a cheese selection , peach compote , milk ice - cream and coffee with petits fours .
Fresh from instructing his population to waste less food , it can only be hoped that Gordon Brown polished off every single morsel on his plate .
Andrew Mitchell , the shadow secretary of state for international development , said : " The G8 have made a bad start to their summit , with excessive cost and lavish consumption .
Surely it is not unreasonable for each leader to give a guarantee that they will stand by their solemn pledges of three years ago at Gleneagles to help the world 's poor .
All of us are watching , waiting and listening . "
The massive attack that has infected PCs by tricking users into clicking links in fake messages from CNN.com shows little sign of ending soon , security researchers say .
According to MX Logic Inc. , spam posing as CNN.com
Top 10 lists peaked at close to 11 million messages per hour early Thursday , but remained at high volumes throughout the day Friday .
The Colorado security vendor said it had been tracking an average of 8 million messages per hour since midnight .
MX Logic 's vice president of information security , Sam Masiello , called the trend " a very slow , but steady decline " from the 11 a.m. Mountain
Time peak the day before .
Masiello also said that the spam has changed since attacks were first launched on Tuesday .
" We 've also seen several morphs of this spam over the past couple of days , " he said in an entry posted on the MX Logic blog Friday .
Where the messages once trumpeted " CNN .com Daily Top 10 " in the subject heading and linked to a single filename on malware - hosting sites , now the spam sports a subject reading " CNN Alerts : My Custom Alert " and uses a variety of filenames in the malicious URL .
" This is likely in response to all of the media attention and awareness that has been brought up over the past couple of days , " Masiello speculated .
Also on Friday , Websense Inc. reported that its researchers had seen the attack mutating , with the spam subject heading not only touting " CNN Alerts : My Custom Alert , " but also using legitimate news stories culled from CNN to make the messages more convincing .
Users who clicked on the " FULL STORY " link in the message were redirected to a fake CNN site , where they were told they needed to download an update to Flash Player , Adobe System Inc. 's popular Internet media player , to view a video clip from CNN .
Websense also said it had spotted traces of the campaign in blog spam .
If users agreed to download the bogus Flash update , they were trapped in an endless loop , where clicking " Cancel " in the initial dialog produced a second pop-up .
Clicking " Cancel " there returned the user to the first pop-up .
The only options at that point were for users to shut down the browser or give in and install the malware .
MX Logic added that it had seen the URLs in the spam lead to legitimate domains that had probably been compromised , and named a U.K. - based roofing company as an example .
Earlier this week , Bulgarian security researcher Dancho Danchev had found more than 1,000 compromised domains being used to serve up the fake Flash .
In a follow - up e-mail , Danchev said that in most cases , he could n't find any characteristics shared by the hacked sites , such as all being hosted by a single Internet service provider .
" My assumption is that they took the time and effort to do some reconnaissance of sites which are vulnerable to remote file inclusion , or other type of remotely exploitable flaw within their Web applications that would allow someone to locally host all the malicious files , " Danchev said .
" I would n't be surprised if I find out that someone has basically went through all keylogged Cpanel passwords he obtained through his botnet , or through the access to a botnet that he temporarily rented . "
Cpanel , a popular server control panel program , has been targeted by password thieves in the past because of the access those passwords provide to sites .
This story , " Fake CNN Alert Still Spreading Malware " was originally published by Computerworld .
During the campaign there was a lot of talk about how this was the first election where the candidates had the option of taking full advantage of the internet , both to reach potential voters with their message and trade snarky comments on each others blogs .
It ’s safe to say the guy that won ( that one ) ran a more net - savvy campaign and I ’d like to think it contributed to his victory .
The idea that our next president is a Crackberry addicted , Mac using Spider - Man collector makes me feel like we have “ one of our own ” in the highest office .
I ’m not preaching … just enthusiastic .
He ’s also going to be the first President of the United States to appoint a Chief Technology Officer .
Here ’s hoping he stays away from Youtube commenters and 4 Chan members .
If you have an idea as to who it should be or what they should focus on , you can cast your vote ( sort of ) here .
I remember , as the economy began to implode , hearing the media recall Roosevelt ’s Fireside Chats and suggesting that someone ( W? ) should be communicating with the American people and reassuring them that their concerns were being addressed .
I thought , “ Obama should do a video blog !
That would allow him to keep us informed and show that he relates to us on a technological level !
Also it woud allow me to stare into his deep brown eyes while his dullcet tones gently bid me off to sleep ! ”
I guess he had the same idea .
I really hope he keeps it up .
ALSO A THING !:
Check out this forum post where a few Aussie Fancy Bastards weigh in on the potential castration of their nets .
Quite a few people think that - now that they are out of office - it is too late to try Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld , Gonzales and the rest of the boys for their crimes .
Even those who support prosecutions think it probably wo n't happen .
For example , Dave Lindorff wrote today :
The likelihood of their being indicted and brought to trial now that they have left office is exceedingly slim .
The truth , however , is that it is a much better time to prosecute the criminals then when they were in office .
Why ?
Because , as an attorney has previously pointed out :
It is unlikely that a court would allow high - level officials such as a sitting president or vice president to be tried until they leave office after the end of their designated term or through impeachment and removal .
This is because the constitutional " separation of powers " doctrine provides that one branch of government , such as the judiciary , cannot unduly interfere with the workings of another branch , such as the executive branch .
It is clear that , pursuant to federal statutes , a sitting president cannot be tried criminally , although it has not been decided whether the president can be indicted ( the first step in the criminal process ) while in office or whether the vice president has the same protections as the president .
Thus , even if a court did not dismiss a lawsuit outright on sovereign immunity grounds , it would almost certainly stay ( i.e. pause ) any lawsuit against the president and vice president .

With all the doom and gloom of the past few months and all signs pointing to hard times ahead , I ’ve been thinking back to earlier in the decade , during the dotcom bust .
I was at Live365 , the Internet radio network , and we had burned through millions of dollars with no appreciable revenues nor a business model .
Our CEO / founder had left , and I found myself promoted to the management team well short of my 30th birthday and with no management experience to speak of .
Our investors , having lost faith in the prior management team , had the Company on a very tight leash .
So tight that we depended on a wire transfer every two weeks to meet payroll and other obligations .
At one point , our ISP shut us off , and we had no Internet access at the office .
I had to get an employee to drive a check over so that they would turn us back on .
Even worse , our site went down when the people we bought bandwidth from got shut off themselves .
It was n’t our fault , but we were still down , and the worst part was that we did n’t have enough cash to migrate to another bandwidth provider .
I ’ll never forget one of our employees offering to make the Company a personal loan .
I could n’t accept it because I was n’t sure if we ’d be able to pay him back .
Amazingly , our users did n’t give up on us .
They set up alternate forums to discuss what was going on , sent pizza to our offices and , most importantly , gave us moral support .
I wo n’t go through the litany of hardship we faced but , suffice to say we almost went under a few times .
We were able to survive through sheer will , the dedication of our employees and users and a lot of luck .
There were so many lessons learned , but , in particular :
1 . Be as transparent with your employees and other stakeholders as you can be .
At one point , we had to tell everyone in the company that coming to work was optional and that the next payroll was in doubt because of our cash issues .
Even though it was bad news , they appreciated the transparency .
In hindsight , I would have been much more communicative than I had been .
2. Cultivate a trusted adviser or mentor outside of the workplace .
I think people should do this anyway but it helped me a great deal to have someone I could talk to about the issues I was facing and dispassionately help me evaluate the scenarios and available options .
3 . Remember whom you work for and where your fiduciary duties lie .
Yes , you ultimately work for yourself .
But , as a founder or management team member , you may have fiduciary duties to shareholders , both common and preferred , to employees , creditors and customers .
Their interests can diverge even in the best of times and especially so when things start going pear - shaped .
I made some painful decisions that ruined a friendship but were for the ultimate good of the company and satisfied my fiduciary and ethical obligations — and , to reiterate No. 2 above , I ’m glad I had a trusted adviser to help me make sense of things during such an emotionally fraught period .
4. Accelerate non-advertising revenue models .
This is a more practical recommendation .
Even if your usage and advertising metrics are growing nicely , now is the time to accelerate development of non ad - based models and prioritize the other revenue streams more highly .
Your investors and poptential investors and acquirers will appreciate this .
Not only that but they are likely to discount your ad - based revenues anyway , so any momentum you can show outside of ads will bolster your story .
5 . What does n’t kill you will only make you stronger .
Easy to say , hard to live through .
But just keep telling yourself this when things really , really suck .
6. Pray !
Seriously , luck plays a big role .
Do whatever you can to make your own luck .
While it ’s going to be a bumpy road ahead that will involve a lot of pain for many people , I think it actually will be better this time around :
The Internet , the web and mobile are real media with real users , real revenues and real business models .
Add to that the fact that it ’s orders of magnitude cheaper to develop and go - to - market than it was then , and I do n’t think the downturn in our general field will be as drastic as it was back in the day .

All those involved , and most of those following the bloodshed in Gaza from afar , are sure who is in the right and who is in the wrong .
They know who the innocent victims are and who are the wicked perpetrators .
These certainties are held equally firmly by those who will be demonstrating in solidarity with the Palestinians in London today and those who plan to stage similar shows of support for Israel later this month .
Both sides see the conflict in moral terms .
For supporters of the Palestinians , it could not be clearer .
Israel is committing a war crime , killing people in their hundreds , hammering a besieged population from the sky ( and soon perhaps on the ground too ) , claiming to aim only at Hamas but inevitably striking those civilians who get in the way .
Israel 's cheerleaders are just as clear .
Israel is the victim , hitting out now only belatedly and in self - defence .
Its southern citizens have sat terrorised in bomb shelters , fearing the random rockets of Hamas , since 2005 , longer than any society could tolerate without fighting back .
Both sides say they would have maintained the six - month ceasefire that had held - albeit imperfectly - until December 19 had the other side not broken it first .
And who did break the deal first , Hamas with its rockets or Israel with its blockade ?
Both sides point at the other with equal vehemence , a Newtonian chain of claimed action and reaction that can stretch back to infinity .
So perhaps a more useful exercise - especially for those who long for an eventual peace with both sides living side by side - is not to ask whether the current action is legitimate , but whether it is wise .
Israel , say its spokesmen , seeks not to trigger an Iraq - style " regime change " in Gaza but simply to alter Hamas ' calculus , so it concludes that hurling rockets is against its own interests .
Israel hopes thereby to reassert its long - cherished deterrence , so damaged in Lebanon in 2006 .
Hamas will be taught a lesson , abide by an enduring ceasefire and leave Israel 's southern border quiet .
Israel can then get on with pursuing a pact with the Fatah - led Palestinians of the West Bank .
That sounds coherent , but does it make sense ?
After this first phase of the conflict , Israeli officials say yes .
They boast that Hamas ' command and control systems have been shattered , and that its leaders are in hiding 4 m under ground .
But there are immediate questions , eerily similar to the ones that surfaced in Lebanon two years ago .
How exactly does this end ?
If Israeli tanks go into Gaza , wo n't they get bogged down in the mud and narrow streets of the refugee camps , terrain known intimately by Hamas ?
And these are only the most obvious , current concerns .
The grounds for questioning the wisdom of Operation Cast Lead , even from Israel 's own point of view , go much deeper .
First , even if Israel gets the quiet it wants there is every reason to believe it could have got that without resorting to war .
The longtime Palestinian analyst and negotiator Hussein Agha says it would have been " straightforward : if they had lifted the blockade , the rockets would have stopped " .
Some diplomatic sources dispute this , arguing that Hamas actually saw an advantage in the sanctions regime : " opening up would have loosened Hamas ' grip , " says one .
Hence the cases of Hamas firing on border crossings as they were opened .
But most Palestinians insist that a relaxation of the blockade would have granted Hamas its key objective - a chance to prove it can govern effectively - and it would not have jeopardised that with rocket fire .
It would have had too much to lose .
Put that to Israelis , and they admit that prospect was unpalatable too : they can't allow Hamas , a movement whose charter drips with antisemitism and calls for Israel 's eradication , to gain the appearance of legitimacy .
But if , as Israel insists , its chief objective is quiet in the south , then there was at least another , non-military path it could have taken - one that those who know Hamas best insist would have stopped the Qassams .
Besides , any ceasefire will involve easing the blockade , so Israel will end up making those concessions anyway .
Second , if Israel hoped to break Hamas ' hold on Gaza it has gone precisely the wrong way about it .
Its leaders have done this many times before , repeatedly misreading the way Arab societies work .
They believe that if they hit Gaza ( or Lebanon ) hard enough , the local population will blame Hamas ( or Hezbollah ) for bringing tragedy upon them .
But it does n't work like that .
Instead , Gazans blame Israel - and close ranks with Hamas .
" Anything which does n't kill Hamas makes them stronger , " says Agha , noting the way the organisation has been lionised in recent days across the Arab world , hailed as a defiant party of resistance , turning it into a " regional phenomenon " .
Third , Israel 's best hopes lie with the so - called moderate Arab leaders .
But they have been badly undermined by this exercise , and none more so than the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , whose peace talks with Israel now look like consorting with a brutal enemy .
And this is without mentioning the fresh supply of hatred Israel has stored up against itself , creating a new generation of Gazans bent on revenge .
Every child who witnessed this week 's bombing is another recruit for the violence of the future .
So , yes , there may be short - term advantage for Israel 's politicians , eyeing the election calendar , in hitting Hamas hard .
But the senior European official who told me that this is " tactics , not strategy by the Israelis , who are expert in dealing with symptoms , not causes " is surely right .
This is the act of a nation that has plenty of tactics for war - but no strategy for peace .
If it did , it would realise that Israel cannot pick the Palestinians ' leaders for them , that Hamas - however repulsive its charter - is part of the Palestinian reality and will eventually have to be accommodated .
Such a peace strategy would see a decision to withdraw from almost all of the West Bank and end settlement expansion , thereby making Abbas - and the peace process - credible in the eyes of his own people .
But there is no such peace strategy , only an Israeli leadership so dazzled by its own military might that it has come to believe that force is almost always the answer - and the way to avoid the toughest questions .

At the start of 2008 , Anna Sam , was part of a legion of 170,000 French women who are , in her words , “ omnipresent but invisible ” .
She was a “ beepeuse ” ( a woman who beeps ) or , more officially , a “ hôtesse de caisse ” ( till - hostess ) .
In other words , she was a supermarket check - out girl .
In January , Mme Sam , 29 , began to write about her experiences , first in a blog , then in a book .
She told of life behind the till and the conveyor belt - “ one of the most desirable vantage points from which to enjoy the full panoply of human idiocy ” .
Almost a year later , the invisible woman is not only omnipresent but inescapable .
She has become a best - selling author , with more than 100,000 sales , and a triumphantly successful blogger , with more than 1,000,000 visits to her site ( caissierenofutur.over-blog.com ) .
Her advice on the life of shop - workers is sought by politicians and supermarket chains .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Her book - “ Les Tribulations d'une Caissière ” ( The tribulations of a check - out girl ) - is about to be translated into several languages .
There are projects to turn Mme Sam 's life - literature - student - turned “ beepeuse ” - turned - author - into a comic - book , a play and a film .
The young Breton attributes her success to a turning away from a stifling obsession with celebrities towards a refreshing interest in the humour - and heroism - of everyday lives .
“ I talk about things as they really are , without exaggeration or aggression , ” she said .
“ My popularity shows that society is changing more rapidly than we think . ”
The success of Anna Sam 's book follows in the tradition of other , surprising , runaway triumphs in France in recent years , such as the movies “ Amélie Poulain ” ( 2001 ) and “ Bienvenue chez Les Ch'tis ” ( 2008 ) .
All three are pleasantly humorous portraits of the lives of ordinary people .
Mme Sam is still determined to extract light - hearted revenge from the thousands of customers who ignored , or insulted her , during her eight years behind the tills of a suburban supermarket in Rennes .
“ ( My book ) is so easy to read that even supermarket customers can read it , ” she says .
With malicious but gentle wit , she lists the different categories of “ typical ” customers .
There are those who have their noses impatiently pressed to the sliding door 30 minutes before opening - time .
There are those who are discovered ambling behind their trolley ten minutes after the doors have closed .
There are the boastful ones , whose trolley contains nothing but extra-size condoms .
There are the pathologically bashful ones , who go to extreme lengths to hide toilet paper beneath other items in their trolleys .
( If the bar - code happens not to be working , the “ beepeuse ” takes a malicious pleasure in broadcasting to the whole supermarket a request for the price of “ an extra - large packet of pink , double - ply toilet paper ” . )
There are also the queue - jumpers , the kleptomaniacs ( CDs hidden in camemberts are common in France , apparently ) and the obsessive bargain - hunters .
There is the orderly young man who places his shopping neatly on the conveyor belt , followed by a piece of snot picked from his nose .
There are the customers who keep their money in their socks or their bras .

And then there are the customers who carry on conversations on their mobile telephones while failing to say “ bonjour ” to the invisible “ beepeuse ” .
“ But I 'm already at the till !
Why did n't you tell me that you wanted bananas …
You want to go out tonight ?
But have you stopped throwing up yet ?
I am sure you have the gastro .
I hope you have n't given it to me .
I do n't want to spend the whole night on the toilet … ”
Mme Sam has a special hatred for the male customers who used to ask her “ vous - êtes ouverte ? ” - meaning “ are you open ? ” but also “ are you available ? ” “ I am not but my till is , ” she would primly reply .
Supermarkets can be erotic places , it seems ( French supermarkets at any rate ) .
Mme Sam writes : “ You would be astonished by the amount of kisses stolen in the aisles ( even in the toilet paper department ) , the langorous looks exchanged between the charcuterie and fish counters , the bottoms and breasts felt in the frozen food department … ”
Mme Sam is especially poignant , however , on the fate of the “ beepeuses ” themselves , trapped behind their tills , unable to escape easily for a breather , or a coffee , or even a pee .
A check - out girl , Mme Sam calculates , says “ bonjour ” 250 times a day , “ merci ” 500 times a day and “ have you got a frequent customer card ” 200 times .
She ( and very occasionally in France , he ) beeps 20 items a minute and lifts 800 kilos an hour for a monthly salary of € 850 .
Mme Sam says that , in becoming an author , she looked forward to having more spare time , especially at weekends .
Now , she says , she is in so much demand that she “ has plenty of time but not a minute to myself . ”

Shepard Smith has a face made for television , a face seemingly created not just for the cameras but by them , a brand - name face that could be made into a mask and worn on Halloween .
It 's extreme , without being irregular ; indeed , its extremity lies in its action - figure regularity , its plane - sawed proportions .
Well , that and his eyes .
His eyes are points of interest , both on television and in person .
They look done , if you want to know the truth .
He is the proverbial journalist who goes through life with a raised eyebrow , not out of temperament but rather because he can't get the damned thing down .
His right eyebrow is steeply and permanently peaked , like a tattoo of skeptical interest .
And his eyes themselves ... well , you meet him and you do n't even register what color they are .
You register their shine .
No matter what the light , he is the one guy in the room whose eyes always catch it and return it with a mineral gleam .
And yet his face is not nearly as recognizable as his voice .
It 's not simply that he has great pipes , mellowed by the cigarettes he smokes outside the building before and after most of his newscasts .
It 's that ... well , listen to him as he tapes , in advance , the lead - in to his 3:00 P.M. show , Studio B .
He 's in someplace called the tracking room , which is closet - sized , with the acoustics of the inside of a drum .
There 's a script waiting for him by the microphone , and as soon as he sits down , he begins to read it .
But he does n't read the way most people read .
He reads the way opera singers sing , in a voice whose sudden contrivance is matched only by its sudden force .
He reads loud , in a great baritone honk .
He reads insinuatingly .
He reads with rhythm , he reads with speed , he reads with irony and skepticism and vehemence and maybe a little menace : " It 's being called a political crime spree .
The governor of Illinois arrested on federal corruption charges ... " Yes , it 's Day One for Blago .
The Rod Blagojevich story has just broken , and all over the airwaves , professional newsreaders are reading the sordid details with a certain degree of relish .
But Shep Smith is the only one who sounds like this , the only one whose voice is instantly recognizable , maybe not as the voice of a man but as the voice of an institution .
Inside the institution , by his own insistence , his voice is the voice of " straight news . "
Outside the institution , however , his voice is the voice of Fox News , and that 's something else entirely .
Shep Smith is standing on his desk .
He looks dignified , for a man standing on his desk — he is wearing a dark - blue suit with a windowpane pattern , a silvery pale - blue tie whose knot he continually tends to , and square - toed black shoes — but , as Tom Cruise discovered , there is only so much dignity a man standing on furniture can possess .
Fortunately , the desk is made to be stood upon .
It 's not your typical desk , made out of wood .
It 's a Fox desk — a desk commissioned by Fox News — and so it 's a maximalist desk , in both conception and design .
It 's made out of a clear slab of Lucite laid atop a piece of burnished metal .
And it connects to a set of Lucite steps , which connect in turn to a Lucite catwalk suspended from the ceiling .
After Shep stands on his desk , he will stand on the catwalk .
There he will not dance , although the catwalk itself seems filched from a South Beach disco .
There he will look into the camera and deliver the news .
Steve Fenn
Welcome to Shep Smith 's new home , on the twelfth floor of the News Corp. building , which is Fox News 's headquarters in midtown Manhattan .
Welcome to what Shep has christened " Studio 12 H " and what his colleague , the Sunday news anchor Chris Wallace , calls " Shep 's Playroom . "
It 's a Wednesday afternoon in December .
It 's Blago , Day Two .
And in a few minutes , Shep is going to complete this last impromptu rehearsal before going live with the first broadcast of his seven o'clock news show , the Fox Report , in HD .
The broadcast is a big deal for Shep and his team of nearly fifty producers , directors , engineers , writers , and cameramen — so big that they sometimes call it the Launch , until they remember that in Fox News nomenclature the only Launch is the launch of the network itself , on October 7 , 1996 , and they go back to calling it the Move .
Still , it 's a big deal , not only because of the technical issues involved but because this broadcast of the Fox Report really is a launch , both for Shep and for Fox News .
Shep Smith has been with Fox News from the beginning , when it started as an oppositional force in American journalism .
Now forty - five years old , he has been anchoring the Fox Report —
Fox 's answer to the evening news shows of the three traditional broadcast networks — since 1999 and has seen
Fox transform itself from the enemy to the intimidating arm of the party in power .
At the end of 2007 , he signed a new three - year deal with Fox for a reported $ 7.5 million a year .
He has always managed to be a part of Fox and apart from it at the same time , and in 2008 he distinguished himself by treating Republicans as aggressively as Fox News normally treats Democrats — by seeming fed up with Republicans , and maybe with the strictures of Fox News itself .
Now , in 2009 , people are asking what 's up with Shep Smith as a way of asking what 's up with Fox — as way of asking how Fox is going to cover the news as it goes back to its oppositional role in the age of Obama .
In some way , then , Studio 12H , Shep 's Playroom , is an answer .
How 's
Fox going to cover the news ?
Here 's how : with a studio that inspires
Shep to say , " Hey , we 're not laying people off at Fox — we 're getting new $ 4 million studios !
Life is good ! "
With a studio that 's not just built for Shep but around him — around his particular talents .
" There are a lot of people who would n't step into that studio , " says his producer , Kim Rosenberg , the point being that Shep would .
Shep likes to move , so Shep 's Playroom is so big that while he 's ascending the steps to the catwalk , his stage manager is inspired to sing , " Oh , I hope those knees are ready , because there 's gonna be a lot of walking around tuh - day . "
Shep likes to do a lot of things at once , so Shep 's Playroom is as hyperactive as a video - game arcade , with a wall of LED screens that Shep calls the " LSD wall . "
Shep likes technology , so in the middle of Shep 's Playroom squats an enormous piece of brutalist sculpture called The Cube , emphasis on the definite article , because The Cube was also commissioned by Fox , and there 's not another in all of television news .
The Cube is huge and multiscreened and it throbs with lurid colors and Fox 's trademark WWF graphics , and Shep is supposed to interact with it , as if it were a kind of coanchor .
The only problem is that it dwarfs him .
Indeed , the whole place does .
Shep Smith is not a little person .
He 's at least six feet tall .
But Shep 's Playroom dwarfs
Shep , and the last move he rehearses before going live calls for him to stand on a little box while facing the camera , like Alan Ladd in Shane .
Nigel Parry
It 's absurd , of course .
The whole thing — the little box , The Cube , Shep 's Playroom , Fox News , television news in general — is absurd , and what has always distinguished Shep , and by extension Fox , is that he seems to know it .
He is such a creature of television that he is able to parody television , both on and off camera .
Because he 's always the anchorman , he 's never the anchorman — indeed , Fox executives call him the " antianchor " — and now , to loosen up his team , he uses his booming anchor voice to comment on the live Fox News feed that 's appearing on the monitors and screens all around Shep 's Playroom .
" Hey , " he says to a reporter who can't hear him , " you look freaky tonight .
Old ... dying ... but still handsome and debonair .
With a hot girlfriend .
Is n't that right ?
You have a hot girlfriend , do n't you ... ? "
Then he begins his shout - outs to the people around him .
" What 's up , Steve - O ? Levo !
What up , thug ?
Big Mac , looking great , man ! "
And when two sheepish , techie - looking Fox employees are pulled into Shep 's Playroom so that the two chairs attached to keyboard - workstations in the back are occupied during the newscast , Shep looks up and says , " Good — sitters !
Hel - lo !
It 's exciting , is n't it ... ? "
It is like this all the time with Shep .
Although he is arguably the least known of Fox 's foundational talents , he knows everybody at Fox , and everybody knows him .
Indeed , if you followed Shep with a Steadicam through the halls of Fox , you could get a tracking shot like the one Scorsese got of Ray Liotta 's Henry Hill walking through the kitchen at the Copa .
The handshakes , and what he calls the " cutting up " — these are part of his job , as prescribed by the impresario himself , Roger Ailes .
Happiness is part of his job .
" ' Unhappy people make happy people unhappy ' is something Roger drills into us , " he says .
" That and ' Remember , you could be selling shoes . ' "
And so now , when his stage manager — a woman dressed in a heavy quilted parka because Shep likes his studio cold — begins to call out the amount of time left before the Fox Report HD goes live , not only does Shep begin reading aloud and editing the stylized blank verse of his script , not only does he take a compact and pat his face with the pancake one last time , not only does he read ( aloud — he always reads everything aloud , except for stuff he reads off his BlackBerry ) various streams of news and information off the Internet ; he also whistles the tune of an old Perry Como novelty hit from the fifties , and then , with less than twenty seconds to go , he says , " Thanks , y'all .
Well done , everyone .
I do n't know how you did it , but you did .
Whatever happens now does n't matter .
The facts are all right . "
Then he buttons his suit jacket , pushes the knot of his tie back to his throat , and gets out of his chair .
The old idea of the godlike anchor dispensing facts from the unquestioned authority of the anchor 's desk : " That 's dead , thankfully , " he says , and he knows , because he helped kill it .
There is an anchor 's desk in Shep 's studio , but it 's made of Lucite now , and once again , he climbs on top of it .
" From our new home in Studio 12H in New York , this is Fox Report HD , " he intones , and it 's the note that he hits on " HD " — that Foxian note , ironic and confidential and insinuating , carried off by a sudden virtuosic modulation in volume — that reminds you that no , Shep Smith might not be Fox News .
But Fox News is definitely Shep Smith .

He 's always been a sport .
There are several Shep Smith Creation Myths circulating around Fox — several stories of how Fox brass came to see that he was Their Guy — and what they all have in common is his willingness to do what needed to be done , without standing on ceremony .
For John Moody , executive vice - president of news , it was the time when Roger Ailes — Moody 's boss and the president and architect of Fox News — looked up at a television and saw footage of O. J. Simpson 's civil trial and said , " You know , just once I 'd like to hear some reporter have the guts to say that he 's here at the O. J. Simpson trial , where there 's nothing going on and nothing happened today . "
Moody : " I called Shepard in L. A. , which is where he was at the time .
I said , ' Let 's think about this . '
He said , ' I got it . '
I said , ' Well . . .'
And he said , ' No , I got it . '
It was the kind of thing where he was on the air before I finished my sentence .
And Shepard just did this dry , absolutely dead - on thing where he said , ' There 's nothing going on at the O. J. trial today .
If something happens , we 'll let you know about it .
But for now , this is Shepard Smith in Los Angeles , at the O. J. trial , where nothing 's happening . '
That 's when you knew , that 's when you went , ' Oh yeah , oh yeah . . . .' "
" Shepard is in Fox News 's DNA . "
The Shepard Smith Creation Myths are important because they are Fox News 's Creation Myths as well .
Like Shep , Roger Ailes and John Moody and Sharri Berg , the senior VP of news , have all been at Fox News since even before the Launch , and like Shep , they all have managed to preserve the original conception of Fox as a besieged but sprightly upstart , even through nearly ten years of success and dominance .
" Shepard is in Fox News 's DNA , " Berg says , and though it might sound clichéd , it 's actually quite precise , for the story told by Shep Smith — Mississippi cotton merchant 's son who wanted to work in TV ever since he saw the cosmopolitan horde of correspondents descend on nearby Memphis for Elvis 's funeral ; who grew up very conscious that he lived in flyover country and that the three New York — based networks were n't likely to tell the story of people like him ; who saw the ups and downs of a cotton merchant 's life and as a result says , " Working for the Man seemed really good to me " ; who quit the University of Mississippi to work for local news stations in Florida , and then quit local news to work with Berg at Fox 's tabloid news show , A Current Affair ; who , when A Current Affair went off the air , came to work for Fox in New York ; and who now lives in a loft in Greenwich Village , summers in the Hamptons , and flies most weekends in the fall to his house in Oxford , Mississippi , so that he can take his father to Ole Miss home games — is the Fox story , writ small .
Fox
News really is different from its competitors , not just for the way it treats ideology but for the way it treats television .
Its DNA — like Shep Smith 's DNA — is rooted in local news , in tabloid news , in rebels who like working for the Man , in anchors and executives who have been number one year after year and are still so aware of where they came from that they can keep a straight face when they , like Sharri Berg , claim , " We are the underdog . "
Is it fair to say that another distinguishing characteristic of people like Ailes and Moody and Berg and , yes , Shep is that they can also keep a straight face when they insist that ideology has nothing to do with what is reported on news programs like Shep 's 7:00 P.M. Fox Report ?
Is it balanced to say that one of their talents consists of being able to state that " Fair and Balanced is more than a slogan " without cracking up ?
No , it 's not — because , in Shep 's case , anyway , that would suggest a level of cynicism and calculation that neither he nor his immediate colleagues seem to possess .
Shep , of course , has the distinction of being the Left 's favorite Fox News personality .
Yet to those who suspect that " something 's going on " at Fox — Shep Smith 's using his show to audition for a job at MSNBC !
Fox is putting a peppy liberal - conservative hybrid on its showroom floor so that it can keep on selling its gas - guzzling O'Reillys and Hannitys ! —
Shep offers the placidly passionate rejoinder that the only thing going on at Fox is what 's been going on since he joined the network in 1996 .
" There has to be news at a place called Fox News , " he says , and he 's not the only one .
It 's the mantra of the network , the fallback equation that — until the recent entrance of Glenn Beck , anyway — has enabled its employees to distinguish between the programming that takes place between nine in the morning and eight at night , which is called News , and the programming that takes over thereafter , which is called Opinion .
" I think we do a pretty good job of labeling it for the viewer , " Shep says .
" But we are under intense scrutiny because of our opinion shows .
Are there people who want the news done a certain way ?
You bet there are , and some are in this building .
But they do n't affect what I do .
The inner pressure and outer pressure that everyone thinks exists does n't .
When I hear people say that Fox News is right wing , I know that 's not true , because I 'm the one doing the news .
It 's my show , and there 's no place for opinion on my show .
It 's uninteresting to me .
I do n't care what Sean Hannity thinks and I do n't care what Alan Colmes thinks and I guarantee they do n't care what I think and they do n't know , either .
You know what 's interesting to me ?
What 's interesting to me is that the thing people want to know about is the part on which I spend absolutely no time . "
Of course , it 's more complicated than that , because at Fox the opinion side very often drives the news side — think of Hannity keeping alive William Ayers as a news story as if by force of truculent will ; think of O'Reilly plugging the " War on Christmas " until it became a crossover hit that wound up in the news rotation .
In general , though , he does spend very little time trafficking in matters of ideology or political partisanship , and that 's because he spends most of his time exactly how he prefers to spend it : " processing information . "
It sounds like such a bland , modest , almost technocratic way to make a living .
It 's not , because it 's where Fox takes ownership of the news .
The network has never been just about ideology ; it has also been about technology , which is where it has made its ideology stick , where it has earned ideology its style points .
And Shep has been part of that .
That screen ?
That infernal Fox screen ?
That " green screen , " as the Fox people call it , or the Screen with a Lot of Shit Going On on It , as it 's known in popular parlance ?
That 's Shep's .
He pioneered its use on the Fox Report .
More important , that 's Shep himself .
Shep not only believed , before just about anyone else did , that the linear , orderly style of the 6:30 newscast was as dead as the godly anchor ; he was also able to handle an emphatically nonlinear way of storytelling .
" We push as much stuff — as much video , as much information — on the screen as we can , " says Fox 's news director , Jay Wallace , who started out as one of Shep 's writers .
" The thing about Shep is that he can look at that screen for twelve seconds and tell you what 's going on in any one of those boxes .
And then he can sell it to the viewer in about a second . "
And so the funny thing about Fox News is that it 's almost a disappointment to visit it , especially if you 're of the belief that it's a nefarious force in American life , a greedy beast from whose adamantine jaws the presidency itself had to be wrested .
The people are so nice .
They 're so accommodating .
They work so hard .
It 's almost a Shangri-la of gainful employment , with everybody feeling remunerated and appreciated .
The only thing that distinguishes it from other news organizations is that the freebie books scattered on desks and countertops all call for a return to the gold standard , and there are a lot of sexy girls running around in tight sweaters , seamed stockings , and black high heels .
It 's not an angry place so much as it is a happy place notable for its angry prime - time hosts .
It 's Shep Smith 's place , in other words , more than it is Sean Hannity 's — but the fact that Shep 's a nice guy does n't mean that its jaws are any less adamantine or any more inclined to loosen their grip .

" Why is this happening ? "
Shep asks one afternoon , a few minutes before his three o'clock show , Studio B , goes on air .
It 's a seemingly aimless question , inspired by some technical trouble but spoken to no one in particular , and yet it gets an instant response from one of the technicians .
" Because they hate us and want us to fail , " the technician says .
" Exactly , " Shep says , and then repeats the sentence with his dramatic , self - mocking newscaster 's chops .
" Because they hate us ... and want us ... to fail . "
This is Shep 's slogan .
All anchors are supposed to have a slogan , right ?
They become famous for their slogans — for the same words spoken the same way , night after night — from " Hear now the news " to " Courage . "
Shep has never found the magic incantation that would preserve his name for posterity .
There 's so much going on in his broadcasts that he never seems to get the opportunity to go all oracular on us .
Besides ,
Fox already has its famous slogans trademarked for the purpose of viewer inculcation , and so it 's very much in keeping with the function Shep performs at the network that he 's kept his best slogan for internal use only .
Spend any time on the set with Shep and you 'll hear members of Team Shep , with the barest prompting , chiming in cheerfully that the world hates them and wants them to fail .
And so , once again , Shep is representative of his employer , this time in his happy sense of grievance .
He , like Fox News in general , enjoys a position of long - term dominance in the cable - news market ; the Fox Report gets as many viewers as his competitors on CNN and MSNBC combined ( though not nearly as many as even the lowest - rated network newscast ) .
At the same time , he , like Fox News in general — hell , like the conservative movement in general — has a sense of himself as a warrior battling against entrenched interests that do n't even deign to take him seriously .
Forget " Fair and Balanced " ; forget " We Report , You Decide . "
Fox should chuck both of them and go with " Because They Hate Us and Want Us to Fail " as its public rallying cry .
It so perfectly expresses the network 's ethos that surely Roger Ailes himself must have had a hand in coining it ... but according to Shep , he learned it from his ninth - grade Spanish teacher in Holly Springs , Mississippi , who offered it as an answer when Shep asked why Spanish was so hard .
Today he is failing .
Today is Blago , Day Two , and the machine that allows
Shep to communicate with his line producer in the Studio B control room is broken .
Except that Shep does n't know it , so he keeps trying to speak to the control room after he misidentifies a photograph of a youngish African - American man standing next to Rod Blagojevich as Jesse Jackson Jr. But fortunately , there is something that gets him out of it .
And that 's — as is always the case — the news itself .
There is some footage that Fox has acquired .
It 's from Virginia .
It involves an 18 - wheeler .
The 18 - wheeler is as white as O. J.'s SUV , and it's on the run .
Cops are chasing it .
It 's not just another car chase — it 's a truck chase .
And nobody likes a good chase as much as Shep Smith does .
Shep is part of Fox News 's DNA ?
Well , car chases are part of Shep's .
Around
Fox he is noted for his ability to " squeeze every ounce of news , every ounce of suspense , every ounce of drama out of a basic car chase , " in the words of John Moody .
Or , in the words of Shep himself : " I much enjoy them . "
How much ?
Well , on this afternoon the rogue 18 - wheeler preempts the planned Studio B contribution of entertainment reporter Jill Dobson ( or , as Shep calls her upon her entrance to the set , " Dobs ! " ) , one of the Fox blonds , bounteous in a pink sweater .
And then , later , at seven o'clock , when Shep is doing the last broadcast of the Fox Report from his old , non -HD studio , there is a second chase , this one involving a service truck just as O. J.-ishly white as the 18 - wheeler , and Dobs is preempted again as Shep stays with the footage from L. A. in the hopes of getting to the pit move .
This article appeared in the March 2009 issue of Esquire . .
The pit move is the climactic moment of any car chase , the moment when the cops ram the fugitive 's bumper , the fugitive skids out and is summarily taken to the hoosegow .
Justice is served .
On this broadcast , however , the cops keep trying the pit move , but the service truck is too big , and it does n't give .
So the next night , when Shep is at the end of his first broadcast from the garish fantasia of Studio 12H , he asks his viewers if they remember the car chase from the night before and promises , as the last teaser before the last break , " The ending you did not see ... is next . "
The pit move !
Shep 's going to deliver the pit move because he promised the pit move , and because the pit move is good TV .
Say this about Fox :
They might not do the news better .
They certainly do n't do journalism better .
But they do television better , or faster , or at least more shamelessly , or at least more enthusiastically , and that translates to : better .
And so now Shep is once again standing on his anchor 's desk , and The Cube is lighting up with tinged footage of the cops executing the pit move , except that this time they succeed , and as Shep says , " now our wannabe Burt Reynolds is cooling his heels ... in jail .
And now you know the news , in HD . "
Hey , that was a slogan of sorts , was n't it ?
But once again
Shep can't quite let it go at that , because he 's Shep Smith and he's on Fox News and he functions not just as the evening news anchor but also as the lead - in to the No Spin Zone .
He has to say something about the man who follows him , and what he says amounts to a slogan in its own right : " And if you do n't get HD , call O'Reilly .
He can fix anything . "

Abraham Lincoln's First Inauguration
I am loth ( sic ) to close .
We are not enemies , but friends .
We must not be enemies .
Though passion may have strained , it must not break our bonds of affection .
The mystic chords of memory , stretching from every battle - field , and patriot grave , to every living heart and hearthstone , all over this broad land , will yet swell the chorus of the Union , when again touched , as surely they will be , by the better angels of our nature .

In a recent Joel on Software forum post Thinking of Leaving the Industry , one programmer wonders if software development is the right career choice in the face of broad economic uncertainty :
After reading the disgruntled posts here from long time programmers and hearing so much about ageism and outsourcing , I 'm thinking of leaving the industry .
What is a good industry to get into where your programming skills would put you at an advantage ?
Joel Spolsky responded :
Although the tech industry is not immune , programming jobs are not really being impacted .
Yes , there are fewer openings , but there are still openings ( see my job board for evidence ) .
I still have n't met a great programmer who does n't have a job .
I still can't fill all the openings at my company .
Our pay is great .
There 's no other career except Wall Street that regularly pays kids $ 75,000 right out of school , and where so many people make six figures salaries for long careers with just a bachelors degree .
There 's no other career where you come to work every day and get to invent , design , and engineer the way the future will work .
Despite the occasional idiot bosses and workplaces that forbid you from putting up Dilbert cartoons on your cubicle walls , there 's no other industry where workers are treated so well .
Jesus you 're spoiled , people .
Do you know how many people in America go to jobs where you need permission to go to the bathroom ?
Stop the whining , already .
Programming is a fantastic career .
Most programmers would love to do it even if they did n't get paid .
How many people get to do what they love and get paid for it ?
2 % ? 5 % ?
I tend to agree with Joel 's brand of tough love .
What he seems to be saying -- after taking my usual poetic license -- is this :
Programming : love it or leave it .
Unless you 're fortunate enough to work for a top tier software development company , like Google , Microsoft , or Apple , you 've probably experienced first hand the huge skill disparities in your fellow programmers .
I 'm betting you 've also wondered more than once why some of your coworkers can't , well , program .
Even if that 's what their job description says .
Over the last twenty years , I 've worked with far too many programmers who honestly had no business being paid to be a programmer .
Now , I 'm not talking about your average programmer here .
We 're all human , and we all make mistakes .
I 'm talking about the Daily WTF crew .
People that actively give programming a bad name , and you , as their coworker , a constant headache .
Like Joel , I 'm not ready to call the current conditions a new dot com bubble yet , because business is still quite good .
But one of the ( very ) few bright spots of the previous bubble was that it weeded out all the people who did n't truly love software development .
Once the incentive to become an overnight dot - com genius programmer millionaire was gone , computer science enrollment suddenly dropped precipitously at colleges across the country .
The only people left applying for programming jobs were the true freaks and geeks who , y'know , loved this stuff .
The kind of people I had originally enjoyed working with so much .
At least until a bunch of careerist gold diggers suddenly showed up and started polluting our workplace .
As much as the dot com bubble sucked , I was intensely glad to see these people go .
Now I 'm wondering if the current economic conditions are an opportunity to clean house again .
I mean this in the nicest possible way , but not everyone should be a programmer .
How often have you wished that a certain coworker of yours would suddenly have an epiphany one day and decide that this whole software engineering thing just is n't working out for them ?
How do you tell someone that the quality of their work is terrible and they 'll never be good at their job -- so much so that they should literally quit and pursue a new career ?
I 've wanted to many times , but I never had the guts .
Joel implied that good programmers love programming so much they 'd do it for no pay at all .
I wo n't go quite that far , but I will note that the best programmers I 've known have all had a lifelong passion for what they do .
There 's no way a minor economic blip would ever convince them they should do anything else .
No way .
No how .
So if a programmer ever hints , even in passing , that they might possibly want to exit the field -- they probably should .
I 'm not saying you should be a jerk about it , obviously .
But if someone has any doubt at all about programming as a career choice , they should be encouraged to explore alternatives -- and make room for another programmer who unashamedly loves to code .
Then again , maybe I 'm not the best person to ask .
I spent Christmas Eve setting up servers .
I 'm on holiday right now , sitting in a hotel room in Santa Barbara , and you know what I spent the last two nights doing until the wee hours of the morning ?

Oh yeah , and this blog post .
So I might be a little biased .
Update April 2015 : Reading it again years later , I regret the tone of this post .
I was frustrated at the time and it comes across now as just smarmy .
Still , I stand by the principal idea : that you should avoid Python ’s daemon threads if you can .
Update June 2015 : This is Python bug 1856 .
It was fixed in Python 3.2.1 and 3.3 , but the fix was never backported to 2.x .
( An attempt to backport to the 2.7 branch caused another bug and it was abandoned . )
Daemon threads may be ok in Python >= 3.2.1 , but definitely are n’t in earlier versions .
The other day at work we encountered an unusual exception in our nightly pounder test run after landing some new code to expose some internal state via a monitoring API .
The problem occurred on shutdown .
The new monitoring code was trying to log some information , but was encountering an exception .
Our logging code was built on top of Python ’s logging module , and we thought perhaps that something was shutting down the logging system without us knowing .
We ourselves never explicitly shut it down , since we wanted it to live until the process exited .
The monitoring was done inside a daemon thread .
The Python docs say only :
A thread can be flagged as a “ daemon thread ” .
The significance of this flag is that the entire Python program exits when only daemon threads are left . ”
Which sounds pretty good , right ?
This thread is just occasionally grabbing some data , and we do n’t need to do anything special when the program shuts down .
Yeah , I remember when I used to believe in things too .
Despite a global interpreter lock that prevents
Python from being truly concurrent anyway , there is a very real possibility that the daemon threads can still execute after the Python runtime has started its own tear - down process .
One step of this process appears to be to set the values inside globals ( ) to None , meaning that any module resolution results in an AttributeError attempting to dereference NoneType .
Other variations on this cause TypeError to be thrown .
The code which triggered this looked something like this , although with more abstraction layers which made hunting it down a little harder :
try : log.info(
" Some thread started ! " ) try : do_something_every_so_often_in_a_loop_and_sleep ( ) except somemodule .
SomeException : pass else : pass finally : log.info(
" Some thread exiting ! " )
The exception we were seeing was an AttributeError on the last line , the log. info ( ) call .
But that was n’t even the original exception .
It was actually another AttributeError caused by the somemodule .
SomeException dereference .
Because all the modules had been reset , somemodule was None too .
Unfortunately the docs are completely devoid of this information , at least in the threading sections which you would actually reference .
The best information I was able to find was this email to python - list a few years back , and a few other emails which do n’t really put the issue front and center .
In the end the solution for us was simply to make them non-daemon threads , notice when the app is being shut down and join them to the main thread .
Another possibility for us was to catch AttributeError in our thread wrapper class – which is what the author of the aforementioned email does – but that seems like papering over a real bug and a real error .
Because of this misbehavior , daemon threads lose almost all of their appeal , but oddly I can’t find people really publicly saying “ do n’t use them ” except in scattered emails .
It seems like it ’s underground information known only to the Python cabal .
( There is no cabal . )
So , I am going to say it .
When I went searching there were n’t any helpful hints in a Google search of “ python daemon threads considered harmful ” .
So , I am staking claim to that phrase .

New Obama Orders on Transparency , FOIA Requests
By Ed O'Keefe
In a move that pleased good government groups and some journalists , President Obama issued new orders today designed to improve the federal government 's openness and transparency .
The first memo instructs all agencies and departments to " adopt a presumption in favor " of Freedom of Information
Act requests , while the second memo orders the director of the Office of Management and Budget to issue recommendations on making the federal government more transparent .
" The Government should not keep information confidential merely because public officials might be embarrassed by disclosure , because errors and failures might be revealed , or because of speculative or abstract fears , " Obama said in the FOIA memo , adding later that " In responding to requests under the FOIA , executive branch agencies ( agencies ) should act promptly and in a spirit of cooperation , recognizing that such agencies are servants of the public . "
His memo on government transparency states that the Obama Administration " will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency , public participation , and collaboration .
Openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in Government . "
The order directs the yet - to - be - named chief technology officer to work with the OMB director to develop an " Open Government Directive " in the next four months .
Just in case new OMB director Peter R. Orszag needs any suggestions , the Sunlight Foundation -- a group dedicated to improving government transparency -- has several .
" I ’m pretty damn pleased that the issue of transparency in government is such a high priority for the new administration , " said director Ellen Miller .
Each agency should do an audit of its information and data how it makes it available , Miller said .
The administration should also redefine the definition of " public information " to mean that government information is not public until it is posted online in an easy - to - download format .
" The devil is in the details , " Miller cautions , noting that the new memos and executive orders had not been posted on the new White House Web site by late afternoon Wednesday .
Obama today also froze the salaries of senior White House staffers and issued executive orders on presidential records and new ethics guidelines for presidential appointees .
What would YOU do ?
Leave your thoughts in the comments section below .
THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary For Immediate Release January 21 , 2009 MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES SUBJECT : Freedom of Information Act A democracy requires accountability , and accountability requires transparency .
As Justice Louis Brandeis wrote , " sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants . "
In our democracy , the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) , which encourages accountability through transparency , is the most prominent expression of a profound national commitment to ensuring an open Government .
At the heart of that commitment is the idea that accountability is in the interest of the Government and the citizenry alike .
The Freedom of Information
Act should be administered with a clear presumption :
In the face of doubt , openness prevails .
The Government should not keep information confidential merely because public officials might be embarrassed by disclosure , because errors and failures might be revealed , or because of speculative or abstract fears .
Nondisclosure should never be based on an effort to protect the personal interests of Government officials at the expense of those they are supposed to serve .
In responding to requests under the FOIA , executive branch agencies ( agencies ) should act promptly and in a spirit of cooperation , recognizing that such agencies are servants of the public .
All agencies should adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure , in order to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA , and to usher in a new era of open Government .
The presumption of disclosure should be applied to all decisions involving FOIA .
The presumption of disclosure also means that agencies should take affirmative steps to make information public .
They should not wait for specific requests from the public .
All agencies should use modern technology to inform citizens about what is known and done by their Government .
Disclosure should be timely .
I direct the Attorney General to issue new guidelines governing the FOIA to the heads of executive departments and agencies , reaffirming the commitment to accountability and transparency , and to publish such guidelines in the Federal Register .
In doing so , the Attorney General should review FOIA reports produced by the agencies under Executive Order 13392 of December 14 , 2005 .
I also direct the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to update guidance to the agencies to increase and improve information dissemination to the public , including through the use of new technologies , and to publish such guidance in the Federal Register .
This memorandum does not create any right or benefit , substantive or procedural , enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States , its departments , agencies , or entities , its officers , employees , or agents , or any other person .
The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register .

Drinking coffee may do more than just keep you awake .
A new study suggests an intriguing potential link to mental health later in life , as well .
A team of Swedish and Danish researchers tracked coffee consumption in a group of 1,409 middle - age men and women for an average of 21 years .
During that time , 61 participants developed dementia , 48 with Alzheimer ’s disease .
After controlling for numerous socioeconomic and health factors , including high cholesterol and high blood pressure , the scientists found that the subjects who had reported drinking three to five cups of coffee daily were 65 percent less likely to have developed dementia , compared with those who drank two cups or less .
People who drank more than five cups a day also were at reduced risk of dementia , the researchers said , but there were not enough people in this group to draw statistically significant conclusions .
Dr. Miia Kivipelto , an associate professor of neurology at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and lead author of the study , does not as yet advocate drinking coffee as a preventive health measure .
“ This is an observational study , ” she said .
“ We have no evidence that for people who are not drinking coffee , taking up drinking will have a protective effect . ”
This post was originally going to be a discussion of the various design patterns used when creating jQuery plugins but while making an example for that very post I got a bit too engrossed in what was only meant to be an example …
So , here is a new jQuery plugin , it ’s called " Fly Off Page " .
It will take selected elements and make them fly ( not literally ) off the page in a random or pre-defined direction .
Customizable options include duration ( of the animation ) , direction , tween ( extend animation ) and ‘ retainSpace ’ which allows you to retain , disregard or animate - out the space that the specified element once took up .
Avaiable directions :
Available options :
Duration :
The amount of time ( in milliseconds ) over which the animation will run .
For example : $ ( elem ) .
flyOffPage ( { duration : 400 // 400 milliseconds ( 0.4 seconds ) } ) ;
Direction :
The selected element will fly off the page in this direction .
‘ top ’ , ‘ right ’ , ‘ btm ’ , ‘ left ’ ‘ topLeft ’ , ‘ topRight ’ , ‘ btmLeft ’ , ‘ btmRight ’ ‘ random ’
Tween :
You can add your own tweens to the animation .
For example : $ ( elem ) .
flyOffPage ( { tween : { opacity : 0 } } ) ;
retainSpace :
This can be set to true / false or an object which will be ran as an animation on the placeholder .
For example : $ ( elem ) .
flyOffPage ( { retainSpace : { height : 0 , width : 0 } } ) ;

How fully is Mitt Romney running for the GOP nomination in 2012 ?
First the condo , now this :
Former Governor Mitt Romney ’s Free and Strong America PAC today sent $ 1,000 checks to a group of House Republicans targeted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ( DCCC ) for their votes against the wasteful $ 800 billion stimulus bill .
Said Romney : “ What Republicans wanted was a bill to strengthen the economy .
What the Democrats passed was a bill to stimulate government .
We are committed to helping these courageous Republicans defend their position and fend off political attacks . ”
Romney called the President ’s stimulus package “ a missed opportunity to make this country stronger . ”
Referring to the 12 House Republicans as the “ Undaunted Dozen , ” Romney praised them for “ standing up for fiscal responsibility and saying no to spending abuse . ”

Do or do not , there is no maybe
If you ’re a “ notebook thinker , ” you ’ll like Baron Fig , a small line of carefully crafted , take - it - anywhere hardcover and pocket notebooks made of archival quality pages ( blank , lined , or dotted ) that lie almost perfectly flat .
I have a first - run hardcover , and it ’s sweet .
Launched in October 2013 as a Kickstarter project , Baron Fig blew past its modest $ 15,000 funding goal by whopping $ 153,289 !
Impressive as that is , what ’s really impressive — and why I ’m writing — is the fantastic , relentless simplicity of the entire idea .
How do you make such a ( seemingly ) ordinary product desirable enough to sell at a premium ?
With design in its purest form , which one trip to their web site will make obvious .
It ’s a beautifully simple site with a single focus — to present Baron Fig notebooks in a personal and somewhat precious way , similar to the iPhone .
They do it not with hyperbole or lengthy explanation , but briefly , clearly , point by careful point .
No distractions , diversions , or sidebars — just a photo , an illustration , a few words , a click or two .
Its design is wide - screen , deep scrolling , mostly white space , with sensitive , quiet typography .
You ’ll see a half - dozen carefully filmed videos of notebooks in use .
What reminded me of all this is the email I got recently promoting a new Baron Fig model — a “ limited edition ” pocket notebook with a lightbulb on the cover , handsomely presented against a tweed jacket :
Kinda makes you want one , does n’t it ?
Think about this .
It ’s a fairly mundane product category .
The lightbulb is an image that you or I would easily discard as overly simplistic .
And adding it to an otherwise blank cover — how much fanfare does that merit ?
I would have thought none , but Baron Fig has turned it into an event — low - key for sure , but worth talking about and worth doing well .
I ’m smiling .
The whole enterprise reinforces for me the efficacy of narrowing an idea to a niche and even a hyper niche and staying with it , carefully refining , proudly presenting , not overlooking the value in even the smallest detail .
Time to rethink a few things .

Update :
Due to the changing nature of marijuana laws and your comments , we will be adding regular posts about the practice of smoking pot around the world and related international laws .
If interested , please view the first in the series : Marijuana Laws in Southeast Asia .
_______________________________________________________________
From an American kid hitting a bong while watching Harold and Kumar to a Moroccan enjoying hash with his afternoon tea , people all over the world smoke cannabis .
DESPITE THE POPULARITY OF weed and hash , most governments in the world have deemed it harmful to the individual and society as a whole .
There are only 11 nations in the world where weed and hash have been decriminalized .
A handful of countries impose mandatory prison sentences and other harsh punishments for the possession or sale of any form of weed and hash .
Another handful look the other way when dealing with cannabis .
Some places that are easy on weed heads can be broken up by region :
Latin America
In Latin America , cannabis is tolerated and / or decriminalized in most countries , with the exception of Bolivia , Ecuador , Honduras and Guatemala .
Marijuana grows well in Central and South America and is a large part of the economy .
Governments tend to have more to worry about than whether someone is smoking a joint .
For travelers , this means that smoking in South America is probably okay , but caution should be used .
Only Peru considers cannabis to be a legal drug , provided you are not in possession of another drug .
I get the impression that throughout Latin America , the tolerance does n’t typically extend to tourists , especially if the police can get a bribe out of it , but you should never travel with pot and risk being searched .
I would highly recommend caution throughout Mexico , Panama , Guatemala and even Costa Rica .
Although weed is sold to tourists all the time in quantities up to 1 / 4 pound , those buyers in turn , are often set up for the policia .
In this particular region , weed may be tolerated , decriminalized or even legal up to small amounts ( usually about 20 grams ) , but as always , keep a low profile .

Europe
Europe is another region where cannabis is generally tolerated , decriminalized or even legal .
We all know about the Netherlands .
It is legal to buy and smoke herb in the Netherlands , in amounts up to five grams per person per day .
People regularly smoke in public parks and anywhere else they can find a bench and a view .
In the Netherlands , one notices that tourists ( especially American tourists ) go a little overboard and smoke their way into oblivion .
The only caution I would take here is making sure you do n’t get duped at the coffee shops or robbed by opportunistic thugs .
GERMANY and BELGIUM : decriminalized .
This means that possessing a small amount is ok , but puffing in public and selling weed is not .

North Africa
The other region where weed is ok is North Africa .
In Egypt , Tunisia , and Morocco , locals smoke hash , a fine alternative to alcohol and accepted in society .
However , this societal norm does not necessarily apply to tourists .
In other words , locals may be puffing , but if the laws still consider what you are doing as illegal , a cop can still make money off you .
I recommend smoking with friends only in this region .
EGYPT : Illegal , but not strictly enforced , just do n’t smoke in public .
Also , do n’t carry large quantities unless you ’d like to see the inside of an Egyptian jail .
: Illegal , but not strictly enforced , just do n’t smoke in public .
Also , do n’t carry large quantities unless you ’d like to see the inside of an Egyptian jail .
MOROCCO : Illegal .
Not recommended to smoke in public or to carry more than a few grams at a time –whatever you can quickly swallow or throw away .
Tourists are usually let off with fines , but technically can be jailed for 4 - 10 years .
Even more if you ’re suspected of smuggling .
Having said all that , these are the nations in which cannabis is legal for consumption and where you should be able to smoke in peace :

AUSTRALIA : Up to 50 grams !
( Certain states of Australia have decriminalized marijuana possession .
In Tasmania , Victoria and Queensland one can be simply ticketed for up to 50 grams .
If found in possession with intent to supply , convictions apply )
I use “ up to five grams ” because I like to err on the side of caution .
I have smoked publicly with fishermen in Thailand , tea merchants in Egypt , farmers in SW China and all my homies throughout Europe and the US .
I will continue to do so .
People all over the planet understand the need to just relax and do your thing after a long day .
Some do it with alcohol , some with tea , some with weed , and some with a book .
Stick to the nations numbered above and if you need to puff elsewhere , be careful .

Researchers at the University of Exeter have found that a walk of just fifteen minutes can reduce chocolate cravings .
The benefits of exercise in helping people manage dependencies on nicotine and other drugs have previously been recognised .
Now , for the first time , newly - published research shows that the same may be true for food cravings .
Following three days of abstinence , 25 regular chocolate eaters were asked to either complete a 15 - minute brisk walk or rest , in a random order .
They then engaged in tasks that would normally induce chocolate cravings , including a mental challenge and opening a chocolate bar .
After exercise participants reported lower cravings than after rest .
Cravings were not only reduced during the walk , but for at least ten minutes afterwards .
The exercise also limited increases in cravings in response to the two tasks .
Professor Adrian Taylor comments : " Our ongoing work consistently shows that brief bouts of physical activity reduce cigarette cravings , but this is the first study to link exercise to reduced chocolate cravings .
Neuroscientists have suggested common processes in the reward centres of the brain between drug and food addictions , and it may be that exercise effects brain chemicals that help to regulate mood and cravings .
This could be good news for people who struggle to manage their cravings for sugary snacks and want to lose weight . "
Previous research has suggested that 97 % of women and 68 % of men experience food cravings .
Craved foods tend to be calorie - dense , fatty or sugary foods , with chocolate being the most commonly reported .
Chocolate has a number of biologically active constituents that temporarily enhance our mood with a result that eating it can become a habit , particularly when we are under stress and when it is readily available , and perhaps when we are least active .
Professor Taylor concludes : " While enjoying the occasional chocolate bar is fine , in time , regular eating may lead to stronger cravings during stress and when it is readily available .
Recognising what causes us to eat high energy snacks , even if we have plans to not do so , can be helpful . "
" Short bouts of physical activity can help to regulate how energised and pleasant we feel , and with a sedentary lifestyle we may naturally turn to mood regulating behaviours such as eating chocolate .
Accumulating 30 minutes of daily physical activity , with two 15 minute brisk walks , for example , not only provides general physical and mental health benefits but also may help to regulate our energy intake .
This research furthers our understanding of the complex physical , psychological and emotional relationship we have with food . "
The research is now published online in the journal Appetite .
Madonna is on the warpath after discovering that unflattering photographs of her Hard Candy pre-airbrushed album artwork have been leaked to the press .
Seeing as this is a woman who launches legal action if her children ’s hands are n’t disinfected every half hour , one can only imagine how put out she might feel to discover that people no longer believe she stopped ageing in 1984 .
Post - airbrushing , she looks vaguely more humanoid .
A few months ago , I was lucky enough to get my hands on a sample of a ruinously expensive and ludicrous new perfume that I think might temporarily solve Madonna ’s problems with the natural ageing process and enable her to resist wearing clothes that would make a teenager look like mutton dressed as lamb .
Ageless Fantasy is an anti-ageing perfume which has been created in order to knock at least eight years off your age .
Put the bottle down , Madonna , drinking it wo n’t improve its results .
Billed as ‘ the essence of youth ’ , it smells of citrus fruits , mangos and pomegranate ; a bit like the popular drink - in - a - carton Um Bongo , in other words , but around £ 164.61 more expensive .
Apparently , scientists have concluded that in particular , the scent of pink grapefruits on a woman can give her an impression of youth .
Just imagine , therefore , how young people would think you were if you hollowed out three or four and wore them as a citrus bikini and a jaunty hat .
I suggest you try it forthwith .
The concept works on the basis that people , men in particular , associate certain scents with certain ages and can therefore be fooled into thinking women are younger if they detect a ‘ youthful scent ’ around them .
Women are slightly harder to trick .
We associate the ‘ youthful scent ’ of a younger man with a great deal of cloying Lynx worn in lieu of bathing , or of a pervasive aroma of wet trainers , four - day - old polyester school shirts and egg sandwich - flecked bum fluff .
Even given the superior olfactory know - how of women , the only way I can imagine Ageless Fantasy really working is if you spray your date in the eyes with the perfume as soon as he arrives to pick you up .
Then , like Cinderella waiting for midnight , you ’ll have to keep watching your man until the blinding effect starts to wear off at which point give it to him with both barrels with as many blasts as it takes for him to agree that you look as if you ’re only 22 .
Because I have a magic portrait ageing on my behalf in the attic ( I ’m actually 83 ) , I do n’t need gimmicks or trinkets to help me look any younger or more desirable , and any lurking persistently around the tropical fruit section at supermarkets is , I promise , purely incidental .
I kept the sample , though .
At the very least it means I can definitely keep going on the Club 18 - 30 holidays I so enjoy .
John Dunford , general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the system would be welcomed if it cut bureaucracy - but he said : " You always seem to get queues behind security devices " .
Winnie the Pooh , Christopher Robin and their forest friends are " seriously troubled individuals " according to Canadian researchers .
Far from being the innocent world it appears to be on the surface , Hundred Acre Wood is , say the reseachers , a place where psycho - social problems are not recognised or treated .
We cannot but wonder how much richer Pooh 's life might be were he to have a trial of low - dose stimulant medication
Pooh , a bear of very little brain , is said to suffer from the condition known as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
Lead researcher Sarah Shea said the purpose of the tongue - in - cheek study was to remind people that anyone can have disorders .
Pooh 's learning problems could also arise from him being dragged downstairs by Christopher Robin , bumping his head on each step - a possible case of " shaken bear syndrome " , asks the study .
" We can not but wonder how much richer Pooh 's life might be were he to have a trial of low - dose stimulant medication , " say the researchers .
Piglet obviously suffers from generalised anxiety disorder according to the study .
Anti-panic agent , it says , would have saved him from the emotional trauma experienced while attempting to trap heffalumps .
Role models
While the chronically depressed Eeyore and risk - taking Tigger are also prescribed different kinds of medication , some of their friends need support and better role - models .
Had his condition been identified early , Owl 's dyslexia could been overcome through intensive support .
The researchers predict that Roo is likely to become a delinquent for lack of a good role model , while Kanga will probably miss the opportunity to get an MBA due to a social context that does not " appear to value education and provides no strong leadership " .
Which brings us to Christopher Robin .
Not finding any diagnosable condition , the specialists express concern over several issues .
Namely , the boy 's lack of parental supervision and the fact that he spends his time talking to animals .
" Sadly the forest is not , in fact , a place of enchantment , but rather one of disenchantment , where neuro - developmental and psycho- social problems go unrecognised and untreated , " conclude the authors .
Whether the readers of Pooh would benefit from the bear 's visit to a child development clinic , as suggested in the study , is another matter .
On his first full day in office , President Obama has issued executive orders which , he says , will usher in a new era of openness and transparency in government .
Attending a swearing - in ceremony for senior White House staff , Mr Obama announced strict new rules on lobbyists and their gifts to federal civil servants .
He said public service was a " privilege " and not about advancing yourself , your friends or your corporate clients .
( Reuters ) - Israel announced a unilateral ceasefire in its offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip on Saturday .
Following are some implications of Israel ’s decision : * While Israel said in announcing its decision that all goals in its Gaza offensive had been met , the threat of rockets being fired after the ceasefire starts remains high .
* Hamas has said the ceasefire is effectively meaningless and it will continue “ resistance ” until Israel pulls its troops out of the Gaza Strip and opens border crossings to allow in food , aid and other materials .
Israel has given no timetable for withdrawal or border openings .
* Other militant groups in Gaza have also said the ceasefire is meaningless and they will continue “ resistance ” against Israel , which is likely to include rocket fire .
Thus , Israel ’s main stated goal may be challenged , at least in the near term .
* Israel has said that if Hamas and other groups do continue rocket attacks , it will resume operations .
Given the likelihood of rockets continuing , Israel ’s mettle is certain to be immediately tested .
* The fact Barack Obama is to be sworn in as the new U.S. president on Tuesday is widely perceived to have had an impact on Israel ’s decision - making .
Israel is keen to ensure it remains on sound terms with its closest ally .
That may make it keen to hold its fire even if Hamas does not .
* International pressure -- from the U.N. and European states -- will also be heavy on Israel hold fire and set a timetable for pulling its troops out of Gaza .
Failure to do either of those things could play into Hamas ’s hands .
* Yet Israel is calculating that by taking unilateral action , it puts pressure on Hamas to follow suit .
If Hamas continues rocket fire , the Islamists may be perceived as the aggressors and Israel may feel justified in resuming operations .
* The three - week offensive resulted in more than 1,200 Palestinian dead , including 410 children .
Thirteen Israelis were also killed .
Despite the toll , Israel is hoping its decision on a ceasefire will offset some of the worldwide criticism it has faced for the onslaught , including suggestions by U.N. officials that its actions should be investigated for war crimes .
* Part of Israel ’s decision - making is also linked to parliamentary elections on February 10 .
* Both the defense minister , Ehud Barak , and the foreign minister , Tzipi Livni , are candidates in the election .
They are hoping a ceasefire , with Israel having met all its goals , will stand them in good stead with the electorate .
They will be anxious , therefore , to show they have succeeded in substantially ending the rocket fire that has disrupted life in the south .
* Their rival , conservative former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , is already ahead in polls and tipped to win the election .
Any perceived failures in Gaza could strengthen his electoral chances as a hawk who opposed Israel ’s move to withdraw its forces from the Gaza Strip in 2005 .

Ohio casino proposals are usually approved by local voters , defeated statewide .
There are game - changing fumbles .
And then there are history - changing fumbles .
The biggest fumble in Ohio history was n't the one committed by Browns running back Ernest Byner in January of 1988 .
That fumble broke a city 's heart , but the damage was ephemeral .
Football is a game .
A far more significant fumble occurred on November 6th , 1990 , roughly 34 months after Byner put the ball on the ground in Denver .
That was the day that Ohio voters overwhelmingly rejected a pilot casino program for the city of Lorain .
That ballot fumble has had lasting consequences .
That vote may represent the most short - sighted , ill - informed outcome in the history of Ohio ballot initiatives .
A powerful and unholy alliance of race tracks and churches conspired to defeat an idea whose time had come .
Had the Lorain casino been given a chance , it could have helped alter Ohio 's economic future .
Had that idea , the brainchild of Lorain developer and auto dealer Alan Spitzer , succeeded , Ohio would have been the third state in the union to act on the economic potential of casinos .
We would have quickly mushroomed into a tourism and gaming industry leader by now .
Instead , tomorrow , we will hear from Gov. Ted Strickland just how bad Ohio 's fortunes have become .
In his State of the State address , he will stress how we will need more severe belt - tightening -- and innovation -- to fill an expected $ 7 billion hole in the next two - year state budget .
What Strickland is unlikely to mention , however , is that he has been sniffing around the casino crowd .
He 's been talking to the gambling folks because he is now willing to admit that they pay tithes and create jobs .
He 's talking to them because filthy lucre is taxable .
That 's wise .
At this point , Strickland and the legislature should heartily embrace any legal industry that creates good paying jobs and bolsters tourism .
Waiting until now makes it harder to bring gambling to the state .
Vested gambling interests surrounding
Ohio do n't want gaming here , unless it 's dictated on their terms .
The parent company of an Indiana casino spent nearly $ 36 million last year to defeat a gambling initiative that appeared on the Ohio ballot .
The company did n't want to lose Ohio or Indiana gamblers .
It was a business decision .
But this is not the time to cry over forfeited casino chips or to allow other states to continue dictating our gaming future .
" I guess I understand where they 're coming from , " said Spitzer , who refuses to question the motives of Strickland and other politicians now giving gambling another look .
" This is the real world , and necessity is the mother of invention . "
" We will probably never be able to do some things on the scale that we might have been able to , given that the competition is now so much greater .
But still , if nothing else , it makes sense to keep Ohio money in Ohio . "
We fumbled badly in 1990 , and the casino world roared past us .
It 's time that Ohio 's politicians ignore the naysayers and get us in the game .
Babies delivered by Caesarean section at 37 weeks were 4.2 times more likely than those delivered at 39 weeks to suffer from respiratory distress syndrome , and 3.3 times more likely to be treated for hypoglycemia , 2.9 times more likely to develop an infection or to be suspected of having an infection , and more than twice as likely to be hospitalized for five or more days or to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit .
Babies delivered by Caesarean section at 38 weeks were 2.1 times more likely than those delivered at 39 weeks to suffer respiratory distress syndrome , 1.8 times more likely to be hospitalized for five or more days , and 1.7 times more likely to have an infection or be suspected of having an infection .
Babies delivered by Caesarean at 38 weeks had a 30 percent increased risk of hypoglycemia and a 50 percent increased risk of being admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit , compared to those delivered at 39 weeks .
“ Faced with the likelihood that there is no other problem , I think it ’s prudent to wait until 39 weeks to avoid subjecting these babies to adverse outcomes , ” Dr. Tita said .
He added that he did not think the results would be different for women undergoing a first elective Caesarean section , versus the repeat Caesareans looked at in this study .
Reactions to the study were mixed .
Dr. Michael Greene , director of obstetrics at Massachusetts General Hospital , who wrote an editorial that accompanied the article , said the paper quantifies differences in risk that many physicians may not be aware of .
“ I would bet if you ask the first 10 obstetricians on the street if they thought it would make a difference to deliver a baby in the second half of the 38th week and the first half of the 39th week , they ’d say , ’ Nah , it ’s not a big difference , ’ ” he said .
“ This study , because of its size and numbers , is able to say , Yeah , it does make a difference . ’ ”
At the same time , he said the study only reviewed live births and did not weigh the risk of a potential stillbirth that could occur with a longer pregnancy against the risk of a complication resulting from an earlier Caesarean .
“ The apparent simple message from this study is too simplistic , ” he said .
“ There is a tiny , small but real increase in stillbirths late in pregnancy for women who had a prior Caesarean section , as opposed to women with no scar in their uterus ” from a previous Caesarean section .
What exactly is this Kawasaki Syndrome — the rare disorder that John Travolta had said his son had suffered from before dying today at the age of sixteen ?
According to the Mayo Clinic 's website , it 's an uncommon disorder that affects children , " that causes inflammation in the walls of small - and medium - sized arteries throughout the body , including the coronary arteries . "
It comes with a variety of unpleasant symptoms , including diarrhea and lots of skin peeling .
But in most cases children suffering from Kawasaki Syndrome make complete recoveries after receiving proper treatment .
However , Jett Travolta — whose parents described him as a Kawasaki sufferer amid reports that the boy was actually autistic — has had medical problems for years .
While promoting Ladder 49 in 2005 , Travolta described what he said was the first time Jett suffered from Kawasaki Syndrome when he was 15 months old :
" He was hospitalised for five days .
His whole body swelled up , it was chemical poisoning , from picking up toys or food particles from the carpet . "
The supposed culprit was a carpet cleaner , so the family decided to go natural .
Travolta 's wife Kelly Preston told the Mirror in 2004 :
Jett 's whole immune system shut down and he got really sick with high fevers - 104 and 105 .
He developed a rash on his body and swollen lymph glands - it was horrible .
...
We 're 90 per cent organic , though there 's some canned foods - a little bit of junk food here and there .
But lots of folks just did n't believe this story , claiming that the boy's parents ' rigid devotion to the Church of Scientology — a cult that does n't eagerly recognize mental illness as anything that vitamins and exercise can't fix — was causing them to willfully deny what some saw as painfully obvious : that Jett was suffering from autism .
Folks picketed the Travolta / Preston family , saying that their refusal to seek treatment for the boy bordered on — or , you know , flat out was — child abuse .
Travolta 's brother Joey even produced a movie about the condition , but the family continued to shut down any reports that autism was involved .
They hewed to the Kawasaki Syndrome story while a glib world believed there to be some bigger secret truth .
" Its not very comfortable in there is it ? " said the stony faced official , cigarette smoke forming a haze around his gleaming oval head .
" Its OK .
We 're fine " I replied wearily , delirious after being awake for a straight period of 30 hours .
" You could be in there for days you know .
For weeks .
Indefinitely .
" So , tell me , you are taking a plane tomorrow morning to the US ? "

It was our journey home that began with the standard packing frenzy : squeezing everything precious and dear and useful into two suitcases that would be our sustenance for the course of 3 months .
The trips to the outdoor recreation store - in preparation for what I anticipated to be a long and tortuous journey across Rafah Crossing to Gaza .
The inspect repellent ; the mosquito netting ; the water purifier ; the potty toppers for my kids and the dried fruit and granola bars and portion sized peanut butter cups .
This time , I wanted to be ready , I thought to myself - just in case I got stuck at the Crossing .
The Crossing .
My presumptuousness is like a dull hit to the back of my head now .
'ayb
Ayb ??
The faces were different each time .
3 or four different rooms and hallways to navigate down .
They refused to give names and the answers they gave were always in the form of cryptic questions .
The first explained I would not be allowed entry into Egypt because Palestinians without permanent residency abroad are not allowed in ; and besides - Rafah Crossing is closed he said ( my response : so open it ? ) .
I was told I was to be deported to the UK first .
" But I had no British visa " I explained .
I was ordered to agree to get on the next flight .
I refused - I did n't come all this way to turn back .
I was escorted to the " extended transit terminal " .
It was empty at first , save for a south Asian man in tightly buckled jeans and a small duffel bag that spent the good part of our time there there in a deep sleep .
During the day the hall would fill up with locally deported passengers - from villages of cities across Egypt , and we would move our things to the upper waiting area .
Most of the time was spent in this waiting area with low level guards who knew nothing and could do nothing .
At different intervals a frustrated Yousuf , fully caped in his black spiderman outfit and mask , would approach them angrily about " why they would n't let him go see hisand ? " and why " they put cockroaches on the floor " .
When we first arrived , he asked if these were the " yahood " , his only experiences with extended closure , delay , and denial of entry being at the hands of the israeli soldiers and government .
" No , but why do n't you ask them why they are are allowed through to sunbathe and we are n't to our own homes ? " " Rabina kbeer " came the response .
They were impotent .
God is great .
There was very little time I was given access to anyone who had any authority .
I seemed to be called in whenever the new person on duty arrived , when they were scheduled for their thrice daily interrogation and intimidation , their shooting and crying .
Officers came and went as shifts began and ended .
But our status was always the same .
Our " problem " , our case , our issue was always the same .
We remained , sitting on our chairs , with our papers and documents in hand , waiting , and no one the better .
Always waiting .
For this is what the Palestinian does : we wait .
For an answer to be given , for a question to be asked ; for a marriage proposal to be made , for a divorce to be finalized ; for a border to open , for a permit to be issued ; for a war to end ; for a war to begin ; for a child to be born ; for one to die a martyr ; for retirement or a new job ; for exile to a better place and for return to the only place that knows us ; for our prisoners to come home ; for our home to no longer be prisons ; for our children to be free ; for freedom from a time when we no longer have to wait .
We waited for the next shift as we were instructed by those who made their own instructions .
Funny how when you need to pass the time , the time does not pass .
"
You need to speak with whose in charge - and their shift starts at 10 am " .
So we pass the night and wait until 10 .
" Well by the time they really get started its more like noon " .
So we wait till noon .
" Well the real work is n't until the evening " .
And we wait until evening .
Then the cycle starts again .
Every now and then the numberless phone would ring requesting me , and a somber voice would ask if I changed my mind .
I insisted all I wanted to do was go home ; that it was not that complicated .
" But Gaza is a special case , we all know that " I was told .
Special , as in expendable , not human , not entitled to rights special , I thought .
Unfamiliar faces that acted as though though I was a long - lost friend kept popping in and out to see me .
As though I were an amnesiac in a penitentiary .
They all kept asking the same cryptic question " so you are getting on a plane soon , right ?
" First , a gentleman from the Palestinian representative 's office that someone else whose name I was meant to recognize sent .
"
It 'll all be resolved within the hour " he promised confidently , before going on to tell me about his son who worked with Motorola in Florida ; " Helping Israeli drones do their job ? " " That 's right ! " he beamed .
An hour came and went , and suddenly the issue was " irresolvable " , and I was " a journalist up to trouble " .*** Friends and family in Egypt , the US , and Gaza , worked around the clock with me , calling in any favors they had , anyone they knew , doing anything they could to get some answers and let me through .
But the answer was always the same : Amn il Dawla ( State Security and Intelligence ) says no , and they are the ultimate authorities .
No one goes past them .
Later a second Palestinian representative came to see me .
" So you are not going on that second flight are you ? " " What are you talking about ?
Why does everyone speak to me in question form ? " " Answer the question " " No , I came here to go to Gaza , not to return to the US " " Ok that 's all I needed to know ; there is a convoy of injured Palestinian with security clearance heading to the border with some space ; we are trying to get you on there with them ; 15 minutes and it'll all be resolved , we just need clearance , its all over " he assured me .
Yousuf smashed another cockroach .**** We were taken down a new hallway .
A new room .
A new face .
The man behind the desk explained how he was losing sleep over my case , how I had the while airport working on it , ho he had a son Yousuf 's age ; and then offered me an apple and a bottle of water and told me , to rest , a command I would hear again and again over the course of the 36 hours .
I thought to myself , my eyes nearly popping out of my face .
" I do n't want your food .
I do n't want to rest .
I do n't want your sympathy .
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME .
To my country .
To my parents .
IS THAT TOO HARD TO UNDERSTAND ? " I screamed , breaking my level - headed calm of the past 20 hours .
" Please do n't yell , just calm down , calm down , everyone outside will think I am treating you badly , c'mon , and besides its( disgraceful ) not to accept the apple from me " . " ' What 's 'AYB is you denying my entry to my own home !
And why should I be calm ?
This situation does n't call for calm ; it makes no sense and neither should I !
" A distraught Noor furrowed her brows and then comforted me the only way she knew how : by patting me on the back with her little hands and giving me a hug .
Yousuf began to cry .
" C'mon lady do n't have a breakdown in front of your kids please .
You know I have a kid your son's age and its breaking my heart to do this , to see him in these conditions , to put him in the conditions , so please take the plane .
"
" So do n't see me in these conditions !
There 's a simple solution you know .
LET ME GO HOME .
Its not asking a lot is it ? " " Hey now look lady " he said , stiffening suddenly into bad cop , his helpless grimace disappeared .
" Rules are rules , you need a visa to get in here like any other country , can you go to Jordan without a visa ? '" Do n't play the rules game with me .
I HAD APPROVAL FROM YOUR EMBASSY , FROM YOUR CONSUL GENERAL , to cross into Egypt and go to Gaza ; and besides how else am I supposed to get into Gaza ? ? ? "
I shouted , frantically waving the stamped and signed document in front of him as though it were a magic wand .
" So sue him .
supercedes the foreign ministry 's orders , he must have outdated protocol . "
" The letter was dated April 6 , that is 2 days ago , how outdated could it be ??
Look - if I could parachute into Gaza I would , trust me .
With all do respect to your country , I 'm not here to sight - see .
Do you have a parachute for me ?
If I could sail there I would do that too , but last I check Israel was ramming and turning those boats back .
Do you have another suggestions ?
" What is it you want lady - do you want to just live in the airport ?
is that it ?
Because we have no problems letting you live here , really .
We can set up a shelter for you .
And no one will ever ask about you or know you exist .
In any case you do n't have permanent residency abroad so our government policies say we can't let a Palestinian who does not have permanent residency abroad " " I have a US Visa - its expired but my extension of status document is valid until the end of June .
and besides - what kind of illogical law is that ?
you are n't allowing me back home if I do n't have permanent residency abroad ? "
" I do n't read English please translate . .
" " You see it says here that my status is valid until June 30 , 2009 " " Good , so then we CAN deport you back to the US " he said , picking up the phone and giving a quick order for the Palestinian convoy of injured Palestinians heading to the Crossing to go on without me , my only hope of returning home dissipating before my eyes at the hands of a barely literate manipulative enforcer .
"
You just said if i have permanent residency abroad I can go home , now you say I can't , which is it ? ? "
" I 'm sorry you are refusing to go on the plane .
Take her away please .
" We were ushered back to the extended waiting area , back to our roach ridden premises that had become our home , along with a newly arrived Luxembourgian and French couple and their two children who had failed to produce their passports and were being sent back home .
Here I was , about to be deported away from home , over prepared , with my documents and signed papers , from consulates and universities and governments ; and they , used to traveling passport - free the EU , being sent back home because they had only an ID card .*** It was n't long before a new guard came to us , and request we follow him " to a more isolated room " .
" It will be better for you - more private .
All the African flights are arriving now with all their diseases , you do n't want to be here for that !
It 'll get overcrowded and awful in here .
" Given the the well - wishes that preceded my last interrogation about the " uncomfortableness " I may endure , I somehow had a feeling where we were headed .
We were asked to bring all our luggage and escorted down a different hallway ; this time we were asked to leave everything behind , and to give up our cameras , laptops , and mobile phones .
We took our seats in the front of a tiny filthy room , where 17 other men ( and one Indonesian woman was sleeping on the floor in the back , occasionally shouting out in the middle of her interrupted sleep ) of varying nationalities were already waiting .
A brute man- , illiterate by his own admission , took charge of each of files , spontaneously blurting out vulgarities and ordering anyone who so much as whispered to shut the hell up or get sent to real prison ; the room was referred to as " 7abs " , or a cell ; I can probably best describe it as the detention or holding room .
a heady man with a protruding belly that seems at odds with his otherwise lanky body was the door guard .
Officer # 1 divided up the room into regions : the 5 or so south Asians who were there for whatever reason - expired paperwork , illegal documentation - were referred to as " Pakistan " when their attention was needed ;
The snoozing , sleep - talking woman in the back was " Indonesia " ; and the impeccably dressed Guinean businessman , fully decked in a sharp black suit and blue lined tie , was " Kenya " ( despite his persistence please to the contrary ) .
There was a group of Egyptian peasants with forged , fake , or wrongly filed Id cards and passports : a 54 year old man whose ID said he was born in 1990 ; another who left his ID in his village 5 hours away , and so on .
By this point , I had not slept in 27 hours , 40 if one were to count the plane ride .
My patience and my energy were wearing thing .
My children were filthy and tired and confused ; Noor was crying .
I tried to set her cot up , but a cell within a cell did not seem to her liking and she resisted , much as I did .
We took the opportunity to chat when officer # 1 was away .
" " So what did you do ? " asked Kenya , the Guinean .
" I was born Palestinian " I replied .
" Everyone in here is being deported back home for one reason or another right ?
I bet I am the only one being deported away from home ; the only one denied entry to my home .
" Officer # 1 returned , this time he asked me to come with him " with or without your kids " .
I brought them along , not knowing what was next .
There was two steely - eyed men on either end of a relatively well - furnished room , once again inquiring about my " comfort " and ordering - in the form of a question - whether I was taking a flight that morning to the US .
Noor began making a fuss , bellowing at the top of her lungs and swatting anyone that approached her .
" She is stubborn .
She takes after her mother I see " said the man .
Soon we were escorted back to the waiting area .
I knew there was nothing more I could do .
We waited for several more hours until my children exhausted themselves and fell asleep .
I bathed them in the filthy bathroom sinks with freezing tap water and hand soap and arranged their quarters on the steel chairs of the waiting room , buzzing with what seemed like a thousand gnats .
Thank God for the mosquito netting .
Eventually , dawn broke , and we were escorted by two guards to the ticket counter , our $ 2500 flights rerouted , and put on a plane back to Washington .
I noted on one of my tweets that I would be shocked if my children 's immune system survived this jolt .
It did n't .
My daughter vomited the whole flight to London as I slipped in and out of delirium , mumbling half Arabic half English phrases to the flustered but helpful Englishman sitting next to us .
I thank him wherever he is for looking after us .
Whatever she had , Yousuf an eye caught in the coming days - along with an ear and throat infection .
Eventually , we reached Dulles Airport .
I walked confidently to the booth when it was my turn .
What was I going to say ?
How do I explain this ?
The man took one look at my expired visa , and my departure stamps .
" How long have you been gone ? " " 36 hours " I replied bluntly .
" Yes , I see that .
Do you want to explain ? " " Sure .
Egypt forbade me from returning to Gaza " .
" I do n't understand - they denied you entry to your own home ? "
" I do n't either , and if I did , I would n't be here .
" With that , I was given a a stamp and allowed back inside .
Now that we are warm ; clothes ; showered , rested and recovered from whatever awful virus we picked up in the bowels of Cairo airport , I keep thinking to myself : what more could I have done ?
“ The quintessential Palestinian experience , ” historian Rashid Khalidi has written , “ takes place at a border , an airport , a checkpoint : in short , at any one of those many modern barriers where identities are checked and verified .
” In this place , adds Robyn Creswell , “ connection ” turns out to be only another word for separation or quarantine : the loop of airports never ends , like Borges ’s famous library .
The cruelty of the Palestinian situation is that these purgatories are in no way extraordinary but rather the backdrop of daily existence . "
According to the German news magazine Der Spiegel , top NATO commander in Afghanistan , US Gen .
John Craddock , has issued a " guidance " allowing NATO troops " to attack directly drug producers and facilities throughout Afghanistan . "
But other NATO commanders do not want to follow that order , leading to a rift at the top of the allied war machine over who is a legitimate military target .

NATO has reluctantly embraced an expansion of its mission from fighting the Taliban and related insurgents to going after drug trade participants linked to the insurgents .
But Gen.
Craddock 's directive broadens the mission to include any drug traffickers or drug production facilities .
According to the document , a copy of which Der Spiegel says it has , NATO troops can now use deadly force against drug traffickers even when there is no proof they are engaged in armed resistance to NATO / US troops or their Afghan government allies .
But that 's not what NATO countries bargained for in October , when they agreed to allow NATO soldiers to attack opium traffickers linked to the Taliban .
It is " no longer necessary to produce intelligence or other evidence that each particular drug trafficker or narcotics facility in Afghanistan meets the criteria of being a military objective , " Craddock wrote .
The alliance " has decided that [ drug traffickers and narcotics facilities ] are inextricably linked to the Opposing Military Forces , and thus may be attacked . "
Gen .
Craddock sent his directive on January 5 to Egon Ramms , the German leader at NATO command in the Netherlands , and David McKiernan , commander of the NATO peacekeeping force in Afghanistan .
But both commanders rejected it , arguing that the order is illegitimate and violates the laws of war .
McKiernan sent a classified letter from Kabul claiming that Craddock was trying to create " a new category " in the rules of engagement that would " seriously undermine the commitment ISAF has made to the Afghan people and the international community ... to restrain our use of force and avoid civilian casualties to the greatest degree predictable . "
The topic of civilian deaths at the hands of NATO and US troops in Afghanistan is an increasingly prickly one with the people and government of Afghanistan .
President Hamid Karzai has complained loudly and frequently about repeated US air strikes killing civilians .
NATO was forced this week to defend itself by arguing that it had only killed 97 civilians last year , compared to nearly 10 times that by the Taliban .
It is unclear how the conflict between the NATO allies will be resolved .
But if Craddock has his way and NATO declares open season on the drug trade , there will be a true drug war in Afghanistan .
In a country where the drug trade accounts for around half the gross national product and where members of the government and independent warlords as well as the Taliban have a hand in the trade , it is difficult to see how that will help win hearts and minds .
BLUE SPRINGS , Mo. , Dec. 18 ( UPI ) --
A priest has removed two books about Barack Obama from a Missouri Roman Catholic school 's library because of the president - elect 's abortion position .
" I am very pro-life , " the Rev. Ron Elliott of Blue Springs , Mo. , told KMBC-TV , Kansas City , Mo . " Because of his stance on certain issues , I was asked to look into that matter . "

Obama has said he believes abortions should be legally available in accordance with the landmark Roe vs. Wade U.S. Supreme Court decision that said abortion was a constitutional right to privacy under the due- process clause of the 14th Amendment .
Elliott said he pulled the Obama books from St. John LaLande Catholic School , even though he did n't find anything wrong with them when he read them .
He said he would put the books back on the shelf in February or March , " after the dust kind of settles . "
The school has an early childhood center and teaches students from kindergarten through eighth grade .
Reader [ Ramon Viladomat ] sent in what he has been working on over the last year at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona .
Tired of see nothing but zooming map demos , he created a roleplaying game that takes advantage of the reacTable ‘s multitouch interface .
Along with multitouch , the reacTable also uses tangible fiducial markers to represent objects and as an alternative input method .
Embedded above is a video demoing the interface and gameplay ( starts at 3:43 ) .
The game lets you move your miniature through a virtual world .
The surface shows you how far you can move dynamically as your action points regenerate and slowly reveals more dungeon as you discover it .
You can pause the action and use gestures to set attack patterns .
We really like this demo and would love to see someone build one using a popular tabletop game like Warhammer 40 K .

TORONTO , Feb. 10 ( UPI ) --
Two members of Canada 's Ontario Provincial Police force have been charged in two separate traffic incidents , one of them deadly , special investigators said .
The independent Special Investigations
Unit said in the first , a marked OPP cruiser driven by Sgt. Darryl Storey struck a car and caused fatal injuries to an 18 - year - old woman near the northern city of Thunder Bay on Dec. 3 .

In a release , the SIU said Storey was charged with criminal negligence causing death in the crash .
He was arrested and released and is scheduled to appear in provincial court March 5 .
In the second incident , OPP Detective Constable Heidi Fischer was stopped on a highway in southwestern Ontario by a fellow officer and charged with traveling in an unmarked cruiser at 100 mph in a 65 mph zone .
Because the speed was allegedly so high above the limit , Fischer was charged like a civilian and her driver 's license was suspended for seven days and the cruiser was impounded for seven days , the release said .
She will appear in court March 24 .
The SIU did not indicate what internal disciplines the two officers could face .

I once asked by my reader in my other blog – When do you think the recession will end , and how ?
I really am having a hard time to answer the question .
So may opinions from experts and public , as well .
To tell you the truth , I ca n’t imagine how the recession will end , and when will it eventually ends .
Some experts say that the recession will peak within 2 or 3 years , and things will improve gradually from there – so , rough road ahead .
Regarding how the recession will end , here ’s an interesting estimate – According to this article , the average recession lasted for 10.8 months .
Therefore , according to the data , on average , the recession should end last November 2008 , and the longest would probably ended on April 2009 .
Not exactly the case , in my opinion .
Why ?
Negative sentiment drive today ’s recession more than before
I think that today ’s recession might not be your typical recession .
The emotional turmoil is as bad as the economic turmoil , in such a way that people left with unsecurity , uncertainty and negative thinking .
Even though the economy is supposedly rebounded on November 2008 , the economic downturn inertia will lengthen the recession , even beyond what ’s estimated as the long recession mentioned in the article above , April 2009 .
As a non financial expert , but a self - made student of human behaviour , I view the recession will go well over April 2009 , and will reach the peak on mid or late 2010 .
I ’m not sure , but neither the expert .
The best survival tool : financial education
Regarding how the recession will end , my answer would be this :
As everything in life – such as the ripple in a lake decreases when the wind speed decreases – after the panic , buzz and negative sentiment sustain themselves in people , the recession will gradually peaked and the economy will rebound – all with viral effects , as sentiment is contagious ;
The positive outlook of the economy will gradually , in itself , improve economy situation .
The question : How to accelerate economy sustainability ?
The answer :
As people start to gather themselves and start to learn from the situation , their financial intelligence increases gradually , and the new understanding will accelerate economy recovery – eventually .
The availability of money guides and money information , especially online , will help people to learn better , faster .
Nowadays , the phrase “ Time is money ” has never been this true before – the faster people learn , the sooner recession will end – the knowledge will set you free .

Half the world ’s population could be facing a food crisis by the end of the century due to global warming .
That ’s the grim assessment of scientists who looked at projections of global warming ’s impact on the average temperatures during the growing season .
[ If you can not see the flash video below , you can click here for a high quality mp4 video . ]
Interviewee : David Battisti , University of Washington
Produced by Jack Penland — Edited by Jack Penland and James Eagan

Human Impact
The report shows that by 2100 , rising temperatures will have a significant impact upon crop yields , most noticeably in the tropics and sub tropics .
David Battisti , professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington says , “ You ’re talking about very large reductions in yields , on the order of 20 , 30 , 40 percent . ”
Battisti says that in those most affected areas , “ The odds are greater than 90 percent that they ( temperatures ) will exceed anything ever observed . ”
He and Rosamond L. Naylor , associate professor of economics at Stanford University , used projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
Those projections earned IPCC a share of the Nobel Prize along with former Vice - President Al Gore .
The researchers used the IPCC computer models to show climate change for the rest of this century and broke the projected temperatures down to averages for each season in various parts of the world .
Since average summers can be either hotter or cooler than usual , the seasonal averages form a bell - like curve , with normal years forming the bulk of the center curve and cold and warm years at either end .
The researchers took the projected seasonal averages and moved the middle of that curve accordingly .
In the tropics , where the averages do n’t change much , the researchers found that the low end of the new curve was higher than the high end of the current curve .
Also on ScienCentral Warming and Rice 07.13.04
Research into the impact of global warming is showing rice crop yields could be hurt by warmer nighttime temperatures .
Trees and Forests Show Stress from Global Warming 12.23.08
With the help of a more hospitable climate , tiny beetles are doing damage to forests you think only fires could do .
No Fish by 2050 11.02.06
Unless practices change , there will be no viable ocean fishing in the next 40 to 50 years .
Insurance - Global Warming 10.11.05
Insurance companies already are figuring global warming into how they do business .
Climates in the higher latitudes also show dramatic change .
In their report , published in the journal , “ Science , ” Battisti and Naylor describe changes in temperatures in France .
“ The warmest on record to date so far , the odds are 50 - 50 basically that that ’s going to be the ( average ) temperature in the summer at the end of the century . ”
That ’s significant because the warmest summer on record was in 2003 , when anywhere from 30,000 to 50,000 deaths in Europe were blamed on the heat .
Too much of a good thing
While warm weather at the right time can kick start growth , a hotter than average summer for the entire season is not good for plants .
In their report the researchers noted that during that same 2003 European heat wave , “ Italy experienced a record drop in maize yields of 36 % from a year earlier , whereas in France maize and fodder production fell by 30 % , fruit harvests declined by 25 % and wheat harvests … declined by 21 % . ”
Maize is any of several varieties of corn .
Other studies have looked at the impact of a warmer climate on key crops .
One study found that increased average night temperatures will adversely impact rice crops .
However , it is in the developing countries that Battisti sees the greatest urgency for finding a solution .
He says that in those areas by the end of the century , “ You should expect large reductions in yields . ”
What ’s worse , he points out that these areas “ already need food today , ” with a billion malnourished people .
Battisti says the area ’s economy is also a problem , noting , “ There ’s not many options in this case in terms of changing what you grow or investing in new technologies because these places are relatively poor today . ”
The authors say that among the solutions that need to be explored are finding varieties of today ’s crops that will withstand future growing conditions .
Of the climate itself , Battisti says , " In a sense you can say that the climate of the end of this century is really out of bounds from any experiences to date . "
This study was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Tamaki Foundation and appears in the January 9 , 2009 issue of the journal “ Science . "

It ’s common for Smalltalk implementations to run on multiple platforms , and that leads to the problem of designing a framework to allow an application UI to display on all those platforms .
The existing solutions ( not only in Smalltalk ) suffer from various shortcomings .
In order to solve this problem better , Brazil from the start was based on a number of principles different from the industry examples .
Here is an overview of those principles .
It ’s not about widgets .
A UI framework is not ( just ) a widget library .
In that sense , Morphic is on the right track ( and in the mainstream , so is WPF ) .
Interfaces visualize information , and a good interactive visualization is typically more than a window with a few labels and list boxes plopped onto it .
A UI framework needs to do much of what was traditionally expected from a structured graphics ( “ diagramming ” ) framework .
Of course , buttons , list boxes and other primitive interactive elements are still necessary , but the value of a framework is primarily in composing rather than in implementing them .
Which , in fact , it should n’t do at all .
When it ’s about widgets , it ’s about native widgets .
Any OS provides about the same core set of primitive interactive elements .
They are what the users expect to see in a “ real program ” , and the OS by definition does a better job implementing them than anyone could ever hope to .
Emulated widgets are bound to be a poor replica of the original and are thus an exercise in futility .
On the way from Smalltalk - 80 , one attraction of the emulated approach might have been the ability to customize , extend and roll your own , for the sake of creating more expressive UIs .
But when a UI framework is also a graphics framework , expressive UIs can be built by composition rather than by widget hacking — so there really is no good reason not to use what ’s already available , even if its implementation is sealed inside the OS .
Cross - platform should n’t mean platform - agnostic .
So what about the lowest common denominator problem ?
It ’s often assumed that using native widgets in a cross- platform environment means that only the subset of their features common across all platforms can be accessible .
The mistake of this view is the assumption that it ’s not cross-platform unless the user is shielded from platform differences .
It does n’t have to be that way , and should n’t be .
Platforms are different , and a properly designed cross-platform framework should embrace and model those differences rather than try and inevitably fail creating an illusion that they do not exist .
In practice , such modeling means that a framework object that represents a widget can provide access to the lowest common denominator features , while platform - specific features can be available as a “ capability ” — a separate object one can fetch from the widget when the capability is available ( i.e. when the current platform is the one whose capabilities you ask for ) .
Qt is not your friend .
It ’s a common and understandable question — why not use an existing cross- platform framework like Qt or wxWidgets .
Everything that has been said above is reason enough , and another important consideration is that a large complex hard - to - debug third party layer shielding you from the OS facilities you want to use sounds like bad news ( something I dubbed as “ high Space Shuttle factor ” in the original implementation study ) .
Which is also related to the last point .
If it ’s not written in Smalltalk , it ’s broken .
There is a tendency ( at least in Smalltalk - 80 descendants ) to do OS interaction through primitives .
That is so perhaps because FFI arrived relatively late to ObjectWorks , and never was available for Squeak .
Primitives are an arcane enough feature , so they are not discussed in Smalltalk style guides .
If they were , the guides might have said something like this : many primitives you see in VisualWorks and Squeak should not have existed .
A primitive is supposed to do what cannot be expressed in Smalltalk .
If a call out to the OS or a call back from the OS cannot be expressed in Smalltalk , you need an FFI , not a VM plugin .
OS interaction is not something that belongs in a primitive — and if fact , a primitive is about the worst place to do that kind of work .
It means writing a large body of complex code in a low - level language with a higher probability of making a mistake , and then hiding it away in the VM where it ca n’t be easily debugged and fixed .
Hardly a winning combination .
From the time of his death in 1865 to the 200th anniversary of his birth , February 12 , 2009 , there has never been a decade in which Abraham Lincoln 's influence has not been felt .
Yet it has not been a smooth , unfolding history , but a jagged narrative filled with contention and revisionism .
Lincoln 's legacy has shifted again and again as different groups have interpreted him .
Northerners and Southerners , blacks and whites , East Coast elites and prairie Westerners , liberals and conservatives , the religious and secular , scholars and popularizers — all have recalled a sometimes startlingly different Lincoln .
He has been lifted up by both sides of the Temperance Movement ; invoked for and against federal intervention in the economy ; heralded by anti-communists , such as Senator Joseph McCarthy , and by American communists , such as those who joined the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the fight against the fascist Spanish government in the 1930s .
Lincoln has been used to justify support for and against incursions on civil liberties , and has been proclaimed both a true and a false friend to African - Americans .
Was he at heart a " progressive man " whose death was an " unspeakable calamity " for African - Americans , as Frederick Douglass insisted in 1865 ?
Or was he " the embodiment ... of the American Tradition of racism , " as African - American writer Lerone Bennett Jr. sought to document in a 2000 book ?
It is often argued that Lincoln 's abiding reputation is the result of his martyrdom .
And certainly the assassination , occurring as it did on Good Friday , propelled him into reverential heights .
Speaking at a commemoration at the Athenaeum Club in New York City on April 18 , 1865 , three days after Lincoln died , Parke Godwin , editor of the Evening Post , summed up the prevailing mood .
" No loss has been comparable to his , " Godwin said .
" Never in human history has there been so universal , so spontaneous , so profound an expression of a nation 's bereavement . "
He was the first American president to be assassinated , and waves of grief touched every type of neighborhood and every class — at least in the North .
But the shock at the murder explains only part of the tidal wave of mourning .
It is hard to imagine that the assassination of James Buchanan or Franklin Pierce would have had the same impact on the national psyche .
The level of grief reflected who Lincoln was and what he had come to represent .
" Through all his public function , " Godwin said , " there shone the fact that he was a wise and good man .... [ He was ] our supremest leader — our safest counsellor — our wisest friend — our dear father . "
Not everyone agreed .
Northern Democrats had been deeply opposed to Lincoln 's wartime suspension of habeas corpus , which led to the imprisonment without trial of thousands of suspected traitors and war protesters .
Though Lincoln had taken care to proceed constitutionally and with restraint , his opponents decried his " tyrannical " rule .
But in the wake of the assassination even his critics were silent .
Across much of the South , of course , Lincoln was hated , even in death .
Though Robert E. Lee and many Southerners expressed regret over the murder , others saw it as an act of Providence , and cast John Wilkes Booth as the bold slayer of an American tyrant .
" All honor to J. Wilkes Booth , " wrote Southern diarist Kate Stone ( referring as well to the simultaneous , though not fatal , attack on Secretary of State William Seward ) : " What torrents of blood Lincoln has caused to flow , and how Seward has aided him in his bloody work .
I can not be sorry for their fate .
They deserve it .
They have reaped their just reward . "
Four years after Lincoln 's death , Massachusetts journalist Russell Conwell found widespread , lingering bitterness toward Lincoln in the ten former Confederate states that Conwell visited .
" Portraits of Jeff Davis and Lee hang in all their parlors , decorated with Confederate flags , " he wrote .
" Photographs of Wilkes Booth , with the last words of great martyrs printed upon its borders ; effigies of Abraham Lincoln hanging by the neck ... adorn their drawing rooms . "
The Rebellion here " seems not to be dead yet , " Conwell concluded .
For their part , African - Americans ' pangs of loss were tinged with fear for their future .
Few promoted Lincoln 's legacy more passionately than critic - turned - admirer Frederick Douglass , whose frustration at the presidency of Andrew Johnson kept growing .
Lincoln was " a progressive man , a human man , an honorable man , and at heart an antislavery man , " Douglass wrote in December 1865 .
" I assume ... had Abraham Lincoln been spared to see this day , the negro of the South would have had more hope of enfranchisement . "
Ten years later , at the dedication of the Freedmen 's Memorial in Washington , D.C. , Douglass seemed to recant these words , calling Lincoln " preeminently the white man 's President " and American blacks " at best only his step - children . "
But Douglass ' purpose that day was to puncture the sentimentality of the occasion and to criticize the government 's abandonment of Reconstruction .
And in the final decades of his long life Douglass repeatedly invoked Lincoln as having embodied the spirit of racial progress .
Douglass ' worries about America proved prophetic .
By the 1890s , with the failure of Reconstruction and the advent of Jim Crow , Lincoln 's legacy of emancipation lay in ruins .
Regional reconciliation — the healing of the rift between North and South — had supplanted the nation 's commitment to civil rights .
In 1895 , at a gathering of Union and Confederate soldiers in Chicago , the topics of slavery and race were set aside in favor of a focus on North - South reconciliation .
As the 1909 centennial of Lincoln 's birth approached , race relations in the country were reaching a nadir .
In August 1908 , riots broke out in Lincoln 's hometown of Springfield , Illinois , after a white woman , Mabel Hallam , claimed she had been raped by a local black man , George Richardson .
( She later admitted to making up the story . )
On Friday , August 14 , two thousand white men and boys began to attack African - Americans and set fire to black businesses .
" Lincoln freed you , " rioters were heard to yell .
" We 'll show you where you belong . "
The next night , the mob approached the shop of William Donnegan , a 79 - year - old African - American shoemaker who had made boots for Lincoln and at whose brother 's barbershop Lincoln used to mingle with African - Americans .
Setting fire to Donnegan 's shop , the mob dragged the old man outside and pelted him with bricks , then slashed his throat .
Still alive , he was dragged across the street into a school courtyard .
There , not far from a statue of Abraham Lincoln , he was hoisted up a tree and left to die .
Horrified by the reports of such ugly violence , a group of New York City activists formed the National Negro Committee , soon to be renamed the NAACP , with a young scholar named W.E.B. Du Bois to serve as director of publicity and research .
From its beginning , the organization 's mission was intertwined with Lincoln's , as one of its early statements made clear : " Abraham Lincoln began the emancipation of the Negro American .
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People proposes to complete it . "
The centennial of Lincoln 's birth marked the largest commemoration of any person in American history .
The Lincoln penny was minted , the first coin bearing the image of an American president , and talks took place in Washington about a grand Lincoln monument to be erected in the nation 's capital .
All across the country , and in many nations around the world , America 's 16th president was extolled .
An editorial in the London Times declared , " Together with Washington , Lincoln occupies a pinnacle to which no third person is likely to attain . "
The commander of the Brazilian Navy ordered a 21 - gun salute " in homage to the memory of that noble martyr of moral and of neighborly love . "
The former states of the Confederacy , which less than 50 years earlier had rejoiced at Lincoln 's death , now paid tribute to the leader who had reunified the nation .
W. C. Calland , a state official in Missouri — which , during the Civil War , had been a border state that contributed 40,000 troops to the Confederate cause — barely contained his astonishment in a memorandum reporting on the festivities : " Perhaps no event could have gathered around it so much of patriotic sentiment in the South as the birthday of Abraham Lincoln .... Confederate veterans held public services and gave public expression to the sentiment , that had ‘ Lincoln lived ' the days of reconstruction might have been softened and the era of good feeling ushered in earlier . "
In most of America the celebrations were thoroughly segregated , including in Springfield , where blacks ( with the exception of a declined invitation to Booker T. Washington ) were excluded from a dazzling gala dinner .
As the Chicago Tribune reported , it " is to be a lily white affair from start to finish . "
Across town , inside one of Springfield 's most prominent black churches , African - Americans met for their own celebration .
" We colored people love and revere the memory of Lincoln , " said the Rev. L. H. Magee .
" His name is a synonym for the freedom of wife , husband and children , and a chance to live in a free country , fearless of the slave - catcher and his bloodhounds . "
Referring to the " sacred dust of the great emancipator " lying in Springfield 's Oak Ridge Cemetery , Magee called upon black people across America to make pilgrimages to Lincoln 's tomb .
And he cast his gaze forward a hundred years — to the bicentennial of 2009 — and envisioned a Lincoln celebration " by the great - grandchildren of those who celebrate this centenary . "
In that far - off year , Magee predicted , " prejudice shall have been banished as a myth and relegated to the dark days of ‘ Salem witchcraft . ' "
A notable exception to the rule of segregated commemorations took place in Kentucky , where President Theodore Roosevelt , a longtime Lincoln admirer , presided over a dramatic ceremony at the old Lincoln homestead .
Lincoln 's birth cabin , of dubious provenance , had been purchased from promoters who had been displaying it around the country .
Now the state , with Congressional support , planned to rebuild it on its original site , on a knoll above the Sinking Spring that had originally attracted Thomas Lincoln , the president 's father , to the property .
The 110 - acre farmstead would become the " nation 's commons , " it was declared — a crossroads linking the entire country .
Seven thousand people showed up for the dedication , including a number of African - Americans , who mixed in among the others with no thought of separation .
When Roosevelt began his speech he hopped onto a chair and was greeted by cheers .
" As the years [ roll ] by , " he said in his crisp , excitable voice , " ... this whole Nation will grow to feel a peculiar sense of pride in the mightiest of the mighty men who mastered the mighty days ; the lover of his country and of all mankind ; the man whose blood was shed for the union of his people and for the freedom of a race : Abraham Lincoln . "
The ceremony in Kentucky heralded the possibility of national reconciliation and racial justice proceeding hand in hand .
But that was not to be , as the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington , D.C. 13 years later would make all too clear .
Members of the Lincoln Memorial commission — created by Congress in 1911 — saw the monument not only as a tribute to the 16th president but also as a symbol of a reunified nation .
With Northerners and Southerners having fought side by side in the Spanish - American War of 1898 and again in World War I , it was time , they felt , to put aside sectional differences once and for all .
This meant that the Lincoln honored on the National Mall must not be the man who had broken the South militarily or had crushed the institution of slavery but the preserver of the Union .
" By emphasizing his saving the Union you appeal to both sections , " wrote Royal Cortissoz , author of the inscription that would be etched inside the finished building behind Daniel Chester French 's nearly 20 - foot - tall sculpture of the seated Lincoln .
" By saying nothing about slavery you avoid the rubbing of old sores . "
Two American presidents — Warren G. Harding and William Howard Taft — took part in the dedication ceremonies held on May 30 , 1922 , and loudspeakers on the memorial 's rooftop carried the festivities across the Mall .
Black guests were seated in a " colored section " off to the side .
The commissioners had included a black speaker in the program ; not wanting an activist who might challenge the mostly white audience , they had chosen Robert Russa Moton , the mild - mannered president of Tuskegee Institute , and required him to submit his text in advance for revision .
But in what turned out to be the most powerful speech of the day , Moton highlighted Lincoln 's emancipationist legacy and challenged Americans to live up to their calling to be a people of " equal justice and equal opportunity . "
In the days that followed , Moton 's speech went almost entirely unreported .
Even his name was dropped from the record — in most accounts Moton was referred to simply as " a representative of the race . "
African - Americans across the country were outraged .
The Chicago Defender , an African - American weekly , urged a boycott of the Lincoln Memorial until it was properly dedicated to the real Lincoln .
Not long afterward , at a large gathering in front of the monument , Bishop E.D.W.
Jones , an African - American religious leader , insisted that " the immortality of the great emancipator lay not in his preservation of the Union , but in his giving freedom to the negroes of America . "
In the decades since , the Lincoln Memorial has been the scene of many dramatic moments in history .
A photograph of President Franklin D. Roosevelt taken at the memorial on February 12 , 1938 , shows him leaning against a military attaché , his hand on his heart .
" I do not know which party Lincoln would belong to if he were alive , " Roosevelt said two years later .
" His sympathies and his motives of championship of humanity itself have made him for all centuries to come the legitimate property of all parties — of every man and woman and child in every part of our land . "
On April 9 , 1939 , after being denied the use of Constitution Hall in Washington because of her race , the great contralto Marian Anderson was invited to sing at the Lincoln Memorial .
Seventy - five thousand people , black and white , gathered at the monument for an emotional concert that further linked Lincoln 's memory to racial progress .
Three years later , during the bleak days of World War II , when it seemed that the Allies might lose the war , Lincoln 's memory served as a potent force of national encouragement .
In July 1942 , on an outdoor stage within view of the Lincoln Memorial , a powerful performance of Aaron Copland 's " Lincoln Portrait " took place , with Carl Sandburg reading Lincoln 's words , including " we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain . "
In 1957 , a 28 - year - old Martin Luther King Jr. came to the Lincoln Memorial to help lead a protest for black voting rights .
" The spirit of Lincoln still lives , " he had proclaimed before the protest .
Six years later , in 1963 , he returned for the March on Washington .
The August day was bright and sunny , and more than 200,000 people , black and white , converged on the Mall in front of the Lincoln Memorial .
King 's speech called Lincoln 's Emancipation Proclamation " a beacon of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been scarred in the flame of withering injustice . "
But it was not enough , he went on , simply to glorify the past .
" One hundred years later we must face the tragic fact the Negro is still not free .... is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chain of discrimination . "
And then he told the enraptured crowd , " I have a dream . "
Author and New York Times book critic Richard Bernstein later called King 's words " the single most important piece of American oratory since Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address . "
Just three months after the speech , President John F. Kennedy would be assassinated , ushering in a period of national grief not unlike that after Lincoln 's murder .
Also echoing the previous century , Kennedy 's efforts to advance civil rights had prompted some to mourn him as the " second emancipator . "
A. Philip Randolph , who had organized the March on Washington , declared that the time had come to complete " this unfinished business of American democracy for which two presidents have died . "
To address a profound need for national healing and unity , JFK's widow , Jacqueline Kennedy — in consultation with other family members and official planners — decided to model her slain husband 's funeral upon Lincoln's .
The president 's casket was laid in state inside the White House East Room , and was later taken to the Great Rotunda of the Capitol and rested upon the catafalque used at Lincoln 's funeral .
On their final procession to Arlington National Cemetery , the funeral cars passed reverently by the Lincoln Memorial .
One of the most poignant images from that era was a political cartoon drawn by Bill Mauldin , depicting the statue of Lincoln bent over in grief .
In the nearly half century since , Lincoln 's reputation has been under assault from various quarters .
Malcolm
X broke with the long tradition of African - American admiration for Lincoln , saying in 1964 that he had done " more to trick Negroes than any other man in history . "
In 1968 , pointing to clear examples of Lincoln 's racial prejudice , Lerone Bennett Jr. asked in Ebony magazine , " Was Abe Lincoln a White Supremacist ? "
( His answer : yes . )
The 1960s and ' 70s were a period in which icons of all kinds — especially great leaders of the past — were being smashed , and Lincoln was no exception .
Old arguments surfaced that he had never really cared about emancipation , that he was at heart a political opportunist .
States ' rights libertarians criticized his aggressive handling of the Civil War , his assaults on civil liberties and his aggrandizing of federal government .
In particular , the Nixon administration 's perceived abuse of executive power during the Vietnam War prompted unflattering comparisons with Lincoln 's wartime measures .
Some scholars , however , rejected such comparisons , noting that Lincoln reluctantly did what he thought necessary to preserve the Constitution and the nation .
Historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. , for one , wrote in 1973 that since the Vietnam War did n't rise to the same level of national crisis , Nixon " has sought to establish as a normal Presidential power what previous Presidents had regarded as power justified only by extreme emergencies .
. . .
He does not , like Lincoln , confess to doubt about the legality of his course . "
Decades later , another war would again bring Lincoln 's legacy to the fore .
Shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , President George W. Bush addressed Congress with words evocative of Lincoln 's comments at the outset of the Civil War : " The course of this conflict is not known , " Bush said , " yet its outcome is certain .
Freedom and fear , justice and cruelty , have always been at war , and we know that God is not neutral between them . "
As in the Vietnam era , subsequent controversies over the White House 's conduct of the war on terror — such as the use of secret wiretapping and the detention of " enemy combatants " without trial — provoked another round of debates over presidential powers and the precedents created by Lincoln .
Despite such lingering controversies , Lincoln has consistently polled as one of the three greatest U.S. presidents , along with George Washington and Franklin D. Roosevelt .
And though many African - Americans lost their veneration for him over the decades , recent statements by President Barack Obama and others suggest renewed appreciation .
It was black Americans , after all , who refused to give up on Lincoln 's emancipationist legacy even when American whites wanted to forget it .
And if Lincoln shared in the racial prejudice of his day , it is also true that his outlook grew significantly over the years of his presidency .
He was " the first great man that I talked with in the United States freely , " Frederick Douglass wrote , " who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself , of the difference of color . "
And yet , as Bennett and others have rightly insisted , the Lincoln of earlier generations of blacks was also in part a mythic figure — his own racial prejudices passed over too lightly , even as African - Americans ' roles in emancipation were underemphasized .
In a series of 1922 editorials for the NAACP journal the Crisis , W.E.B. Du Bois stressed the importance of taking Lincoln off his pedestal in order to place attention on the need for ongoing progress .
But Du Bois refused to reject Lincoln in the process .
" The scars and foibles and contradictions of the Great do not diminish but enhance the worth and meaning of their upward struggle , " he wrote .
Of all the great figures of the 19th century , " Lincoln is to me the most human and lovable .
And I love him not because he was perfect but because he was not and yet triumphed . "
In a 2005 essay in Time magazine , Obama said much the same thing : " I am fully aware of his limited views on race .
But ...[ in ] the midst of slavery 's dark storm and the complexities of governing a house divided , he somehow kept his moral compass pointed firm and true . "
Lincoln will always remain the president who helped destroy slavery and preserved the Union .
With stubbornness , caution and an exquisite sense of timing , he engaged almost physically with unfolding history .
Derided by some as an opportunist , he was in fact an artist , responding to events as he himself changed over time , allowing himself to grow into a true reformer .
Misjudged as a mere jokester , incompetent , unserious , he was in fact the most serious actor on the political stage .
He was politically shrewd , and he took a long view of history .
And he knew when to strike to obtain his ends .
Just for his work on behalf of the 13th Amendment , which abolished slavery in the United States , he has earned a permanent place in the history of human freedom .
In addition , he was a man of patience who refused to demonize others ; a person of the middle who could build bridges across chasms .
Herein may lie one of his most important legacies — his unwavering desire to reunite the American people .
In Chicago 's Grant Park , the night he was declared the winner of the 2008 election , Obama sought to capture that sentiment , quoting from Lincoln 's first inaugural address : " We are not enemies , but friends ....
Though passion may have strained , it must not break our bonds of affection . "
And with the inauguration of the nation 's first African - American president , we remember that , in 1864 , with the Union war effort going badly , the national government might have been tempted to suspend the upcoming elections .
Not only did Lincoln insist they take place , he staked his campaign on a controversial platform calling for the 13th Amendment , willing to risk everything on its behalf .
When he went on to an overwhelming victory in November , he obtained a mandate to carry through his program .
" [ I ] f the rebellion could force us to forego , or postpone a national election , " he spoke to a gathered crowd from a White House window , " it might fairly claim to have already conquered and ruined us .... [ The election ] has demonstrated that a people 's government can sustain a national election , in the midst of a great civil war . "
Around the world , governments routinely suspend elections , citing the justification of a " national emergency . "
Yet Lincoln set a precedent that would guarantee the voting rights of the American people through subsequent wars and economic depressions .
Though our understanding of him is more nuanced than it once was , and we are more able to recognize his limitations as well as his strengths , Abraham Lincoln remains the great example of democratic leadership — by most criteria , truly our greatest president .

We 've all seen them : on comes a commercial with a young , casually dressed , if somewhat unkempt , young man , and an older , portly man in a very middle - management - esque suit .
The younger man announces " I'm a Mac " while the older responds " And I 'm a PC , " and the two go on to lament some critical design failure facing the PC to which the Mac is impervious .
As Linux users , we know the basic premise of the commercial — that " I'm a PC " means " I run Windows " — is a fallacy , and what is really needed is a third cast member declaring " I'm Linux . "
If such a thought has ever crossed your mind , then fire up your camera , because the time to act is now .
The Linux Foundation — the Oregon - based non-profit responsible for promoting Linux and keeping developer - in - chief Linus Torvalds off the dole — is about to launch a contest aimed at filling the Linux gap left in the " I'm a Mac / I'm a PC " commercials , and as one might expect , have set out a competition that highlights the collaborative nature of the Linux community .
The contest is open - entry , and invites contestants to submit user - created video that " showcases just what Linux means to those who use it , and hopefully inspires many to try it . "
Though the Apple / Microsoft commercials are certainly the inspiration for the contest , submissions are not required to follow the established " I'm a Mac / I'm a PC " format — indeed , one need not reference the " other " operating systems at all .
Entry , which begins on Monday , January 26 , is open to those eighteen and over — due to legal restrictions — should be sixty seconds or less , must not be in violation of the Foundation 's Terms of Service , and must be submitted by midnight Pacific time on March 15 , 2009 .
Judges will be selected by the Foundation , and will judge submissions based on " originality , clarity of message and how much it inspires others to use Linux . "
The Linux community will be invited to vote and comment on submissions , and the judges will include this feedback in their decision , though a high number of votes it is not the only criteria for winning .
Multiple unique entries are encouraged , and may be as simple or elaborate as the contestant prefers .
Companies and groups — for example , Canonical or Novell , Ubuntu or openSUSE — are welcome to submit one or more entries representing their group , but only individuals may win the actual prize , so a " designated winner " must be identified .
Speaking of the prize , the lucky winner receives free hotel / airfare / registration for the Linux Foundation Japan Symposium , held in Narita , Japan in October .
If you 've ever wanted to get your Spielberg on and spread Linux love at the same time , now is the time to get cracking .
We look forward to seeing what Linux Journal readers , and all Linux users , come up with — coming from the Linux community , we know it 'll be an event to remember .
New Yorker Films , the distributor that helped introduce American moviegoers to the works of Bernardo Bertolucci , Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Ousmane Sembène , announced on Monday that it was going out of business after 44 years .
One of the most influential distributors of foreign and independent films , New Yorker has amassed a library of more than 400 titles , including Jean - Luc Godard ’s “ Breathless ” and Claude Lanzmann ’s epic Holocaust documentary “ Shoah , ” said Dan Talbot , who founded the company in 1965 .
Mr. Talbot , 82 , said in a telephone interview that the company was going out of business because its library was being sold .
It had been pledged as collateral on a loan taken out by its former owner , Madstone Films , which bought New Yorker Films in 2002 .
The library could be auctioned off as early as next week , he added .
New Yorker Films held rights to distribute movies to theaters and to institutions like colleges , and also to release DVDs .

May 9th is National Lost Sock Memorial Day .
I believe that every washing machine manufactured after 1963 was designed to eat precisely one sock per month , just to keep everybody in the consumer world a little off - balance .
So where do all the socks go ?
They 're sacrificed , with noble intent , for our collective unease .
It 's a religion I 'm starting .
And , of course , I 'll be taking donations ...
Milan 08 : Clock by Christiaan Postma consists of more than 150 synchronised clock mechanisms , which rotate metal bars that briefly align to spell the appropriate time ( click to play the movie above to see how it works ) .
Postma showed the project at Spazio Rossana Orlandi .
" The starting point with this project was a personal study about form and time , " says Postma .
" I put together more than 150 individual clockworks and made them work together to become one clock .
I show the progress of time by letting the numbers be written in words by the clockworks .
Reading clockwise , the time being is visible through a word and readable by the completeness of the word , 12 words from ' one ' to ' twelve ' .
" The word “ three ” completely appears when it ’s exactly 3 o’clock and will then transform again as time passes .
The word “ four ” begins to appear and at exactly 4 o’clock the word “ four ” is clearly visible .
The word “ three ” is by then totally vanished and no longer readable . "
The clock measures 140 x 140 cm .
Harley is one lucky dog .
Not only did he survive a raging inferno that killed scores of pets two days ago , but he 's just gone to a loving new home .
The 15 - month - old Shih Tzu was one of nine dogs rescued by firefighters as an early morning blaze gutted Durham Region Humane Society 's animal shelter in Oshawa .
The $ 250,000 fire is still under investigation by the Ontario Fire Marshal 's office , but shelter manager Ruby Richards said preliminary reports indicate it started in the ceiling and may – a sad irony for the cats – have been sparked by mice chewing through electrical wires .
" It was devastating , " Harley 's new owner , Judy Hannah , said of the fire .
She and her husband , Barry , feared Harley , whom they had already adopted , was among the victims because he was at the Waterloo St. shelter waiting to be neutered before they could take him home .
" He is a sweetheart , " Barry said yesterday as the happy pup wriggled in his arms after they collected him from the Oshawa Animal Services shelter , where the rescued animals were taken .
The Newcastle couple lost their toy poodle to cancer two months ago .
Close to 100 cats , three dogs and several rabbits and rodents perished in the blaze .
The initial death toll of 150 cats was downgraded after firefighters tallied the bodies yesterday .
Animal lovers across the country rallied to help as the news spread .
" It 's been crazy here , " said Richards .
" People are very upset and some people have just been crying on the phone . "
Donations poured in to their website and offers of temporary locations , food and supplies kept staff hopping all day .
Whitby mother Candie Abramson and her sons M.J. , 13 , and Quinton , 11 , arrived at the Animal Services shelter on Farewell St. with cash donations in lieu of Christmas gifts for their teachers .
" How many coffee mugs and boxes of chocolates do they really need ? " said Abramson .
" We thought this way would benefit the little people with four legs . "
Coincidentally , the 50 members of the Divine Light Spiritual Foundation in Oshawa had already picked the humane society for their annual charity donation .
" When we heard about the fire , we thought , ` This is imperative , let 's get this done now , ' " said Rev. Alva Folkes of the $ 5,000 gift .
Animal welfare workers were thrilled with the public response .
But leaving so many animals unattended overnight shocked one Toronto pet owner , who questioned the society 's ability to provide safe and adequate care .

" I 'm really angry about this , " Wayne Webster said .

Update :
I made three new videos of 2009 with my 5D Mark II last year .

One year in 40 seconds from Eirik Solheim on Vimeo .
So far I ’ve made two videos of the images I describe in this article .
The one here at the top and another two minutes version .
Read on to learn how I did this , to see the other video and to download the videos and images in high quality .
And if you want to watch this video here at the top in HD quality you have to click through to Vimeo .
The story
Back in 2005 I did an experiment shooting images out of my window for one year .
It turned out pretty cool and in the end of 2007 I decided to do the same .
But in much better quality .
So I started shooting images with my Canon 400D .
From the same spot each time , but not through my window .
I found a spot outside that gave more or less the same framing each time I placed my camera .
So , I went out on our balcony snapping some images at pretty irregular intervals all through 2008 .
Each time I snapped the following images :
3 exposures @ 10 mm ( Canon EF - S 10 - 22 F3.5-4.5 USM )
3 exposures @ 17 mm ( Canon EF - S 17-55 f2.8 IS USM )
3 exposures @ 55 mm ( Canon EF - S 17-55 f2.8 IS USM )
All images shot in RAW .
The three exposures where : normal , +2 EV and - 2 EV .
In addition to the images I decided to record some audio at the same place .
Using my Canon S2 IS and my Canon HF10 I recorded simple background sounds trough 2008 as well .
Not with exact connections to each image .
More with a focus on getting audio from winter , spring , summer and autumn .
All together giving me a pretty decent range of material to put together some experiments .
Then what ?
The videos …
Link to this video in HD on YouTube .
At the top of this article you find a 40 second version that show one year .
Using the 10 mm wide angle images .
Right above you find a two minute version made from the 55 mm zoomed in images .
First I used Photomatix to make HDR images of the ones I decided to use .
Mostly because the HDR effect makes the images flat so that the difference in light and shadows wo n’t disturb the transitions in my video .
Then I used Photoshop to align all the images .
Placing the camera manually at the same spot each time wo n’t give the exact same spot .
So I needed some fine adjustment .
Photoshop does this .
Here ’s how :
First load the images you have chosen into layers by using “ File -> Scripts - > Load files into stack “
When you have found all your files make sure to check “ Attempt to automatically align … “
Give your computer huge amounts of time and get back when it has finished .
Now Photoshop has adjusted all the images and put them on separate layers in one file .
The next thing you have to do is to crop the image .
Because of the adjustments the images are not the exact same size .
A crop will do the trick .
When the computer is done cropping you export the layers to files .
“ File -> Scripts -> Export Layers to files “
Now you have a folder with a bunch of images with the same framing .
I decided to do simple dissolves between them .
And ended up with a project in Final Cut Express that looked like the image above .
I did n’t want one dissolve at a time .
I wanted to make some kind of flow where one dissolve is taken over by the new one before it is finished .
As you can see from the timeline my dissolves overlap .

Meeting another milestone for the open source effort to extend Microsoft 's .NET platform outside of Windows , the Mono Project -- backed by Novell , but with a little help from Microsoft too now and then -- is celebrating the release of version 2.2 this week .
Perhaps the most important addition to this latest release is full support for SIMD ( Single Instruction / Multiple Data ) extensions , which should provide orders of magnitude in performance improvements for developers who are building .NET games -- and there are more of these developers in high places than you might think -- to run cross-platform .
" When the Mono runtime 's SIMD optimization are active the operations on the structures defined in this namespace are mapped to hardware operations which can improve the performance of your graphics , multimedia or 3D operations significantly , " reads a recent edition to Mono 's online documentation .
Advertisement
An October 2008 demonstration at PDC by Mono 's lead developer , Miguel de Icaza , demonstrates the speed explosion up - close .
The graph depicts the standard Mono common language runtime 's ability to do sophisticated 3D graphics , and when you 're talking about time , you do n't want to be the bar on the bottom of the chart .
But there it is , and obviously , compiled C++ will be much faster .
But look at the tiny little pair of bars at the top : That 's Mono with SIMD extensions .
What 's very , very interesting about this development is that it places
Mono in a class that 's conceivably above even .NET itself .
Game developers may even consider writing for Mono for Windows instead of .NET for this very reason .
As InfoQ's Jonathan Allen put it , " Mono is outgrowing the standard .
Mono is not just playing catch - up any more , it is trying to move past the CLR in many areas .
And as an open source project , they can slip in new libraries at a much faster clip than Microsoft . "
DIGG THIS
It ’s hardly a news flash that many people who are widely regarded as lions of the pro-market side have gone over to the dark side in recent months .
I am not going to name any names ; if you are one of the guilty parties , you know who you are ; and the rest of us know , too , owing to your public expressions of anti-market sentiment in newspapers and on the World Wide Web .
Why have so many notable economists and others jumped ship ?
Many , it appears , have simply panicked .
Starting late last summer , the financial markets began to exhibit tremendous volatility , officials at the Fed and the Treasury began to act as if imminent disaster loomed , and media commentators and reporters completely lost their composure .
Even people who should have known better began to talk and to act as if the economy stood on the brink of complete collapse unless the government took unprecedented actions immediately .
When one extraordinary action failed to calm the waters at once , another extraordinary action was taken , then another , and another .
We now look back on four months littered with ad hoc bailouts , new regulations , institutional takeovers , a gigantic bail - out statute , massive lending , asset exchanges , and loan guarantees never before made by the Fed and the Treasury — all on a scale that no one foresaw six months ago .
We might understand that the big bankers and other financial masters of the universe who had got themselves and their mega-institutions into such deep trouble would have worked hard to create a sense of crisis and to exploit it as a pretext for cushioning their slide from the financial pinnacles — peaks so high that the air is thin and the brain does not function effectively , so that even such workaday necessities as due diligence are overlooked .
Blessed with friends in high places , these financial titans snatched loot by the hundreds of billions while the snatching was good .
But why have free - market economists and other commentators expressed approval of this blatant piracy ?
It now appears , I am saddened to report , that these free - market experts were not so expert after all .
Indeed , many of them seem to have failed to understand how markets work and how government actions can hobble or kill those workings .
Many have talked as if they actually believe in vulgar Keynesianism or other crackpot ideas — about " systemic risk " where none exists or about " missing markets " for poor - quality assets that only a fool would try to sell privately when the alternative of a munificent government buyout shimmers on the horizon .
Despite the evidence of how counterproductive all of these frantic government actions have been , of how they have served above all to produce " regime uncertainty " about what the rules will be tomorrow or the next day , and thereby to paralyze private arrangements , the market ’s fair weather friends are now clamoring for various species of government " stimulus " as soon as the Obama regime takes power .
Of course , the Obamistas ’ motives are purely political , as befits a pack of office holders and their lackeys , so it is pointless to indict them — a rattlesnake is not to be blamed if it strikes , because its nature impels it to do so .
But why are well - known free - market economists going along with this nonsense ?
Back in my days as a professor , I always endeavored early in the course to teach my students the fundamental importance not only of the first laws of demand and supply , but also of the second laws of demand and supply .
Thus , the first law of supply states that the greater the price , the greater is the quantity supplied per unit of time , other things being equal .
And the second law of supply states that the own - price elasticity of supply is greater , the greater is the time allowed for response to a change in price .
The first and second laws of demand are expressed similarly , mutatis mutandis .
Thus , although we can expect markets to respond to price changes , we must recognize that the responses take time ; and the greater the time , the greater are the responses .
Anyone who expects markets to restore a disturbed equilibrium instantaneously will be disappointed .
People cannot discover the relevant changes , confirm and assess them , consider alternative arrangements of their affairs , and carry out those changes in an instant .
The competent economist appreciates the necessity of patience in evaluating the market ’s operation .
Simply because the market does not appear to have reconfigured itself fully soon after a shock , we have no warrant to conclude that " the market does n’t work anymore " or that " the market does n’t work the way it used to . "
Such statements manifest an economic crackpot , and economists who talk this way discredit their professional competence .
A clever riposte , of course , is the one that Keynes himself famously made in response to criticism of inconstancy in his views : " When the facts change , I change my mind .
What do you do , sir ? "
Glibness , however , is a poor substitute for good sense , and Keynes ’s critics were right to call him to account for his frequent shifts with the winds of events and intellectual fads .
Nothing that has happened recently invalidates in the slightest the solid corpus of sound economic understanding .
Indeed , such understanding allows us to comprehend how a variety of government policies created the incentives that , by various paths , led to the current difficulties ; and such understanding informs us that piling new , equally foolish polices on top of the ones that got us into these straits is a recipe for short - term salvation at best , and for long - term troubles galore , even if the short - term " stimulus " should appear to have the desired effects .
Decent analysts know these things ; I am not breaking new ground here .
So , we can only shake our heads in wonder when we see well - known free - market economists and other formerly sound analysts and commentators embracing unsound and ill - considered positions .
Among other things , we must appreciate that the sky is not falling , even if the news media and the politicians talk and act as if it is .
Yes , house prices have fallen substantially , but what did people expect — that the bubbled - up values achieved between 2001 and 2007 would be sustained forever or rise even more preposterously ?
We are witnessing a correction .
If real estate prices have been driven up absurdly by easy credit , reckless lending , and silly expectations , then real estate prices must come down substantially .
To act as if prevention of this correction represents the sine qua non of recovery is to begin one ’s journey on the wrong foot .
And to suppose that throwing taxpayer money mindlessly at real - estate - based securities or at people who cannot afford to make regular mortgage payments only portends a new and greater collapse of house prices later on .
Of course , the new New Deal idea of the Obama regime ’s " creating jobs " by bankrolling infrastructure " investments " might as well come with a written guarantee attached that it will generate nothing but resource waste and the pork - barrel distribution of vast amounts of taxpayer money to satisfy the appetites of congressmen , local politicians , construction unions , and real - estate interests .
Even if a road , a bridge , or a sewer system ultimately comes forth as a visible result , the unseen alternatives forgone are almost certain to have greater value for those from whom the grasping hand of the federal state has stripped the wherewithal to pay for the projects .
Free - market analysts ought to understand such matters , which are scarcely arcane , and anyone who has watched the government ’s responses to previous recessions , from 1929 to the present , ought to understand the present situation without remedial instruction from me .
Yes , unemployment has risen , as it always does during a recession .
But the rate of unemployment last month was only 6.7 percent .
During the Great Depression , the unemployment rate often exceeded 20 percent , and many workers who had jobs in those days had only part - time employment even when they wanted to work full - time .
So , despite the numerous Chicken Littles running about excitedly , the present situation does not bear comparison with the mass unemployment of the 1930s ; nor does the ample safety net that now stretches beneath the unemployed — a refuge that did not exist in anything like its present setup during that difficult decade .
I do not belittle the problems that involuntary unemployment may pose for people even now , but it makes no sense for policy makers to burn the house down because they have discovered that a few rats have taken up residence in it .
Above all , policy makers , economists , other analysts , and news media commentators need to cultivate an understanding of and appreciation for the wisdom of the aphorism , " do n’t just stand there , undo something . "
The greatest mistake made in previous occasions of this sort has been to add new government burdens to the ones that helped to bring on the troubles in the first place ; hence the ratchet effect in the growth of government .
If only we had the wisdom to recognize a crisis as the most compelling occasion for getting rid of accumulated government burdens and idiocies , then we could throw the ratchet effect into reverse , with highly beneficial long - run consequences , including greater economic liberty and faster economic growth .

Will SD cards be able to rival hard drives for storage capacity anytime soon ?
Probably not , but it wo n't be because of a technical limitation – the next generation of SD cards , dubbed SDXC , have been announced this week .
Among other things , the new format for the cards will result in a theoretical size limit of a massive 2TB , 64 times greater than the current 32 GB limitation .
That 's a significant jump , considering that 32 GB SDHC cards have been available for only about a year .
The SD association has been working to retain the existing form factor and interface for SD cards , but is pushing the technology forward at a very rapid rate .
The SDXC standard will supposedly provide cards that will start at read / write speeds greater than 100MB / sec , and in the future could go as high as 300 MB / sec.
SD is a very popular format , particularly for devices like digital camcorders and cameras .
With HD cameras becoming more popular and the amount of space needed to store high quality video increasing rapidly , SDXC is trying to keep up and fill that need .

In a reflection of the digital age , more online journalists are jailed around the world than journalists from any other medium , the Committee to Protect Journalists ( CPJ ) reported on Thursday .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The New York - based media watchdog group , in its annual census of imprisoned journalists , said that as of December 1 , a total of 125 journalists were behind bars , two fewer than at the same point in 2007 .
It said 56 of the imprisoned journalists were considered online journalists — bloggers , Web - based reporters , or online editors — surpassing the number of print journalists for the first time .
Print reporters , editors , and photographers are the next largest category of jailed journalists , with 53 cases , the CPJ said , adding that television and radio journalists and documentary filmmakers constitute the rest .
For the 10th consecutive year , China was the leading jailer of journalists , the CPJ said , followed by Cuba , Myanmar , Eritrea and Uzbekistan .
It said 24 of the 28 jailed journalists in China worked online including Hu Jia , a prominent human rights activist and blogger serving a three - and - a - half year prison term .
Cuba holds 21 writers and editors in prison , the CPJ said , while Myanmar is detaining 14 journalists including five arrested while trying to spread news about Cyclone Nargis .
There are 13 journalists in prisons in Eritrea , the CPJ said , and the Eritrean authorities “ have refused to disclose the whereabouts , legal status , or health of any of the journalists they have imprisoned . ”
Six journalists are being detained in Uzbekistan , the CPJ said , including Dzhamshid Karimov , a nephew of the country ’s president who was a reporter for independent news websites .
“ Online journalism has changed the media landscape and the way we communicate with each other , ” said CPJ executive director Joel Simon .

When a bully picks on you , you might get consoled by grown - ups who say things about how he 's just jealous or trying to get your attention .
But now a group of psychiatry researchers at the University of Chicago have revealed the true reason behind bullying :
That bully beats you up because he enjoys it .
Healthy kids ' brains ( pictured ) respond to other people 's pain with sympathetic twinges in their own pain centers .
But bullies who witness pain show activity in their brains ' reward centers .
Psychology professor Jean Decety and his team analyzed the brains of bullies — teens who had showed unusual aggression , starting fights , using weapons , and mugging people .
He put the bullies in a functional MRI scanner , looking to see how their brains reacted to pictures of a person deliberately stepping on someone else 's foot .
Said Decety :
Aggressive adolescents showed a specific and very strong activation of the amygdala and ventral striatum ( an area that responds to feeling rewarded ) when watching pain inflicted on others , which suggested that they enjoyed watching pain .
Advertisement
Earlier this year , Decety demonstrated that most children respond to these images of pain with sympathy , imaginatively feeling the pain themselves .
And that 's what the control group in his most recent study did .
But the bullies clearly liked seeing pain .
Decety thinks his discovery will help psychologists and psychiatrists treat violent adolescents .
He believes that when teens enjoy other people 's pain it means they 've suffered a disruption in their brains ' natural empathetic reactions .
In other words , someday we might have a " cure " for aggression that restores bullies ' ability to feel sympathy for other people 's pain .
Of course , tinkering with this brain signaling mechanism might also reveal a way to disrupt people 's empathy too — turning pacifists into sadists .

You 've heard the old saw " fake it ' til you make it , " right ?
This is an instrument that takes those words to heart .
Developed by the Magnetic Musical Training project , FielDrum sees a pretty standard percussion instrument fitted with a series of electromagnets .
Placed beneath the drum head , the magnets can either be told to " attract " or " repel " via-MIDI , creating some kick - ass paradiddles as the new drum student holds his or her sticks over the instrument .
Sure , this all sounds like fun , but this is the kind of research that could have serious ramifications :
How do people learn things involving " complex physical gestures ? "
Can people " learn - by - feel ? "
How does this approach compare to traditional motor training ?
We 're dying to find out the answers -- but mostly we 're dying to get out hands on one of these drums for our robot marching band .

" We 've all seen how even non-profits are beholden to the whims and ideals of their major contributors " Exactly .
Who would endow them ?
The government ?
How would coverage have been different over the last 8 years if newspapers had been beholden directly to the Bush Admin rather than Murdoch ?
No taxpayer money for papers .
New , albiet smaller papers will grow in the space once occupied by these dying behemoths .
The sooner the better .
just say'n , IMO .

Nonprofits are able to " make money " , if I recall .
Newspapers used to make what was considered a decent profit , and in recent years , corporations have taken over and demanded more profit .
That view is from Earl Cadlwell , of " Caldwell Chronicle " on WBAI ( shows are archived for 90 days , including his great one with Les Payne , on Jan.2 , 2009 on their longtime journalist experiences ) .
Les Payne has suggested that newspapers are dying and that the internet has the opportunity for the new readers , and new writers , with the older journalists acting as experience .
It 's cheaper , he says , to do news online .
He always stresses that facts need checking in doing journalism .
I notice that more journalists are blogging , such as Hugh Hamilton , also of WBAI , how has his own blog , as well as his radio show , " TalkBack " .
I like reading news online , but I prefer independent media ( obviously , as here I am ) , blogs and DemocracyNow .
WBAI is a Pacifica network station .

Or how about something like the BBC ?
I 'm all for getting the profit motive out of the equation .
Contrary to the dominant paradigm , the love of profit corrupts everything it touches .
The free market system has utterly failed to provide citizens with reliable news .

Nonprofits do not have to rely on donors .
They can sell ads and everything .
They just do n't have to pay stockholders , do n't have to make a profit for the ownership .
If they do make a profit after expenses and salaries , it has to go toward the business , or another nonprofit entity , not enrich owners .
I think it is a great way for the print media to keep happening and to have less pressure to skew their product in favor of fascism .

Lottakatz -
As the original op - ed notes ( and as I did , as well ) , the call was not for government endowment --- though I suppose " colleges and universities " as referred are often publicly endowed --- but presumably from private foundations , etc .
Your point is well taken , however .
Even if non-profits PBS and NPR , both recipients of government largess , have ( for the most part ) done okay , even with partial government funding .
At least they 're not on the verge of disappearing forever , like so many newspapers and wire services across the country .

Maybe PBS and NPR are not on the verge of disappearing , but I 'm not sure that they get a passing grade .
Our big newspapers have done a great deal of harm .
Whether the good they 've also done outweighs the harm , I do n't know .
I 'm not ready to support the Mouth Piece Media .
How about grants to support small , local papers that actually do reporting ?

Endowment by the Governemnt , the Pew Family Trust , or the Bradley Foundation has a similar peril :
You tkae the King 's shilling you dance to the tune called by the King .
What is needed is for reporters to report their stories and accrue personal gain in a forum other than media outlet .
I do n't know the form that takes , but I am not sure endowment is the path there .

# 6 " ... op - ed notes ( and as I did , as well ) , the call was not for government endowment "
Sorry , I must have missed the comment about non -govt .
funding .
I still like the idea of the ' capitalist road ' for newspapers because it 's transparent , all I need to see is ownership , ( at the city level ) who frequently buys the big ads , and the finished product .
With endowments I would have to spend too much time on Google checking out the donors to see if the writing reflects an agenda beyond journalism . # 2 " ... internet has the opportunity for the new readers , and new writers , with the older journalists acting as experience .
It 's cheaper , he says , to do news online . "
I do n't mind the idea of these institutions dying if they do n't fulfill their purpose even so much as to attract the buyers .
Our City paper went from left to right to ( IMO ) hard right years ago so I have n't read the mainstream city paper for years .
I 've been reading about ' electronic newspapers ' in Sci-Fi since I was a kid and it's tech progress I 'm entirely comfortable with .
I love the evolution and diversity of it .
And I want a flying car now that we have our wrist telephones coming into production .

The " Powers That Be " are ensuring their primary routes of delivery of propaganda to the population stays intact .
Sarkozy is so intent on keeping French newspapers operating he 's talking about the government giving people free subscriptions for life .
Do you really think Sarkozy would be so intent on ensuring newspapers retain their same place in society if it was n't a foundation upon which the conservative movement is built ?
I say newspapers caused their own fate .
Newspaper as a whole went far right politically pretty much worldwide , supported the free trade / globalists agenda , and lost all trust from the people as a result .
Let 'em die .
Progressive should spend our more limited resources on less costly means of information distribution .
Summarizing the days events on newsprint and distributing that hard copy in citywide delivery networks is a waste of labor and resources .
Cheap bendable electronic displays are starting to come out of the labs .
10 years from now that will be how people read what they think of as magazines .
Newsgathering will be moved almost entirely online , and I 'm fine with that , because there will be a new chance for new progressive voices to appear to replace the hardcopy empires of old .

In a sense , going non-profit does represent government funding because the organizations will be paying far less taxes than for - profits and there are no guarantees that they will be providing more of a " public service " than they do now .
And then there is the matter of the government not being financially able to provide effective oversight which is currently the case in the charitable organization industry .

# 3 Perry : I am not sure the BBC is such a great example of independent journalism .
One of its reporters was reporting live on 9/11/01 about the collapse of World Trade Center tower # 7 as it stood in the background behind her ( so did Aaron Brown of CNN ) .
It " collapsed " [ imploded is probably the correct term ] 20 minutes later .
Apparently the " evil doers " had fed " talking points " to the media , including BBC .
The BBC report was a much - visited YouTube video that has now been censored off of YouTube , along with many other 9 - 11 YouTube videos .
The scuttlebutt is that [ whose ? ] spokesman , Sen . Joe Lieberman , has declared that any media information that contradicts the Official Government Conspiracy Theory of 9 - 11 [ 19 middle eastern men highjacked four planes with boxcutters ] is " Terrorist Propaganda , " and must not be available or accessible on the internet .
Methinks too many people are moving into the 9 - 11 truther camp for the comfort of the " evil doers . "

Or they could just do their damn jobs properly , investigating and reporting rather than taking dictation from corporations and the government and then more people would read them .
I gave up on newspapers about decade ago when I saw that GWB was being given a free ride in spite of his well known shortcomings .
They should go out of business , if this is the best they can do .

Mark Karlin , creator / publisher of the indispensable BuzzFlash wrote to me on this topic via private mail , which I post , with his permission here ... brad , as far as the op - ed on newspapers , that 's why buzzflash does n't accept advertising .
if you have seen on huffington post , there are ads for shell and british petroleum artfully persuading people how concerned they are doing about the environment .
even kos has adds for the likes of the " aerospace industry . " we 're just making it by , but growing
i think the guardian is a good model .
it 's a trust .
but only a few papers would have the heft to build up an endowment to survive that way .
and they should start from the ground - up .
the management of the nyt , tribune company and washington post are obstacles to independent journalism .
some of the worthy reporters could be rehired .
but all print newspapers are an endangered species .
the costs of production and distribution , combined with new generations that get their news from the net make the distribution of a daily paper news product obsolete , not to mention way behind the news cycle .
mark karlin
After requesting his permission to post his remarks here , he followed up with ... you 're welcome to do with them whatever you wish .
advertising is what makes the American economy run , but it is also the key poison in the corporate media industry .
there are so many ways in which advertising has tainted corporate news coverge , far too many to enumerate .
the idea of trusts are great , but worldwide news organizations are extremely costly .
there is n't enough , realistically , philanthropic money to cover the coverage and analysis that is needed .
personally , if we are to enter an era of honest , open and dynamic news , Americans are going to have to invest it individually , just as they pay for cable television .
people are going to have to own the media , so that it is accountable to citizens not corporations and advertisers .
that 's a dramatic shift in thinking , but the value of news and information needs to be monetized as a consumer choice .
if people want oil companies to finances their news , they 'll get what they are not paying for .

Non-profit sounds good , but the NYTimes deserves to die .
As Daniel Elsberg said in this place , if he brought the Pentagon Papers to them now , they would n't publish them .
I think the real reason for the decline of investigative journalism ( besides this stupid and silly ideal of " balance " instead of truth ) is , in a very ironic way , tied to the very reasons that our economy is in a depression .
It 's a class of CEOs and other top executives ( and the NYT has one ) who have long since ceased to be about business and are now ideologically infused and have very clear political agendas .
The tilt toward Bushhole was no accident .
That 's where the money was .
I remember when I sent the NYTimes a commentary six months before the revelations of Abu Graib that torture was a high level policy of this government , they would n't publish it .
My sources were public and unimpeachable .
One was a direct interview with Rumsfield in the PARIS MATCH in which he endorsed the methods of interrogation in " THe Battle of Algiers . "
And they refused to publish it .
I probably should have tried to publish it elsewhere , but I was discouraged .
I felt for a long time that unless I was a CEO , I could n't be a full citizen of this country .

' Steve ' , Wow !
now that 's a flying car in the best sense of the word , at least until we get that anti-gravity thing working ' 99 ' , I loves me some holodeck .
The best eps IMO were the three wherein the ' people ' constructs became self aware and knew they were holographs ; " Elementary , Dear Data " , " Ship in a Bottle " and the noir detective episode " The Big Goodbye " .
( Thank 's for the link so I could ferret out the names . )
The self awareness angle was later played out beautifully in the movie " The Thirteenth Floor " .
Also , the simulation model of our existence has been put forward by a contemporary philosopher and he gives the probability as 1 in 5 : http://www.simulation-argument.com/

Fron # 18 " only a few papers would have the heft to build up an endowment to survive that way .
and they should start from the ground - up .
the management of the nyt , tribune company and washington post are obstacles to independent journalism . "
I agree and think the on - line corporate papers and the blogs have rendered the big papers obsolete .
If you have a variety of on - line sources you get all of the National and international stories that the giants cover , opinion and examination , and some investigative stories that they refuse to .
The MSM did n't break the Don Siegalman story , he would still be in jail if his fate rested with the MSM .
The big gap seems to be a citywide daily that is independent .
Here in my city you can get close to it on - line but the sites are all controlled by local television news and our daily paper .
None of them have the depth or ease of uses as a real paper .
By depth I mean the level of iteration into city goings - on that papers do so well , crime stat 's w / synopsis ' local social events for the day etc. and all those little personalizing touches .
I really miss that kind of thing though .
Every city should have a good , objective city - wide daily also because it reinforces a city 's identity and a readers sense of place .
Fron # 18 " ... the costs of production and distribution , combined with new generations that get their news from the net make the distribution of a daily paper news product obsolete , not to mention way behind the news cycle . "
The production and distribution ( once you get past investigating , writing and editing ) is labor intensive .
These jobs have been hit hard in my town and will go away entirely if news is all electronic .
I am not happy with that loss but I do n't subscribe to a poor newspaper just to subsidize those jobs .
We have an evening daily so the time lag on stories is n't so great .
I love the printed word and hate that papers have come to this end .
Having said that though , if I could find a good don- line daily for my city I 'd embrace the change totally and gladly and never look back .

Here 's a little peek at a page from Robert Crumb 's forthcoming Book of Genesis , a literal adaptation from the first book in the Old Testament .
It 's been years - in - the - making ( Here 's a 2004 Guardian article about it ) .
The only other book I 'm looking forward to with as much excitment as this one is Harvey Kurtzman 's Humbug anthology .
The long - awaited publication of Robert Crumb 's Book of Genesis , an adaptation of the Bible story , which Norton will be publishing in Fall 2009 .
I had the privilege of seeing some of the pages in France two years ago , and the scope of the work has haunted me ever since .
I 'm sure the religious right will be all up in arms with cliché horror that a quote unquote " cartoonist " has defamed their sacred cow , but Crumb is taking this work very seriously , and Genesis is some of his best work .

Realtor to the stars Linda Stein had it coming , suspect Natavia Lowery told prosecutors in a chilling taped murder confession revealed for the first time today .
“ She has never , never , never treated me like this ! ” the pretty personal assistant fumed to prosecutors in the tape .
“ Never ! ” she shouts , describing how the high - powered Realtor was cursing up a storm in her Fifth Avenue apartment while handling a $ 30 million sale on an October morning in 2007 – all the while puffing pot like a locomotive and waving around a wooden yoga stick .
“ So I snatched it from her , ” Lowery added , almost calmly .
“ So I took it and I like hit her with it . ”
“ After the first time , she fell ? ” prosecutor Joan Illuzzi - Orbon then asks from off camera , matching her suspect ’s calm .
“ Yes , ” the now - sniffling Lowery answered .
“ I was n’t myself . ”
Stein ’s daughter , Mandy – who had discovered her mother ’s corpse – was also sobbing in the Manhattan courtroom where the tape is being played during a pre-trial hearing to determine its admissibility .
“ I was mad , ” Lowery continued .
“ I was confused .
I was angry .
I was paranoid , ” Lowery told the prosecutor .
“ I was feeling like I never had before .
I felt like she was my worst enemy .
How do you go from being someone ’s best friend to , like , enemy ?
You know ? ”
“ How often did she say something you found offensive , ” Illuzzi - Orbon asked – a subtle nudge to continue .
Lowery took the bait .
“ Um , probably like every other day .
You know .
She never said anything about black people .
She ’d always just be like , ‘ Spics this , stupid Mexican rats this .
Why do they work here , why are they here ?
I hate foreigners . ’
I was like , ‘ Linda , you should n’t be like that . ’
She ’d say , ‘ I pay my taxes , I can say whatever I want . ”
Did Stein touch you with the stick , Illuzzi - Orbon asked .
“ She just had the cane , swinging it , ” Lowery said .
“ Did you find that demeaning ? ” Illuzzi - Orbon asked , gently – another nudge .
“ Yes , yes , ” Lowery answered .
How many times did you hit her , Illuzzi - Orbon asked .
Lowery sniffled audibly on the tape before answering , slowly , “ Probably … six ? ”
“ I just feel angry , ” Lowery said , switching to present tense as if reliving the moment .
“ It was like , you know , just so I can breathe , just so I can get back to normal , you know ? ”
“ What made you stop hitting her ? ” Illuzzi - Orbon asked .
“ I think it was just like , you know , I hit her six times , and then I stood up and I was like in total shock , like -” Lowery ’s voice trailed off .
Then Illuzzi-Orbon asked why Lowery needed to stand – had she been crouching as she continued to hit the fallen woman ?
Lowery said she had been crouching , then stood up .
“ I was just standing there .
I said her name so many times .
I shook her so many times .
It was like once I hit her , that was it .
It was kinda like if you close your eyes .
You know , that ’s it .
I did n’t see any you know , blood or anything .
It was like my eyes were closed .
“ My intentions were n’t to kill her .
It was like , just leave me alone , ” Lowery said , her voice rising as if she again were shouting at her doomed boss .
“ Leave me alone ! ” Lowery repeated .
“ You know , it was like she was my worst enemy you know , at the time . ”
Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement own the stage , but Flight Of The Conchords fans know that their manager , Murray ( Rhys Darby ) , makes it all tick .
Whether he 's hyping New Zealand ( " like Scotland , but further " ) or booking the hapless duo into hopeless gigs , he clings to the belief that organization trumps ineptitude :
Every band meeting has a roll call and an agenda , no matter how few people or items are involved .
Murray could easily be the butt of the joke , but Darby makes his dogged incompetence seem valiant rather than deluded .
Darby took some time off from filming the show 's second season for a chat in his dressing room , with an Air New Zealand pen close at hand .

The A.V. Club :
You 've been with Bret and Jemaine longer than anyone , have n't you ?
Rhys Darby : Yeah , I 've known them for I guess about 10 years .
We hooked up in Edinburgh when we individually went to do the Fringe Festival over there , and we were the only Kiwi acts performing .
We kind of bundled together and helped each other out .
I did their flyering , and Bret did my lighting .
So when they got approached to do the BBC radio show , they asked me to play the role of the manager , and we just kind of flippantly did it .
Made it up on the day , with a tape recorder much like this setup .
" Go ! " " All right , band meeting , um … " I just did the roll call right off the bat .
And the rest is history .

AVC : How did you go about transferring the character to TV ?
RD : That was the big issue .
It 's okay for them to be seen , but how was I going to be portrayed ?
The manager was an unseen entity at the beginning , and we thought it should maybe be an older person .
But we found right from the radio series that we connected and improvised really well as a threesome .
So it was a sort of no - brainer for me to come in and play the same part on the television side of things .
We kept that same vibe of the characters , obviously , those three main characters , and then we just colored in the world around them .
Advertisement
AVC : The show seemed destined for cult status .
Did you expect that ?
RD : We knew that was going to be the case , but we did n't know how big a cult it was going to be .
We should have had an idea from the beginning .
The Conchords already had like 20,000 friends online before the series even went out , so they already had a big buildup of people that knew about it .
And of course they told millions of others , and then now there 's a sort of tsunami—cult fans have pushed it into this thing where , bang , they 've got to have another season , we 've got to keep this thing going for the fans .
But even now , there are people who have n't seen it , or " I 've heard of that . "
And of course if you do n't have HBO , or you have n't heard of buying a DVD , or have n't got the Internet , then you would n't have come across us .
But it 's getting scarcer now to find someone who does n't know the show .
Advertisement
AVC : Pretty much all the people you'd think would have heard of the show , have .
RD : I think you can sum it up with , if you 're into comedy , you will know what the show is about .
We have so many comedy geeks , comedy enthusiasts , fanatical people who go to comedy festivals and follow comedians , and really treat it like rock ' n ' roll — which it can be , but more like the geeky rock ' n ' roll .
And that 's great , because that 's the world I 've lived in , even before I started doing comedy .
I feel like I 've made it to this really important position within my peer group .
It 's been awesome .
Advertisement
AVC : It 's a great character .
RD : I had no idea it was going to be so popular when it came out .
I thought , " People are n't going to like my character , because he 's so different .
If they 're really into these cool - looking idiots , they 're not going to like this other idiot who kind of gets in their way and is always uptight and has his little lists . "
I guess because it 's the opposite side of the seesaw , it just fits in perfectly .
He is kind of like their father figure .
They 're kind of lost without him , and he 's definitely lost without them .

Murray 's got a good heart .
It 's not about trying to get money for these guys .
The best part of his day is when they come in and he tries to connect with the cool gang .
He tries to get them gigs , but he mentions sometimes , " It 's not about that !
It 's about the look ! "
And I think deep down , the characters never really expect to make it .
They 're young and looking for hot chicks and that sort of stuff .
It 's weird , because they do n't drink — they always have water .
It 's all about details and things you do n't expect .
It 's about being comfortable in your skin .
AVC : There is a sort of gentleness to the way he 's portrayed .
Clearly Murray is a figure of fun , but the show is n't mocking him the way it could be .
Advertisement
RD : Yeah , absolutely .
He 's not as mocked as he could be .
Bret and Jemaine would obviously mock him if they were very cool , but they do n't , because they look up to him .
It 's that New Zealand thing that binds them together .
I like to think of them as a very cool belt , with nice little features on it , maybe some designs of cowboys on it .
I 'm the buckle .
A very boring buckle .
Imagine that in the middle .
You see this really cool belt , and you 're like , " Wow ! " and then you look at the buckle , " Ah … I would 've gone for a little different buckle . "
But it 's such a good buckle to hold it together !
AVC : The first season was already pretty fully formed , but are there things you wanted to do differently this time around ?
Advertisement
RD : They unfortunately ran out of songs , and they had to write 20 new ones .
So therefore they could write the songs to fit in the episodes , and not the other way around .
That gave them the advantage of coming up with any story they wanted to .
The first series , in a way , was difficult because of that .
That 's why all the episodes are quite similar : getting with girls , blah blah blah .
The songs were about getting with girls , so they had to fit it in .
This time around , they 're able to go off on slightly different tangents and just put songs in .
So that 's been simple — it 's been easier .
Certainly not simple , writing 20 new songs and keeping it the same caliber as the others has certainly been difficult .
AVC : They 're going through an album 's worth of songs in three to four episodes .
RD : Absolutely .
You 've got your difficult - second - album syndrome along with your difficult - second - season syndrome .
So you 've got to work on your things that obviously work , which are the band meetings and the getting lost , being confused , fish - out - of - water scenarios .
People do n't want anything too different .
I think what they really want is 20 brilliant new songs , and then stuff in between them that 's similar to what happened last time , but maybe in different settings .
You 've got the apartment , you 've got the office , you 've got Dave 's shop , and then you 've got out on the streets of Manhattan or whatever .
And Mel and Doug popping up .
And as soon as you go , " Right , let 's take it out of this and go to Hawaii , " you start to go into one of those TV shows where you go " Now look at them , they 've gone to London for the weekend . "
Those episodes of shows never seem to work as well .
This is all about absolutely absurd situations that fit in a weird world , so it almost looks normal , and we just act it out very realistically , so there 's no punchline .
We play it out like " This is real . "
I guess people can believe it because we 're from New Zealand , and they assume that 's how we really are , that 's how we act and what our country 's like .
Advertisement
AVC : In the U.S. , people talk about how many great comedians come from Canada because they 're in America 's shadow , and some people consider that sense of inferiority something that helps breed a better comic .
Do you feel there 's anything comparable to that the relationship between New Zealand and Australia ?
RD : Yeah , we 're lumped together because we 're from that part of the world .
We have similar accents and cultures , but there 's a very distinct difference to us and them .
It 's distinct , but if you 're from one of these big countries , you can't see it .
So our mission in life is to show people the ever - so - slight difference we have between our two places .
That 's a big part of the show .
" We 're from New Zealand !
It 's quite a way from Australia !
We 're the one with rivers and gullies and hobbits and toothbrush fences !
We 've got interesting things . "
It 's funny , because we take it quite seriously , and when we come abroad , we say " Oh my God , why do we take those toothbrush fences so seriously ? "
Advertisement
AVC : Have you gotten to do anything particularly noteworthy in the new season ?
RD : I 've done some dancing .
I was quite impressed with being able to learn choreographed dance moves .
A little more singing .
Last season , Murray was always behind a desk or in a car , never moving around and not very physical .
This year , I run at one point .
There 's a slapstick scene I do .
Murray 's not so much stuck behind a desk this year — although many of the best scenes are him just stuck behind a desk , talking bollocks .
Advertisement
AVC : Are those largely improvised ?
RD : There 's a scripted version of what we want for the band meetings , so we do one like that and then let it roll , and just improvise .
It 's kind of an organic process .
But most of it is improvised , yes .
Advertisement
AVC : So is there more improvisation in those scenes than with other one - episode guest actors ?
RD : We try to get actors that are okay with improvisation .
A lot of the comic ones enjoy it .
We let them know , " This is the scene , and if you want to add more , go ahead . "
Advertisement
AVC : One big thing that makes the musical sequences work is that there 's a delicate semi-competence to them .
They seem like they 're meant to look like they 're made for $ 1.50 .
RD : That first season , we had a very limited budget , and there 's a homemade feel to a lot of the music videos .
It fits in with the lowbrow look of the show , and it fits in with the musician scenario and the boring government job Murray holds and the horrible autumn colors he wears .
This time around , we got a lot more money , and we put a lot of that into the music videos .
I think they 'll still have a similar look , but we can put more money toward props .
This just in : spending 14 hours a day playing Counterstrike or World of Warcraft means your offline relationships could suffer .
Researchers at Brigham Young University in Utah talked to 813 university students across the US and found that as the amount of time the students spent playing video games went up , the quality of their relationships with friends and family suffered .
" Relationship quality is one of a cluster of things that we found to be associated with videogames , " said researcher Laura Walker .
" The most striking part is that everything we found clustered around videogame use is negative . "
Drugs , sex appeal and Raving Rabbids
Statistical analyses revealed that the more people play videogames , the more frequent their involvement in ' risky ' behaviours such as drinking and drug abuse .
Daily gamers reported smoking marijuana almost twice as often as occasional players and three times as often as those who never play .
The study found that nearly three quarters of male students in the study played video games regularly , compared to just 17 per cent of their female counterparts .
For young women , self - worth was low if their time spent playing videogames was high .
But there is one ray of sunshine - the study found that the connection between gaming and anti-social behaviour was only ' modest ' and the researchers themselves hoped that future studies would exonerate family - oriented consoles and multiplayer games .

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports of Israel ’s heavy artillery bombardment of densely populated Gaza on Saturday that “ The American School north of Gaza was directly hit and almost completely destroyed , with one school guard killed .
In addition , at least three to five schools were damaged by Israeli shelling of nearby targets . ”
I presume that this is the school working to promote US good relations with Palestinians that now no longer exists ..
Of course , the rest of the humanitarian situation is pretty bad , too– “ Distribution of food assistance to the most vulnerable is erratic due to the security situation . ”
The OCHA [ pdf ] issued the following report on Saturday regarding the Gaza humanitarian situation , about 4 hours before Israel invaded .
Personally , I find that the pdf format is often an impediment to the spread of information .
The files are huge , they require proprietary software , and do n’t suit a lot of the world that is still dependent on dial - up connections .
So I am posting the report in HTML here .

United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
GAZA HUMANITARIAN SITUATION REPORT 3 January 2009 as of 16:00 Israeli military operations and heavy bombardment of the Gaza Strip continued into their eighth day .
Violence
As of 3 January , according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza , 432 people have been killed and 2,200 persons have been injured .
On 3 January , the IAF continued air and naval strikes in all parts of the Gaza Strip , particularly North Gaza , Gaza and the Middle area , with airstrikes focusing on moving vehicles , residences , open areas , and former Israeli settlements .
In addition to the airstrikes , the IDF has commenced shelling areas in Gaza up to and exceeding one kilometer from the Israel - Gaza border .
At the moment of issuing this release , artillery shell fire has been reported from the eastern border to open areas in North Gaza , Gaza and the Middle Area .
Increasing numbers of warning leaflets are being dropped , warning people to evacuate the targeted areas , exacerbating confusion and panic among the civilian population .
The American School north of Gaza was directly hit and almost completely destroyed , with one school guard killed .
In addition , at least three to five schools were damaged by Israeli shelling of nearby targets .
Palestinian militants fired 20 rockets and mortars into Israel injuring 3 Israelis .
Health According to WHO [ The World Health Organization ] , many medical supply donations have entered the Strip in recent days , including through Rafah , and more are in the pipeline .
The main challenge for now is how to catalogue and manage these supplies .
WHO is identifying which individual items may still be needed , particularly in regards to medical equipment which is more difficult to assess .
Intensive care unit capacity in hospitals is still limited and the lack of specialist surgeons remains a problem .
Blood units have entered Gaza , bringing supplies to adequate levels .
In addition to the Ministry of Health ’s current central warehouse , UNRWA has identified a storage facility for incoming MoH pharmaceuticals .
A logistical team of pharmacists and other staff are shifting supplies currently held in small storage spaces throughout Gaza to the new central warehouse for organization and inventory ; all new medicines arriving will also be stored in this new warehouse .
Three more storage facilities in the north , central and south have been identified .
Since 27 December , 103 patients entered Egypt through Rafah for external medical treatment .
Of growing concern are the 700 - 1000 chronic medical patients who had been receiving regular treatment in Israel and East Jerusalem each month .
The existing referral system through Erez for these patients has been disrupted .
Without electricity from the Gaza Power Plant ( GPP ) , hospitals are operating on backup electric generators .
These generators cannot be relied on to provide constant power to hospitals , and it is critical that fuel is delivered to the power station in order for mains electricity to be restored .
Food
Distribution of food assistance to the most vulnerable is erratic due to the security situation .
Since 27 December , WFP ( through implementing partners ) has distributed only a fraction of the 1350 metric tonnes available and the food that is currently being distributed should have been distributed in the October - December cycle .
UNRWA resumed its prior food distribution in seven distribution centres on 1 January which it had suspended on 18 December ; distributions are continuing today .
Water and Sanitation
On 2 January , airstrikes in the Al Mughraga area damaged a main drinking water pipe , cutting off water supplies to 30,000 people in Nuseirat Camp .
Beit Lahiya Sewage Lagoon :
There is a particular emerging concern , that current military operations could damage the sand walls of the Beit Lahiya sewage lagoon causing a massive sewage overflow .
In addition to agricultural areas , up to 15,000 people are directly at risk .
Two years ago , five people were killed and 2,000 displaced when the lagoon overflowed .
Shelter
Several hundred people have sought shelter at locations provided by UNRWA .
The Agency has 91 preidentified locations throughout the Gaza Strip , primarily schools , with a capacity for 40,000 persons , including non-refugee displaced if necessary .
Crossings
KEREM SHALOM : Closed today .
A total of 75 truckloads including 42 for humanitarian aid agencies were allowed entry to Gaza through Kerem Shalom crossing yesterday , 2 January .
These included 46 truckloads of food supplies ( including 21 trucks for UNRWA ) , five medical supplies ( MoH and WHO ) , 17 truckloads of animal feed , five power generators for ICRC , and two trucks of other items .
RAFAH : Three truckloads of medical supplies ( Qatari , Kuwait and Egyptian donation ) were allowed entry to Gaza through Rafah crossing today .
Five medical cases were allowed out .
EREZ : Closed today .
226 foreign nationals ( Russians , Ukrainians , Americans and Norwegians ) were allowed out through Erez yesterday .
International staff of Non-Governmental Organizations ( NGOs ) have been prevented from entering Gaza for the past two months , adversely affecting program management and assessments .
Priority imports neded :
Power plant and electrical transformers : Industrial fuel is needed to power the Gaza Power Plant , which has been shut down since 30 December .
Replacement of ten transformers which were completely damaged is also urgently needed to restore electricity supply to 250,000 people in central and northern Gaza .
All water , sanitation and other utilities , which provide basic services to the population , as well as hospitals and the general population are affected by the outages ; some areas have now experienced power outages for up to 48 hours .
Hospitals are increasingly reverting to generators to support intensive care and operating room functions .
Wheat grain : Essential to provide flour for local bakeries and humanitarian food distribution to the population of Gaza .
There are long lines at bakeries and bread rationing has been implemented by the Gaza authorities .
Cash :
Has still not entered the Gaza Strip and is urgently needed , including for the UNRWA cash distribution program to some 94,000 dependent beneficiaries , as well as its “ cash for work ” program .
[ Above : Geithner discusses regulatory reform of the financial sector as he announces his bailout plan this morning . ]
One of the reasons Obama is having trouble with the stimulus bill is that ordinary people lump it in with this steaming pile called the bank bailout :
WASHINGTON —
The Obama administration ’s new plan to bail out the nation ’s banks was fashioned after a spirited internal debate that pitted the Treasury secretary , Timothy F. Geithner , against some of the president ’s top political hands .
In the end , Mr. Geithner largely prevailed in opposing tougher conditions on financial institutions that were sought by presidential aides , including David Axelrod , a senior adviser to the president , according to administration and Congressional officials .
Mr. Geithner , who will announce the broad outlines of the plan on Tuesday , successfully fought against more severe limits on executive pay for companies receiving government aid .
He resisted those who wanted to dictate how banks would spend their rescue money .
And he prevailed over top administration aides who wanted to replace bank executives and wipe out shareholders at institutions receiving aid .
Because of the internal debate , some of the most contentious issues remain unresolved .
[...]
Abandoning any pretense about limiting the moral hazards at companies that made foolhardy investments , the plan also will not require shareholders of companies receiving significant assistance to lose most or all of their investment .
Some officials had suggested that the next bailout phase not protect existing shareholders .
( Shareholders at most banks that fail will continue to lose their investment . )

After nearly a week of shutdowns that left 18 European countries facing severe energy shortages in a mid-winter cold snap , gas briefly began flowing again on Tuesday through the 4,000 - kilometer pipeline ( about 2,500 miles ) that connects Russian gas fields with Europe via Ukraine .
But the tentative deal began unraveling almost immediately amid an escalating war of words between Moscow and Kiev .
By Tuesday evening the gas flow had been blocked somewhere in Ukraine , to the consternation of European observers sent to monitor deliveries , and both sides were back to blaming the other .
The perennial dispute between the two former - Soviet states over prices and terms of transit is now boiling over into a crisis that threatens to paralyze economic relations and plunge Russia and the West deeper into diplomatic crisis .
Moscow maintains it ’s simply a matter of weaning Ukraine from the Soviet - era subsidies that saw it paying less than half the global market price for its gas as recently as last year .
Mired in economic troubles , Ukraine ’s ability to pay the $ 450 per thousand cubic meters that Russia is now demanding seems uncertain .
Ukraine relies on Russia for 75 percent of its gas needs , and the fuel is essential to power the steel and chemical industries that are the economic backbone of the former Soviet country of 50 million .
But as observers ’ heads spin over the on again , off again flow of Russian gas , which accounts for a quarter of Europe ’s total supply , there are growing suspicions that hidden concerns over Ukraine ’s geopolitical choices and high - level corruption in both Russia and Ukraine may be the real factors driving this dispute .
“ There are so many things about this conflict that are neither logical nor transparent , and it is the subject of many intrigues , ” says Dmitry Vydrin , a deputy of Ukraine ’s parliament , the Rada .
“ Nobody can say when or how it ’s going to end .
We all have many more questions than answers at this point . ”
Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of sabotaging Europe - bound deliveries by illegally siphoning off gas that it ’s unwilling to pay market rates for .
Alexander Medvedev , deputy CEO of the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom , added a fresh stick of dynamite to that charge Tuesday , suggesting that “ a completely different country ” may be orchestrating Kiev ’s behavior .
That ’s a likely reference to the United States , which last month signed a “ strategic partnership ” with Kiev , which Moscow reads as support for Kiev ’s bid to join NATO .
The rhetoric between Moscow and Kiev has flared to new heights in recent days , with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin accusing Ukraine ’s warring politicians of stealing gas to fund their political campaigns , and Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko replying that Russian claims are untrue and designed to “ humiliate ” Ukraine .
In an interview with German TV this week , Mr. Putin denied that geopolitical considerations mattered , but then slammed Ukraine ’s “ Orange ” revolutionaries , who had pledged closer ties with the West , for leading the country astray .
“ The former leaders of the Orange Revolution have failed to live up to their hopes , ” Mr. Putin said .
“ Political infighting [ in Ukraine ] is degenerating into a clash between clans .
. . and [ a ] fight for access to financial flows , of which trade in Russian gas is one . ”
Social discontent does appear to be looming as Ukraine ’s twin political and economic crises go critical .
A mid-December survey conducted by the independent Democratic Initiatives Fund in Kiev found that nearly 84 percent of Ukrainians believe the country is in dire straits .
Fewer than 2 percent thought the situation was fine .
Russian experts deny that Moscow is attempting to exploit Ukraine ’s weaknesses .
After nearly two decades of providing cheap gas to Ukraine , Russian leaders simply want to end the constant wrangling over prices , says Nikolai Petrov , an expert with the Carnegie Center in Moscow .
“ Russia has not gained a good image by subsidizing Ukrainian energy consumption , and gets accused of hostile actions against Ukraine when it tries to raise the price , ” he says .
“ So Russian leaders are being pragmatic here , having decided that there ’s little to lose by seeing this through .
Putin has learned from the past , and it looks like he wants to get a solution that will last . ”
But Mr. Petrov adds that Putin ’s claim that Ukraine ’s leadership is sunk in corruption is a case of “ the pot calling the kettle black . ”
Experts say that instead of contracting directly with Ukraine ’s state gas firm , Naftohaz , Russia ’s Gazprom sells its gas through shadowy offshore intermediaries who flip the payments back and forth , beyond any official scrutiny .
One such entity , RosUkrEnergo , is 50 percent owned by Gazprom .
“ It ’s absolutely inexplicable why Gazprom has these joint ventures with obscure little companies , and transfers billions of dollars to them , unless the purpose is to evade taxes and reward particular unseen interests , ” says Mikhail Krutikhin , a partner with RusEnergy , a Moscow - based consultancy .
“ Someone is getting that money .
If this is n’t corruption , what is ? ” he says .
Mr. Vydrin , the Ukrainian parliamentarian , agrees .
“ Gas spells corruption in both Ukraine and Russia , ” he says .
“ Neither Russian nor Ukrainian gas officials live on their salaries , and it would be very painful for them to give up this model of doing business . ”
Some of the coolest things I picked up in Tokyo were a trio of Katsuhiro Otomo art books – although sadly they were n’t for me , intended instead for my favourite Otomo - san obsessive Al T. Shame , as I would have liked to have spent some quality time with these beauties .
Luckily though , I was able to grab a few shots before I let him get his grubby paws all over them .
First off is the hard to find Akira Animation Archive – tricky to get hold of in the UK , and pretty elusive in Tokyo too , it turns out .
But on the big man ’s request I hunted high and low from Shinjuku to Akihabara , finally bagging a second hand copy in Mandarake Shibuya .
It ’s a nice looking book , packed with lots of images , storyboards , sketches and concept designs from the classic film .
Next up is a hefty tone – one I had to think twice before buying just as the weight of the thing threatened to crush my luggage restrictions .
Steamboy – The Storyboard Book does exactly what it says on the cover , presenting the films entire board set in a stylish hardcover volume .
As you can see , the hand drawn storyboards – all by Otomo himself , apparently – look great in this format , and the book looks like one you ’d want to spend hours with .
Finally I also grabbed him this Robot Carnival art book .
I have never seen the movie , sadly , but seeing as it ’s an anthology of different directors ’ works , there ’s obviously a lot of stuff in here that is n’t Otomo produced .
From the quick flick I had , there ’s a lot of interesting stuff , especially if you ’re into that slightly retro looking ‘ 80s anime vibe .
Anyway , I wo n’t say anymore , I ’ll just wait for the man himself to let you know what he thinks …
Lord Mandelson's £ 2.3 bn bail - out of the car industry – ostensibly aimed at shoring up jobs in towns such as Swindon and Luton – could end up being deployed in the pit lanes of Monte Carlo after Honda 's formula one team confirmed it was in talks to avail itself of taxpayer - funded loans .
Honda Racing became the UK's first and highest - profile casualty of the global collapse in spending on cars in December when its Japanese parent company announced it would withdraw funding .
Nick
Fry , the team 's chief executive , has since been seeking a buyer for the team , which has 700 employees at its Brackley base and an annual budget in the region of £ 200 m .
Yesterday Honda Racing ­confirmed it had been in talks with Lord Mandelson 's Department for Business , Enterprise and Regulatory Reform .
" We have had meetings with BERR over the future of the team on several occasions over the past month , " said a statement .
Asked whether the team would qualify for the support package , a spokeswoman for BERR said : " There is no reason why Honda Racing could n't apply .
" We expect any company in the automotive industry or in its supply chain with a turnover of £ 25 m or more to qualify [ for the loans ] if it has a viable project to deliver the objectives of the support package .
All applications will be considered on a case - by - case basis . "
The spokeswoman added that the ­government 's four key criteria for companies to qualify were having a turnover in excess of £ 25 m , being at the cutting edge of innovation , reducing carbon emissions , and creating jobs .
Honda Racing could claim to qualify on all counts .
It easily exceeds the turnover requirement ; formula one is innovative almost by definition , as each year brings advances to propel the racing cars faster ; the sport is committed to reducing its carbon emissions ; and success for Honda Racing would lead to an increase in its workforce .
Reports last month suggested that if a buyer could not be found by 1 February the team would have to be wound up .
Honda Racing was keen to dismiss such suggestions yesterday , talking of its optimism that a saviour would be found .
A taxpayer - backed support package for the team would be likely to generate more interest .
For now , Honda Racing is concentrating on getting its car on the grid for the first grand prix of the season , in Melbourne on 29 March .

A while back a Sun engineer posted an article claiming that the best way to scale MySQL is to shard your database in many instances on a single server , each of which runs in threads that individually have low performance .
The Sun way has always been to get high throughput with high latency .
And that ’s fine .
Others have commented on the real - world applicability of this technique with MySQL , so I wo n’t .
But what I ’m interested in is something the author says in the comments of his own blog post :
btw ; we are working on a scalable replacement of InnoDB .
Stay tuned ….
What is it ?
Surely it ’s not Falcon .
MySQL and Sun have said many times Falcon is n’t meant to be an InnoDB replacement .
The next question : how should we interpret the word “ scalable ” given the context ?
Clearly there ’s a difference of opinion between MrBenchmark and others on what that word means .
So what will the scaling characteristics of this InnoDB replacement really be ?
The following is a joke , not meant to be taken seriously : Maybe it will be MyISAM with a fix to the key buffer scalability problems .
Start with your database with 50 tables .
Make 1 million databases , each with the same 50 tables , and you can scale up to 1 million rows by putting 1 row in each table .
Ta-da !
Row - level locking with MyISAM !
But seriously , what is it ?
Report : Renewable Energy is Leading Source of New Electric Generating Capacity in US
January 23rd , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Renewable energy is starting off right in the new year with the “ Electric Power Annual 2007 ” report from the US Energy Information Administration .
According to the newly released report , non-hydroelectric renewable energy is now the leading source of new electric generating capacity in the US .
In 2007 , electric power generation increased 2.3 % , from 4,065 million MWh in 2006 to 4,157 MWh in 2007 .
Total net summer capacity increased 8,673 MW , with wind energy responsible for 5,186 MW .
Wood and wood derived fuels continue to be the largest source of renewable generation , accounting for 37.1 % .
Coming in second place is wind energy , accounting for 32.7& of total net generation from non-hydroelectric renewable sources .
The only renewable energy source to decline was conventional hydroelectric power , dropping from 289 million MWh in 2006 to 248 million MWh in 2007 .
I ’m betting that these figures will only become more encouraging with a renewable energy - friendly president in office .

I had a reoccurring dream when I was a kid that I had some sort of telescopic vision .
I would go outside at night and look up into the stars searching for alien spacecraft .
When I would find them they looked like little white triangles like in the game asteroids .
I was always sad when I would think about it during the day and realize that it was just a dream .
In 1994 , in the East African nation of Rwanda , one million ethnic Tutsi people were slaughtered , in a genocide committed by their Hutu countrymen .
But the scars left by these murderous militiamen go well beyond the numbers of the dead : they live on , in the lives of the women they held captive , raped - and left pregnant .
Intended Consequences tells the stories of some of these women , victims of the sexual violence used as a weapon of war against them .
Some 20,000 children were born as a result .
Photojournalist Jonathan Torgovnik photographed and interviewed 30 women and their families , and has produced a piece of incredible complexity : how does a woman care for her child when it 's the son or daughter of the man who raped her ?

Solidarity with refusers
By Adam Keller
Gush Shalom -- January 8 , 2009 -- Courage to Refuse has resumed its activity after several years and asked everybody to join them in picketing the Ministry of Defence .
Courage to Refuse was founded in 2002 , by reservists such as paratrooper officer David Zonshein , sickened and disgusted by the things they had seen ( and took part in ) during the army 's efforts to put down the second Intifada .
At that time they had a considerable impact , and their call upon reservists to refuse serving the occupation worried the military authorities .
But like other groups they were effectively derailed by Sharon 's Gaza trick , which placed on the Israeli public a unilateral and woefully incomplete " Disengagement " .
The beginning of the " Cast Lead " war in Gaza -– and specifically , the calling up of an increasing number of reservists , being massed at the Gaza Strip borders in preparation to be thrown in -- aroused Courage to Refuse back into action .
Some of the activists themselves got call - up orders , and they got urgent calls from many others who were called up and were far from eager to comply .
At least three reservists are known to have informed their officers of their outright refusal to go into Gaza , and many others have resorted to various means of " grey refusal " to avoid it .
For their part , the Courage to Refuse organisers drew up a new manifesto on which they are busily collecting the signatures of reservists , both those who were involved before and those were not ( see below ) .
A call was issued for a demonstration outside the Ministry of Defence on January 8 : " Once again we feel the need to call upon reservists and conscripts to refuse taking part in the brutal killing perpetrated by the Israeli Defence Force in Gaza .
The terrible bombing of the UNRWA school in Jabalya Refugee Camp , in which Israeli forces killed more than forty Palestinian civilians in a single moment , increased our determination to act - – coming after hundreds of civilians killed earlier , including many women and children .
A killing perpetrated under the pretext of security , under the Blue and White Flag , and in the name of every citizen of Israel .
A killing which must not be allowed to continue ! "
Members of other groups , such as ourselves of Gush Shalom , were welcomed to join in , but with a caution : " Without in any way detracting from the importance of earlier demonstrations against the war , in order to make an effective appeal to reservists we should use a bit different language than of the slogans used in these .
To restrain our anger , however justified , and moderate our narrative .
Not to call the Minister of Defence ` A murderer ' nor term the IDF `a terrorist organisation ' ( even when at times speaking in this way seems right ) but focus on the pure moral call upon soldiers to preserve the ' purity ' of their arms and refuse to take part in this madness . "
We " radicals " who joined the January 8 action respected the organisers ' wishes .
The slogans prepared by Courage to Refuse included " Revenge is not security " , " Refuse to take part in the in the campaign of bloodshed " , " No to the killing of civilians –- in Gaza and Sderot " , " Barak creates terror in Gaza " , " Refuse to fight in Gaza " ( this Hebrew slogan can also be translated as " Refuse to fight against Gaza " ) , " Refuse to destroy Gaza and Sderot " , " The destruction of Gaza produces terror " , " Courage to talk -- not to kill " .
Some of placards had the national Star of David inscribed beside the slogan –- which is far from the rule in other anti-war protests .
Even so , the call upon soldiders to refuse orders made it very radical confrontation with the present warlike atmosphere prevailing in the Israeli media and political system .
What next ?
So far , the military authorities refrained from imprisoning any of the refusing reservists , knowing from the earlier confrontations that any imprisoned refuser would become a focus of solidarity actions from which the movement could grow and snowball .
However , the Courage to Refuse organisers now contemplate a sharper action -– i.e. , going southwards to the Gaza Strip border , where the army concentrated the already mobilised thousands of reservists who might any day be sent into Gaza , with the government bent on escalating the war in defiance of the Security Council cease - fire resolution .
The military authorities might find it impossible to ignore and tacitly tolerate the presence of agitators busily " subverting the troops " .
The Gaza Refusal Manifesto
We , soldiers and officers of the IDF
To whom the security and future are dear
Who understand that the attack in Gaza intensifies the conflict , will bring additional long years of missiles upon growing circles of the Israeli population , and brings terrible disasters upon the peoples in Israel and Palestine alike .
We understand that revenge is not security and that the IDF operation in Gaza perpetuates the conflict , and certainly does not help its solution .
In light of the above , we hereby declare that we will not take part in the campaign of destruction in Gaza .

Israeli pilot refuses to target Palestinians
Press TV -- January 14 , 2009 --
An Israeli Apache helicopter pilot is refusing to take part in the ongoing onslaught against the civilians in the Gaza Strip .
Captain
Orr , who has flown dozens of combat missions over Gaza the past few weeks , said Tuesday that he decided to abort missions to avoid killing civilians after seeing children near his intended targets .
He also expressed sorrow for civilian casualties , the people who were caught up in the bombardment by him and his colleagues , saying that the vast majority of damage and casualties in Gaza were caused by flying attack helicopters and jet fighters .
Since the start of " Operation Cast Lead " , Israeli forces have killed more than 1000 Palestinians and wounded over 4580 others -- most of whom are women and children .
Captain
Orr made the remarks in an interview with Associated Press .
He was also accompanied by a military minder in order not to disclose confidential information .
As the civilian casualties in Gaza continues to rise , UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Wednesday called for an " immediate and durable ceasefire " in the region .
" I again urge both parties to stop now , to stop the fighting now , there is no time to lose , " Ban said at the start of his Middle East tour aimed at brokering a truce between Hamas and Israel .
The call for ceasefire comes as Tel Aviv continues to attack residential areas across Gaza with unconventional weapons including White phosphorus bombs .
White phosphorus , classified as a ' chemical weapon ' by the US intelligence , is an incendiary material that causes horrific burns , severe injuries or even death when it encounters human skin .
Absolutely not in their name , not in ours
By Michael Warschawski
January 18 , 2009 -- Ehud Barak , Tzipi Livni , Gabi Ashkenazi and Ehud Olmert -- do n’t you dare show your faces at any memorial ceremony for the heroes of the Warsaw Ghetto , Lublin , Vilna or Kishinev .
And you too , leaders of Peace Now , for whom peace means a pacification of the Palestinian resistance by any means , including the destruction of a people .
Whenever I will be there , I shall personally do my best to expel each of you from these events , for your very presence would be an immense sacrilege .
Not in their names
You have no right to speak in the name of the martyrs of our people .
You are not Anne Frank of the Bergen Belsen concentration camp but Hans Frank , the German general who acted to starve and destroy the Jews of Poland .
You are not representing any continuity with the Warsaw Ghetto , because today the Warsaw Ghetto is right in front of you , targeted by your own tanks and artillery , and its name is Gaza .
Gaza that you have decided to eliminate from the map , as General Frank intended to eliminate the Ghetto .
But , unlike the ghettos of Poland and Belorussia , in which the Jews were left almost alone , Gaza will not be eliminated because millions of men and women from the four corners of our world are building a powerful human shield carrying two words : never again !
Not in our name !
Together with tens of thousands of other Jews , from Canada to Great Britain , from Australia to Germany , we are warning you : do n't dare to speak in our names , because we will run after you , even , if needed , to the hell of war - criminals , and stuff your words down your throat until you ask for forgiveness for having mixed us up with your crimes .
We , and not you , are the children of Mala Zimetbaum and Marek Edelman , of Mordechai Anilevicz and Stephane Hessel , and we are conveying their message to humankind for custody in the hands of the Gaza resistance fighters :
" We are fighting for our freedom and yours , for our pride and yours , for our human , social and national dignity and yours . "
( Appeal of the Ghetto to the world , Passover 1943 )
But for you , the leaders of Israel , “ freedom ” is a dirty word .
You have no pride and you do not understand the meaning of human dignity .
We are not “ another Jewish voice ” , but the sole Jewish voice able to speak in the names of the tortured saints of the Jewish people .
Your voice is nothing other than the old bestial vociferations of the killers of our ancestors .

A call from within
In support of the Palestinian human rights community 's call for international action
January 8 , 2009 --
As if the occupation was not enough , the brutal ongoing repression of the Palestinian population , the construction of settlements and the siege of Gaza -- now comes the bombardment of the civilian population : men , women , old folks and children .
Hundreds of dead , hundreds of injured , overwhelmed hospitals , and the central medicine depot of Gaza bombed .
The ship Dignity of the Free Gaza movement which brought emergency medical supplies and a number of physicians was also attacked .
Israel has returned to openly committing war crimes , worse than what we have seen in a long time .
Israeli media do not expose their viewers to the horrors and to the voices of severe criticism of these crimes .
The story told is uniform .
Israeli dissidents are denounced as traitors .
Public opinion including that of the Zionist left supports the Israeli policy uncritically and without reservation .
Israel 's destructive criminal policy will not cease without a massive intervention by the international community .
However , except for some rather weak official condemnation , the international community is reluctant to intervene .
The United States openly supports the Israeli violence and Europe , although voicing some condemnation , is unwilling to seriously consider withdrawing the " gift " it handed Israel by upgrading its relations with the European Union .
In the past the world knew how to fight criminal policies .
The boycott on South Africa was effective , but Israel is handled with kid gloves : its trade relations are flourishing , academic and cultural cooperation continue and intensify with diplomatic support .
This international backing must stop .
That is the only way to stop the insatiable Israeli violence .
We are calling on the world to stop Israeli violence and not allow the continuation of the brutal occupation .
We call on the world to condemn and not become an accomplice in Israel 's crimes .
In light of the above , we call on the world to implement the call by Palestinian human rights organisations which urges :
• The UN Security Council to call an emergency session and adopt concrete measures , including the imposition of sanctions , in order to ensure Israel 's fulfillment of its obligations under international humanitarian law .
• The High Contracting Parties to the Geneva Conventions to fulfil their obligation under common Article 1 to ensure respect for the provisions of the Conventions , taking appropriate measures to compel Israel to abide by its obligations under international humanitarian law , in particular placing pivotal importance on the respect and protection of civilians from the effects of the hostilities .
• The High Contracting Parties to fulfil their legal obligation under Article 146 of the Fourth Geneva Convention to prosecute those responsible for grave breaches of the Convention .
• EU institutions and member states to make effective use of the European Union Guidelines on promoting compliance with international humanitarian law ( 2005 / C 327/04 ) to ensure Israel complies with international humanitarian law under paragraph 16 ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) of these guidelines , including the adoption of immediate restrictive measures and sanctions , as well as cessation of all upgrade dialogue with Israel .

Rabbinical statement on Gaza ( USA )
January 23 , 2009 --
As American rabbis and rabbinical students from various parts of the Jewish world , we express our sorrow and outrage over Israel 's latest military operation in Gaza .
Judaism teaches that all human beings are created in the image of God and that one who takes a single life destroys an entire world .
We condemn the firing of missiles from Gaza that forced so many Israelis to live in fear and we mourn the loss of life that resulted from these attacks .
However , we are devastated by Israel 's disproportionate use of force , killing more than 1,300 people , including over 450 children .
In the wake of such overwhelming civilian carnage , we can only ask , in the words of the Talmud , " How do we know that our blood is redder than the blood of our fellow ? "
Jewish tradition also teaches that " when an arrow leaves the hand of a warrior he cannot take it back . "
From this we learn that violence unleashes a myriad of consequences that we cannot control or reverse .
We cannot begin to fathom the depths of trauma this action has caused for those living in Gaza and the grief for scores of individuals , families and loved ones around the world .
Moreover we can only imagine the growing fury it has inspired in Gazans , Palestinians and the greater Arab world and the serious damage it has inflicted upon prospects for peace between Israelis and Palestinians .
In the wake of the recent cease - fire the task before the new American administration is all the more daunting - and all the more critical .
We urge our new president to turn back the policies of previous administrations - policies which have given Israel a blank check to take numerous measures that we believe are counter to the cause of peace , including the expropriation of Palestinian lands , destruction of Palestinians homes and businesses and the widespread building of settlements in occupied Palestinian territory , to name but a few .
We sincerely hope the Obama administration will find the courage to insist that the Israeli government end these actions in the strongest terms possible .
As Jewish spiritual leaders , we believe the pursuit of peace and justice to be our most sacrosanct value .
We reject the vision of this conflict as an " Us vs. Them " zero sum game .
We urge all who seek an end to this tragic conflict to commit themselves to peace , reconciliation and restorative justice .
We call for a political solution that ends the occupation , addresses the needs of Palestinian refugees and constructs a positive future by and for Israelis and Palestinians in the holy land .

British MP : `My grandmother did not die to provide cover for Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian grandmothers in Gaza '
By Liam Macuaid
January 15 , 2009 --
This snippet is taken from MRzine .
Gerald Kaufman is on the rightwing of the British Labour Party and it's so exceptionally rare for him to say much that the readers of this site would agree with that it ’s worth posting .
Sir Gerald Kaufman ( Manchester , Gorton ) ( Labour ) :
In congratulating my right hon .
Friend [ David Miliband ] on steering resolution 1860 through the United Nations Security Council , may I ask him what the international reaction would be if Hamas had slaughtered nearly 900 Israelis and subjected nearly 1.5 million Israelis to degradation and deprivation ?
Is it not an incontrovertible fact that Olmert , Livni and Barak are mass - murderers and war criminals — [ Interruption . ]
Yes .
And they bring shame on the Jewish people whose star of David they use as a flag in Gaza , but whose ethos and morals go completely against what this Israeli Government are doing .
The video can be seen here .
It 's an astonishingly powerful and personal speech .
This is the full text of Kaufman 's speech to the British House of Commons on January 15 , 2009 :
Sir Gerald Kaufman ( Manchester , Gorton ) ( Lab ) : I was brought up as an orthodox Jew and a Zionist .
On a shelf in our kitchen , there was a tin box for the Jewish National Fund , into which we put coins to help the pioneers building a Jewish presence in Palestine .
I first went to Israel in 1961 and I have been there since more times than I can count .
I had family in Israel and have friends in Israel .
One of them fought in the wars of 1956 , 1967 and 1973 and was wounded in two of them .
The tie clip that I am wearing is made from a campaign decoration awarded to him , which he presented to me .
I have known most of the Prime Ministers of Israel , starting with the founding Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion .
Golda Meir was my friend , as was Yigal Allon , Deputy Prime Minister , who , as a general , won the Negev for Israel in the 1948 war of independence .
My parents came to Britain as refugees from Poland .
Most of their families were subsequently murdered by the Nazis in the holocaust .
My grandmother was ill in bed when the Nazis came to her home town of Staszow .
A German soldier shot her dead in her bed .
My grandmother did not die to provide cover for Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian grandmothers in Gaza .
The current Israeli Government ruthlessly and cynically exploit the continuing guilt among gentiles over the slaughter of Jews in the holocaust as justification for their murder of Palestinians .
The implication is that Jewish lives are precious , but the lives of Palestinians do not count .
On Sky News a few days ago , the spokeswoman for the Israeli army , Major Leibovich , was asked about the Israeli killing of , at that time , 800 Palestinians — the total is now 1,000 .
She replied instantly that “ 500 of them were militants . ”
That was the reply of a Nazi .
I suppose that the Jews fighting for their lives in the Warsaw ghetto could have been dismissed as militants .
The Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni asserts that her Government will have no dealings with Hamas , because they are terrorists .
Tzipi Livni ’s father was Eitan Livni , chief operations officer of the terrorist Irgun Zvai Leumi , who organised the blowing - up of the King David hotel in Jerusalem , in which 91 victims were killed , including four Jews .
Israel was born out of Jewish terrorism .
Jewish terrorists hanged two British sergeants and booby - trapped their corpses .
Irgun , together with the terrorist Stern gang , massacred 254 Palestinians in 1948 in the village of Deir Yassin .
Today , the current Israeli Government indicate that they would be willing , in circumstances acceptable to them , to negotiate with the Palestinian President Abbas of Fatah .
It is too late for that .
They could have negotiated with Fatah ’s previous leader , Yasser Arafat , who was a friend of mine .
Instead , they besieged him in a bunker in Ramallah , where I visited him .
Because of the failings of Fatah since Arafat ’s death , Hamas won the Palestinian election in 2006 .
Hamas is a deeply nasty organisation , but it was democratically elected , and it is the only game in town .
The boycotting of Hamas , including by our Government , has been a culpable error , from which dreadful consequences have followed .
The great Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban , with whom I campaigned for peace on many platforms , said : “ You make peace by talking to your enemies . ”
However many Palestinians the Israelis murder in Gaza , they cannot solve this existential problem by military means .
Whenever and however the fighting ends , there will still be 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza and 2.5 million more on the west bank .
They are treated like dirt by the Israelis , with hundreds of road blocks and with the ghastly denizens of the illegal Jewish settlements harassing them as well .
The time will come , not so long from now , when they will outnumber the Jewish population in Israel .
It is time for our Government to make clear to the Israeli Government that their conduct and policies are unacceptable , and to impose a total arms ban on Israel .
It is time for peace , but real peace , not the solution by conquest which is the Israelis ’ real goal but which it is impossible for them to achieve .
They are not simply war criminals ; they are fools .
Jews in Solidarity with Palestine : Stop the US - backed genocidal Israeli war on Gaza
Nearly a thousand women , men and children killed by US - made Israeli bombs
Thousands more wounded
1.5 million under siege for the past 18 months , without food , water , medicine , fuel
Collective punishment for resisting occupation ; emergency aid blocked
Massive violations of international law
Apartheid wall
Racist oppression
Homes and land stolen
Forced into refugee camps
60 years of occupation , from the river to the sea
We say enough !
We are Jews in solidarity with Palestine
No to Israel !
Yes to self - determination , democracy & freedom !
Stop US Funding of the War on Palestine !
The whole world is horrified by the murderous Israeli assault against the suffering people of Gaza .
From Seoul to Caracas , from Johannesburg to Amman to London , millions of people have poured into the streets to demand an end to this genocidal campaign , which is funded by the United States and carried out with US - supplied weaponry .
There have also been protests in US cities .
While most of those marching are Arab - Americans , many African Americans , Latinos , Asian - Americans and whites have joined in .
Many Jewish people , outraged at Israel 's war crimes and anguished that they are carried out in their name , are speaking out .
It 's good that Jewish people of conscience are disassociating themselves from the Gaza aggression .
But it 's not enough .
This atrocity is only the latest , and it's no aberration .
It reflects the program of the Israeli settler state -- which is based on the theft of Palestine , the ouster and suppression of the Palestinian people , and the racist ideology of Zionism -- and of its primary sponsor , the Pentagon and US business establishment .
It 's not enough to oppose the bombing .
It 's not enough to demand an end to the 41 - year occupation of Gaza and the West Bank .
We stand in complete and unconditional support for the self - determination of the Palestinian people .
This includes the right to return to Palestine , from the river to the sea , and the right to democratically determine the form and the future of the Palestinian state .
Nothing less will undo the historic crime of al Nakba -- the 1948 catastrophe of the establishment of the state of Israel based on the ouster of the Palestinian people from their homeland , oppression and inequality .
That crime betrayed the whole history of the Jewish people .
From helping topple the czar in Russia and build the unions in New York , to resisting pogroms and fighting to the last breath in the Warsaw Ghetto , opposition to persecution , oppression and racism was central to the Jewish heritage .
We call on Jewish people around the world , including those inside Israel , to join us in reclaiming that heritage .
Reject racism and genocide .
Reject the Zionist state , the very concept of which is racist to the core .
Take the hand of our Palestinian sisters and brothers .
Defend their righteous struggle to restore their stolen land and build a democratic Palestine .
This is not an impossible quest .
Remember how mighty the settler state in South Africa seemed , only a little over two decades ago ?
The racist regime there was buttressed by US -- and Israeli -- support .
But it was battered by the unstoppable political and military struggle against apartheid , which gained worldwide support .
Apartheid fell , replaced by a new state based on legal equality .
A future of equality for all is possible in Palestine too .
Until this future is won , the Palestinian struggle will go on .
We stand with that struggle .

International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network :
We stand with the majority .
We will not be silent on Gaza .
We write with grief and rage as we watch the horrifying Israeli air and ground attacks on Gaza .
As Jews committed to ending Zionism , the founding ideology of Israel , and all forms of colonialism , we stand in solidarity with the Palestinian people , who continue to struggle in the face of these attacks , much as they have against more than 60 years of ethnic cleansing and racism .
As Joseph Massad recently wrote , Gaza is in uprising against genocide , and is receiving today the same indifference from the capitals of the West that the rebels in the Warsaw Ghetto received in 1943 .
We stand with the hundreds of thousands who have taken the streets in solidarity with Gaza¹s resistance .
We stand with all those who struggle against racism , dispossession and genocide .
We stand with the majority .
We will not be silent on Gaza .
We reject Israel 's pretence to act in response to rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas .
Israel broke the ceasefire on November 4 , 2008 , while world attention was focused on US elections .
What the Israeli government calls ``security '' is fundamentally opposed to the real safety of all people living in the region .
Residents of Sderot and other towns bordering Gaza have begged the government of Israel to maintain the ceasefire and accused it of ``wasting that period of calm , instead of using it to advance understanding and begin negotiations ' ' .
With United States , European Union , and Egyptian collusion , Israel imposed a siege and blockade for over two years , intentionally preventing its economic recovery , degrading its civilian infrastructure , attempting to dismantle self - governance , and preventing travel and obstructing humanitarian aid .
That siege , which was and continues to be a gross violation of human rights and a crime against humanity , led directly to the present escalation .
As of today , Israeli forces have killed over 700 people and injured thousands .
Israel has bombed mosques , universities , police headquarters , roads , office buildings , and residential neighbourhoods and schools , causing indescribable and horrible destruction .
This is n¹t defence .
This is n¹t a war between two sides .
This is terrorism .
This is genocide .
We stand with the majority .
We will not be silent on Gaza .
As Jews , we have an additional responsibility to speak and to act against these despicable acts , because we are heirs to the victims of a genocide , because Israel is claiming to ``defend '' us through the ethnic cleansing of Palestine with the ultimate goal of erasing the Palestinian people , and also because of the role played by the Jewish organisations in the United States and the West in justifying , perpetrating and escalating Israeli state terrorism against Palestinians .
We recall that the violence in Gaza today is the inevitable outcome -- the latest link in a chain of terror -- that results from an ideology based on the dispossession of the indigenous people of Palestine in favour of European Jews .
Just as the ideology of White racism was the backbone of apartheid in South Africa , so the ideology of Zionism explains the history of violence in Palestine , the ethnic cleansing of 1948 , the occupation of the West bank and Gaza in 1967 , and the many massacres that Israel perpetrated periodically since 1948 to the present one in Gaza .
The maintenance of the Israeli state as a state founded on and perpetuating Jewish privilege requires the denial and attempted annihilation of the Palestinian people .
We recall that unless this ideology is delegitimised and defeated , the violence in the Middle East will continue to escalate until either Palestinian or Jewish existence in the area ends , and possibly both .
Racism and colonial domination will never be the basis for peace .
We stand with the majority .
We will not be silent on Gaza .
We insist on an immediate end to Israel¹s assault , a complete withdrawal of all Israeli forces , a complete and unconditional end to the siege , and the restoration and extension of the ceasefire .
We insist on the establishment of a special international tribunal for investigating the crimes of the Israeli leadership of this siege .
We affirm the urgent need for Jewish resistance to Zionism and stand committed to the extrication of Jewish history , politics , community , and culture from the grip of Zionism .
We situate our work in a long legacy of Jewish people throughout history who have stood in solidarity with others in common struggles against all forms of racism , empire building , and repression .
As a growing sector of the Palestine solidarity movement , we call upon all Jews of conscience to take a strong stand against the current escalation of violence , as well as the murderous ground upon which Zionist ideology and the Israeli state has been constructed .
We call on Jews to put an end to complicity , to break the silence , and to confront the fallacy of a Zionist consensus .
We call on anti-Zionist Jews around the world to organise in escalation against the massacres on Gaza , and to continue to support Palestinian resistance through campaigns of Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions , and through actions that target their own governments ' financial and political support for Israel .
We stand with the majority .
We will not be silent on Gaza .
WE call on you to JOIN US in continued ACTION !
Mobilise creative actions to disrupt and confront pro-Israel events , propaganda and businesses .
Zionists and their supporters should not have their events , propaganda or business contributions in support of Israel go without confrontation .
Creative actions are those which use creative tactics , visuals and art to convey a message about the reason for the disruption such as die-ins , projections of images on the outside of Zionist organizations , public art displays , street theatre , etc .
Targets may include Zionist organizations that have been mobilising a lot of support for this attack , events to fundraise for the siege on Gaza , or billboards or poster campaigns to justify Israeli violence .
Other ways to take action
Join or organise emergency protests and direct actions in partnership with Palestine solidarity and social justice organisations in your area .
Donate money for Middle East Children 's Alliance ( MECA ) cargo of medical supplies and their delivery .
IJAN is partnering with MECA in collecting funds and organising pressure to allow over 5 tons of medical supplies into Gaza through the Rafah border with Egypt .
The current conditions in Gaza medical facilities are dire .
Please DONATE to MECA now !
In the next week IJAN will send an update out about the shipment , please be prepared to organise any necessary pressure in response to this update .
Contact government officials and call on them to act by denouncing the attacks and demanding an immediate cease - fire .
Flood Israeli embassies and consulates with letters and calls decrying the attacks .
Find contact info for Israeli embassies around the world .
Continue circulating the petition in support of UN General Assembly President Father Miguel D'Escoto Brockmann who has spoken out to condemn Israeli " Apartheid " and call for boycott , divestment and sanctions .
He has received death threats for his statement .
Call to Jewish students : Efforts are underway to make visible and support the activism of Jewish students who condemn Israel 's actions in Gaza and who support the movement for boycott , divestment and sanctions .
Join the " Jewish Students Condemn Israel , Support BDS Campus Campaigns ! "
Facebook cause .
Email students@ijsn.net to be added to the contact list for when IJAN student campaigns are launched and send reports for the website about Jewish student participation in Gaza solidarity actions .
The International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network ( IJAN ) is a growing international network of Jews whose Jewish identities are not based on Zionism but on a plurality of histories and experiences .
We share a commitment to participation in the legacy of struggles against colonisation and imperialism .
As such , we struggle against Zionism and its manifestation in the State of Israel¹s historic and ongoing ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people and the confiscation of their land .

Brian Klug :
Not in my name
By Brian Klug Guardian , January 9 , 2009 --
In any conflict between peoples , there is a time for balancing the books , for placing facts neatly in the debit and credit columns , for issuing measured statements about the rights and wrongs on both sides .
But not in the midst of one - sided carnage .
The only decent thing to feel at the present time is outrage .
The only thing for decent people to do right now is to condemn , without reserve or qualification , the brutal campaign that the Israeli military is waging against the population of Gaza .
Every if and but derogates from decency .
Earlier this week , my synagogue sent its members an email containing details of two rallies in support of Israel " which we would urge you to support " .
No ifs and buts here , just solid support for the perpetrator in the midst of the horror it is perpetrating .
Is it possible to go further in the opposite direction to decency ?
Attached was a flyer for a " Mass Rally in Support of Israel " organised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council , with " the support of the major organisations of UK Jewry " , to be held in London this weekend .
The flyer proclaims : " End Hamas terror ! "
No ifs and buts here either .
No hint at the unspeakable state terror being unleashed , day after day , by the Israeli military .
It defies belief .
So , let me place on record the following fact : the board does not speak for all British Jews and certainly not for this one .
Nor does the so - called Leadership Council , nor any of the organisations associated with this misbegotten event .
None of them represents me or the Judaism that I cherish and which leads me to say as follows : I condemn utterly the military offensive by the government of Israel against the people of Gaza .
The loss of any human life , on whatever side of this conflict , is a terrible thing .
At this juncture , though , my heart is with the Palestinians on the ground in the midst of their misery .
And I extend my hand to those Israelis who are speaking out against their own government .

Jews call on Israeli soldiers to stop war crimes
We Jews in the international community call upon Israeli soldiers to raise the Black Flag of Illegality over the operations against the people of Gaza .
We refuse to remain silent while Israeli leaders force Israeli soldiers to commit war crimes : crimes against humanity for which they will one day be called to account .
Israeli soldiers of conscience can , and must , stop this dangerous , illegal , and immoral war .
This criminal activity does nothing to advance the health and welfare of Jews .
Rather , from Sderot to Sydney , from Ashkelon to Amsterdam , we will all benefit when there is justice for Palestinians .
Therefore , we call on you to use all measures possible to stop these atrocities against the Palestinian people .
Flagrantly illegal orders must not simply be disobeyed , but actively and effectively opposed .
We members of the international Jewish community call on you , the Israeli soldiers of conscience , to halt the Israeli war machine , which only you can , and must , do .

Letter by prominent British Jews on Israel 's war on Gaza
The Guardian , Saturday , January 10 , 2009
We the undersigned are all of Jewish origin .
When we see the dead and bloodied bodies of young children , the cutting off of water , electricity and food , we are reminded of the siege of the Warsaw Ghetto .
When Dov Weisglass , an adviser to the Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert , talked of putting Gazans " on a diet " and the deputy defence minister , Matan Vilnai , talked about the Palestinians experiencing " a bigger shoah "
( holocaust ) , this reminds us of Governor General Hans Frank in Nazi- occupied Poland , who spoke of " death by hunger " .
The real reason for the attack on Gaza is that Israel is only willing to deal with Palestinian quislings .
The main crime of Hamas is not terrorism but its refusal to accept becoming a pawn in the hands of the Israeli occupation regime in Palestine .
The decision last month by the EU council to upgrade relations with Israel , without any specific conditions on human rights , has encouraged further Israeli aggression .
The time for appeasing Israel is long past .
As a first step , Britain must withdraw the British ambassador to Israel and , as with apartheid South Africa , embark on a programme of boycott , divestment and sanctions .

Statement condemning Israel 's attacks on Gaza by Independent Australian Jewish Voices
Monday , January 5 , 2009
The following statement reflects only the views of those signatories whose names appear below .
Signatories of other statements or authors of articles and blogs on our IAJV website are not to be taken as endorsing this statement .
---------------------
We are Australian Jews who join thousands in Israel and around the world condemning ongoing Israeli military attacks on Gaza .
Together with Israeli peace group Gush Shalom , we condemn the current war as " inhuman , superfluous " and " abominable " .
While Israel has the right to protect its citizens and to demand an end to the crime of Palestinian rockets that target civilians , this cannot be used as a pretext for the grossly disproportionate military assault on Gaza because it was Israel that violated the fragile truce on November 4 , 2008 .
Furthermore , Israel ignored Hamas ' diplomatic initiatives to re-establish the cease - fire since it expired on December 19 .
The crude home - made rockets have caused relatively few Israeli casualties .
By contrast , Israeli bombardment has caused [ at the time of this statement 's release ] around 400 deaths and 2000 casualties including a large proportion of women and children .
The bombardment has included civilian targets such as a university , television station , factories , mosques , ministry offices , parliament and refugee camps .
Since Hamas is a legitimate , democratically elected political party that controls the government , security - related institutions are also civilian targets including police departments and uniformed officers .
History has demonstrated that military punishment has never broken the spirit of a people or produced peace .
On the contrary , the assault on the population of Gaza will only inflame hatred of Jews and of the State of Israel while doing nothing to protect the lives of Israelis .
Above all , it will undermine the prospects of joining with peace - seeking Palestinians to negotiate a lasting , just solution to the conflict .
The war on the population of Gaza comes after the Israeli blockade that had already created a severe humanitarian crisis under which the Palestinians suffered from lack of food , electricity , medicines , hospital equipment and other basic necessities of life .
The blockade was condemned by the UN as a violation of international law and , like the massive Israeli air - strikes , constitutes illegal collective punishment prohibited by the Geneva Conventions .
We call for an immediate end to attacks on civilians by Palestinians and Israelis .
However , since Palestinians have no means of self - defence against the most powerful military force in the Middle East , we particularly call on Israel to end its brutal assault on the vulnerable Palestinian people of Gaza and to reconsider its rejection of the UN Security Council 's call for a cease - fire .
Israel has refused to accept Hamas ' consistent offer of negotiations since its election win in 2006 .
There can be no solution to the conflict without Israel being a willing partner to dialogue .

Palestinian , Jewish and local activists shut down Israeli Consulate ( San Francisco )
Thursday , January 15 , 2009 San Francisco
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 15 , 2009
Contact : Harris Kornstein , ( 510 ) 343-6065
Raw video , audio , and photos available .
Arrested participants available for interviews .
SAN FRANCISCO – A group of nine activists – Palestinian , anti-Zionist Jewish , and immigrant rights activists – blocked the entrance of the Israeli Consulate beginning at 8:30 am today , in non-violent protest of Israeli apartheid and its current attacks on Gaza .
The activists chained themselves together using handcuffs and locks , locked the doors to the building , and were joined by a diverse rally of over 40 supporters .
The action was organised jointly by local Palestinians and Jews in support of : an immediate ceasefire ; the opening of land , sea , and air borders to allow in emergency supplies ; and an end to US financial and political support for Israel .
“ For the past sixty years , Israel has tried to eliminate the Palestinian people by forcing them out of their homes and off their lands , starving them , and killing them ” , said Maria Poblet , an immigrants ’ rights organizer .
“ The recent blockades and attacks in Gaza are not an exception , but a brutal reminder that killing civilians is a regular part of Israeli strategy . ”
Linked arm in arm , Bay Area Jews , Palestinians and social - justice activists aim to increase pressure on Israel and its supporters in the face of the 21 - day siege on Gaza and the growing humanitarian crisis .
All nine activists were arrested after about two hours , charged with trespassing , and allowed to leave .
This action is one in a series that has moved from Toronto , to New York , to Los Angeles .
Organisers assert that the current situation in Gaza is not a conflict between two peoples of equivalent capacities , nor is Israel ’s motive self - defense .
“ For the past year and a half , Israel has enacted strangling sanctions under the guise of targeting Hamas , collectively starving the entire population of food , water , medicine , and other vital resources , ” stated Monadel Herzallah of the United States Palestinian Community Network .
“ The recent air and ground strikes are another brutal blow to Gazans who are already trapped in a concentration camp of despair and growing poverty . ”
Activists also spoke out against the US pledge of more than $ 3 billion each year in unrestricted aid to Israel .
“ Israel ’s use of US aid and military equipment violates our own laws .
We can choose to uphold US and international laws , or ignore them as we are now doing at the peril of our conscience and our place among all of humanity ” , said Nadeen Elshorafa of the General Union of Palestinian Students .
Organizer Sara Kershnar of the International Jewish anti-Zionist Network summed up the sentiment : “ Today , as Palestinians , Jews and our united allies , we make our position clear : we are on one side , the side of justice ; Israel , an apartheid state , is on the other . ”

Hamas executes suspected Fatah traitors in Gaza Fatah officials say 19 members killed in Gaza , many tortured
Israeli soldiers are briefed at a staging area on the Israel - Gaza border , just outside the northern Gaza Stip , Wednesday Jan. 21 , 2009 .
Israel withdrew the last of its troops from the Gaza Strip before dawn on Wednesday , the military said , as the government pursued diplomatic efforts to stanch the flow of arms into the Hamas - ruled territory .

As Israel 's last troops left the Gaza Strip Wednesday , Hamas officials conceded that they are executing Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel during the three - week invasion .
In the West Bank , Fatah officials said at least 19 of its members have been executed and many more brutally tortured .
Gaza residents say Hamas is using schools and other public buildings in Gaza City , and the towns of Khan Yunis and Rafah as detention centers to interrogate members of Fatah , their political rivals .
They said three men have been blinded during questioning and more than 60 have been shot in the legs as punishment .
" They are committing human rights violations in a very brutal manner , " Mahmoud Habbash , Palestinian Authority minister of social welfare said in Ramallah .
" Not only did Israel perpetrate war crimes , but Hamas also has been targeting innocent Palestinians . "
' Kisses to Israeli warplanes '
A leaflet distributed by the Fatah military wing , the Al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigades , pleaded with Hamas to " respect the blood of the Palestinian martyrs " and urged them to stop pursuing Fatah members in Gaza .
The leaflet said Hamas has arrested hundreds of Fatah members since the cease - fire and has threatened to shoot anyone who refuses to surrender .
While Fatah leaders in the West Bank also accused Hamas of stealing U.N. aid convoys , Hamas officials denounced Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and his Fatah movement for collaborating with Israel and said they no longer recognized his authority since his term officially ended on Jan.
9 .
In Damascus , Moussa Abu Marzook , the Hamas deputy political leader , told reporters that senior Fatah officials had " distributed candy celebrating the Gaza offensive , sent kisses to Israeli warplanes " and " guided these planes to their targets . "
Admitting that suspected collaborators were being executed in Gaza , Abu Marzook said " many people from the former Palestinian Authority viewed the Israeli offensive as an opportunity to rise to power again " in Gaza .
Bitter rivals
Hamas and Fatah have been bitter rivals since June 2007 , when Hamas ousted Fatah from Gaza after launching a bloody coup against the Abbas government .
About 400 Fatah supporters were killed and many others badly maimed .
Since the 23 - day Israeli assault on Gaza ended in a cease - fire Sunday , Hamas has repeatedly accused Abbas of backing Israel and has branded him a traitor and collaborator .
On the first day of the invasion on Dec. 27 , Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal called on Palestinians in the West Bank to overthrow the Abbas government in a " quiet intifada . "
More recently , Mohammed Al - Ghoul , Hamas justice minister , said Abbas should be put on trial for conspiring against the Palestinian people " in full coordination with the Israeli occupation . "
Ihab Ghissin , a spokesman for the Hamas Ministry of Interior in Gaza , confirmed the arrest of Fatah activists .
" We have managed to capture a number of collaborators who are now being questioned for their role in aiding the Zionist aggression , " he told reporters in Gaza City .
Fatah officials have dismissed the accusations of spying for Israel , pointing out that Abbas has described Israel 's three - week offensive as " barbaric and criminal . "
On Tuesday , Abbas backed an Arab League statement that accused Israel of war crimes .
On Wednesday , a Fatah flyer calling West Bank residents to attend mass rallies today to condemn the invasion said " Israeli aggression did not distinguish between Palestinian factions . "
David Makovsky , director of the Washington Institute 's Project on the Middle East Peace Process , says Hamas has been hurling spy accusations at Fatah since the takeover of Gaza .
" It 's clearly more palatable to Hamas to accuse Fatah of collaborating with Israel than to openly admit their desire for raw power over Gaza , " said Makovsky .
Hamas proof
But Hamas legislator Salah Bardaweel said he has proof that Fatah helped Israel assassinate security chief Said Siam , commander of the 15,000 - strong Hamas Executive Force militia .
Siam was killed along with his brother and another senior security official in an air strike last week .
Bardaweel said Fatah informants reported directly to Abbas officials in the West Bank .
" We had arrested a number of them prior to the Israeli assault , and we found them with plans showing homes of Hamas ' leaders , and places where Hamas stores its weapons .
They have admitted their guilt and told us names of their masters , who would , in turn , inform the Israeli intelligence ... to facilitate the Israeli mission , " said Bardaweel .
In Gaza City , Fatah activists told spine - chilling stories of retribution .
Relatives of Abed al - Gharabli , a former Fatah security officer who spent 12 years in an Israeli prison , said he was kidnapped by a group of Hamas militiamen who shot him in both legs after severely torturing him .
Ziad Abu Hayeh , a Al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigade commander , is reported to have been blinded after being abducted from his home in Khan Yunis by Hamas gunmen .
In other cases , Fatah supporters were simply shot in the legs - a favored Hamas tactic during the 2007 coup that drove Fatah out of Gaza .
The crackdown suggests it will not be easy to bring Hamas and Fatah together in a national unity government that many observers believe is the only way to lift international sanctions against Gaza and ensure the speedy flow of goods to a population in desperate need of aid .
The European Union has said it will not give reconstruction funds to Hamas , only to the Abbas government .
As you know from Apocalypse Now and , to a lesser extent , Platoon , one problem was that the regular farm folk who we were trying to liberate in South Vietnam , and the commie bad guys we were fighting , were often the same guys .
So we launched the Strategic Hamlet Program to try to separate the bad guys from the good , so we could then kill that first group .
Makes sense .
The idea was to set up villages that would be provided with supplies and protection by the non-commie South Vietnam government .
The rural folk would all move there and would be so grateful they would support the good guys .
This was all based on the scientific principle that , " If you force millions of people to pack up their shit and move to a new place that they have to build themselves with a bunch of strangers , they will love you for it . "

How could that shit not work ?
How It Backfired :
These " hamlet " and " village " words do n't really do this program justice .
Protecting and supplying a couple of small towns would have been no big deal .
But in all , the Strategic Hamlet Program ended up relocating 8.5 million people .
The government had no ability to supply and protect that many .
Basically , they had a plan in place to take control of the area , but no plan in place to tell them what to do when they took control .
Who does that ?
We do !
With millions of newly pissed - off South Vietnamese villagers now condensed in small areas , the communist insurgents were able to come in and recruit support at an impressive rate .
In some cases there were as many insurgent recruits inside the villages as there were outside .

This posed an all new problem for U.S. and South Vietnam forces .
Take a look at these two pictures of people who , according to the professionals at ratethisasian.com , are both Vietnamese .
Would you be able to tell which one is the communist insurgent ?
Yeah , neither could we ( although the sunflowers indicate possible hippie activity ) .
At any rate , U.S. and South Vietnamese forces faced this same problem , albeit at a presumably much less sexy level , with the Strategic Hamlet Program .
Ordinary non-combatant citizens were now living amongst just as many enemy fighters .
And nobody could tell the difference .
Federal health officials said a single strain of salmonella has sickened 388 people in 42 states since the fall , but the cause of the outbreak remains unknown .
The outbreak started Sept. 3 , but most patients have become ill since mid-October , Lola Russell , a spokeswoman for the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said Wednesday .
Ms. Russell did n't give a number for how many were hospitalized , but said it was 18 % of those interviewed .

While I generally try to leave the filleting of the conservative movement 's more outrageous voices to the experts ( knives being sharp and all ) , I occasionally attempt a skewer or two when so moved .
At the risk of relying on anecdote , though , it seems that every time I write something about Ann Coulter or Rush Limbaugh I 'm chided from the left ( " why waste time talking about them ? " ) or the right ( " they do n't really represent the Republican Party / conservative movement in America " ) .
Well , an interesting thing is happening within the Republican Party , and it only exposes the prominence of voices like Limbaugh's , and the extent to which he can actually bring elected GOP representatives to their knees .
I 'm sure many of you are already familiar with the story of Rep. Phil Gingrey ( R - GA ) , the chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee , who recently had some mild criticismsfor Limbaugh - particularly appropriate given Limbaugh 's recent declaration that he hopes the Obama Presidency fails , consequences to the American public be damned , and that the Republican leadership seemed frightened to pursue such a strategy .
After Gingrey 's faint rebuke , Limbaugh lashed out , and Gingrey supplicated himself before El Rushbo :
“ I never told Rush to back off , ” Gingrey continued .
“ I regret and apologize for the fact that my comments have offended and upset my fellow conservatives — that was not my intent … Rush Limbaugh , Sean Hannity , Newt Gingrich , and other conservative giants are the voices of the conservative movement ’s conscience . ”
As Steve Benen observed :
Gingrey went on to say , " I see eye - to - eye with Rush Limbaugh , " adding that he 's among millions of Americans " inspired " by Limbaugh Note , Gingrey had n't said anything especially controversial yesterday .
It iseasy for political observers on the outside to criticize , as compared to keeping a party together .
But Gingrey not only faced a swift rebuke for daring to question Leader Limbaugh , but apologized , in writing , and in an embarrassingly meek tone .
The Republican Party is suffering something of a leadership vacuum .
It 's pretty obvious who 's calling the shots .
[ emphasis added throughout ]
Indeed .
But it did n't end there .
Mike Pence ( R - IN ) was next in line to make gestures in Limbaugh 's direction cooing about how he " cherish[es ] " Limbaugh 's " voice in the debate . "
Yeah , what 's not to love .
But stillit did not end there .
The Wall St. Journal lept into the fray and offered Rush a spot on its Op - Ed pages from which to offer a solution to the economic crisis - a sophomoric proposal that does n't even pretend to take into account questions of efficacy .
No , to Rush , it 's all a political ruse :
Fifty - three percent of American voters voted for Barack Obama ; 46 % voted for John McCain , and 1 % voted for wackos .
Give that 1 % to President Obama .
Let ’s say the vote was 54 % to 46 % .
As a way to bring the country together and at the same time determine the most effective way to deal with recessions , under the Obama - Limbaugh Stimulus Plan of 2009 : 54 % of the $ 900 billion — $ 486 billion — will be spent on infrastructure and pork as defined by Mr. Obama and the Democrats ; 46 % — $ 414 billion — will be directed toward tax cuts , as determined by me .
Brilliant !
Erected on such solid economic principles !
How could that possibly fail !
So there you have it , the cherished voice of the conservative conscience offering a fiscal gimmick that , however ludicrous , the GOP leaders know better than to question .
No , I expect them all to tiptoe around l'enfant terrible as if he was little Anthony Fremont .
But now that the GOP has acknowledged Rush 's place in the movement 's firmament , should n't we all drop the protests that Rush is too insignificant to discuss , or that discussing his views would be a waste of time because he does n't really speak for the GOP ?
Why , he 's one of their most revered pundits .
" Inspirational " even .
Given this , I believe it would be fair - no necessary - that the media ask a whole host of questions of GOP representatives regarding Limbaugh 's past statements / positions .
After all , the media has a duty to inform the American people of just how much influence the extreme right wing has over the Republican Party .
A short list below the fold , but feel free to add your own .
In my last post I made a mistake of publishing a piece of code that used C++ weak atomics –which are part of the new C++ Memory Model .
I qualified the post by saying that I had no proof of correctness , and the main purpose of it was to discourage the use of weak atomics .
In a way the post was successful because it did prove that weak atomics are very tricky indeed .
As was pointed out to me by Anthony and Dmitriy , my implementation was incorrect ( I modified the post retroactively to make this point clear ) .
Additionally , in his blog , Anthony published a proof of the algorithm posted by Dmitriy .
And that ’s when the fun started …
Before I describe what happened , let me give you a bird ’s eye view of the C++ Memory Model .
The Model
The purpose of a memory model is to define the semantics of concurrent operations at an abstract level –independent of the platform on which the program is running .
Essentially , one has to define in what order program statements may be executed , and what memory values may be observed .
The basic memory model , the one used by Java , is based on sequential consistency .
Program statements are executed in program order on each processor , and the actions of multiple threads are interleaved in some ( global ) order .
A memory load can only see the value that was written last , according to this global order .
The C++ strong atomics ( the default ) follow this model .
It ’s the weak atomics that are trouble .
Weak atomics let the programmer specify memory ordering of loads and stores that is less than sequentially consistent .
Unlike the sequentially consistent model , the model for weak atomics cannot be described in terms of a state machine ( this was pointed out and criticized by Herb Sutter in his Prism proposal ) .
Instead the model is formulated as a set of global constraints imposed on executions .
In a state - machine formulation , a step the program takes is based on previous history .
The step does n’t have to be uniquely defined –the machine may be non-deterministic .
The execution may split into multiple branches .
What is important , though , is that the step taken does not depend on the future of the execution .
This is not true in the weak - atomics model .
The way to think about it is that , in a non-sequentially - consistent execution , the values seen by memory loads may come either from the past or from the future .
A processor may speculate–make a guess at the values that have not been stored yet .
A speculation may be discarded if the guess turns out to be wrong , or accepted if it was right .
So the acceptability of a given execution can only be determined by looking at the whole execution , from start to end .
Understandably , this makes any correctness proofs extremely tricky .
The Proof
The proposed implementation of the Peterson lock using weak atomics can be reduced to the following :
// Thread 0 zeroWants.save( true , memory_order_relaxed ) ; r0 = victim.exchange( 0 , memory_order_acq_rel ) ; r1 = oneWants.load( memory_order_acquire ) ; // Thread 1 oneWants.save ( true , memory_order_relaxed ) ; r2 = victim.exchange ( 1 , memory_order_acq_rel ) ; r3 = zeroWants.load(memory_order_acquire ) ;
( The memory_order_acquire directives in the two loads are needed for synchronization with the unlock part of the algorithm , which is not included here . )
The hardest part of the proof is to show mutual exclusion–it should be impossible for both threads to enter the critical section at the same time .
In Peterson ’s algorithm , the entrance to the critical section is predicated on the values loaded into r1 and r3 .
If both values are false , the algorithm is broken .
Let ’s consider the situation when both threads try to acquire the lock for the first time .
The values of zeroWants and oneWants are initially false , and the value of victim is zero .
Is it possible for both loads ( zeroWants and oneWants ) to see the initial values , rather than the ones saved by the opposing thread ?
The short answer is yes , as long as there is no intervening inter - thread synchronization .
In this case , the only synchronization that may happen is between a store - release in one thread and the corresponding load - acquire in the other .
For instance , if the load part of the exchange operation on victim in thread 0 sees the value written by the store part of the exchange in thread 1 ( that is , r0 is equal to 1 ) , than these two operations are in a “ synchronizes - with ” relationship .
We can then establish the following chronology :
The save of true to oneWants in T1 happens before the store of 1 to victim ( part of exchange ) in T1 .
This is guaranteed by program order .
The store of 1 into victim in T1 happens before the load of victim in T0 ( part of exchange ) .
This is because r0 is 1 in this part of the proof .
The load of victim in T0 happens before the load of oneWants in T0 .
This is guaranteed by program order .
Because the happens - before relation is transitive , we can conclude that the load of oneWants in T0 ( item 3 ) must see the value stored in T1 ( item 1 ) , which is true , and therefore T0 wo n’t enter the critical section .
So far so good .
That was the simple case .
Here ’s the controversial one : Both r0 and r2 are zero .
In particular , it means that r0 came from the initial value of victim .
What about r2 ?
It could have come either from the exchange in T0 or from the initial value of victim ( both are zero ! ) .
According to the memory model , we have to consider both cases !
If r0 came from the exchange in T1 then we can use the same reasoning as before to conclude that T1 cannot enter the critical section .
But if the source of the zero in r0 is the original value of victim then there is no synchronization between T0 and T1 .
Both threads can enter the critical section !
You might be thinking : Either the exchange in T1 comes first and the exchange in T2 must see its value , or the exchange in T2 comes first and the one in T1 must see its value–they can’t both see the original value .
This just shows you how ingrained sequentially consistent thinking is .
There is no meaning to “ comes first ” in the world of weak atomics .
Two events may only be sequenced if they occur in the same thread , or there is a synchronization path between them .
Here we are still at the stage of trying to establish whether the two exchanges are synchronized or not .
The Controversy
Let me spell it out :
Both exchanges see the initial value of victim .
Since they did n’t interact , there is no synchronizes - with relationship between them .
Therefore we ca n’t establish any inter - thread chronology , and it ’s perfectly possible for both threads to see the original values of zeroWants and oneWants .
// Thread 0 zeroWants.save( true , memory_order_relaxed ) ; r0 = victim.exchange( 0 , memory_order_acq_rel ) ; // sees initial value , 0 r1 = oneWants.load( memory_order_acquire ) ; // sees initial value , false // Thread 1 oneWants.save ( true , memory_order_relaxed ) ; r2 = victim.exchange ( 1 , memory_order_acq_rel ) ; // sees initial value , 0 r3 = zeroWants.load(memory_order_acquire ) ; // sees initial value , false
I had concluded that the implementation was broken , but I let Anthony defend his proof .
Here ’s the argument he presented , based on the modification order of victim .
The C++ memory model enforces global modification order for every memory location .
The victim variable starts at zero and then is modified twice by the exchanges in T0 and T1 .
If thread T1 sees the original value , zero , of victim then the same exchange modifies it to one .
The modification order is therefore ( T1 : 1 , T0 : 0 ) .
If we assume that an atomic exchange must always see the preceding value in the modification order , then we must conclude that the exchange in T0 must read 1 .
Therefore it synchronizes with the exchange in T1 and mutual exclusion is assured .
And here ’s the clincher :
The draft C++ Standard did not specify what value must be seen by the atomic exchange ( or , more generally , by an atomic Read - Modify - Write operation ) .
I confirmed that with Hans Boehm , who concluded that this apparent hole in the standard must be corrected .
The next draft of the Standard will say that a RMW operation must see the last value in the modification order of the memory object in question .
Only then the proof of correctness of the weak - atomics implementation of Peterson lock will be complete .
Conclusion
I had no idea what I was getting myself into when attempting to reason about C++ weak atomics .
The theory behind them is so complex that it ’s borderline unusable .
It took three people ( Anthony , Hans , and me ) and a modification to the Standard to complete the proof of a relatively simple algorithm .
Imagine doing the same for a lock - free queue based on weak atomics !
Hans , who was instrumental in creating the C++ memory model , hopes that weak atomics will be a stopgap measure until processor designers find more efficient ways of implementing sequential consistency .
For now , it is strongly recommended to leave weak atomics to top experts whose numbers can be counted on the fingers of one hand .
I ’m grateful to ( in order of appearance ) Anthony Williams , Dmitriy V’jukov , Hans Boehm , and others who contributed to this post .
GREAT cornering and eye - popping acceleration make Porsche 's cars popular among thrill - seeking bankers and hedge - fund managers .
Now its clients are discovering that the carmaker itself has an unexpected talent for cornering markets .
In a few tumultuous days it is thought to have made a cool € 6 billion - 12 billion ( $ 7.5 billion - 15 billion ) on the share price of Volkswagen ( VW ) — a coup that has roiled the world 's financial markets .
Porsche 's gambit was as old as finance itself .
For about three years it had been steadily increasing its stake in VW , a much larger yet less profitable carmaker with which it shares a little production .
Its buying had driven up the price of VW 's shares to above the level at which it would make any economic sense for Porsche to buy VW .
Seeing this , hedge funds sold shares in VW that they did not own .
One strategy was a bet that VW 's share price would fall .
Some also bought shares in Porsche , in a wager that shares of both would converge .
The risks of short selling should have been apparent to the brightest hedge - fund managers in Mayfair and Greenwich because of widespread suspicion that Porsche , a dab hand in currency - derivatives markets , was also mucking about with options on VW stock .
Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley warned clients on October 8th of the danger of playing “ billionaire 's poker ” by betting against Porsche .
Max Warburton of Alliance Bernstein said Porsche could make billions by squeezing short - sellers of VW 's shares .
At the time Porsche dismissed these musings as a “ fairy - tale ” .
But on October 26th it executed a handbrake turn , saying that it owned nearly 43 % of VW 's shares outright and had derivative contracts on nearly 32 % more .
That meant it had tied up almost all of the freely available shares ( the rest are held by the state government and index funds ) .
Hedge funds quickly did the maths , concluding that they could be caught in an “ infinite squeeze ” in which they were forced to buy shares at any price .
Their frenzied buying sent VW 's share price soaring ( see chart ) .
After languishing below € 200 last year , it jumped to more than € 1,005 at one point on October 28th , briefly making VW the world 's most valuable company .
Porsche may have made paper gains of € 30 billion - 40 billion in what one analyst described as “ one of the most brilliantly conceived wealth transfers ever . ”
Porsche says it never intended to make money on derivatives and only bought them to protect its planned purchases of VW stock .
On October 29th it said that it would settle up to 5 % of its VW options , freeing up a similar portion of stock and sending the price down again .
Hedge funds that take bad bets may garner little sympathy , but the VW saga does more than punish a few “ locusts ” .
On October 28th shares in Morgan Stanley , Goldman Sachs and Société Générale wobbled on worries ( denied by all ) that they might also be exposed to VW .
If the losses are big enough to cause the failure of even a few hedge funds , that would spell more pain for the battered banking system .
Other casualties include buyers of passive funds that track the German market who will end up with a disproportionate stake in VW within their portfolios .
With VW 's share price falling again , those who sell now will lock in a loss .
The greatest damage is to the reputation of Germany 's capital markets , where regulators are now belatedly investigating what went on .
Allowing acquirers to build large secret stakes in bid targets does nothing for confidence .
Even Porsche may come to rue its coup .
“ They may struggle to sell 911s to hedge - fund managers for years and years to come , ” says one investor .
The eccentric uncle who left a garage in his will ... containing a £ 6 m Bugatti supercar
When eccentric doctor and compulsive hoarder Harold Carr died at the age of 89 , his relatives faced a daunting task to sort through his possessions .
His home was packed with piles of medical machinery , 1,500 beer steins , thousands of receipts and even a World War Two spy drone .
But all the effort became worth it when they opened the door of his garage - and struck gold .
Superblast from the past :
The 1937 Bugatti - one of only 17 made in the world - stunned Dr Harold Carr 's family when they opened his garage
Inside they found a 1937 Bugatti Type 57S Atalante , one of only 17 ever made .
The historic automobile with only 26,284 miles on the clock still has 99 per cent of its original parts .
It will be sold in Paris next month and is strongly tipped to surpass the £ 4.7 million world record for a car at auction .
Auctioneers have put a reserve price of £ 3 million on a two - seater described as one of the ' ultimate road - going sports cars from the golden era of the 1930s ' .
And despite the credit crunch it could fetch anything up to £ 6 million .
Keen flier : Dr Carr in his younger days
Fifteen of the 17 Type 57S Atalantes still exist .
This particular model was originally owned by Earl Howe , a leading figure in the early days of British motor sport .
It has a 3.3 - litre , eightcylinder engine , four - speed manual gearbox , can reach 60 mph in ten seconds and has a top speed of 130 mph .
Dr Carr , an orthopaedic surgeon who served as an army doctor during World War Two and also became a keen flier , bought the vehicle in 1955 for £ 895 - the equivalent of £ 15,500 today .
He drove it for a few years before leaving it in the garage near his home at Gosforth , Newcastle upon Tyne .
The last tax disc expired in December 1960 .
He never married and eight relatives are to share the proceeds of his estate .
A nephew , who wishes to remain anonymous , said : ' We knew he had some cars , but we had no idea what they were .
' It was a bit of local folklore that he had a Bugatti , but no one knew for sure .
It 's worth so much because he has n't used it for 50 years .
It was one of the original supercars .
' When it was built it could reach 130 mph at a time when other cars could only do 50 mph .
Of course we are delighted and we 're going to make sure the money is shared out among the family .
It 's a wonderful thing to leave . '
He described his uncle as ' a very eccentric old gent ' , adding : ' I suppose you could call him a mad doctor .
People who saw him in the street thought he was a tramp .
He would wear two pairs of trousers at the same time .
' All the children would laugh at him in the street when he tinkered with his cars because he wore a piece of rubber tube round his head to stop the oil getting in his hair .
But he was always such a generous man . '
In his later years Dr Carr suffered from a form of obsessive compulsive disorder and hoarded everything in the house he refused to leave .
Files were piled 6 ft high at his detached home , including even receipts for pencils bought in the 1950s .
' Since he died , it has taken me 18 months to get where I am today , ' said the nephew .
' There was an awful lot to sort out with his house . '
Classic car : The Bugatti Type 57S Atalante
A classic Aston Martin was found in another garage and sold for ' tens of thousands ' , but an E - type Jaguar was in such a poor state that it had to be scrapped .
Over the years Dr Carr resisted many offers to buy the Bugatti .
When his property was cleared dozens of notes from would - be buyers were found inside .
' People must have known because he got letters from all over the country , ' his nephew said .
' He got notes pushed through his door .
People travelled from all over to try and convince him to sell the car . '
Inside the 1937 Bugatti Type 57S Atalante , which could fetch up to £ 6 million at auction
James Knight , international head of the Bonhams motoring department , said Dr Carr 's Bugatti was ' one of the last great barn discoveries ' .
He added : ' I have known of this Bugatti for a number of years and , like a select group of others , had n't dared divulge its whereabouts to anyone .
It offers a truly rewarding project to the new owner - who will join a select list of distinguished owners - to play such an integral part in bringing this wonderful motor car back to life . '
The current auction record of £ 4.7 million was paid in 1987 in London for another Bugatti , a 1931 Royale .
Other previous Bugatti owners include Le Mans 24 hour race winner Earl Howe and Northumberland gentry , Lord Ridley
What Uri Dromi says about Hamas is pure and poisonous Israeli propaganda ( This Hamas hallucination , 23 January ) .
In every respect his article is almost the exact opposite of the truth .
Dromi claims that : " The Orwellian mindset of the organisation is as much a barrier to peace as the rockets it fires . "
But it is the newspeak of Israeli propagandists like Dromi that is truly Orwellian .
Over the last four weeks the powerful Israeli propaganda machine has been churning out lie after lie about Hamas in order to excuse its own inexcusable onslaught .
Israel stopped journalists going into Gaza , preventing any independent reporting on the war crimes its forces were committing .
Truth is usually the first casualty in war .
Gaza was not even a war in the conventional sense of the word ; it was one - sided carnage .
Here are some of the facts Dromi ignores or wilfully misrepresents .
First , Hamas is the democratically elected government of the Palestinian people , not the corrupt regime led by Mahmoud Abbas .
Second , Hamas spokesmen have repeatedly declared their readiness for a long - term ceasefire .
Khalid Mish'al recently did so on these pages ( Comment , 6 January ) .
Third , Hamas has a solid record of observing ceasefires , while Israel has a consistent record of sabotaging them .
Fourth , even during the ceasefire Israel did not lift its economic blockade of the 1.5 million inhabitants of Gaza , a form of collective punishment forbidden by international law .
Fifth , the offensive unleashed in Gaza was illegal , immoral and unnecessary .
If all Israel wanted was to stop rocket attacks from Gaza , all it had to do was to observe the ceasefire brokered by Egypt in June 2008 .

THE weeping of Ahmad Samouni was heart - rending .
From a hospital bed in Gaza , the 16 - year - old broke into tears as he told a television interviewer how several members of his family had been killed in an Israeli strike .
“ My brother was bleeding so much and right in front of my eyes , he died .
My other brother Ismail , he also bled to death .
My mum and my youngest brother , they are gone .
Four brothers and my mother , dead .
May God give them peace . ”
The plight of the Samouni clan stands out even amid the profligate bloodshed of Israel 's war in the Gaza Strip .
According to survivors , about 100 members of the clan had been gathered by Israeli soldiers in a building in the Zeitun district on January 4th .
The next day , it was struck by Israeli shells or missiles , killing about 30 .
Worse , Israeli forces are accused of preventing Palestinian paramedics from helping the survivors for two days .
“ This is a shocking incident .
The Israeli military must have been aware of the situation but did not assist the wounded , ” said the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) , not usually given to emotive language or public complaints about violations of humanitarian law .
Navi Pillay , the United Nations ' High Commissioner for Human Rights , went further .
The killings show “ elements of what would constitute war crimes ” , she said .
Israel replies that its army has looked into the claims and found no record of the incident at Zeitun .
It claims that it is targeting Hamas only , and promises to improve “ co-operation and co-ordination ” with the ICRC .
But Israel is vague about whether it will conduct a further inquiry , and tends to be wary of outside investigation .
It declined to co-operate , for instance , with a UN inquiry into a shelling incident that killed 19 civilians in Gaza in 2006 .
This concluded that “ there is a possibility that the shelling … constituted a war crime ” .
Another contentious incident in this war was the killing of more than 40 bystanders on January 6th near a UN school that was temporarily housing refugees .
Here the Israeli army says that its soldiers were attacked by mortars fired “ from within the school ” and responded with mortar fire .
But the UN strenuously denies that Hamas fighters were in the school .
There is also the alleged use of white phosphorous shells : permitted as a smokescreen , but not over civilian areas .
About 1,000 Palestinians have been killed , among them more than 400 women and children , in nearly three weeks of fighting .
But Hugo Slim , author of “ Killing Civilians ” , a book on the suffering of civilians in war , argues that although every civilian death is a tragedy , “ not every civilian death is a crime ” .
War crimes typically involve deliberate brutality or recklessness .
The modern laws of conflict do not seek to ban war , or even to eliminate the killing of civilians ; they merely seek to stop the most egregious abuses and to limit harm to civilians as far as possible .
Short of arguing that Israel is deliberately massacring Palestinians ( if so , many more would probably have been killed and Israel 's warning leaflets would be superfluous ) , judging war crimes depends on the facts of specific incidents and subjective legal concepts .
Is Israel discriminating between civilians and combatants ?
Are its actions proportionate to the military gain ?
And is it taking proper care to spare civilians in the crowded Strip ?
A British government manual on the laws of war admits that , for example , the principle of proportionality “ is not always straightforward ” , not least because attempting to reduce the danger to civilians may increase the risk to one 's own forces .
Moreover , if the enemy puts civilians at risk by deliberately placing military targets near them , “ this is a factor to be taken into account in favour of the attackers ” .
Israel makes precisely such arguments .
Its aggressive tactics , it says , are justified by the need to protect Israeli forces , and Hamas is to blame for civilian deaths by hiding rockets and other weapons in mosques .
According to Israeli officials , Hamas 's top leaders are hiding in a bunker under the overstretched Shifa hospital ( which , however , has not been attacked ) .
The laws of war have their roots , in part , in early worries about the impact of military technology such as air bombardment and poison gases .
But international law has found it easier to deal with low - tech mass killings at close quarters , as in the Rwandan genocide of 1994 , than with the rights and wrongs of Western - style air campaigns .
Civilians are repeatedly hit by NATO aircraft in Afghanistan , but there are only regrets , not court - martials .
In other ways , military technology has raised the bar for what is considered acceptable .
The skies above Gaza are buzzing with surveillance drones .
Israeli command - and - control systems are doubtless as sophisticated as American ones , which give commanders vast digital maps in which structures are individually numbered and clearly identified if they are not to be attacked ; they even have “ splat ” graphics to estimate the area that will be affected by a blast .
Mishaps do happen ; on January 5th three Israeli soldiers were killed by one of their own tanks .
But without more facts , it is hard to believe the Israelis did not know about the presence of civilians at Zeitun and at the UN school .
All nation states are founded on the nationalist belief that each nation has a specific claim to a specific territory .
Nationalists can and do recognise other nations claims to other territories , but almost all make an exclusive claim to at least some territory .
This claim is , by definition , an expression of group superiority .
The members of the nation , according the nationalist movement in question , possess an inherently superior claim to the territory , purely by membership of the group .
They do not have to do anything for it .
The claim covers not only their claimed right to live there , but their claimed right to exclude others .
There is one exception to this pattern : the diaspora nationalism of the Roma .
The Roma do not know exactly where their ancestral homeland is located .
Therefore , in sharp contrast to other nationalist movements , Roma nationalism does not claim territory .
And until they know where it is , Roma nationalists can not attempt to expel the existing inhabitants of that territory .
All existing nation states do make a claim of superior right to national territory .
In all cases , this claim is made on behalf of a single ethnic group , or a cluster of ethnic groups ( titular nation plus national minorities ) .
That the groups are ethnic is the source of most of the racism in ideology and policy .
If states were exclusively founded on gender , their ideology might be sexist , but not racist .
Conversely , all nation states claim that other groups do not possess that specific right to the territory in question .
Irish nationalists believe that the ' Irish people ' have a superior right to the island of Ireland , and that the Paraguayan people do not possess this right .
They believe that individual Irishmen and Irish women are the bearers of this collective right , and that these individuals can not be denied the right to reside in Ireland .
They they do not believe this about randomly selected individual Paraguayans .
Ireland has no indigenous ethnic minorities so the definition of the nation is relatively simple .
However these beliefs can be held on behalf of more than one national group , but never on behalf of all nations of the world - at least not in any existing nation state .
The formal expression of these underlying beliefs is the citizenship and immigration policy of the nation states .
Note that nothing stops Irish and Paraguayan nationalists from respecting each others claims , especially since they have no common disputed territory .
However , that does not make their claims any less racist .
It is often said , that the nation states have widely differing conceptions of citizenship .
In fact they all operate in conformity with these two principles of superior claim , and legitimate exclusion .
All existing nation states share two other characteristics .
No nation state has an absolute open - border policy ( totally free immigration ) , and all nation states allow the acquisition of citizenship by descent .
These four characteristics allow Zionism to be considered racist - in the company of other nationalisms , including the quasi - official ideologies of each nation state .
The superior claim to national territory is the attribution of a superior quality to members of the national group .
The denial of this claim to certain other ethnic groups is the attribution of an inferior status to their members .
The lack of an open - door immigration policy means , that these claims are translated into real exclusion .
Finally , the acquisition of citizenship by descent is a purely biological mechanism : it is racist in the general sense , but it is also closest to the biological ideologies first described by the term ' racism ' .
French and German attitudes are said to represent the extremes of citizenship policy , but in fact both states share a biological concept of citizenship .
Both illustrate this core policy , despite their differences in emphasis .
Germany has a generally restrictive immigration policy , which it relaxed in the 1960's and 1970's to allow labour migration for ( West ) German industry .
The children of the many Turkish immigrants grew up in Germany as foreign citizens , with a Turkish passport and a German residence permit .
Even the third generation , often born in Germany of German - born parents , usually speaking only German , were still Turkish citizens .
If they committed a crime they were liable to be deported to Turkey , even if they did not speak a word of Turkish and had never been there before .
Only in the last few years has naturalisation become almost automatic for the third generation .
In contrast , descendants of Germans who settled in eastern Europe , sometimes two or three centuries ago , can arrive in Germany and claim full citizenship .
It is not necessary that their parents are German citizens , and they are not required to speak a word of German .
The German state will pay for their full integration in German society , because they are considered part of the German ' Volk ' .
French policies are based on different assumptions , about the effectiveness of French society in transferring its own core values .
Living in France for a long period , or growing up in France , is considered to effectively assimilate the migrant or the child .
( There is an underlying belief in the self - evident superiority of French values ) .
Naturalisation is therefore easier , and in principle birth in France confers citizenship - but the parents must get there first , for the child to be born there .
However in both cases a basic rule applies , which undermines the French pretensions to have a ' non- racist ' citizenship and nationality policy .
The child born of citizens is a citizen .
All existing nation states apply this principle , usually without regard to place of birth .
The child born to a French - citizen mother and a French - citizen father , in Zambia , is a French citizen .
The child born to a German - citizen mother and a German - citizen father , in Zambia , is a German citizen .
No special procedure is required of either the parents or the baby , and no supplementary qualifications .
The child of Zambian parents , who have no German or French ancestors and no connection with Germany or France , can make no claim on the citizenship of these countries .
Both doors are equally closed .
That essential inequality is by definition racist .
As an adult , the Zambian child can later try to enter either country , and acquire citizenship .
That means going through a special procedure , and meeting certain norms , for instance on educational level .
Ultimately , acquiring citizenship might be easier in France , but there is no guarantee there either .
This is the reality of nation states : most people got their citizenship from their parents , and they did nothing for it .
They certainly did not have to cross the Strait of Gibraltar in a small boat , and spend 10 years picking tomatoes or cleaning toilets - which is what a Zambian might do to acquire legal residence in an EU country .
In other words the average citizen , certainly in the richer countries , is complicit in a grand racist scheme .
They benefit greatly from their privilege at birth , while others lose horribly .
That is presumably why they do n't like to talk about the issue , but in terms of human suffering this is the worst aspect of the inherent racism of the nation states .
If adults in a western city were arrested , and condemned on the basis of their ethnicity to the typical conditions of life in rural Africa , it would be considered a crime against humanity .
Origins and definition of Zionism
The racist characteristics of nationalism can be found in the Zionist ideology and in the State of Israel , a nation state .
The word Zionism is used today for the foundational ideology of the Israeli nation state - the claims by which it justifies its existence .
However Zionism as a nationalist movement is older than that state : past and present Zionism do not always coincide .
Zionism is a diaspora nationalism of the Jewish people .
In a diaspora nationalism , most members of the national group are not resident on the claimed national territory , and the nation state can only be achieved by ' return ' migration .
Zionism is an unusual nationalism : it is largely the creation of a single individual , Theodor Herzl .
He was the first to make a public claim to a Jewish State , and promoted that idea in Europe .
His work reflected the general climate of nationalist revival movements in eastern Europe at the time , especially in the Austro - Hungarian empire .
It was almost inevitable , that a Jewish movement would identify Jews as ' a people ' when all around them Germans , Poles , Czechs , Slovaks , Ruthenians , Slovenes , Croats , Serbs , and Hungarians were doing the same .
The other historically possible options - a purely religious revival movement , and an emancipation movement - were side - tracked .
Zionism is also unusual because , in the early years , there was no clear idea of the national homeland .
There was a clear territorial concentration of Jews in Europe , in what is now Poland , Belarus , the Ukraine and southern Russia .
However , except for local concentrations , they were in a minority even in this territory .
The idea of a Jewish nation state in eastern Europe was never influential in Zionism .
Some of the early plans for Jewish resettlement were not even formally nationalist : they made no claim to a state .
Resettlement in a British colony , such as Uganda , was for a time the most serious option .
The negotiations came to nothing - but the idea influenced British policy , when Palestine became a British mandate territory , after the First World War .
By the time of the Balfour Declaration , Zionism was a standard nationalist movement .
Zionists claimed to speak on behalf of a people , the Jewish people .
They claimed a nation state for that people in Palestine , on the grounds that it was the historic homeland of the Jewish people .
The ' Jewish people ' for almost all Zionists was ( and is ) an ethno- national group - and not a religious community .
A minority of religious Jews still opposes Zionism for religious reasons .
Zionism in the State of Israel When the State of Israel came into existence , it included a mainly Arab minority , now about one million people .
Historically Zionism has never recognised any ' national minority ' within the nation , the status of ( for instance ) the Frisians within the modern Dutch nation .
For Zionists , the Jewish people is the Jewish nation : Zionism is a mono-ethnic nationalism comparable to Irish nationalism .
The present State of Israel generally has the constitutional structure of a secular nation state .
It has conceded citizenship to the ' Israeli Arabs ' , although many will identify themselves as ' Palestinians ' .
However there is no tradition in Zionism which sees this group ( ' Arabs ' or ' Palestinians ' ) as a constituent minority of the Jewish people .
Although many Zionists claimed the territory where Yasir Arafat lived , no Zionist ever saw him as a Jew .
There is also no nationalist movement to establish a bi-national state on the former mandate territory of Palestine .
Zionism is not such a movement , and the State of Israel does not claim to be a bi-national state .
In this respect , Zionism is comparable to Czech nationalism or Slovak nationalism - not to Czechoslovak nationalism ..
No Zionists call themselves Palestino - Jews or Judaeo - Palestinians .
The State is called Israel , not Filastino - Israel or Israelo - Filastina Within this framework , which includes contradictory ideas about Israeli citizenship , the four racist characteristics can be identified .
Firstly , the Zionist movement historically made a claim to territory on behalf of ' the Jewish people ' , an exclusive geopolitical claim .
It claimed that individual Jews had a right to residence in that territory , which did not apply to randomly selected non-Jews outside that territory .
None of the early Zionists advocated the ethnic cleansing , which in fact preceded the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 - but none of them believed that non-Jews had a right to the Jewish homeland either .
Zionists attribute a superior quality to Jews , namely the exclusive right to the Jewish national territory .
The State of Israel , by definition , claims Israeli territory for Israeli's .
It attributes a superior quality to Israeli's , although paradoxically that includes the Arab minority with Israeli citizenship .
However , the State of Israel is not ' Israelist ' - in the sense of consistently presenting these claims for both its Jewish and Arab citizens .
In official pronouncements , such as its defensive speech to the Durban anti-racism conference , Israel continues to claim state legitimacy as the national homeland for the ' Jewish people ' .
It is therefore not correct to say , that in Israel Jewish diaspora nationalism has been succeeded by Israeli nationalism .
The legitimising ideology of Israel is still largely Zionism , and not ' Israelism ' .
Secondly , Zionism attributes an inferior status to members of non-Jewish ethno-national groups : that they lack the absolute right to residence in the Jewish homeland , and to citizenship of a Jewish nation state .
The State of Israel confers no right of residence or citizenship on persons born outside Israel , unless they have specific links to Israel , to the Jewish people , or to Judaism .
That excludes about 99 % of the world population .
The only exception to the general pattern of nationalist exclusion is , that the State of Israel extends citizenship to the historically resident Arab minority .
However , some groups in Israel dispute even their right to residence , and propose their expulsion as part of a ' peace settlement ' - together with the expulsion of Palestinians from all or part of the occupied territories .
According to a 2003 opinion poll in Israel ( Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies ) , 31 % now support the expulsion of the Arab minority , and 46 % support clearance of the territories .
The most obvious exclusion , which was not foreseen by the early Zionists , is the status of the Palestinians in the occupied territories .
Theodor Herzl never imagined that a Jewish state would be an occupying power , and therefore the de facto government , for a large non-Jewish population .
In addition , about three million people belong to the clearly identifiable ' Palestinian - refugee ' minorities , in other Arab countries , although most were born in their present country of residence .
The State of Israel clearly attributes an inferior status to this population : namely that they do not possess the right to Israeli citizenship .
This population is generally equivalent to the ' Palestinian people ' in the occupied territories , although it includes small non-Jewish , non-Arab minorities .
The members of this population , ( primarily Palestinian ) , can not vote , for instance , and if they did all vote in Israeli elections , it would mean the end of the State of Israel .
Again it is true that all nation states operate this exclusion , and none of them extend citizenship to everyone , certainly not to hostile populations .
That does not make such policies any less racist , since the exclusions are by definition on ethnic or national grounds .
That would not matter so much , if Israeli borders were open to all immigrants : but they are not , and this is the third racist characteristic of Zionism .
Israel has one of the highest immigration rates in history , but immigration policy has always been restrictive .
Although Israel grants citizenship to the resident Arab minority , it does not permit Arab immigration , even by former residents of its territory .
Only those who stayed in their villages in 1948 got Israeli citizenship : those who crossed the front line to the Arab side can not get back - not as a citizen , and probably not as a visitor .
Other Arabs , who have no connection with Palestine , can not simply migrate to Israel , nor can most of the world 's population .
Israeli immigration is essentially for Jews only , and this is the most obviously racist policy of present Zionism .
In this case , the State of Israel has a formal and explicit policy of Jewish immigration , which is clearly Zionist .
It is the logical consequence of the original Zionist demand for a Jewish state formed by migration , meaning migration of Jews .
In one respect Israeli policy differs from most national immigration policies : citizenship can be indirectly acquired on religious grounds .
A person who converts to Judaism can be a Jew in the sense of the Israeli Law of Return , if the conversion is accepted as valid by religious authorities in Israel .
The convert can then go to Israel ( entry can not be legally refused ) , and can claim Israeli nationality and citizenship .
Sometimes this is quoted by Israel 's supporters , to show Israel is not racist .
In theory , all the inhabitants of the Palestinian territories can sincerely convert to Judaism tomorrow , and on acceptance of their conversion move to Israel .
- where they will all presumably live as good and prosperous Israeli citizens .
In practice this is absurdly unlikely .
And the question is : why should they have to convert to Judaism , when native - born atheist or Buddhist Israelis can still be part of the Jewish people ?
This is the fourth racist characteristic , equally present in the state policies of Israel and present Zionist belief .
It was not very relevant for the early Zionists , who were too far from a Jewish state to think about its future citizenship policy .
Nevertheless , it was predictable even at the time Herzl wrote , on the basis of the general characteristics of European nation states ( and of the Austro - Hungarian empire where he lived ) .
The child of an Israeli citizen mother and and Israeli citizen father is an Israeli citizen .
( I am not sure if this applies to the children of Israeli Arabs , born in the occupied territories ) .
The child acquires this privilege without effort : no application under the Law of Return , no conversion to Judaism , no other qualification for citizenship .
The child simply acquires the rights ( and duties ) of an Israeli citizen through unconscious biological process .
The child without this biological advantage ( birth , or parentage , or genetic material ) does not automatically acquire citizenship .
Life in Israel is not always pleasant , and many western Jews hesitate to emigrate there , but within the region an Israeli - born child has the advantage .
The child born to Israeli settlers in central Hebron will statistically live longer , be better educated , and have a higher standard of living , then the Palestinian child born in an adjoining house .
This advantage is part of the general advantage of being born in a rich country , which about one - fifth of the world 's population share .
In citizenship and immigration issues , biology determines fate .
Not inevitably , but because nation states are structured that way .
There is no inherent moral reason why states should limit immigration , or residence , or citizenship , simply on grounds of birth .
In fact , it is hard to think of any moral justification for it .
It is clearly racist in the general sense of the word , and its derivation from the ideology of nationalism indicates the racist origins of that ideology .
The nationalism underlying the nation state Israel , which is accurately called Zionism , is no different in this respect .
Here too , Zionism is racist .

Anyway , I stared at it for about 20 minutes .
I could n't bring myself to push the lever and let it go .... at one point , I thought it was talking to me " .... george , george , do n't flush me .... let 's get together for a beer and talk this over ... shall we ? " .... my god , am I going fucking crazy ?
Finally , I started talking BACK to the freacking poop .... I said " Paul ( that was his name , he told me so ) , Paul , I have to flush you , your just a piece of fucking shit . " ..... but then he said something that made me think ... he said ... George , if I were a piece of shit , how come I do n't smell ? " ... and he was right .... he had no stink !!!.
So we talked for awhile , about the wife and kids , and his family , and the little poops .
He told me they were all swell , except his inlaws were all diahrea ... " are n't they all ? " I replied .
Anyway .... we reached a lull in the conversation , and , without thinking , I reached over and flushed him .
My god , the look of terror on his face is burned into my brain .
I watched him grasp and grab at the side of the bowl as he whirled around .... but he could n't catch on ... he just left brown streaks ... and now that 's all I have left of him .
And I 'm sad ... and I miss him ... and I want him back ....

Dear Senator Minchin ,
Please do what you can to ameliorate the dire situation in which Dawn Rowan finds herself in .
I am sure that you are aware that Dawn has saved many lives , come to the aid of women and children fleeing domestic violence and been the compassionate adviser of women whose lives have been blighted by violence and threats .
She was warning people about the prevalence of child sex abuse long before that subject became speakable .
Like many women in the van , she has been punished for her outspokenness .
This is a terrible thing for young women of our age to understand , but it seems to be the truth still .
She is one of my heroes .
In the 80s her work was an international influence for good and her work seminal in the progress towards understanding families under stress .
She has continued her work despite the misery her life became after the appeal against her successful defamation case .
This woman does not deserve to be pursued into bankruptcy .
Please give this sad case your attention .

The House passed the TARP bill , authored by House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) , on Wednesday .
Some banks bailing on bailout
It ’s no secret that the public hates the government rescue of Wall Street , but now even some banks are bailing on their own bailout .
Some smaller banks are dropping out of the voluntary program designed to jumpstart lending , created with $ 250 billion of the Wall Street rescue , because they fear angry policymakers plan to slap them with unanticipated new rules and requirements .

The development signals the policy fights to come as Democrats seek balance with industry over demands for more regulation , even as the financial system needs more government help .
Democrats have spent the last two weeks pressing for tough new restrictions on financial institutions that get some of the initial $ 700 billion bailout money .
But industry officials warn that banks ’ fears that policymakers will slap them with onerous retroactive rules could chill participation in the Capital Purchase Program , designed to help healthy banks increase lending .
The American Bankers Association has heard from several banks that were accepted by Treasury to participate in the Capital Purchase Program but have since decided not to take the government funds , said Wayne Abernathy , the trade group ’s executive director for financial institutions policy and regulatory affairs .
A few other banks have said they are for now delaying the decision to complete the process as they wait to see what policymakers do with the program , he said , declining to name any of the banks that had withdrawn .
“ The number one concern I ’ve heard is that they ’re worried about the strings that would come along with it , ” Abernathy said .
The worries grip even those institutions staying in the program , lobbyists report .
The Senate cleared the way for the second $ 350 billion last week but only after the incoming Obama administration promised to enact new rules on executive compensation , dividend payments and other use of the bailout funds by recipients of funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
House Democrats insisted on putting their TARP rules in legislative form .
The House passed the bill , authored by House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) , on Wednesday by a margin of 260 to 166 .
While the Senate is not expected to take up Frank ’s bill , the strong Democratic vote in the House gives him some leverage to see that President Barack Obama meets the demands .
Frank ’s bill only gives
Treasury the authority to make its stricter executive compensation restrictions retroactively .
But the banks ’ fears are broader than just what is contained in the measure .
For one , they ’ve watched the federal government slap strict dividend limits and other rules on Bank of American and Citigroup when each institution needed an additional capital infusion , outside of the capital purchase program .
There is a “ general anxiety that there are going to be new and unforeseen requirements , and it ’s hard to run a business that way , ” Abernathy said , citing dividend policies , rules that tell bankers where to direct lending and complex new regulatory requirements as top concerns .
Brian Gardner , a financial industry analyst , said those banks dropping out tend to be smaller institutions with stronger capital positions .
Therefore , their exits are unlikely to affect credit in the banking system as a whole , he said .
The dropouts were probably wavering on whether to use the program anyway , “ and what they perceive to be the increased political risk to them tilts the balance against using it , ” said Gardner , senior vice president of Washington research for Keefe , Bruyette & Woods , which has closely tracked capital purchase program participation .
Treasury has already doled out most of the $ 250 billion in the capital purchase program , and what is left is going out in small bundles to smaller banks .
Meanwhile , the largest 25 banks in the country — which have already gotten their share — make up the majority of the banking system , Gardner said .
“ The idea that a handful of them are going to say no , systemically , from a macro perspective , is not that important because their overall impact on the national economy is not that great , ” he said .

PRINCETON , NJ --
For the first time since Gallup began tracking Barack Obama 's presidential job approval rating on Jan. 21 , fewer than 60 % of Americans approve of the job he is doing as president .
In Feb . 21-23 polling , 59 % of Americans give Obama a positive review , while 25 % say they disapprove , and 16 % have no opinion .
To date , Obama has averaged 64 % approval , but , as the graph shows , there has been a slight but perceptible decline in his approval rating since he took office .
This decline has largely occurred among Republicans .
The drop below 60 % approval within the past week -- from 63 % in Feb. 18 - 20 polling to 59 % in Feb. 21 - 23 polling -- has mostly come among independents .
Late last week , 62 % of independents approved of Obama , compared with 54 % in the last three days .
His approval rating among Democrats has dipped slightly ( but not to a statistically significant degree ) , while approval among Republicans has not changed .
While Obama 's overall approval rating has fallen by four percentage points in recent days ( from 63 % in Feb. 18 - 20 polling to the current 59 % ) , his disapproval rating has been steady ( 24 % in Feb. 18 - 20 polling to the current 25 % ) .
Rather , the percentage of Americans without an opinion of his job performance has increased , from 13 % to 16 % .
In essence , Americans in recent days are becoming increasingly unsure about how Obama is doing , rather than becoming more critical .
As the table suggests , most of the movement among independents in recent days has been from the approval to the no opinion category .
And his disapproval rating has dropped among Republicans , with a concomitant increase in no opinion .
Thus , Americans ' assessments of Obama are in a period of flux .
Given that Obama is addressing the nation tonight , he has a tremendous opportunity to convert Americans who are now on the fence -- in addition to those who now disapprove of him -- into supporters .
The latest USA Today / Gallup poll shows Americans are most interested in hearing about economic matters , particularly how Obama will address unemployment , the mortgage crisis , and how the economic stimulus package will be administered .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,553 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Feb. 21 - 23 , 2009 , as part of Gallup Poll Daily tracking .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Firefox 's broad support for plug-ins and extensions has always been a major feature of the browser , particularly back in the days of IE6 .
The the browser 's enduring popularity has finally caught the eye of malware authors , as a trojan is now targeting Firefox specifically
BitDefender has identified this new bit of holiday cheer as Trojan .
PWS.
ChromeInject .A " ( the ChromeInject suffix refers to the Chrome component of Firefox ) .
The trojan installs itself into Firefox 's add - on directory , registers itself as Greasemonkey , and begins searching your hard drive for passwords , login details , your World of WarCraft account information , and your library card number .
Please note , this trojan is not actually the Greasemonkey add - on , and only identifies itself as such .
Mozilla has confirmed that the official Greasemonkey release contained within Mozilla 's own extension repository ( and available here ) is malware - free .
If you 're currently using Greasemonkey or are interested in doing so , there 's no reason to avoid the legitimate add - on at this time , so long as you download it from Mozilla 's page or an equally trusted source .
Once installed , the trojan is capable of identifying over 100 web sites .
When an infected user visits a site the trojan recognizes , the parasite comes to life and records the login / password details being transmitted .
Presumably it then goes back to sleep , quietly keeping an eye on further system activity .
It 's not clear if the trojan is visible as an installed add - on from within the browser , or how it interacts with the real Webmonkey , if that extension is installed .
The attack vector is also vague .
At the moment , BitDefender believes users are catching the trojan through one of the normal approaches — opening attachments , allowing ActiveX or JavaScript to execute in an unsafe way , or downloading malware - ridden " codecs " in order to catch a sneak preview of 2 Girls 1 Cup 2 Fast 2 Furious .
BitDefender has already updated its own AV suite to detect and remove the new trojan ; other malware vendors will undoubtedly do the same within the next few days .
[ / caption ] A 10 meter - wide asteroid named 2009 BD discovered earlier this month is making a slow pass of the Earth , coming within 400,000 miles ( 644,000 km ) of our planet .
The near - Earth asteroid ( NEO ) poses no threat to us , but it is an oddity worth studying .
Astronomers believe the rock is a rare “ co-orbital asteroid ” which follows the orbit of the Earth , not receding more than 0.1 AU ( 15 million km ) away .
It is stalking us .
On looking at the NASA JPL Small - Body Database orbital plot , it is hard to distinguish between the orbital path of the Earth and 2009 BD , showing just how close the asteroid is shadowing the Earth on its journey around the Sun …
In 2006 , NASA announced that Earth ’s “ second moon ” was an asteroid called 2003 YN107 ( with a diameter of about 20 meters ) and it was about to leave the vicinity of Earth , leaving its “ corkscrewing ” orbit around our planet for seven years , only to return again in 60 years time .
2003 YN107 was of no threat ( and wont be in the future ) , but it is interesting to study these bodies to understand how they interact with Earth .
Having NEOs in stable orbits around the Earth could be of benefit to mankind in the future as missions can be planned , possibly sending mining missions to these rocky visitors so we can tap their resources .
So far , little is known about the new 10 meter asteroid in our near - Earth neighbourhood , but it provides us with an exciting opportunity to track its laborious orbit to see whether it will eventually be ejected after making a close pass to the Earth ’s gravitational field ( as was the case with 2003 YN107 in 2006 ) .
From preliminary observations , 2009 BD is projected to shadow our planet for many months ( possibly years ) to come .
Until November 2010 at least , the asteroid will hang around the Earth , within a distance of 0.1 AU .
It is worth emphasising that 2009 BD is of no threat to the Earth , its closest approach takes it 644,000 km from us .
For comparison , the Moon ’s apogee is 400,000 km , so 2009 BD is stalking us from afar , beyond lunar orbit .
As time goes on , astronomers will be able to track 2009 BD ’s orbit with more precision ( for updates , keep an eye on the JPL Small - Body Database ) , but for now , we have a micro-second moon following the Earth on its orbit around the Sun …

Transcript of what Duffy said
SPRINGFIELD - Each of the 59 state senators was given the opportunity during former Gov. Rod Blagojevich 's impeachment trial last month to make a five - minute speech .
Lake Barrington Republican Dan Duffy , making his first speech ever in the Illinois Senate , stunned many observers with blunt criticism of veteran members for not challenging Blagojevich 's behavior sooner .
Here 's a transcript :
" As a freshman senator , let me say it has been an interesting first month in office .
It is an honor to represent the people of the 26th District and to sit here in their chair .
I have heard over the past few days how the governor has traded official acts in exchange for personal profit and campaign contributions .
He did this many times in a variety of ways .
I have also heard how the governor violated state and federal laws .
The governor 's speech today was incredible , a very passionate political speech , but it does n't change the facts .
The governor 's actions show a pattern of abuse , which clearly tramples over the Illinois Constitution and violates his oath of office .
The testimony presented definitely warrants the governor 's removal from office , but what confuses me is that the testimony shows that this abuse of power has been going on for years and that many people in this government and in this chamber had to have known about it .
According to the governor 's speech today , he said that what he did , he did in conjunction with the Democratic Senate leadership .
He said he could n't have done any of this without their help and support .
The auditor general 's testimony yesterday reflects how deep and how widespread the corruption has gone .
How is it that the majority in this chamber , the same people who have presented this case reflecting years of corruption , are the same people that have praised the governor by giving him three pay raises over the past two years ?
Three raises since the 2006 election , increasing the governor 's salary by almost 18 percent at the same time that all this documented corruption was taking place .
Mr. President , we have just scratched the surface of corruption .
The governor did not and could not have done all this without a lot of help .
We must implement clear and concise transparency laws in this state .
Every single government check written , whether for payroll , bills or expenses , should be posted on the Internet on a Web site for all to see .
Voters should have the ability to recall , if necessary , any elected official in this state .
And we should have a whistle - blowers ' hotline for all legislators , staff and lobbyists to call if they suspect or know of any corruption that 's taking place .
This hotline should be maintained by a nonpolitical appointment who will keep names anonymous and offer awards for convictions .
This is just the beginning , Mr. President , and we have a lot of work to do . "

BBC News
Critics say state news puts a positive spin on domestic stories
Chinese intellectuals have signed an open letter calling for a boycott of state television news programmes .
The letter says China 's Central Television ( CCTV ) has turned its news and historical drama series into propaganda to brainwash its audience .
The author of the damning letter told the BBC that the action should at least serve as a health warning to the susceptible public .
The authorities have been alarmed by the latest development .
They tend to accuse the Western media of biased coverage of China .
But this open letter accuses CCTV of systematic bias in its news coverage .
' Whitewash '
The letter - signed by more than 20 academics and lawyers - lists six broad categories of bias and brainwashing .
It says the state TV monopoly has ignored many stories of social unrest and riots , and whitewashed serious events like the recent milk contamination scandal .
The letter 's author , Ling Cangzhou , told the BBC that its signatories were fed up with the positive spin on domestic news from the central TV station and the negative tone on international events .
He said that the letter should at least alert the public to the problem , though the state TV broadcaster is too pervasive to be boycotted effectively .
Media controls meant the letter had to be published on a US - based website , but it has been picked up widely by Chinese websites .
An NHS doctor allegedly held captive by her parents was freed by a Bangladesh court today in a landmark legal victory under the UK's Forced Marriage Act .
Dr Humayra Abedin , 33 , from east London , was brought before the high court in the capital , Dhaka , after five previousrequests had been defied by her family .
She is expected to fly back to the UK this week .
Human rights groups hope the case will set a strong international precedent and deter families who might be planning similar courses of action .
There was confusion about the immediate effect of the order , which is believed to be the first ever issued at the behest of British authorities on behalf of a non-national .
Abedin is a Bangladeshi but the judge nonetheless ordered she be placed under court protection until a representative from the British high commission comes to collect her .
No UK representative was in court .
The 2007 Forced Marriage
Act was designed to protect vulnerable individuals coerced into legally binding partnerships against their will .
Most cases dealt with by the Foreign Office 's Forced Marriage Unit involve families with Asian connections .
The department has so far helped in 180 such disputes overseas .
Justice Syed Mohmed Hossain told the court : " [ Dr Abedin ] requested the court not to put her parents in trouble because of what they did to her … Children are not the slaves of their parents , they must have their own freedoms . "
Setting a deadline of this afternoon for Dr Abedin 's parents to return her passport and credit cards , he added : " What I have heard reminds me of the dark times , the old ages we had in Bangladesh . "
If Abedin 's family had failed to comply they could have been imprisoned .
Abedin arrived in the UK six years ago to study for a master 's degree in public health at Leeds University .
She moved to London and was training to become a registrar at a GP surgery in east London .
During the summer she was told her mother was ill and returned to Dhaka .
The alarm over her disappearance was raised reportedly after a friend in East Ham received a text message from her saying : " Please help me .
My life is in danger . "
The Foreign Office subsequently issued a protection order under the Forced Marriage Act .
The order may not technically be enforceable overseas — due to Abedin 's nationality — but was granted , the FO said , in the hope it might " carry some weight " with the Bangladeshi court system .
The Foreign Office said : " Dr Abedin is a Bangladeshi national so we cannot offer her formal consular assistance .
However , we will meet her to hear her story and establish the recommendations of the court order . "
As the judge gave his verdict , she sat quietly at the front of the court as her father , Mohammad Joynal Abedin , broke down in tears .
Her parents were allegedly aggrieved by her rejection of a husband they had found for her in Bangladesh .
The father , along with the mother , Sufiya Kamal , had refused to bring the doctor to the court , saying she was mentally incapacitated .
Today was the first time she had been seen by the court .
Only her parents ' lawyers and lawyers acting for ASK , a Bangladesh human rights group , and Abedin 's cousin were present .
A Bangladeshi human rights lawyer , Sara Hossain , who represented ASK , and members of the Abedin family opposed to the doctor 's treatment , said afterwards : " She 's free to go , she 's been set at liberty and she wants to return to the UK .
Her family has been ordered to return her passport .
" We 're delighted with the result , the rights of a Bangladeshi woman have been protected as they should be .
Dr Abedin looks very relieved . "
Anne -Marie Hutchinson , the lawyer who acted for Abedin in the UK , said : " Humayra is elated .
Exhausted , but elated .
She is very very tired , she is emotional .
" She appeared before the court today and told them she was being held against her will and that she wanted to leave .
She did n't want to bring charges against her parents . "
Financial institutions in the United States probably need hundreds of billions of dollars in additional assistance , and one congressman wants to harness state and local pension funds to help them .
Rather than rely more heavily on the Treasury , which has already put $ 350 billion in the nation ’s banks , Representative Gary L. Ackerman sees an opportunity in the trillions of dollars in public pension funds .
Most of the funds suffered giant losses last year in the market turmoil .
But they do not need all of their assets immediately , because their time horizon for paying benefits is decades long .
Mr. Ackerman , Democrat of New York , is sponsoring legislation that would allow public pension funds to pool some of their money and use it to create a sole - purpose entity that would buy $ 50 billion to $ 250 billion worth of preferred stock in America ’s banks .
That would strengthen the banks ’ balance sheets and , Mr. Ackerman hopes , get them lending again .
“ Some of us are getting tired of writing checks with public money ” and seeing no results , Mr. Ackerman said .
He said pension fund officials who had heard about the measure so far were eager to participate .
( Fortune ) --
He had headed one of the world 's biggest stock markets , and was known as " The Voice of Wall Street . "
His brokerage company attracted wealthy investors , including one of the nation 's most elite clubs .
Then , as his firm collapsed amid the worst economic downturn in decades he admitted it had all been a sham .
The embezzler ?
Not former NASDAQ stock exchange chairman Bernard Madoff .
This Wall Street villain 's crimes occurred more than 70 years ago .
His name was Richard Whitney .
The fall of the former New York Stock Exchange president and securities firm principal captivated a nation that was struggling to emerge from the Great Depression .
Like Madoff ,
Whitney boasted a sterling reputation and was regarded as a savvy investor who steered clients successfully through perilous market storms .
Both men's alleged crimes went undetected by authorities for years .
And both instantly became symbols of Wall Street 's betrayal of investors .
While Madoff hailed from simple roots and attended Hofstra University , Whitney was born on third base , the scion of a prominent New England family .
The Groton and Harvard man had rowed on his schools ' crews and played football .
He served for five years as the president of the New York Stock Exchange and played a key role in helping slow the stock market slide in October 1929 .
On Black Thursday , as panic reached a crescendo , he dramatically placed a series of generous bids on shattered blue chip stocks , helping bring confidence back to the markets .
" Richard Whitney Halts Stock Panic , " headlines proclaimed .
But Whitney was living a lie .
For years , he concealed growing problems at his firm , Richard Whitney & Co. Finally , in March 1938 , the firm collapsed , causing a brief sell - off in the New York Stock Exchange .
Whitney , who like Madoff , took blame for the firm 's admitted wrongdoing , went down fast .
After the firm 's fall it took just one month for him to be indicted and shipped off to the slammer .
He pleaded guilty to stealing $ 214,000 from funds he supervised .
At his sentencing , he received a withering rebuke from the judge .
" To cover up your thefts and your insolvency , you resorted to larcenies , frauds , misrepresentations and falsifications of books , " the judge thundered , adding that Whitney had dealt " the decent forces of America " a " severe setback . "
One of his main victims : The New York Yacht Club .
According to a contemporaneous New York Times account , the disgraced financier was fingerprinted on an April morning , sent to the showers with the other prisoners , " and his well - tailored blue serge suit , polo coat and gray felt hat were laid aside for a baggy suit of gray prison shoddy and ill - fitting cap . "
He was shackled to two extortionists and escorted out of The Tombs .
A crowd of 5,000 people assembled at Grand Central Station to see Whitney 's train off before it headed north along the Hudson River to Sing Sing prison .
An auction of his belongings , which included a pair of pearl studs , and a key - wind watch , brought just $ 763 .
Whitney was paroled in 1941 after serving more than three years of his five - to ten - year sentence .
He became the manager of a dairy farm , supervising three farmhands and 25 cows .
In 1946 , he went back into business when he became president of a textile company that made yarns from the ramie plant , which grew in the Florida muck .
The former financier died in 1974 at the age of 86 .
You probably know that credit card companies have been scrutinizing every charge on your account in recent years , searching for purchases that thieves may have made .
Turns out , though , that some of the companies have been suspicious of your own spending , too .
In recent months , American Express has gone far beyond simply checking your credit score and making sure you pay on time .
The company has been looking at home prices in your area , the type of mortgage lender you ’re using and whether small - business card customers work in an industry under siege .
It has also been looking at how you spend your money , searching for patterns or similarities to other customers who have trouble paying their bills .
In some instances , if it did n’t like what it was seeing , the company has cut customer credit lines .
It laid out this logic in letters that infuriated many of the cardholders who received them .
“ Other customers who have used their card at establishments where you recently shopped , ” one of those letters said , “ have a poor repayment history with American Express . ”
It sure sounded as if American Express had developed a blacklist of merchants patronized by troubled cardholders .
But late this week , American Express told me that was n’t the case .
The company said it had also decided to stop using what it has called “ spending patterns ” as a criteria in its credit line reductions .

Often we opponents of socialistic , legislatively - created , utilitarian - based , property - redistributing , artificial , arbitrary , inconsistent , irrational , innovation - hampering , monopolistic , anti-competitive , and wealth - destroying intellectual property laws are accused of hypocrisy when we “ copyright ” our articles and books .
I ’ve pointed out to such people innumerable times , to little avail , that copyright is a noun , not a verb–that you do n’t “ copyright ” something –you have a copyright in your original works of authorship as soon as you write them , automatically , courtesy of federal law .
No copyright notice is required .
No copyright registration is required .
You have the right , whether you like it or not .
Well , then , why do n’t you just “ make it public domain , ” some then , a bit unreflectively , retort .
The problem is , there is no clear and good way to do this .
If you use a Creative Commons license , you are actually employing the copyright the state grants you –you are putting conditions or limitations on what others may do with your works .
Even if you use the least restrictive type , “ Attribution , ” you are requiring others to do something to avoid being liable for copyright infringement .
Now , some have tried to find ways to let you abandon your copyright , or “ dedicate ” it to “ the public . ”
Creative Commons has a proposed “ Public Domain Dedication “ , but : ( a ) it does n’t seem easy , at least for the typical user ; and ( b ) there appear to be doubts as to whether it would work–and until it ’s clear that it does , it ’s worse than a CC license , since publishers would be afraid to rely on it .
It is possible that a type of estoppel would apply , preventing the “ dedicator ” from complaining if someone else relied on his “ dedication ” to his detriment ; but there is “ a quirk of U.S. copyright law which grants the author of a work the right to cancel ‘ the exclusive or nonexclusive grant of a transfer or license of copyright or of any right under a copyright ” thirty - five years later , unless the work was originally a work for hire . ’”
So sayeth Wikipedia ; and it outlines other deficiencies of the “ public domain dedication . ”
Creative Commons seems to recognize the potential problems with their attempt to set up a “ public domain dedication ” – first , they say , “ Please note that the Public Domain Dedication may not be valid outside of the United States . ”
Well , that ’s no good .
We do live in a global , um , world .
Last time I checked , the Internet was available even outside America !
Second , I had to google their site to even find it–it ’s not even listed in their Licenses page , or in their FAQ .
They provide this method with disclaimers and no guarantees , and they bury it on their site .
Hmm , tells you something .
So , what ’s a libertarian to do ?
I tend to think the CC 3.0 Attribution license is the most libertarian–it only requires you to say who wrote it –but most people would do this anyway , so that ’s not a huge imposition .
The “ non-commercial ” ones prevent people from using it “ for profit ” –this is still a use of copyright to force people not to publish .
And the “ Attribution Share Alike ” seeks to use one ’s copyright threat to force others to use this license too .
( For example , suppose you have a deal with a publisher , and you want to use a CC share - alike licensed work in your book .
But the publisher you are using refuses to grant a “ share alike ” license .
So now , you ca n’t use the CC licensed work .
I.e. , if you publish your paper with a CC attribution license , the other guy can use it in his book .
But if you do a share alike one , he can ’t .
He ’s prevented by your copyright assertion threat . )
The d*mned government imposes this right on us and does not even provide an easy way to opt out of it or get rid of it .
Ridiculous .
Update :
In my comments to Roderick Long ’s post Steal This Journal ! , I noted :
Roderick ,
If I ’m not mistaken , “ copyleft ” is similar to the Creative Commons “ share alike ” license .
Libertarian Papers , however , uses the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License .
After thinking about this , it seems to me that the “ Attribution ” license is more libertarian than “ Share - Alike ” ( or copyleft ) .
Now the new “ CCO “ , or “ No Rights Reserved , ” attempt to make one ’s work “ public domain ” seems the most libertarian of all , but its efficacy looks doubtful to me , and it ’s still embryonic as far as I can tell .
In response to Charles Johnson ’s ( Rad Geek ) suggestion that Attribution - Share - Alike ( a “ viral ” type of copyright license , a.k.a. “ copyleft ” ) might be preferable or acceptable from a libertarian perspective , I replied :
Rad , I see the argument , but I think the best policy is just to free it up .
It ’s a bit too paternalistic , rude , untrusting , to force others to do it like you do , to assume they ’ll “ abuse ” their power .
And , it might stop the work from being re-published .
We want our libertarian ideas spread far and wide .
I want an editor of a book considering reprinting one of our pieces to see no obstacles .
A “ viral share - alike ” provision could be .
Let ideas be free .

Police shut down Facebook page after angry drivers post hate comments about ' Terminator ' traffic warden
The Terminator : John Woodgate 's zero tolerance to traffic offences is disliked by many drivers
He arrived with the determination to ' clean up this town ' and earned a tough reputation for his pursuit of parking offenders .
But the heavy - handed manner of traffic warden John Woodgate has not gone down well with the residents of Sudbury in Suffolk .
So much so that they set up a website as a forum to vent their fury about the man nicknamed ' The Terminator ' .
Soon , nearly 1,000 motorists had signed up to the page on Facebook , making comments such as ' you jobsworth ****',
' get cancer ' and ' the man is just a bully in a uniform ' .
But Suffolk police have demanded it be shut down because it contained ' hateful , threatening or obscene material ' .
Mr Woodgate , 60 , recently became a police community support officer , but the tickets have kept coming .
And yesterday locals still had plenty to say .
John McMillan , president of the town 's Chamber of Commerce , said : ' The problem is that he is so bloody rude and offensive and is just not prepared to be flexible . '
Dock Roper , 63 , said : ' The man is a real menace .
He needs to be removed from office - he shows no humanity and I am not surprised that so many people do n't like him . '
Facebook said : ' Our policy is to remove groups that attack an individual or group . '
Facebook agreed to remove the page on the grounds that it contained hateful and threatening criticism of Mr Woodgate ( file picture )

Two of the hottest and most engaging topics in space and astronomy these days are 1 . ) exoplanets – planets orbiting other stars – and 2 . ) dark matter — that unknown stuff that seemingly makes up a considerable portion of our universe .
There ’s a spacecraft currently in development that could help answer our questions about whether there really are other Earth - like planets out there , as well as provide clues to the nature of dark matter .
The spacecraft is called SIM – the Space Interferometry Mission .
“ We ’ll be looking for other Earths around other stars , ” said Stephen Edberg , System Scientist for the mission , “ and by making accurate mass measurements of galaxies , we should be able to measure dark matter , as well . ”
Listen to the January 20 , 2009 “ 365 Days of Astronomy ” Podcast and my interview with Steve Edberg , and / or read more about the SIM Lite mission below !
The concept for this mission has been around for awhile , and the concept has changed over time , with the telescope going through different incarnations .
Currently , the mission is being called SIM Lite , as the spacecraft itself has gotten smaller , however the mirrors for the interferometer have gotten bigger .
While interferometry at radio wavelengths has been done for over 50 years , optical interferometry has only matured recently .
Optical interferometry combines the light of multiple telescopes to perform as a single , much larger telescope .
SIM
Lite will have two visible - wavelength stellar interferometer sensors – as well as other advanced detectors , that will work together to create an extremely sensitive telescope , orbiting outside of Earth ’s atmosphere .
“ These are instruments that can measure positions in the sky to almost unbelievable accuracy , ” said Edberg .
“ Envision Buzz Aldrin standing on the moon .
Pretend he ’s holding a nickel between thumb and forefinger .
SIM can measure the thickness of that nickel as seen by someone standing on the surface of the Earth .
That is one micro arc second , a very tiny fraction of the sky . ”
Watch a video depicting this — ( Quicktime needed )
Having the ability to make measurements like that with SIM , it will be possible to infer the presence of planets within about 30 light - years from Earth , and those planets can be as small and low mass as Earth .
As of now , the SIM team anticipates studying between 65 and 100 stars over a five year mission , looking for Earth analogs , planets roughly the same mass as Earth orbiting their stars in the habitable zone , where liquid water could exist .
So , for example , SIM Lite would be able to detect a habitable planet around the star 40 Eridani A , 16 light - years away , known to fans of the “ Star Trek ” television series as the location of Mr. Spock ’s home planet , Vulcan .
See a movie depicting this possible detection — ( QuickTime needed ) .
SIM will not detect a planet directly , but by detecting the motion it causes in the parent star .
“ That ’s a difficult task , there ’s no question , ” said Edberg , “ but it gets complicated , based on what we see with our own solar system and what we ’ve seen in other planetary systems .
We know there are other systems out there that have more than one planet .
Multiple planets can confound the measurements . ”
But SIM should be able to detect the different sized planets orbiting other stars .
SIM
Lite recently passed a double blind study conducted by four separate teams who confirmed that SIM ’s technology will allow the detection of Earth - mass planets among multiple - planet systems , by having the ability to measure the mass of different sized planets , to as low as Earth - mass .
“ With a few exceptions all the planets we know about were detected using a method called radial velocity , ” said Edberg , “ where we look at the periodic motion of the star coming toward us and moving away from us on a regular basis .
But when you make measurements like that , when you have no other information , you do n’t know the orientation of the planets ’ orbit with respect to the star , or the mass of either the star or the planet . ”
With the hottest stars , radial velocity ca n’t be used to look for planets .
But SIM
Lite will be able to look at stars clear across the diagram from the coolest to the hottest stars .
“ So far , we have n’t found any other Earth - sized planets , ” said Edberg .
( See our article from 1/19/2009 about a planet that could possibly be 1.4 times the mass of Earth . )
“ So , finding Earth analogs around stars like the sun is really the big goal . ”
“ It ’s a big question mark in the other planets we know about now – I believe we know only about 10 % of the masses of extrasolar planets , ” said Edberg .
A second planet search program , called the “ broad survey , ” will probe roughly 2,000 stars in our galaxy to determine the prevalence planets the size of Neptune and larger .
SIM will also be used to measure the sizes of stars , as well as distances of stars , and be able to do so several hundred times more accurately than previously possible .
SIM
Lite will also measure the motion of nearby galaxies , in most cases , for the first time .
These measurements will help provide the first total mass measurements of individual galaxies .
All of this will enable scientists to estimate the distribution of dark matter in our own galaxy and the universe .
“ Dark matter is known for its gravitational affects , ” said Edberg .
“ It does n’t seem to interact with normal matter as we know it .
To get more clues on it , we want to know where it is . ”
SIM will measure on two different scales .
One is within the Milky Way Galaxy , making measurements of stars and globular clusters , and making measurements of stars that have been torn out of smaller galaxies that orbit the Milky Way .
“ We can do mass model of our galaxy and find out where that mass is , including what has to be a lot of dark matter , ” said Edberg .
“ When we make measurements of how our galaxy rotates , you find that it rotates like a solid .
Instead of being Keplerian , where you think of Mercury going around the sun faster than Pluto , from all the way inside the galaxy as close as we can measure to the center , out to beyond the sun ’s distance , the Milky Way rotates like it ’s a solid body .
It ’s not a solid body , but that means it must have a density that is constant all the way through and that means there is far more matter than we can see . ”
“ Another thing we ’d like to know is the concentration of dark matter in cluster of galaxies , ” Edberg continued .
“ The Milky Way is part of the Local Group of galaxies , and SIM has the capability to measure stars within the individual galaxies , which in turn can be modeled to tell us where the dark matter is within the Local Group .
This is cutting edge .
This is one of the big mysteries right now in astrophysics and cosmology . ”
Extra solar planets and dark energy may seem like two completely different things for one spacecraft to be looking for , but Edberg said this is an example of how everything is tied together .
“ To get planet masses we need to know the masses of the parent stars , ” he said .
“ SIM will make measurements of stars , particularly binary stars , and determine the masses of stars for a wide variety of star types , and be able to estimate the sizes of the planets that are causing the reflex motion .
To make the measurements , and because stars with planets are going to be scattered around the sky , we need to have a grid of stars that are the fixed points to give us latitude and longitude , so to speak .
If you know exactly where St. Louis and Los Angeles are , then it ’s much easier to triangulate where things between them are .
We need to do this all around the sky , and to do that we tie that down to the stars , and SIM can do that .
These are fundamental questions that we do n’t know the answers to , but SIM will help us find the answers . ”
So , SIM Lite will be searching from within our neighborhood to the edge of the universe .
What ’s the status of this future spacecraft ?
“ We ’re on hold right now , ” said Edberg .
“ We recently passed the double blind test to show that SIM can find Earth - like planets in systems that have multiple planets .
SIM is also undergoing a decadal review to make the case that the astronomical science community needs to have a mission like SIM to strengthen the foundations enormously . ”
Technical work is being done to prepare to build the actual instruments , but due to budgetary reasons , NASA has not set a launch date .
“ We think we could be ready to launch by 2015 once we get the go - ahead from NASA , ” said Edberg , “ and the go ahead depends on the decadal review , and the reports should be out in about a year . ”
SIM Lite would provide an entirely new measurement capability in astronomy .
Its findings would likely stand firmly on their own , while complimenting the capabilities of our current , as well as other planned future space observatories .

Why is it illegal to smoke cannabis ?
Why are n't the courts tougher on criminals ?
What help can you get if you 've come out of prison and you can't get a job ?
These are just some of the questions asked by Newsbeat and 1Xtra listeners , when they went to the Houses of Parliament to meet one of the UK's most important and influential politicians , the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement ADAM RICHARDSON , 27 , a mechanic from Bury St Edmunds Adam can't understand why cannabis is being reclassified Adam wanted to ask Jacqui Smith why cannabis is illegal , because he thinks it is less harmful than alcohol .
However , the Home Secretary refused to say which of the two substances she thought was more dangerous .
" As much as people sometimes want a one - word answer , actually it 's more complicated than that , " she explained .
Adam told her he knows from personal experience that alcohol is worse .
" I 've been in trouble for getting in a fight when I was drunk , " he said .
" If I 'd had a smoke , I would have avoided it .
I 've seen so many people become aggressive on alcohol . "
Jacqui Smith replied , " I 'm just not convinced that the answer , if someone gets into a drunken fight , is to give them some other harmful substance instead .
Perhaps the answer is , ' Do n't drink so much , and do n't get into the fight in the first place ' " .
JODIE , a 22 - year - old mum from Crawley As a mother Jodie worries about the future for her kids Jodie explained to the Home Secretary that she 's frightened , because her younger brother goes out on the streets at night with a knife in his pocket .
She said he carries a blade to protect himself .
" Why should he walk along a street , not knowing whether the five men that are walking towards him - whether one of them 's got a knife ? " she asked .
Jacqui Smith told her that for knife - carriers , " the evidence is you 're more likely to have that knife used against yourself " .
JAMES KENNEDY , 28 , a highways worker from Leicester James and his family are concerned about crime James says he knows a teenager who repeatedly breaks the law , and is " constantly in and out of court " .
He told Jacqui Smith that punishments are too lenient , which just encourages him to re-offend .
" He keeps getting off , again and again , " he said .
" So what message is that giving him ? "
The Home Secretary told James a lot of the responsibility might lie within the family .
She said : " Parents are really crucial in this .
I do n't think someone gets to 15 and goes off the rails without there being signs earlier " .
She added that parents should " do things like make sure they know their kids are going to school , and know where their kids are " .
ADRIAN LUKE , 25 , from Bedford Adrian wants more help available for ex-offenders Adrian told the Home Secretary that he needs to get a job or he risks going back to his old life of selling crack cocaine on the streets .
He says he 's spent 18 months in prison , and now he wants to stay straight .
But he told the Home Secretary : " I need to support myself and my kids and my family .
I 'm very tempted to go back to doing what I was doing before " .
" I 'm sympathetic to you , Adrian , " Jacqui Smith told him , " because it sounds like you 're really trying hard .
" You 've made the right decision to not go back into prison and to try and find a job .
We 'll do what we can to help you to do that . "
BECKY MILES , 25 , from Solihull Becky is worried about going out at night in Birmingham Becky likes to go out with friends in Birmingham .
But she says one of the city 's main going - out areas , Broad Street , has become a no - go area , particularly at night .
" I now do n't go out as often as I used to , " she said .
" There is knife crime , there 's been gun crime down there .
It 's not all alcohol - fueled either . "
Jacqui Smith told her , " That 's why we 're putting a particular focus on the way women feel about being able to walk the streets in the evening " .
" What I 'm trying to do is get more statistics on what 's happening in areas , " she added .
" I want people to have the best information about the sort of areas they 're going to , so they can have more confidence . "
A VERDICT ON OUR HOME SECRETARY ?
The five Newsbeat and 1Xtra listeners spent more than 40 minutes grilling Jacqui Smith .
Afterwards , most of them said they were a little disappointed by the way she dealt with their concerns .
" I expected a text - book answer , " said James , " and that 's exactly what I got .
She treated us as if our opinions did n't count . "
Adam said : " She did n't give a straight answer .
She is n't someone I 'd go for a drink down the pub with " .
Young mum Jodie was also frustrated , saying , " She just sat there gabbing on .
By the time she 'd finished , you 'd forgot what she said because it was n't directed at the questions that were asked " .
Adrian thought the Home Secretary could have answered questions better , but he added , " on the whole , I think she 's a nice person " .

FIRENZE - Maxi risarcimento per un ex militare italiano malato di tumore per presunta contaminazione da uranio impoverito : lo ha deciso il tribunale di Firenze che ha condannato il ministero della Difesa a un risarcimento di oltre mezzo milione di euro , per la precisione 545.061 , nei confronti di Gianbattista Marica , ammalatosi di tumore durante la missione ' Ibis ' in Somalia , dove era stato per otto mesi , dal dicembre 1992 al luglio ' 93 , come paracadutista di leva .
NESSO DI CAUSALITÀ - La sentenza è stata diffusa da Falco Accame , presidente dell ' Anavafaf , un'associazione che assiste le vittime arruolate nelle Forze armate , cui lo stesso Marica si era rivolto nel 2001 per rendere pubblico il suo caso .
Nel provvedimento giudiziario , datato 17 dicembre 2008 , viene riportato il parere di un consulente tecnico che afferma l'esistenza di un nesso di causalità tra il Linfoma di Hodgkin ( la malattia riportata dal militare , ora in fase di « remissione definitiva » ) e l'esposizione all 'uranio impoverito .
Ad avviso dell 'esperto designato dal tribunale , le conclusioni dell ' indagine scientifica compiuta dalla Commissione Mandelli , secondo cui tale nesso non può essere accertato , « sono destituite di fondamento per l'erronea procedura di ricerca utilizzata » .
Il tribunale ha dunque condannato il ministero della Difesa per non aver disposto l'adozione di adeguate misure protettive per i partecipanti alla missione in Somalia , nonostante fosse « sotto gli occhi dell ' opinione pubblica internazionale - si legge nella sentenza - la pericolosità specifica di quel teatro di guerra , sotto il profilo eziopatogenetico che qui interessa , e nonostante l'adozione da parte di altri contingenti di misure di prevenzione particolari » .
Secondo i giudici , «al di là delle raccomandazioni che erano o dovevano essere note al ministero , il fatto che ai militari americani fosse imposta l'adozione di particolari protezioni , anche in mancanza di ulteriori conoscenze , doveva allertare le autorità italiane » .
CAUTELE IGNORATE - C'è stato dunque « un atteggiamento non ispirato ai principi di cautela e responsabilità da parte del ministero della Difesa , consistito nell 'aver ignorato le informazioni in suo possesso , già da lungo tempo , circa la presenza di uranio impoverito nelle aree interessate dalla missione e i pericoli per la salute dei soldati collegati all 'utilizzo di tale metallo ; nel non aver impiegato tutte le misure necessarie per tutelare la salute dei propri militari e nell ' aver ignorato le cautele adottate da altri Paesi impegnati nella stessa missione , nonostante l'adozione di tali misure di prevenzione fosse stata più volte segnalata dai militari italiani » .
« Marica denunciò subito il fatto che i militari Usa in Somalia , anche a 40 gradi all ' ombra , operavano con tute , maschere , guanti e occhiali , mentre i soldati italiani erano in calzoncini corti e canottiera » afferma Accame , che parla di sentenza storica e ricorda che « i reparti italiani non seppero del pericolo che il 22 novembre 1999 , quando apparvero le norme di protezione destinate ai militari nei Balcani » .
Sul numero delle vittime , sottolinea Accame , l'incertezza è ancora totale : si oscilla , a seconda delle rilevazioni , tra i 77 e i 160 morti , e tra i 312 e i 2.500 malati .
MATCHES and even salt were in short supply as the Soviet empire 's planned economies collapsed two decades ago .
But blame was plentiful then and now .
Millions of people — chiefly men in late middle age — died earlier than their counterparts in other countries .
That drop , of fully five years in male life expectancy between 1991 and 1994 , demands explanation .
A newly published article in the Lancet , a British medical journal that in recent years has used epidemiological analysis to examine political and social questions , argues that the clear culprit was mass privatisation ( distributing vouchers that could be swapped for shares in state - owned enterprises ) .
A statistical analysis , it says , shows that this element of the economic - reform package , nicknamed “ shock therapy ” , clearly correlates with higher mortality rates .
That , says the Lancet , was a shocking failure .
It argues that advocates of free - market economics ( it cites an article in this newspaper by the economist Jeffrey Sachs ) ignored the human costs of the policies they were promoting .
These included unemployment and human misery , leading to early death .
In effect , mass privatisation was mass murder .
Had Russia adopted more gradual reforms , those lives would have been saved .
In fact the blame game must start at the beginning .
Why was the Soviet economy in ruins by 1991 ?
Partly because planned economies do n't work ( blame Lenin and Stalin for that ) .
Partly because the gerontocratic leadership of Leonid Brezhnev failed to start reforms in the early 1970s , when gradualism might have had a chance of succeeding .
By the time Mikhail Gorbachev initiated perestroika and glasnost in the late 1980s , the Soviet Union was all but bust .
Worse , by running the printing presses red -hot , his government created a colossal monetary overhang .
Russians may have thought that their savings evaporated when prices were liberalised at the start of 1992 ; in truth , their cash was already worthless .
Surgical alcohol
The second question is the effect of all this on mortality .
Soviet public - health statistics show a clear decline from 1965 to the early 1980s , with rising deaths from circulatory diseases ( because of poor diet , smoking and , especially , drinking ) .
Mr Gorbachev 's anti-booze campaign — although hugely unpopular — raised life expectancy by fully three years between 1985 and 1987 .
After 1992 the state monopoly on alcohol ( and health checks on its quality ) collapsed .
As anybody who lived in Russia at the time will recall , the effect was spectacular — and catastrophic .
Death rates returned to their long - term trend .
The thorniest question is about economic policy mistakes after 1991 .
In retrospect , the West failed to prepare for the Soviet collapse .
It took too long to recognise that Boris Yeltsin 's first government deserved trust , pressing it too hard on debt repayments and being too stingy with aid .
Then it made the opposite mistake , being too trusting and generous when Russia was becoming more hawkish and looting was endemic .
Mass privatisation broke the planners ' grip but failed to create the hoped - for shareholder democracy .
Yet the Lancet paper seriously misunderstands both the timing and the effects of economic reform .
It states quite wrongly that “ Russia fully implemented shock therapy by 1994 ” .
As it happens , in that year life expectancy started rising .
But in any case reforms were by then bogged down and advisers such as Mr Sachs had quit in despair .
Moreover , mass privatisation had little immediate effect on jobs — or much else .
Most Russians exchanged their vouchers for trivial amounts of cash , or even vodka .
That may have been marginally bad for their health — but it does not explain the huge jump in the death rate .
Correlation is not causation .
Mass privatisation was not the most important or effective part of “ shock therapy ” and the rise in death rates is out of synch with efforts at economic reform .
Furthermore , countries that successfully applied shock therapy , such as Poland , saw improved life expectancy .
So did the then Czechoslovakia , which plumped for mass privatisation , albeit not very successfully .
Mistakes were made , but Russia 's tragedy was that reform came too slowly , not too fast .
Referee Jose Manuel Barro Escandón made history at the weekend by sending off 19 players in a regional first division match between Recreativo Linense and Saladillo de Algeciras .
Recreativo were winning 1 - 0 when one of their players was red-carded in the 54th minute .
A fight broke out , which then escalated into a brawl involving several members of the crowd .
The match was swiftly abandoned by the referee , who proceeded to show straight red cards to nine players from each side in the dressing rooms , the most puzzling part of which is the question of who , exactly , managed to escape getting a red , and whether they can still look their team - mates in the eye on the training pitch .
Speaking to Spanish radio after the game , the Recreativo coach , Sebastián Naranjo , suggested it might have all been rather overblown in any case .
" The players who intervened , and even the spectators , were just trying to see that things did n't get worse , " he said .
" I do n't know what happened to the guy ...
The referee has set a new record . "
Perhaps so , in terms of the sheer volume of expulsions , but Escandón is certainly not the first to oversee an outbreak of western - style every - man - for - himself fisticuffs .
One of the most infamous involved the Jamaican national team during a friendly against Mexican club Toros Neza in Mexico City in 1997 .
A local player reacted violently to being fouled : cue 22 - man tear - up , rapidly joined by coaching staff and members of the Mexican crowd .
Jamaica diplomatically left the field .
Only to return , in less conciliatory mood , armed with bricks .
On a more exalted stage , the Battle of Santiago , is the popular name for the 1962 World Cup group match between hosts Chile and Italy .
Enraged by less than flattering descriptions of their home country by Italian journalists , the Chileans kicked off firmly of the opinion that revenge was a dish best served hot .
The first foul was committed after 13 seconds .
Italy 's Giorgio Ferrini was sent off in the 12th minute ( he eventually had to be dragged off by policemen ) .
Italy 's Mario David was sent off for kicking Leonel Sanchez in the head .
Humberto Maschio had his nose broken by a Chilean fist .
Chile eventually won 2 - 0 , finishing with 11 men against nine .
And David Coleman saw it all .
Remember : what you 're about to see is the most stupid , appalling , disgraceful and disgusting exhibition of football , possibly in the history of the game .
Right at the other end of the scale , even beach football can go wrong .
Here Uruguay have just come from behind to beat Argentina 2 - 1 .
I repeat : at beach football .
It should be obvious to anyone who is paying attention that the American system of government has broken down .
The checks and balances of the three branches of government have failed to check and balance and the growth of state power has not only continued , but accelerated .
Government spending has increased as a percentage of national economic activity to the point where the risk of default or hyperinflation approaches a mathematical certainty .
Supreme Court Justices and legislators are biased toward increasing presidential power because , among other reasonst they draw their paychecks from the Executive Branch Department of the Treasury .
Personal freedom has diminished to the point where we actually celebrate the ability to choose between despot A and despot B the way a condemned prisoner might be grateful to choose between death by hanging or firing squad .
The reason why I am so concerned about the usurpation of power by the Executive ( and to a lesser extent the Judicial ) branch is that the effect is a transfer of power from the citizenry to the government as a whole .
Only Congressmen and senators are directly elected by majority vote .
The president is selected by the Electoral College and the justices and judges of the federal courts are nominated by the president .
The legislature is the branch of government most accountable to the people and it is the branch that has yielded it 's authority to the other branches .
Among other things , it has lost much of its authority to make war , negotiate treaties , and control spending .
Many patriotic Americans will argue that , although the system is imperfect , it is still better than many alternatives .
I actually agree with that claim , but that does n't mean that the current state of affairs is acceptable .
A failure is a failure , regardless of the degree to which it is preferable over worse failures .
Having herpes is wonderful compared to having AIDS .
House arrest is better than prison , but the domicile we are confined to is starting to look more and more like a penitentiary every day as the cage 's gilding loses its luster .
Considering the rate at which our less - than - ideal situation is deteriorating , the “ it could be worse ” defense is particularly unconvincing .
The central weakness with constitutional government is the government 's ability to use its rule - making power to modify the rules that limit its power .
This is accomplished through constitutional amendments , presidential signing statements , judicial review , judicial activism , selective law enforcement , and other legislative tricks .
In the U.S. , this has meant that , in just over two hundred years , the government has morphed from a relatively benign force of minor inconvenience into a near - omnipresent leviathan that interferes with almost everything we do .
It may not be totalitarian yet , but it is clearly headed in that direction .
In order to arrest and reverse this descent into servitude , alternatives should be considered .
I propose that , instead of three branches of government , we adopt three ( or more ) completely independent and non-territorial governments .
I make this proposal because it is not the concept of checks and balances that has failed , but the inadequacy of the particular system in place that is the source of our problems .
I know this is a radical proposal , but no more radical than the constitutional republic that we live under now was when it was first proposed .
A radical solution is called for because , in my opinion , attempts at incremental reforms have been no more effective than efforts to liberalize the mafia or the Ku Klux Klan would be .
It is simply not in the nature of a territorial or monopoly state to relinquish its power or operate in a non-coercive fashion .
Considering how unusual non-territorial competing governments are , several objections spring to mind .
I will address a few of them here .
1 . Is n't a known but flawed system preferable to an untried solution ?
In fact , a system similar to that which I propose lasted for 300 years in Saga - era Iceland , which is longer than our current experiment in democratic republicanism has been running .
Actually , as drastic as my solution admittedly is , when looked at another way , it is not so radical .
People have the option of changing governments today by moving .
I am merely suggesting we extend that same option to those who choose not to relocate .
By increasing the ease at which we could switch governments , they would be forced to become more responsive or risk losing their subjects ( and tax revenue ) .
2. Would n't a lack of a strong central Government invite invasion ?
It 's true that a group of non-territorial governments would be less able to protect us from foreign and domestic threats , but the upside of that limitation is that the governments themselves would be less threatening both domestically and abroad .
The attacks on Pearl Harbor and the World Trade center killed thousands , but not nearly as many as the Washington policies of slavery , the draft , Indian eradication , and Jim Crowe .
Protection from government is at least as important as protection by government , and a decreased ability to prevent attacks is a decreased ability to aggress against other nations and consequently a decreased likelihood of provoking attacks against us .
3 . What 's to keep anyone from just choosing no government and stop paying taxes altogether ?
Most people would still prefer to choose a government for the same reason most people now prefer to buy food rather than growing or raising their own .
In economics , the phenomenon is known as Specialization .
Nothing would absolutely prevent anyone from opting out of collective government altogether , but the benefits of specialization would encourage most to retain the services of a government at the same time such an arrangement would ensure that the governments would provide services equal to or exceeding the tax revenue they collect ( otherwise , they would go out of business ) .
4 . Would n't having several competing governments be less efficient ?
Some economies of scale would be lost by having several redundant governments , but the benefits of competition outweigh the benefits of monopoly .
If governments were run more like private businesses , the incentives would be reversed .
Currently , a state agency that does a poor job asks for and receives more funding , which effectively rewards poor performance .
Alternately , private companies usually lose revenue or go out of business altogether when they perform poorly and they profit when they do well .
These objections are by no means comprehensive , nor are my responses to them .
The purpose of this proposal is not to end discussion but to start it .
Real world constraints require practical , not utopian , solutions .
As time progresses and the failure of democratic republicanism becomes more apparent , this discussion will assume greater importance and the need for some kind of alternative will be obvious .
In my pursuit of a solution to the separation of powers problem , I have drawn on the ideas of many others .
I do n't claim to have developed this idea on my own and in fact very little of it is original .
My goal is not to challenge the ideals of the American Revolution , but to advance them beyond their current implementation .
Liberty is a noble objective in itself , but it is also the surest path toward future prosperity .

Iranian artists have created the world 's largest sand carpet from the colorful sand found on the country 's southern island of Hormuz .
Some 25 visual artists used 70 types of colorful sand to create the ' Persian Gulf ' sand carpet , which will be displayed on the island from Dec. 9 to 17 , 2008 .
The 12000 - square - meter carpet is unique in magnitude , pattern and color and its title which shares the name of the forever Persian Gulf .
The previous sand carpet record belonged to 900 - square - meter one created on the Canary Islands in the North Atlantic Ocean .
Known for its beautiful red soil , Hormuz Island has witnessed numerous artistic events , including Iran 's 15th Environmental Art Festival .
How Tarsnap uses Amazon Web Services
Regular readers of these Daemonic Dispatches will no doubt have noticed that I have mentioned occasions , and it's no secret that my tarsnap online backup service is built on top of Amazon Web Services .
Over the month since tarsnap reached public beta , a number of people have asked me questions about AWS and how tarsnap uses it , so I think now is a good time to provide some insight into how the tarsnap service works behind the scenes .
The tarsnap server provides a transactional key -> blob store to tarsnap clients .
The keys are a fixed 33 bytes ( a one - character type plus a 256 - bit unique ID generated using SHA256 ) , while blobs are an average of about 30 kB but can be as large as 256 kB .
In order to create a new archive , the tarsnap client sends a " write transaction start " request , many " write data " requests , and a " commit transaction " request to the tarsnap server ; deleting an archive is similar ( except with a " delete transaction start " and " delete data " requests ) .
The tarsnap server has no concept of separate tarsnap archives or of eliminating data which is duplicated between archives ; instead , it is up to the tarsnap client to recognize duplicate data and avoid storing it again , and to only delete data once no remaining archives require it ( this is important for both performance and security ) .
As a result , it is essential that the tarsnap server provide a storage system which is both transactional and strongly consistent :
Without this guarantee , it would be possible for partial archives to be stored but " orphaned " in the event that the tarsnap client crashed in the middle of writing an archive ( in which case an unlucky user would be stuck paying to store inaccessible and useless bits ) , or -- even worse -- for the tarsnap client to delete some bits which were still required by an archive , rendering that archive unreadable .
Of course , providing strong consistency comes at a price : Tarsnap sacrifices availability .
If , at any point , the tarsnap server finds that it is unable to service a request , it simply drops the connection to the tarsnap client ; the tarsnap client will then re-connect and retry .
In practice , tarsnap client re-connections occur far more often due to client - server connections falling victim to network outages and packet loss ; but the tarsnap client handles a server failure and a network outage identically ( in fact , the client code is n't even aware of the distinction ) .
Once data reaches the tarsnap server , it is stored to Amazon S3 ; and the tarsnap server only acknowledges the client request once the S3 PUT has successfully completed -- that is , once the data has been stored on disks in multiple geographically diverse datacenters .
However , S3 by itself does n't provide either the consistency guarantees or the transactionality required by tarsnap .
To provide these , the tarsnap server implements a log- structured filesystem on S3 , but holds all of the relevant metadata on an EC2 instance .
Because log entry numbers are strictly increasing , each object which the tarsnap server stores on S3 only has one possible value ( if it exists at all ) ; and because metadata is stored on EC2 ( which makes it easy to provide strong consistency guarantees ) , this makes it possible to recognize if S3 provides " stale " data ( since the only possible stale response is a 404 error ) .
Now , holding ( meta ) data on an EC2 instance means that we must accept the possibility of the EC2 instance dying ; but the use of a log - structured filesystem makes this an easy problem to solve :
All of the metadata is implicit in the individual log entries , so to regenerate the metadata one must merely read the log entries back from S3 .
In fact , this provides a very good " safety net " to protect against any unforseen glitches in the tarsnap service :
If all else fails , I can do a complete reboot of the service by throwing away everything except the data stored on S3 and then reconstructing all of the transient state .
Naturally , this all comes at a cost , and this is part of why tarsnap 's price for storage ( $ 0.30 / GB / month ) and bandwidth ( $ 0.30 / GB ) is higher than S3's prices ( $ 0.15 / GB / month for storage , and $ 0.10 -- $ 0.17 / GB for bandwidth ) .
However , the price difference is n't as large as it seems :
In addition to the price of storage and bandwidth , S3 charges a per-request fee of $ 0.00001 ( for PUTs ) or $ 0.000001 ( for GETs ) .
While this seems small , it adds up :
If the tarsnap client wrote data directly to S3 ( ignoring , for the purpose of argument , the fact that S3 does n't provide consistency and transactionality ) the added cost of S3 PUTs would make it more expensive than writing data via the tarsnap server .
Because the tarsnap server services requests from many clients at once , it is able to " bundle " multiple writes together , with the result that the cost of PUTs which I end up paying S3 is considerably lower on a per - GB basis .
That said , I do make a few cents of profit out of the $ 0.30 ; but unlike Jungle Disk , I do n't charge an up - front fee for the tarsnap client code ( the Jungle Disk software costs $ 20 ) or a monthly fee for the service ( Jungle Disk Plus costs a flat $ 1 / month beyond the S3 costs ) , and given that I spent two years working full - time on writing all the code for tarsnap , I do n't think it 's unreasonable for me to add a small markup to the service in order to pay for my time . :-)
Speaking of money , I would be remiss if I failed to mention SimpleDB .
While I wrote last year that one should not try to use [ SimpleDB ] to store any sort of accounting information , this is in fact exactly what I 'm doing : Tarsnap users ' current and historical account balanaces along with how much storage and bandwidth they have used , are all stored in SimpleDB .
The fact that SimpleDB lacks any useful consistency guarantee means that it is theoretically impossible to do this without a risk that a user 's usage , or worse , a payment made will be " lost " and not reflected in a user 's current balance ; but I 've written the code in such a way that the tarsnap accounting code will never lose anything providing that SimpleDB always reaches consistency within 24 hours .
Given that I 've been told that SimpleDB usually reaches consistency within a few seconds , the danger of losing some accounting data is low enough that I 'm not particularly concerned .
I would never be so cavalier about someone 's data , but accounting data ... well , it 's only money , after all .
There are still improvements which I 'd like to see made to Amazon Web Services : Removing " eventual consistency " or at least replacing it with eventually known consistency ( the distinction being that with eventually known consistency you can query an API to ask if updates have propagated yet ) and adding support for running FreeBSD on EC2 ( I 've signed an NDA , so I can't say much here except that we 're working on it ) are at the top of my list , closely followed by expanding the Flexible Payments Service to Canada .
For all its quirks and limitations , though , Amazon Web Services is a great platform which I 'd recommend to anyone interested in building an online service .

OPINION : YOU MAY , from time to time , find yourself in the unfortunate position of having to justify some atrocity or other .
This can lead to anxiety , awkwardness and social embarrassment .
In extreme cases , you may even find yourself blurting out obscene words such as “ wrong ” , “ immoral ” or “ sorry ” .
But these problems can be avoided by following our simple , six - step guide to defending the indefensible , writes Fintan O'Toole
1 . Why are you saying this ?
Always begin by questioning the motives of those who draw attention to unfortunate incidents such as the shelling of schools , the blocking of ambulances , the placing of bombs in restaurants , the firing of rockets into towns etc .
They are anti-Semites , anti-Irish , anti-Islam – whatever .
Even when you know the charge to be untrue , make them deny it .
If confronted with an obviously independent , respected and neutral organisation – the Red Cross , Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch , a UN agency – react more in sorrow than anger .
Accept that they are acting for the best motives , but regret that they have been cynically manipulated by evil forces .
This gives you a double whammy – the implication that your critics are stupid and another cynical abuse to chalk up against your enemies .
2 . What about . . .?
What about 800 years of oppression ?
What about Hamas ’s charter ?
What about Cromwell ?
What about the Holocaust ?
What about the H -Blocks ?
What about the rockets ?
It is true , of course , that logic dictates that revulsion at one atrocity should apply to all others .
Unless “ we ” are innately superior to “ them ” ( we are , but let ’s not go there ) , the same standards have to apply .
But your job is not about logic – it ’s about emotion and distraction .
What - aboutery generates passionate indignation and , more importantly , means that you do n’t have to actually address what you ’ve done .
This , remember , is your primary task – to fill the airwaves or the newspapers with everything except an actual engagement with the atrocities .
3 . They did it themselves .
Yes , we pulled the trigger , dropped the bomb , fired the shell , aimed the rocket , strapped on the explosives .
But none of this would have happened if they had n’t partitioned Ireland , refused to recognise the state of Israel , voted for Sinn Féin , voted for Hamas . . . and so on .
Repeat the phrases “ inevitable consequence ” and “ unavoidable tragedy ” .
Use them often enough and your actual human agency will completely disappear .
Murder is really suicide .
4 . We gave a warning .
We left a coded message saying that the bombs were about to go off .
We dropped leaflets from the sky telling civilians to evacuate the area .
Maybe the warning was a little imprecise or a little late .
Maybe , when they evacuated one side of the town , we exploded car bombs in the area they ran into .
Maybe , when they sought refuge in schools flying the UN flag , we shelled those buildings too .
But we gave a warning .
5 . There is no morality , only “ moralising ” .
Morality is an awkward bugger in these circumstances , not least because it can play hell with your own conscience .
There is , thankfully , an almost magical solution – the beautiful word “ moralising ” .
It transforms that nasty stuff about right and wrong into a contest between insufferable prigs ( them ) and clear - eyed realists ( you ) .
It shifts the ground from the atrocities you have committed or supported to the psychological flaws of those who get upset about them – all with the addition of five little letters .
For advanced practitioners , “ moralising ” may be combined with “ grandstanding ” in a contemptuous sweep like “ the throng of moralising grandstanders ” , but it generally requires at least a university professorship to pull off such a comprehensive dismissal of international humanitarian law .
6 . We are at war with them to save ourselves .
We have to do it to them before they do it to us .
Other neat formulations include : “ Here , just as generally , humanity would amount to the greatest cruelty towards our own people ” ; “ The only way to cope with them is to treat them with the necessary brutality .
If you spare them , you ’ll later be their victim ” ; and “ If we did n’t fend them off , they would annihilate us . ”
These latter phrases , nicely turned though they are , need to be used with caution and not in front of historically literate audiences who might recognise their origins in early 1940s Germany .
If anyone should point out such parallels , however , see point one .
Used in the right combination , these simple devices can generate a surprising amount of obfuscation , distraction and misinformation .
Other devices , like controlling the flow of information by keeping journalists out and downright , barefaced lies , are useful but not strictly necessary .
The only restriction on the use of this six - step programme is that it is best not used by those who have criticised such devices in the past .
If , for example , you spent many years exposing the sickening hypocrisy and evasion of the IRA in relation to its atrocities against civilians during the Troubles , it is probably best not to deploy the same linguistic manoeuvres in defence of Israel ’s attacks on Gaza .
In such circumstances , if you ca n’t be consistent , it is probably best to be silent .

Advertisement A series of demonstrations is taking place across the UK to try and stop the Israeli air strikes on Gaza .
The protests are being held at 18 locations including Portsmouth , Manchester , Hull , London and Glasgow .
They come after several days of smaller demonstrations around the country , including outside the Israeli Embassy in Kensington , west London .
Israel 's government has said it is defending its citizens from Palestinian rocket attacks .
' No defence '
The government launched the offensive after Palestinian rockets were fired into Israel 's southern regions , breaking a six - month truce .
But Lyndsey German , of the Stop the War Coalition , said Israel 's actions were not " a defence measure " .
She said there would be " tens of thousands " of people in London alone and this " is just the start of the campaign " .
" If there is an invasion of Gaza , as looks likely , by the Israeli army , if the blockade continues with people suffering from shortages of food and medicine , then I think this will grow .
" This is Israel being aggressive , this is Israel attacking one and a half million people who already live in great poverty , in great difficulty . "
For every one person killed in Gaza , they are creating 100 suicide bombers .
It 's not just about Gaza , it 's about all of us

Cities protest over Gaza attacks
More than 30 organisations , including the British Muslim Initiative and the Stop the War Coalition , have worked together to organise the series of protests .
The BBC's Barnie Choudhury estimated there were 7,000 to 10,000 people marching along the Embankment in central London towards Trafalgar Square .
Some chanted " Free , free Palestine " and " Israel terrorists " .
On Whitehall , hundreds of shoes were thrown at the gates of Downing Street , echoing the protest of an Iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at US President George W Bush .
A firework was also reportedly thrown at police .
Elsewhere , an estimated 2,000 people marched through Manchester and in Portsmouth , nearly 500 people took to the streets .
Police said there were about 500 demonstrators in Glasgow and 600 in Edinburgh .
Former model Bianca Jagger and singer Annie Lennox have supported the action , and have also called on American president - elect Barack Obama to speak up against the bombardment .
Ms Lennox told the BBC that both sides were " wrong " and a total ceasefire was the only sensible solution .
She said the intervention of President George W Bush , who has described Hamas 's rocket attacks as an " act of terror " , was not helping the situation .
She said : " The problem is , from my perspective , they are pouring petrol onto the fire .
" They have to sit down .
This is a small window of opportunity just before things kick off .
" For every one person killed in Gaza , they are creating 100 suicide bombers .
It 's not just about Gaza , it 's about all of us .
Actor Paul Kaye , whose mother - in - law was killed in a Hamas rocket attack , told the BBC he had experienced the situation from an Israeli point of view .
" It 's terrifying , " he said .
" My wife was trapped in a supermarket in a rocket attack .
I was with my sons in Ashkelon station , holding them , waiting for a rocket to land and shutting my eyes thinking ' is this it ? '
" So I think it 's important to remember that mothers fleeing rocket attacks holding their children have the same fear on both sides of the border . "
Ceasefire calls
The UN has reported that some 2,000 Palestinians have been wounded since the airstrikes began last Saturday .
Thousands marched past Downing Street in protest at the violence More than 400 people have been killed including 60 civilians - 34 of them children .
Four Israelis - three civilians and one soldier - have been killed by rockets fired into Israel from Gaza , which have hit towns up to 25 miles ( 40 km ) from the narrow coastal strip .
Both sides have so far resisted international calls for a ceasefire .
' Self - defeating ' Foreign Office Minister Bill Rammell said the British government was " forcefully and strongly arguing " for an immediate end to the violence .
" Israel has a right to respond proportionately , but we 've been very , very clear that there has been a massive loss of innocent life ... and that is unacceptable . "
Mr Rammell said Hamas rocket attacks on Israel were also " unacceptable " , but stressed that " a reinvigorated political process " was the only route to a long - term solution .
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg branded Israel 's strategy of bombing Gaza " self - defeating " .
" One of the great victims of the Israeli action is ... moderate public opinion in the Arab world , upon whom Israeli long - term security interests depend , " he said .
He said the reaction of the EU had been " weak " and said member states should have threatened to sever trade links with Israel if the bombardment continued .
Chairwoman of the Jewish Labour Movement , MP Louise Ellman , defended Israel 's actions .
She told the BBC : " The scale of human suffering of the people in Gaza is deeply distressing but the responsibility lies with Hamas . "
She described the militant group as an " organisation that does not accept the existence of Israel " and one that " refuses to be involved in negotiations " that would result in a two - state solution in the region .

Ben Bernanke , chairman of the US Federal Reserve , warned yesterday that the economic recovery package planned by the incoming Obama administration will not succeed unless financial stability is restored .
Mr Bernanke used a speech in London to issue a clear challenge to the US president - elect , Barack Obama , who is planning a huge fiscal stimulus – expected to be worth $ 775 bn ( £ 535 bn ) – to get the US economy going again .
He said : " Fiscal actions are unlikely to promote a lasting recovery unless they are accompanied by strong measures to further stabilise and strengthen the financial system . "

Delivering the Stamp Lecture at the London School of Economics , Mr Bernanke spelt out what those " further measures " might entail .
They include further recapitalisations of financial institutions ; purchases of " toxic debts " under the troubled assets relief programme ( the Tarp ) , or government guarantees of their value ; purchases of commercial paper , and , possibly , government securities ; and a clear signal that " economic conditions are likely to warrant an unusually low federal funds rate for some time " .
The Fed has already announced its intention to buy $ 600 bn worth of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt and mortgage - backed securities .
In addition , the possibility of a " bad Bank " was floated yesterday by Mr Bernanke .
This would purchase assets from financial institutions in exchange for cash and equity in the new vehicle .
However , the commercial banks would never again be allowed to become " too big to fail " , the Fed 's chairman added .
" It is unacceptable that large firms that the government is now compelled to support to preserve financial stability were among the greatest risk - takers during the boom period ... they must accept especially close regulatory scrutiny of their risk - taking . "
Mr Bernanke 's remarks were echoed by those given in evidence to a Treasury Select Committee hearing on the banking crisis and its effects on the UK .
Jon Moulton , founder of Alchemy Partners , told MPs on the committee that the banks had become " too damn complicated " and impossible to regulate or manage .
He called for " narrow banks " to get back to the absolute basic activities of the sector .
Mr Moulton also berated the ambition of the new business loan guarantee scheme , set to be unveiled by the Government today .
He said : " Twenty billion pounds is not actually a very large number against the scale of the problems we 're talking about .
" I would personally be happy if the scheme was a lot larger – it offends many of my basic principles , but we are in a bad hole and we need to get out of that hole . "

Richard Lambert , the director general of the CBI , said the emphasis should now be on lending to larger companies .
" Wholesale markets are frozen and I think there is particular reason to be concerned about the refinancing needs of larger companies who need a syndicate to take them through , and are finding it noticeably harder , " he warned .
" It 's going to be appropriate for the taxpayer to take on more credit risk . "
Mr Lambert , Mr Moulton and other witnesses urged the Government to " print money " , while Mr Bernanke also spoke openly about the Fed 's plans to implement a policy of " quantitative easing " , though the Fed chairman prefers the term " credit easing " .
The policy would not be inflationary , he said , because the " vast majority of banks are choosing to leave their excess reserves idle , in most cases on deposit with the Fed " .
The Fed could " unwind " its positions relatively quickly , though the mortgage - backed securities would probably be retained for longer , he added .
The calls for action came amid further signs that the global economic slowdown is intensifying .
In its annual global risk report , the World Econ-omic Forum , which is best known for its annual gathering in Davos , Switzerland , said that the international economy is threatened by Western governments ' worsening public finances and a further collapse in asset prices as the financial crisis continues to take its toll .
The credit ratings agency Standard & Poor 's yesterday issued a more pessimistic verdict on Portuguese sovereign debt , which joins Ireland , Spain and Greece in the euro - delinquents club , shaking confidence in the single currency .
The WEF added that China faced major difficulties , with growth set to drop below 6 per cent , a slowdown that would make global economic conditions much worse .
The Australian National University will help build a giant laser to measure supernovas and black holes in deep space .
The ANU will partner with the University of Adelaide and Australian Research Council on the project .
The device will be built in the United States at a cost of $ US200 million and will take about seven years .
The laser sends light down tubes 4 kilometre long to detect movement changes in the universe .
Project leader Professor David McClelland says the device will allow them to look at space in a whole new way .
" Our way of sensing the universe , until now , has always been with electromagnetic waves with optical waves , microwaves , radio waves but they 're all electromagnetic in origin , " he said .
" The gravitational waves are something totally different , they 're a new form of medium for which we can observe the universe .
" It 's a bit like being able to use a sense of hearing for the first time . "
Professor McClelland says the laser will open up a new field of astronomy and has the potential to revolutionise scientific understanding of the cosmos .
" Unlike light , which gets absorbed and scattered and obscured along the way , when gravitational waves are emitted they interact so weakly with matter that we see them as they were , as they were generated , " he said .
" So we can look at the inside of a supernova or we can look at the very moments of the big bang with them . "
Nickelback lyrics notwithstanding , many see Linux as the hero that can save us  save us from continuous hardware upgrades with each major software revision , confusing licensing programs , hidden costs and fees and vendor lock - in .
With that said , is Linux our hero ?
The obvious answer is yes , but is it a true hero or just the hero of the month ?
They say that a hero can save us ; I 'm not gonna stand here and wait .
They say a hero will appear when the world needs one most .
A hero saves you from oppression ( vendor lock - in ) , fights off the bad guys ( hackers , viruses , malware ) , and allows you to sleep better at night knowing he is watching over you ( stability ) .
When Linux first emerged as a " ready for prime time " OS in the mid-1990s , Windows NT 4 and Windows 95 were our heroes .
They saved us from Novell 's NetWare , SCO Unix and Microsoft 's own Windows 3.x  but at a very high price : Choice .
We converted to Windows from every known platform and OS only to find ourselves caught in Microsoft 's inescapable maelstrom of marketing hype , endless service packs and upgrade madness .
We were too scared not to embrace the new hero as our own , so we accepted it and relinquished our ability to choose any other platform , for better or worse .
Once introduced to the stability ( kernel 1.2.13 ) and charisma of Linux , it was irresistible .
We did n't stand and wait but helped Linux take small bites ( bytes ? ) out of the prevailing hero 's mystique .
Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) were the first to harness the power and agility of Linux as a free alternative to traditional Unix systems .
Sun 's Solaris OS began to lose its luster as the ISP platform of choice .
This was perhaps the first major commercial conversion from an established heroic icon to the way of the shiny new hero for whom we 've been waiting .

Fast forward a few years to 2005 and beyond , while Linux makes its presence known to most of the world 's data centers and large corporate networks .
It is also beginning to show up on desktop computers in government offices , major corporations , and large banks .
Linux - based virtualization is now a primary force in trimming those IT budgets in huge server consolidation projects .
IBM , HP , Oracle , Novell , Red Hat , Canonical , VMware , Citrix , and even Microsoft now support Linux as an OS and as a substrate for other services .
Linux powers the largest cloud computing services , hosts most of the world 's web services , inherently protects us from viruses and other malware programs , makes up powerful super computers and runs the humble TiVo .
In the most fundamental way , Linux is a hero  a hero that also saves you bundle of cash .

Octopus love :
Make room for a little kink
Apparently the octopus , once believed to be the loner of the deep , is actually the ocean 's resident fetishist .
University of California , Berkeley , scientists report in Marine Biology that during many weeks of observing the cephalopod in reefs near Indonesia , the creatures engaged in everything from " cross- dressing " to strangulation during courtship and mating .
Alpha males would never leave the side of their female consorts , and dealt with other suitors — that might try to remove the alpha male 's sperm from the female and replace it with their own — harshly , sometimes by strangling them to death with their tentacles .
The less manly of the lot would often impersonate females to avoid stronger males by altering stripes on their bodies to look more like those of the fairer sex .
They would then sneak up on a possible mate and engage in an act of copulation that lasted up to six times longer than their more macho peers ( topping out at 30 minutes ) .
The end result : both sexual partners died within several weeks , but not until after the females each laid thousands of eggs to carry the freak show to future generations .

Guitar science : Sucking the feedback out of shredding
It was a trademark move of ill - fated rock - n- rollers Jimi Hendrix and , much later , Kurt Cobain : facing their amplifiers as they wailed , their guitars cranking out notes barely audible against the sonic wall of feedback .
Now Joshua Reiss , an electronic engineer at Queen Mary , University of London , reveals that he has developed a piece of software that sound engineers can use to take all the noise ( but none of the fun ) out of those guitar histrionics .
During a preperformance sound check , his program can pick out certain frequency levels that are likely to result in a screech .
Whenever the music starts to approach one of these risky frequencies during the actual show , the software adjusts the overall volume to avoid any feedback .
This software is not suggested for use with most metal and punk bands .

World 's first manned airplane powered by hydrogen takes flight
U.S. aircraft maker
Boeing announced this week that it had completed the world 's first manned flights in an airplane powered by pollution - free hydrogen .
The test flights in February and March outside Madrid , Spain , mark the first time a pilot has ever flown an aircraft powered by hydrogen ( unmanned hydrogen fuel cell planes were flown by AeroVironment , Inc. , in 2005 and hydrogen gas has been used for buoyancy in balloons and blimps for more than a century ) .
Electricity produced by a fuel cell by combining hydrogen and oxygen powered an electric motor to turn the two - seat test glider 's propeller and enabled it to fly for roughly 20 minutes at 62 miles per hour ( 100 kilometers per hour ) at about 3,300 feet ( 1,000 meters ) above sea level .
The flights were a success , but Boeing does not expect larger aircraft to be able to fly on hydrogen anytime soon .
It could , however , be used for smaller aircraft such as crop dusters or as an auxiliary source of power in jumbo jets .

Breakbone fever cripples Rio
Dengue fever — a potentially fatal mosquito - borne disease that causes crippling muscle and joint pain — has infected at least 55,000 people in Rio de Janeiro , nearly double the number of people infected in all of Brazil last year .
Brazilian officials , struggling to cope with the outbreak , have requested military aid and assistance from foreign doctors .
They are not sure what caused the sudden spike in cases .
The infection , also known as breakbone fever because of its symptoms , is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito and has killed at least 67 people in Rio this year , many of them children .
There is no vaccine , which means the only way to stop the spread of the disease is to kill its mosquito hosts .

Newborn planet may be younger than Christianity
Researchers have spotted the youngest planet to date — an embryonic " protoplanet " still embedded in its birthing material .
U.K. researchers trained radio telescope arrays at Jodrell Bank in England and the Very Large Array ( VLA ) in New Mexico toward the star HL Tau , 520 light - years away , where they identified a clump of small pebbles that they believe will condense into a gas giant planet some 14 times heavier than Jupiter .
The star itself is thought to be no more than 100,000 years old ( compared with the sun 's 4.6 billion years ) , but researchers say the planet could have formed as recently as 1,600 years ago , kicked off by a gravitational nudge from another star wandering past .

LHC doomsday lawsuit questions physicists ' instincts for self - preservation
Concerned individuals are out to save the world — from particle accelerators .
According to news reports , a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii last month alleges that CERN ( European Organization for Nuclear Research ) researchers have not sufficiently investigated the possibility that they will unleash a world - destroying mini–black hole when they fire up the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , an enormous $ 8 - billion particle accelerator set to go on line later this year near Geneva , Switzerland .
Walter Wagner , a former radiation safety officer and cosmic - ray physicist living in Hawaii , raised similar concerns in 1999 over an accelerator in Long Island , N.Y. , that ended up not destroying the world .
This time , he and a second plaintiff are seeking a temporary restraining order against CERN until it proves the safety of the new machine , the largest ever of its kind .
Physicists have repeatedly dismissed the notion of runaway black holes or any other disastrous consequences from such experiments .
A spokesman for CERN , which lies well outside of Hawaii 's jurisdiction , told reporters it is updating a 2003 study to address Wagner 's lingering concerns .

Witness The Unstoppable Death Machines , consisting of brothers Mike ( guitar , vocals ) and Bill Tucci ( drums , vocals ) and their brother from another mother Leaf Chang ( bass , vocals ) .
The band recently released a thousand CD copies of their first self - titled EP and handed one to me the other day .
I ’m happy to report that it ’s good listening ( MP3 below ) .

Ellen Finally Snares George Clooney ( Video , Photo )
has been on a long quest to getto appear on her morning talk show .
She dubbed her efforts last season George Watch '08 and has kicked it into high gear in January , proclaiming George Clooney is Mine in '09 .
The comedic show host has questioned Clooney 's fellow actors and friends in an effort to find out what will finally entice her favorite male actor to appear as a guest on The Ellen DeGeneres Show .
Check out some of her earlier antics here .
A breakthrough was finally reached when ER actor Noah Wyle tipped her off that Clooney is a huge Cincinnati Reds fan , having grown up in that city .
DeGeneres immediately got the producers on the task of inviting two 1970's Big Red Machine Hall of Fame players , Johnny Bench and Joe Morgan to appear on the show .
The rest , as they say , is history .
When Clooney found out that they were going to appear on Ellen , he agreed to be part of the segment that was taped on Thursday and aired today , Monday , January 19 .
Ellen 's persistence has obviously paid off .
Check out video from Thursday 's show below and Clooney 's appearance video .
Ike worker killed saving dogs may be buried as a pauper Man killed saving three dogs may be buried as pauper
Hailed as hero , officials unable to find any relatives
Three dogs rescued by Houston animal - control officers after a Hurricane Ike relief worker died trying to reach them are back with their owner , but a Florida man hailed as a hero may be buried as a pauper .
Robert " Bob " Emery , who was from Florida and in Texas to help clear storm debris , died late Saturday after dashing onto the East Freeway to reach the dogs who were huddled in the emergency lane against a cement median .
He was struck by a passing motorcycle .
Officers brought the dogs to a city kennel where they were held until Wednesday when , thanks to a rabies - vaccine tag , they were reunited with their owner .
Authorities would n't release their names or say whether they had heard of Emery .
The 54 - year - old repairman lived alone on Big Pine Key , Fla .
He had a trailer with a view of the sea and was apparently estranged from family .
" We are trying to locate family to notify them of this person 's death , " said Beverly Begay , chief investigator with the Harris County Medical Examiner 's Office .
If no family is found , and no one claims the body , it would be given a pauper 's burial , Begay said of a wait that could be days or weeks .
Back in Florida , Sandy Downs , whose husband knew Emery for about five years and told him about the post - storm work here , has been hitting the streets for clues on how to reach his family .
" He lived in Big Pine alone , and did n't have a wife or girlfriend that I know of , " Downs said .
" I 'm having trouble tracking down the rumor he had two older daughters . "
Meanwhile , Emery 's story has swirled on the Internet and stoked emotion among animal lovers .
Praise for Emery
Cheryl Lang , president of the Houston - based organization , No Paws Left Behind , which works to find solutions for pets from homes being foreclosed , is among those calling Emery a hero .
" He did n't even think twice , just went out and did it , " she said of Emery trying to reach the dogs .
" That says a lot about his character . "
Lang said he deserves better than a pauper 's burial , and is looking at ways the community can honor his memory , perhaps with a temporary pet shelter .
Houston animal lover April Andres found one positive note after the tragedy .
" I am saddened that Mr. Emery lost his life while being a good Samaritan , but I am so glad that the dogs were reunited with their owner , " she said .
" I know that is what he would have wanted . "

MODESTO , California ( CNN ) --
The photograph became an icon of the Great Depression : a migrant mother with her children burying their faces in her shoulder .
Katherine McIntosh was 4 years old when the photo was snapped .
She said it brought shame -- and determination -- to her family .
Katherine McIntosh holds the photograph taken with her mother in 1936 .

" I wanted to make sure I never lived like that again , " says McIntosh , who turns 77 on Saturday .
" We all worked hard and we all had good jobs and we all stayed with it .
When we got a home , we stayed with it . "
McIntosh is the girl to the left of her mother when you look at the photograph .
The picture is best known as " Migrant Mother , " a black - and - white photo taken in February or March 1936 by Dorothea Lange of Florence Owens Thompson , then 32 , and her children .
Lange was traveling through Nipomo , California , taking photographs of migrant farm workers for the Resettlement Administration .
At the time , Thompson had seven children who worked with her in the fields .
See Lange 's photos of the migrant family »
" She asked my mother if she could take her picture -- that ... her name would never be published , but it was to help the people in the plight that we were all in , the hard times , " McIntosh says .
" So mother let her take the picture , because she thought it would help . "
Watch a Depression - era daughter 's recollections »
The next morning , the photo was printed in a local paper , but by then the family had already moved on to another farm , McIntosh says .
" The picture came out in the paper to show the people what hard times was .
People was starving in that camp .
There was no food , " she says .
" We were ashamed of it .
We did n't want no one to know who we were . "
The photograph helped define the Great Depression , yet McIntosh says her mom did n't let it define her , although the picture " was always talked about in our family . "
" It always stayed with her .
She always wanted a better life , you know . "
Her mother , she says , was a " very strong lady " who liked to have a good time and listen to music , especially the yodeler named Montana Slim .
She laughs when she recalls her brothers bringing home a skinny greyhound pooch .
" Mom , Montana Slim is outside , " they said .
Thompson rushed outside .
The boys chuckled .
They had named the dog after her favorite musician .
" She was the backbone of our family , " McIntosh says of her mom .
" We never had a lot , but she always made sure we had something .
She did n't eat sometimes , but she made sure us children ate .
That 's one thing she did do . "
Her memories of her youth are filled with about 50 percent good times , 50 percent hard times .
It was nearly impossible to get an education .
Children worked the fields with their parents .
As soon as they'd get settled at a school , it was time to pick up and move again .
Her mom would put newborns in cotton sacks and pull them along as she picked cotton .
The older kids would stay in front , so mom could keep a close eye on them .
" We would pick the cotton and pile it up in front of her , and she 'd come along and pick it up and put it in her sack , " McIntosh says .
Watch " we would go home and cry " »
They lived in tents or in a car .
Local kids would tease them , telling them to clean up and bathe .
" They 'd tell you , ' Go home and take a bath . '
You could n't very well take a bath when you 're out in a car [ with ] nowhere to go . "
She adds , " We 'd go home and cry . "
McIntosh now cleans homes in the Modesto , California , area .
She 's proud of the living she 's been able to make -- that she has a roof over her head and has been able to maintain a job all these years .
She says her obsession to keep things clean started in her youth when her chore was to keep the family tent clean .
There were two white sheets that she cleaned each day .
" Even today , when it comes to cleaning , I make sure things are clean .
I can't stand dirty things , " she says with a laugh .
With the nation sinking into tough economic times and analysts saying the current economic crisis is the worst since the Great Depression , McIntosh says if there 's a lesson to be learned from her experience it is to save your money and do n't overextend yourself .
iReport :
Are you worried about losing your job ?
" People live from paycheck to paycheck , even people making good money , " she says .
" Do your best to make sure it does n't happen again .
Elect the people you think is going to do you good . "
Her message for President - elect Barack Obama is simple : " Think of the middle - class people . "
She says she 'll never forget the lessons of her hard - working mother , who died at the age of 80 in 1983 .
Her gravestone says : " Migrant Mother : A Legend of the strength of American motherhood . "
" She was very strict , but very loving and caring .
She cared for us all , " McIntosh says .

Supreme Court to review case of enemy combatant on US soil Agence France - Presse
Published : Friday December 5 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON 
The US Supreme Court agreed Friday to review the case of the only " enemy combatant " detained on US soil , Qatari national Ali al - Marri , who has been held without charge in a military jail since 2003 .
The court said it will hear and take a decision by next summer on the case , which calls into question the right of the president to hold indefinitely and without charge a person declared an enemy combatant .
" We are confident that upon review , the Court will strike down this radical and unnecessary departure from our nation 's most basic values , " said Jonathan Hafetz , staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) and counsel for Marri .
Marri has been held in a US military prison for five years after President George W. Bush declared him an enemy combatant .
The US government alleges he has knowledge of terror plots and trained in Al - Qaeda camps .
Marri came to the United States in September 2001 with his family , to study at a university in Illinois .
He was detained three months later by two FBI agents who believed he had information that could aid the investigation into the September 11 , 2001 attacks , Hafetz wrote in an opinion piece published in the Los Angeles Times last month .
Two months later , the US government filed charges against him , claiming he had engaged in credit card fraud and lied to the FBI .
A trial date was set for July 2003 , but less than a month before it was due to begin , Marri was transferred to a military prison in South Carolina after Bush signed an order declaring him an enemy combatant in the war on terror .
Under current US law , al - Marri could be held in prison without charge " for the rest of his natural life , " according to Hafetz .
A federal appeals court in July ruled that the US president has the power to keep a terrorist suspect jailed indefinitely , but that the detainee has the right to challenge his detention as an " enemy combatant . "
" This sweeping claim of executive authority violates America 's best traditions and defies fundamental principles of due process that have governed the nation since its founding , " Steven Shapiro , executive director of the ACLU , said in a statement on Friday .
" We are hopeful that the Court will reverse the appeals court decision and ensure that people in this country cannot be seized from their homes and imprisoned indefinitely simply because the president says so , " he added .
The US Supreme Court has ruled that war on terror detainees held at the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba -- which the court considered to be US territory where rights enshrined in the US Constitution must be respected -- have a right to challenge their detention in a civilian court .
Dr Sian Griffiths of the NPHSW said : " We hope that this report and the recommendations within it will help reduce the risk of something like this happening again . "
It took just a few hours of watching CNN while cradling his colicky son to make Dr. Dimitri Christakis suspect parents should severely limit the time infants watch TV .
And now he hopes 25 years worth of research will finally prove it .
In one of the most extensive reviews of its kind , the Seattle pediatrician says infant - aimed DVDs such as Baby Einstein , and even award - winning kids ' shows like Sesame Street , can do more harm than good to children under the age of 2 .
In fact , the sensory overload of all those colours , sounds and sights – be it Big Bird or Baby Mozart – may be at least partly to blame for the tenfold increase in cases of attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) in the past 20 years .
It now affects between 5 and 20 per cent of American children .
He even accepts some of the blame .
He believes scientists such as him have helped create the trend .
" There is now an obsession with having smart kids , " Christakis said in a telephone interview yesterday .
" I think we scientists have managed to convince people , rightly , that these early years are really important .
But the problem is we 've created a neurosis around optimizing them and that 's spawned industries that essentially now prey on people 's obsession and fear . "
Nine out of 10 children under the age of two watch TV regularly – some spend up to 40 per cent of the daytime in front of the tube – " despite ongoing warnings " from the American Academy of Pediatrics that they should n't , he says in his review of 78 studies done over 25 years – including his own survey of 1,000 U.S. families – in the January issue of Acta Paediatrica , a monthly pediatrics journal .
In his survey , published in 2007 , he found 29 per cent of families let infants watch TV because " it 's good for their brain , " while 24 per cent use it as a " babysitter . "
In 1971 , the average age that children started watching TV was 4 years old .
Now , it 's four to five months , he says .
Now that there 's so much scientific evidence that too much , too early , is " rewiring " infants ' tiny brains he 's calling for tough regulation .
France , for instance , recently moved to curtail the broadcasting of shows aimed at children under 3 , which has affected 24 - hour channels such as Baby TV .
The sale of " baby DVDs " in the U.S. alone is now a $ 500 million industry .
Millions of dollars in marketing by such giants as Disney - owned Baby Einstein and Georgia - based Brainy Baby , whose officials could n't be reached for comment , have helped persuade too many parents – with no proof – that they 're doing a good thing for their children , says Christakis .
Studies have shown the opposite is true , that baby programs can actually delay language development ( infants learn better from " live presentations " ) and harm attention spans .
The " flashing lights , scene changes , quick edits and auditory cuts " may be " overstimulating to developing brains , " says Christakis , who suspected this 11 years ago when he was homebound with his colicky son and looked to CNN for relief .
He noticed the baby was mesmerized by the light and sound show , and wondered why , since " he obviously did n't understand what was being conveyed . "
" The truth is that we 're in the midst of a large , uncontrolled experiment on the next generation of children .
We 're not going to know for years what the effects of all this exposure to TV will mean , in a scientific sense .
But I 'm concerned that we 're not going to be pleased with the results . "
This is , of course , an endless debate amongst parents , such as Toronto mother Naomi Lieberman , whose now two - and - a - half - year - old daughter , Julie , tried the Baby Einstein DVDs and was n't wowed , and Whitby mother Lesley Kelz , a graphic designer who works at home with two young children and considers TV " my friend . "
" If there were deadlines , I 've had to say , ` Go watch TV . '
I was in the same ( family ) room .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Caterpillar
Inc announced it would cut nearly 20,000 jobs and warned of a tough year ahead as a downturn that began in the United States metastasized into a full - blown global recession , gutting orders for earth - moving equipment .
The world ’s largest maker of construction and mining machines , which also reported lower - than - expected fourth - quarter earnings , said on Monday it was laying off 17,000 workers , and buying out 2,500 others , to reduce costs in the face of what it predicted would be the weakest year since the end of World War Two .
The company slashed its outlook for 2009 and seemed to raise the possibility that it would report a loss in the current quarter -- its first since 1992 .
“ We pretty much hit a wall in December , ” Jim Owens , the company ’s chief executive , said in call with investors .
The news sent Caterpillar shares skidding as much as 10 percent on the New York Stock Exchange .
Owens said the company had been “ whipsawed ” by a rapidly deteriorating global economy and plunging commodity prices .
He said Caterpillar had reacted by encouraging dealers to align their inventory levels with falling volume and “ they responded with significant order cancellations , particularly in December . ”

The layoffs and buyouts , to hit one in every 10 regular workers and idle 8,000 contract workers , represent the biggest wave of job cuts at Caterpillar since the early 1980s , when the company was losing about $ 1 million a day .
The company also said it was freezing salaries of most employees , significantly reducing the total compensation of executives and senior managers , putting several facilities on shortened workweeks , and subjecting thousands of employees to temporary layoffs .
The company reported a fourth - quarter profit of $ 661 million , or $ 1.08 a share , compared with $ 975 million , or $ 1.50 a share , a year ago .
Sales rose 6 percent to $ 12.92 billion .
The company attributed the drop in profitability to significantly higher operating costs in its manufacturing operations as capacity utilization plunged .
It also blamed a sharp decline in profit in its captive finance unit .
Analysts on average expected the company to report a profit of $ 1.28 a share on sales of $ 11.97 billion .

Looking forward , Caterpillar slashed its outlook for 2009 , saying sales could tumble as much as 32 percent to $ 40 billion .
It also said full - year earnings per share before costs associated with the job cuts could fall to just $ 2.50 , compared with last year ’s $ 5.66 .
During the conference call , Owens said Caterpillar was bracing for what he characterized as a “ seismic ” change in sales and revenue in the coming year .
“ If this comes to fruition , it says a lot of bad things not just for Caterpillar but for the economy as a whole , ” said Morningstar analyst John Kearney .
During the call , Mike DeWitt , the company ’s head of investor relations , warned that Caterpillar might even post a loss in the first quarter -- its first in 17 years .
“ December was absolutely atrocious , ” said Kearney .
“ It looks like that is definitely going to spread into the first quarter and maybe get even worse .
It ’s certainly an ugly outlook for at least the first half of 2009 . ”
After shrugging off the downturn in U.S. housing that sparked the worldwide crisis , Caterpillar and other makers of bulldozers , dump trucks and excavators have suddenly faced a world of challenges , including a drop in spending by their well - heeled energy and mining customers .
“ We knew Caterpillar was going to be a disaster . ” said Eli Lustgarten , an analyst at Longbow Research .
“ We just did n’t know the magnitude of it .
And it ’s ugly . ”
Caterpillar shares were down $ 3.46 or 9.7 percent at $ 32.20 in early afternoon trading , off an earlier low of $ 31.92 .
It can look bit crazy , but it seems that there is a widespread train in Russia to organize Orthodox - Christian churches in old railway cars .
It could seem like it ’s a modern phenomena but bit retrospective digging reveals that some of them already appeared when the railroad itself appeared in Russia .

CONWAY , N.H. ( AP ) �
A town official 's comment that many women use domestic violence claims as a " gimmick " during divorce has drawn ire from supporters of a group that helps abuse victims .
The Conway Board of Selectmen voted 4 - 1 against $ 7,500 in town funding for Starting Point , which offers a hot line , shelter , support groups and advocacy services for people who have suffered domestic or sexual abuse .
" There are a lot of women who use ( domestic violence ) as a gimmick in divorce proceedings , " Selectman Crow Dickinson said in explaining his vote .
" All they have to do is call the police and get the person thrown out .
If I call the police and say you 're abusing me , they 'd have to believe me .
I wish people would split up and be more polite about it . "
Dickinson 's comments outraged the 28 - year - old agency 's supporters , including County Attorney Robin Gordon .
" I think comments like that are blatantly based on Neanderthal thinking , " she said .
" I think it 's a shame our legislators do n't understand the value of a program such as Starting Point . "
Nancy Clark , who owns a local marketing firm , called Dickinson 's comments deplorable .
She and her employees responded by launching an Internet - based education campaign about the tragedies of domestic violence and the worth of organizations such as Starting Point .
Kathy Bennett , director of marketing at a local ski area , went on the Facebook social networking Web site to urge people to call town hall and donate to Starting Point to make up for the " shameful snub . "
Starting Point 's executive director , Suzette Indelicato , said Dickinson 's comments highlight the need for education .
" I welcome the opportunity to speak to Crow and the other selectmen about the nature of domestic violence and what it is , " she said .
Dickinson said he was sorry he upset some people .
" Hell hath no fury like a woman 's scorn , " he said .
But he said those who took offense should harness their energy and show up at a deliberative session March 2 to overrule the board 's Wednesday recommendation .
" They should n't be running around gnashing their teeth .
They 're wasting time , " he said .
" They should try and take advantage of this thing .
But I do n't want to talk to a group of 20 raging women individually .
I want to talk to a group of women who seriously want to get the appropriation increased . "
Voters will make the final decision on the proposed funding in April .

1988-2009
Brazilian model and beauty queen contestant20 , has died of complications resulting from a mysterious illness that developed in December .
Her death was reported to have occurred on Saturday morning , January 24 , 2009 .
She suffered a heart attack that was brought on by necrotic septicemia .
Mariana first sought treatment in December 2008 for what was believed to be kidney stones .
Her condition deteriorated in January and doctors were forced to amputate her hands and feet in an attempt to stem the rapidly spreading infection that was causing the premature death of her cells and tissue .
The Brazilian beauty was a finalist in her country 's stage of the Miss World competition .
She also participated in the 2007 Miss Bikini International competition .

Diving into military theory ( again ) .
A core dynamic behind the emergence of the nation - state was it 's ability to run a successful protection business ( aka racket ) .
A system that has been growing since the treaties of Westphalia in the 1600s .
The protection business is relatively simple :
It is a monopoly .
It has exclusive ownership over the use of violence .
As a monopoly , it must crush all internal competitors .
It defends its monopoly from outside interests -- as in warfare with nation - state and non-state competitors .
It charges the customers ( individuals and businesses ) within its geographical areas of control for this service .
This is n't optional .
Customers presumably benefit from this protection .
Historically Successful Protection Rackets
So what made the nation - state formula for protection so superior to its competitors during its ascent over the last 400 years ?
It 's simple .
It delivered value to its customers .
Let 's dive into this with a paper by Charles Tilly ( War Making and State Making as Organized Crime ) .
He cites the economic historian Frederic Lane 's simple formula for success :
The protection monopoly must generate tributes in excess of the costs necessary to maintain it 's monopoly .
in excess of the costs necessary to maintain it 's monopoly .
The protection monopoly must generate protection rents for its customers .
The amount the customers benefit gain from the protection of their interests less the amount they pay for it .
for its customers .
The amount the customers benefit gain from the protection of their interests less the amount they pay for it .
Both tributes and protection rents must be positive for long term success .
Further , the nation - state that minimized protection tributes in favor of maximizing protection rents grew the fastest ( historically , that was partly accomplished through economies of scale ) .
The Status of Modern Protection Rackets
The protection formula broke down in the latter half of the 20th Century as the nation - state became more complex .
Key elements of this breakdown include : First , the advent of nuclear weapons made full scale war impossible ( van Creveld ) .
Second , the emergence of a global marketplace with global property rights meant that the commercial interests of the nation - state 's remaining customers became more powerful than nation - state 's interests .
This restricted / limited warfare even more .
The result has been a slow unraveling of the nation - state 's ability to maintain it 's monopoly over violence ( and much more ) within and outside its geographical borders .
This has created a gap in protection at the local level into which small violent groups are now quickly converging .
Finally , there is additional evidence that the economies of scale that drove the growth of earlier protection monopolies has broken down .
What this Means
It 's likely that small groups that emerge to seize local control ( as in , create a TAZ ) , will eventually converge on the successful protection model ( delineated above ) .
In fact , we have already seen this shift with groups as diverse in origin as the Sendero Luminoso to the Taliban to the Zetas to MEND .
These groups will be successful in so far as they :

Liu Tianheng , who has stomach cancer , examines his X - ray at the Shenqiu County Hospital .
Decades of extraordinary growth have catapulted China to the top of the world 's economic charts , earning the admiration of much of the rest of the world .
Indeed , China 's continued economic rise has been one of the few certainties of the 21st century .
Increasingly , however , the China story is not one of economic miracle but of environmental disaster .
Worries over air quality at the Beijing Olympics , tainted products and China 's rapidly growing contribution to global climate change have focused international attention on the environmental downside of China 's growth .
At home , the Chinese people watch as environmental degradation and pollution transform their landscape , and in the process endanger their health and future livelihoods .
No one is exempt from the environmental consequences of China 's brand of unfettered economic development , but as Stephen Voss ' pictures so heartbreakingly illuminate , China 's poorest are particularly vulnerable .
Hear Voss describe his photos in an audio slideshow »
In China 's cities , merely walking out the front door results in an immediate assault on the senses .
The Chinese people complain most often about noise pollution .
A cacophony of construction booms and car horns is a permanent fixture of life .
The sky is often blanketed in a thick gray haze of pollutants .
The culprits are the ever - present coal - fired power plants and giant heavy - industry complexes that fuel the country 's growth , and more and more the noxious emissions of automobiles .
The Chinese are in the midst of an American - style love affair with private cars .
The country is adding 14,000 new cars to its roads every day and is in the process of laying 52,000 miles of new roadways -- 10,000 more miles than the entire U.S. interstate highway system .
By 2030 , China is expected to surpass the United States as the country with the most cars on its roads .
More broadly , Chinese consumption patterns are also following those of the West , despite the warnings of prominent Chinese cultural and environmental leaders .
The country 's moneyed city dwellers desire air conditioners , refrigerators and second homes .
Popular leisure activities for the wealthy include carbon - intensive activities such as yachting , golfing and car clubs .
In the process , urban residents consume 350 percent more energy than rural Chinese , and more than 70 percent of this energy comes from dirty burning coal .
Every seven to 10 days , another coal - fired power plant , big enough to serve all the households in Dallas or San Diego , opens somewhere in China .
The environmental toll is enormous .
China has five of the world 's 10 most polluted cities , and on an average day in China 's major cities , 75 percent of the residents are breathing unclean air .
The end result : 750,000 Chinese die prematurely every year from air pollution - related respiratory diseases .
For all their wealth , China 's cities have yet to conquer the challenge of clean water .
Among all of China 's 660 - odd cities , only one small city of 200,000 , Lianyuan in Hunan Province , can claim to provide clean drinking water straight from the tap .
In the rest of the country -- even the country 's capital , Beijing -- residents boil their water or buy it in bottles .
Even then , they have no real assurance that the water is safe to drink .
And in this desperately water - scarce country , the urban infrastructure does little to conserve .
Urban China loses up to 20 percent of its water through leaky pipes .
Cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin have sunk six feet over the past decade and a half as precious underground water reserves are drawn down , causing skyscrapers to tilt and encouraging coastal flooding .
Yet tilting skyscrapers are the least of the cities ' concerns .
In Beijing , factories , buildings and underground pipelines have all been destroyed by the plundering of underground aquifers and the resultant land subsidence .
The environmental costs levied on China 's 400 million urban residents pale in comparison , however , to those faced by the country 's more than 800 million farmers and other rural residents .
Much of China 's countryside suffers from severe land degradation , the result of centuries of deforestation and poor land management .
Today , China -- which is roughly the same size as the United States -- is almost one - quarter desert , and the desert is advancing at more than 1,300 square miles , approximately the size of the state of Rhode Island , each year .
Entire villages in China 's north have been lost , submerged in sand by the encroaching desert .
The country 's State Forestry Administration estimates that desertification affects 400 million Chinese , many of whom lose the ability to farm their land or graze their animals and join the ranks of the tens of millions of internal environmental refugees , who often migrate to the big cities in search of new homes and jobs .
Rural Chinese must also contend with a dire water situation .
The small - scale industries that have sprouted throughout the countryside pollute with impunity .
As Voss ' photographs illustrate , pulp and paper , tanning , chemical and other factories set up shop along the banks of China 's rivers and simply dump their waste into the water .
Often the factories are protected by local officials who have a financial stake in their survival .
More than a quarter of the water that flows through China 's seven major river systems and their tributaries is unfit even for industry or agriculture , much less human consumption .
The Yellow River , one of the world 's longest , supplies water to more than 150 million people and 15 percent of China 's agricultural land .
Yet two - thirds of its water is considered unsafe to drink , and 10 percent is classified as sewage .
In 2007 , Chinese officials announced that over one - third of the fish species native to the Yellow River had become extinct due to damming or pollution .
Such alarming statistics beget other even more alarming numbers .
Nearly 700 million people drink water contaminated with animal and human waste , and according to the country 's Ministry of Water Resources , 190 million Chinese drink water so contaminated that it makes them sick .
It does n't help that an estimated two - thirds of China 's rural population lacks access to piped water -- a development failure that has become one of the leading causes of death among children under the age of five .
Local economies also suffer when villagers can't sell their grain or eat the crops planted along the river because the water is so polluted .
As much as 10 percent of China 's farmland is believed to be polluted , and each year 12 million tons of grain are contaminated with heavy metals absorbed from the soil .
China 's environmental challenge moves well beyond simply the problems faced by any society at the height of its industrialization .
The lack of transparency , official accountability and rule of law that defines China 's authoritarian political system makes protecting the environment particularly difficult .
Perhaps no project better exemplifies this challenge than the Three Gorges Dam .
After decades of promoting the virtues of the dam -- the largest in the world -- Chinese officials are only now beginning to acknowledge the dam 's failures .
The potentially negative consequences of the dam , including dramatically rising levels of water pollution , deadly landslides , loss of species and relocation of millions of Chinese , were all known to those involved in the planning of the dam for decades , yet open discussion was forbidden .
A journalist , Dai Qing , was imprisoned for 10 months for her efforts to air publicly the dam 's likely costs and benefits .
Now that the dam has contributed to the death or homelessness of thousands and there is talk of relocating three to four million more Chinese , the price of silence has become clear .
Yet still , the Chinese government refuses a fully honest and open assessment of the situation .
The Chinese people increasingly have little patience for official obfuscation and corruption .
Journalists push to report honestly on pollution disasters , and lawyers bravely take cases on behalf of pollution victims .
When confronted with poisoned water and air , sick children , and ruined crops , the Chinese people sometimes simply take to the streets .
There are more than 50,000 environmental disputes in China every year .
For example , in 2006 , the residents of six neighboring villages in the poor interior province of Gansu held repeated protests over a six - month period against zinc and iron smelters that they believed were poisoning them .
Fully half of the 4,000 to 5,000 villagers exhibited lead - related illnesses ranging from vitamin D deficiency to neurological problems .
In 2007 , when local officials in southern China illegally confiscated farmers ' land to construct a power plant , there were violent demonstrations .
In the cities , where education levels are often higher and information flows more freely , Chinese citizens have even begun to protest in advance of a potential environmental threat .
In 2007 , for example , Beijing residents protested a proposed waste incinerator , and the people of the coastal city of Xiamen marched by the thousands , successfully halting the planned construction of a petrochemical plant near the city center .
As pressure on China 's leaders mounts from below , the rest of the world is also increasingly impatient with the country 's failure to turn its environmental situation around .
Pollutants that build up and threaten China 's ecosystem and the health of its people also traverse the Pacific and affect the United States and other countries .
China 's contribution to global climate change will soon dwarf that of the rest of the world .
The country already ranks as the world 's largest importer of illegally logged timber and the biggest polluter of the Pacific Ocean .
China 's leaders are well aware of the crisis they confront .
The environment has moved to the top of their political agenda , and they have promised increased environmental investment , set impressive targets for reducing pollution and launched grand - scale campaigns to address particularly challenging problems of environmental degradation .
International environmental nongovernmental organizations and their counterparts in China are working aggressively to provide grassroots support for environmental protection .
A number of multinational corporations have even adopted environmental protection as an important and integral part of their business ethic in China .
Public pressure from around the world counts in Beijing .
Yet the situation continues to deteriorate .
Rapid growth remains the priority for many in Beijing , and certainly for most local officials .
Hundreds of millions of Chinese still live in relative poverty ; per-capita GDP amounts to less than $ 2,000 annually .
In such an economic environment , the up - front costs of environmental protection can appear daunting , particularly for officials in the less - developed interior of the country with far fewer economic resources .
And there are few incentives for local officials to put the environment first .
Moreover , opening the political space to allow for greater citizen involvement in environmental protection -- through a free media , unregulated nongovernmental organizations or an independent judiciary -- is seen as too politically risky by most Chinese Communist Party officials , whose primary concern is maintaining power .
Yet only this type of fundamental reform of the country 's political economy will yield the environmental improvements the Chinese leaders and people desire .
In the meantime , local economies will suffer , people 's health will deteriorate , social unrest will grow and the China story may , in the end , change from economic miracle to environmental collapse .

The announcement of a deal reached between the U.S. Treasury and the moribund insurance giant , A.I.G. provides a very lucid insight in to the nefarious and destructive world of the Troubled Asset Relief Program , otherwise known as T.A.R.P.. Not only have A.I.G. received $ 152 billion to date and subsequently reported a third quarter loss of $ 25 billion , now they are to be cleared of their obligation on $ 53 billion worth of toxic credit default swaps .
U.S. taxpayers are now on the hook for $ 205 billion courtesy of an institution which played in the Wall St. casino that passes for a “ Financial Sector ” and lost .
Under the “ Free market ” system , so expounded upon by Government and Wall St. alike , A.I.G should be in chapter 11 .
Bailing out A.I.G and other failing institutions does absolutely nothing to address the fundamental issues at hand .
The economy is in crisis because unemployment and overarching debt levels pushed thousands of families in to the untenable situation where they did not earn enough to cover their debts .
This burst the real estate bubble inflated by Alan Greenspan , crashed real estate prices , consumer spending and manufacturing .
What we are seeing now is the inevitable result of lack of Financial regulation , lax monetary policy and a symbiosis between Government and the Financial industry .
The mortgages taken out by buyers had been bundled into complex financial instruments ; Mortgage backed securities .
The latter along with Credit default swaps and derivatives set the stage for a global financial meltdown .
The Glass - Steagal act of 1933 had been conceived to prevent the Banking sector from indulging in high risk investments to protect the depositors of these institutions .
This was repealed at the end of the Clinton Administration through the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act of 1999 which opened the gates to financial destruction .
With the stroke of a pen , the financial services sector was given the power to literally bring down an economy .
The most urgent matter for Treasury to address is the toxic derivatives market .
The notional amount of outstanding derivatives , as noted by the Bank of International settlements , comes close to $ 512 trillion .
This represents a figure that is impossible to settle and is the real Armageddon which Banks are preparing for by hoarding the cash that they have received through the T.A.R.P.. Unless this time bomb is defused by bringing the undeclared positions on the table , the duration and gravity of this crisis can only increase .
As the underlying assets of these instruments crumble the Banks ' exposure to counterparty risk increases and will lead to the inevitable collapse of even more banks and reduce the availability of investment credit even more .
The underlying assets include interest rates , mortgages , foreign exchange rates , credit ratings on companies and even creditworthiness of entire countries .
This is the level of insanity that has passed for “ Leveraged Investment ”
With over $ 3 trillion of taxpayer money injected in to Banks , insurance companies , commercial paper , Fannie and Freddie what has come back to benefit the dying economy ?
A reduction in lending , increased interest rates on credit card payments and further losses for these same institutions .
No big surprise as the real economy has never stopped it 's nosedive .
Does the Treasury really not realise that there is no point in investing in companies that have no chance of redemption ?
By handing over Americans ' hard earned tax dollars and indebting future generations , the Treasury has been engaging in the biggest transfer of wealth in Human history .
The U.S. is now the biggest debtor on the planet and the rest of the world has noticed .
China , Japan and the Oil kingdoms that buy U.S. debt are losing faith and it's only a matter of time until they turn off the tap .
Obama blasts ' shameful ' Wall Street bonuses RAW STORY
Published : Thursday January 29 , 2009
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP )  President Barack Obama furiously slammed Wall Street titans who took multi-billion dollar bonuses while taxpayers bailed out their industry as " shameful " and guilty of acute " irresponsibility . "
Obama , anger rippling his usually calm countenance , said bosses of big finance firms must sacrifice along with other Americans , as the country tries to dig itself out of a deep economic hole .
The president 's ire was sparked when he read a newspaper article detailing the 18.4 billion dollars in bonuses racked up by Wall Street firms last year , even as stock markets plunged and the economy slumped towards a recession .
" That is the height of irresponsibility .
It is shameful , and part of what we are going to need is for the folks on Wall Street who are asking for help to show some restraint and show some discipline and show some sense of responsibility , " Obama told reporters in the Oval Office .
" The American people understand that we have got a big hole we have got to dig ourselves out of but they do n't like the idea that people are digging a bigger hole as they are being asked to fill it up . "
Obama , speaking after meeting Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , said he would clearly spell out to Wall Street executives they have to act in a more responsible fashion .
There would be time for them to rake in profits and bonuses later in the economic cycle , he said .
" But now is not that time . "
" We 're going to be having conversations as this process moves forward , directly with these folks on Wall Street , " Obama said .
The president , who is piloting an 800 billion dollar plus economic bailout plan through Congress , pledged to make clear that the Wall Street fat cats must " start acting in a more responsible fashion , if we are to together get this economy rolling again . "
He also brought up the case of Citibank , which has taken funds under a separate 700 billion dollar Wall Street bailout , and reportedly nixed plans to buy a 42 million dollar corporate jet after the Treasury Department complained .
" Secretary Geithner already had to pull back one institution that had gone forward with a multimillion dollar jet plane purchase at the same time as they 're receiving TARP money , " Obama said .
White House aides said the massive bonus figures , divulged in a report Wednesday by the New York state comptroller 's office , undercut Obama 's appeal for all Americans to share in a new spirit of responsibility .
Total bonuses in the securities industry fell from 32.9 billion dollars to 18.4 billion dollars in 2008 , the largest percentage drop in more than three decades , Wednesday 's report said .
" But the size of the bonus pool is still the sixth largest on record , " the comptroller 's office said .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs seized on that statistic to compare the largesse of Wall Street with the shrinking stock market - linked pension funds of many ordinary people .
" No American examining their retirement account thinks " it was the sixth best year for Wall Street " in terms of financial performance , Gibbs said .
" The president shares the American people 's outrage on this . "

With wire reports .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Tests confirm that bacteria in recalled batches of contaminated peanut butter match the strain of Salmonella food poisoning that has made at least 410 people sick , health officials said on Monday .
Minnesota investigators found the bacteria in the peanut butter was a genetic match to the bacteria making the people sick .
“ Minnesota Departments of Agriculture and Health lab tests conducted last week discovered Salmonella bacteria in a 5 - pound ( 2 kg ) package of King Nut peanut butter collected from a long - term care facility associated with one of the reported illnesses , ” the health department said in a statement .
It said the peanut butter was the likely source of the 30 cases in Minnesota .
On Saturday Ohio - based food distributor King Nut Cos said it had contacted its customers and asked them to remove all King Nut peanut butter and Parnell ’s Pride peanut butter from the market .
Solon , Ohio - based King
Nut supplies peanut butter to food service companies that distribute the products to institutions like hospitals , schools , restaurants and nursing homes .
The brands are not sold directly to consumers .
King
Nut said it asked customers to stop distributing all peanut butter with lot codes beginning with the number eight and has canceled orders with the manufacturer , Peanut Corporation of America .
Since September , the outbreak of salmonella food poisoning has sickened at least 410 people in 43 states , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The CDC said preliminary analysis suggest peanut butter as a likely source of the outbreak .
Common brand names of peanut butter sold in grocery stores do not appear to be associated with the outbreak , the CDC said .
U.S. Department of Agriculture , Food and Drug Administration and state health officials have been trying to trace the source of the outbreak .
An outbreak of salmonella was linked to Peter Pan brand peanut butter in 2007 .
ConAgra Foods
Inc closed a Georgia plant after more than 300 people became ill .
Salmonella can cause abdominal cramping , diarrhea and fever and it can kill the very young and the very old .
Every year , approximately 40,000 people are reported ill with salmonella in the United States , the CDC says , but it said many more cases are never reported .
