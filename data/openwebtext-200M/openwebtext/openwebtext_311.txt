A Greatest Hits album is an artist 's testament to a long and prolific career .
Or at least it would be , if it was n't for the fact that pretty much anybody can release one , regardless of how few hits they actually have to their name .
As evidence of this , we give you ...
9 The Best of Vanilla Ice
The window of time in which the world actually gave a shit about Vanilla Ice was quite slim , maybe a year , max .
Granted , during those twelve months , the man put together a dazzling string of accomplishments : the first rap song to reach # 1 on the Billboard pop charts , one of the best selling rap albums of all time , several Grammy and American Music Award nominations , sex with a still hot at the time Madonna .
It was a good run .

But as adored as he may have been for 52 weeks in 1990 - 1991 , he was absolutely fucking hated a million times more for about ten years after .
An incident in which he was supposedly dangled from the ankles off a balcony from the top floor of a hotel and forced to sign over the publishing rights to his biggest hit ever is still used as comedy fodder to this day , most recently on a 2006 episode of Entourage .
Chew on that for a second , the fact that Vanilla Ice was almost murdered by Suge Knight is thought to be hilarious by millions of people .
This album could be called The Very Best of That Fucking Ice Ice Baby Dick That Suge Knight Should Have Dropped To His Death and nobody would bat an eyelash .

Best Moment :
How do you pick just one ?
Is it " Ninja Rap , " a song whose " go ninja , go ninja , go ! " chorus evokes kick ass visions of actual ninjas doing the running man , until you realize it 's a song from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II soundtrack ?
How about " I Love You , " a tender hip hop ballad that shamelessly apes LL Cool J's " I Need Love " but does it in such a pussified way it manages to make " I Need Love " sound like " Fuck Da Police " in comparison ?
Perhaps " Satisfaction " would be more to your liking , a tune in which our hero samples
The Rolling Stones greatest riff ever , almost certainly without their permission , and proceeds to take a four minute long hip hop shit on it .
Really , we can't decide .
It 's all pretty goddamned awful .

( h/t Solve Climate Chronicles )
IN 2003 nearly half of all Americans falsely assumed that the U.S. government had found solid evidence for a link between Iraq and al Qaeda .
What is more , almost a quarter of us believed that investigators had all but confirmed the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , according to a 2003 report by the University of Maryland ’s Program on International Policy Attitudes and Knowledge Networks , a polling and market research firm .
How did the true situation in Iraq become so grossly distorted in American minds ?
Many people have attributed such misconceptions to a politically motivated disinformation campaign to engender support for the armed struggle in Iraq .
We do not think the deceptions were premeditated , however .
Instead they are most likely the result of common types of reasoning errors , which appear frequently in discussions in the news media and which can easily fool an unsuspecting public .
News shows often have an implicit bias that may motivate the portrayal of facts and opinions in misleading ways , even if the information presented is largely accurate .
Nevertheless , by becoming familiar with how spokespeople can create false impressions , media consumers can learn to ignore certain claims and thereby avoid getting duped .
We have detected two general types of fallacies — one of them well known and the other newly identified — that have permeated discussion of the Iraq War and that are generally ubiquitous in political debates and other discourse .
Spinning Straw into Fool ’s Gold
One common method of spinning information is the so - called straw man argument .
In this tactic , a person summarizes the opposition ’s position inaccurately so as to weaken it and then refutes that inaccurate rendition .
In a November 2005 speech , for example , President George W. Bush responded to questions about pulling troops out of Iraq by saying , “ We ’ve heard some people say , pull them out right now .
That ’s a huge mistake .
It ’d be a terrible mistake .
It sends a bad message to our troops , and it sends a bad message to our enemy , and it sends a bad message to the Iraqis . ”
The statement that unnamed “ people ” are advocating a troop withdrawal from Iraq “ right now ” is a straw man , because it exaggerates the opposing viewpoint .
Not even the most stalwart Bush adversaries backed an immediate troop withdrawal .
Most proposed that the soldiers be sent home over several months , a more reasonable and persuasive plan that Bush undercut with his straw man .
The straw man is used in countless other contexts as well .
In his acceptance speech at the 1996 Democratic Convention , for instance , Bill Clinton opined : “… with all respect [ to Bob Dole ] , we do not need to build a bridge to the past .
We need to build a bridge to the future . ”
Dole did discuss restoring the values of an earlier America , but Clinton falsely implied that Dole was only looking backward ( whereas Clinton was looking forward ) .
People may use a straw man to discredit theories to which they do not subscribe .
Characterizing evolution , for example , as “ all random chance ” is a straw man argument ; it misrepresents a complex theory that only partly rests on the randomness of mutations that may lead to better chances of survival .
Recently , in a 2006 paper co-authored with Scott F. Aikin , one of us ( Talisse ) documented a twist on the straw man tactic .
In what Talisse dubs a weak man argument , a person sets up the opposition ’s weakest ( or one of its weakest ) arguments or proponents for attack , as opposed to misstating a rival ’s position as the straw man argument does .
In a July 2007 edition of Talking Points , Bill O’Reilly took on a claim by the New York Times that we had lost the war in Iraq by saying that “ the New York Times declared defeat in Iraq Sunday on its editorial page , and there ’s no question the antiwar movement has momentum . ”
( The editorial actually said that “ some opponents of the Iraq war are toying with the idea of American defeat , ” but let us assume that O’Reilly ’s characterization was correct . )
O’Reilly then offered a weak man explanation for the purported defeat : “ The truth is the Iraqi government and many of its citizens are simply not doing enough to defeat the terrorists and corruption .
The U.S.A. ca n’t control that country .
No nation could ....
Unfortunately , the Iraqi failure to help themselves has come true . ”
Although Iraq ’s failure to aid in fighting terrorism and corruption could be why we are losing the war , the troubles in Iraq could also stem from a host of logistical reasons , some of which may shed a negative light on the current administration .
O’Reilly , however , kept any discussion of these reasons offstage , suppressing the various other possible — and possibly more likely — reasons for “ defeat ” in Iraq .
Meanwhile his claims that the “ U.S.A. ca n’t control that country ” and that “ no nation could ” deflected blame from the U.S. government .
Weak man arguments are pervasive .
In a 2005 editorial in Denver ’s Rocky Mountain News , conservative writer and activist David Horowitz picked on ethnic studies scholar Ward Churchill , formerly at the University of Colorado at Boulder , whose views he described as “ hateful and ignorant . ”
Horowitz then went on to claim that Churchill ’s radical “ hate America ” convictions “ represent ” those of a “ substantial segment of the academic community . ”
Thus , he used the example of Churchill ( the weak man ) to argue that “ tenured radicals ” have made universities into leftist political institutions and subverted the academic enterprise , thereby failing to acknowledge the presence of more highly regarded and politically mainstream scholars in academia .
Trolling for Truth
Weak man tactics are harder to detect than those of the straw man variety .
Because straw man arguments are closely related to an opponent ’s true position , a clever listener might be able to spot the truth amid the hyperbole , understatement or other corrupted version of that view .
A weak man argument , however , is more opaque because it contains a grain of truth and often bears little similarity to the stronger arguments that should also be presented .
Therefore , a listener has to know a lot more about the situation to imagine the information that a speaker or writer has cleverly disregarded .
Nevertheless , an astute consumer of the news can catch many straw man and weak man fallacies by knowing how they work .
Another strategy is to always consider a speaker ’s or writer ’s motivation or agenda and be especially alert for skewed statements of fact in editorials , television opinion shows , and the like .
It is also wise to obtain news from more balanced news sources .
An alternative approach is to try to construct , in your own mind , the best argument against what you have heard before accepting it as true .
Or simply ask yourself :
Why should I not believe this ?
Alan Duncan and James Dunseath plan a summer ceremony
The shadow business secretary , 50 , proposed to James Dunseath , 39 , a press officer in the City , on 14 February while the pair were on holiday in Oman .
" James joked that if I had not asked him on Valentine 's Day , he would have asked me on Feb 29 , " Mr Duncan said .
Tory leader David Cameron said he was " thrilled " for Mr Duncan .
The UK has allowed civil partnerships , the legally recognised union between two people of the same sex , since December 2005 .
' Conventional people '
The most well - known couple to take advantage of the legislation are Sir Elton John and his partner David Furnish , who " tied the knot " on 21 December , 2005 .
What James and I are entering into is not a marriage , it is a civil partnership
Alan Duncan
Shadow business secretary
Mr Duncan , who announced his betrothal in the Daily Telegraph 's Court & Social page , is the first Tory MP to enter into a civil partnership .
" I never ever imagined that one day I would be a beneficiary of the legislation , " he said .
" What James and I are entering into is not a marriage , it is a civil partnership .
" You could not find two more conventional people to enter into a civil partnership . "
The couple met at a dinner given by mutual friends 14 months ago .
I am absolutely delighted for Alan and James and wish them all the very best
David Cameron
Conservative leader
Mr Dunseath told the Daily Telegraph : " It 's just fantastic .
We hit it off instantly and our friends say we are inseparable .
" He may be a politician but he 's great fun .
We both feel it 's so right and we 're very lucky . "
Mr Cameron , who began his leadership pledging support for gay partnerships , said he hoped to attend Mr Duncan and Mr Dunseath 's civil partnership ceremony at Marylebone registry office in the summer .
He told the Daily Telegraph : " I am absolutely delighted for Alan and James and wish them all the very best . "
That constant ringing noise can get pretty annoying — and dangerous .
iStockphoto.com / Kati Neudert
Think back to the last time you went to a rock ' n ' roll concert or a fireworks display .
Do you remember that peculiar ringing in your ears after the show stopped ?
The noises around you were muffled briefly , replaced with a buzzing inside your head , almost as if your ears were screaming .
In a way , they were .
­
Noise levels louder than a shouting match can damage parts of our inner ears called hair cells .
Hair cells act as the gatekeepers of our hearing .
When sound waves hit them , they convert those vibrations into electrical currents that our auditory nerves carry to the brain .
Without hair cells , there is nothing for the sound to bounce off , like trying to make your voice echo in the desert .

Hair cells reside in the inner ear inside the shell - shaped cochlea .
Bundles of hair - like extensions , called stereocilia , rest on top of them .
When sound waves travel through the ears and reach the hair cells , the vibrations deflect off the stereocilia , causing them to move according to the force and pitch of the vibration .
For instance , a melodic piano tune would produce gentle movement in the stereocilia , while heavy metal would generate faster , sharper motion .
This motion triggers an electrochemical current that sends the information from the sound waves through the auditory nerves to the brain .
­ When you hear exceptionally loud noises , your stereocilia become damaged and mistakenly keep sending sound information to the auditory nerve cells .
In the case of rock concerts and fireworks displays , the ringing happens because the tips of some of your stereocilia actually have broken off .
You hear those false currents in the ringing in your head , called tinnitus .
However , since you can grow these small tips back in about 24 hours , the ringing is often temporary [ source : Preuss ] .
Read on to find out exactly how something invisible like sound can harm our ears , how you can protect those precious hair cells and what happens when the ringing never stops .
Hydrogen could be a clean , abundant energy source , but it 's difficult to store in bulk .
In new research , materials scientists at Rice University have made the surprising discovery that tiny carbon capsules called buckyballs are so strong they can hold volumes of hydrogen nearly as dense as those at the center of Jupiter .
" Based on our calculations , it appears that some buckyballs are capable of holding volumes of hydrogen so dense as to be almost metallic , " said lead researcher Boris Yakobson , professor of mechanical engineering and materials science at Rice .
" It appears they can hold about 8 percent of their weight in hydrogen at room temperature , which is considerably better than the federal target of 6 percent . "
The Department of Energy has devoted more than $ 1 billion to developing technologies for hydrogen - powered automobiles , including technologies to cost - effectively store hydrogen for use in cars .
Hydrogen is the lightest element in the universe , and it is very difficult to store in bulk .
For hydrogen cars to be competitive with gasoline - powered cars , they need a comparable range and a reasonably compact fuel system .
It 's estimated that a hydrogen - powered car with a suitable range will require a storage system with densities greater than those found in pure , liquid hydrogen .
Yakobson said scientists have long argued the merits of storing hydrogen in tiny , molecular containers like buckyballs , and experiments have shown that it 's possible to store small volumes of hydrogen inside buckyballs .
The new research by Yakobson and former postdoctoral researchers Olga Pupysheva and Amir Farajian offers the first method of precisely calculating how much hydrogen a buckyball can hold before breaking .
Buckyballs , which were discovered at Rice more than 20 years ago , are part of a family of carbon molecules called fullerenes .
The family includes carbon nanotubes , the typical 60 - atom buckyball and larger buckyballs composed of 2,000 or more atoms .
" Bonds between carbon atoms are among the strongest chemical bonds in nature , " Yakobson said .
" These bonds are what make diamond the hardest known substance , and our research showed that it takes an enormous amount of internal pressure to deform and break the carbon - carbon bonds in a fullerene . "
Using a computer model , Yakobson 's research team has tracked the strength of each atomic bond in a buckyball and simulated what happened to the bonds as more hydrogen atoms were packed inside .
Yakobson said the model promises to be particularly useful because it is scalable , that is it can calculate exactly how much hydrogen a buckyball of any given size can hold , and it can also tell scientists how overstuffed buckyballs burst open and release their cargo .
If a feasible way to produce hydrogen - filled buckyballs is developed , Yakobson said , it might be possible to store them as a powder .
" They will likely assemble into weak molecular crystals or form a thin powder , " he said .
" They might find use in their whole form or be punctured under certain conditions to release pure hydrogen for fuel cells or other types of engines . "
The research appears on the March 2008 cover of the American Chemical Society 's journal Nano Letters .
The research was supported by the Office of Naval Research and the Department of Energy .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - International visitors flying into New York now face being identified by all ten fingerprints , part of a heightened security system aimed at identifying potential terror suspects and visa fraud , officials said on Tuesday .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
The upgraded system , part of the U.S. government ’s Homeland Security program and its war on terror , increases the chances of catching illegal or potentially dangerous entrants into the country , officials said at a media briefing at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Tuesday .
The system expands the digital fingerprinting of international visitors to ten fingers from two .
“ Quite simply , this change gives our officers a more accurate idea of who is in front of them , ” said Paul Morris , an executive director at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency .
“ For those who may pose a risk , we will have greater insight into who they are . ”
The added measure came under fire from critics who claim it is not only ineffective but could violate passengers ’ privacy .
“ As near as I can tell , there has been absolutely no success from this in catching terrorists , ” said Bruce Schneier , chief security technology officer at BT Counterpane in Santa Clara , California , who has studied the system .
“ The real question of these programs is , are they the best use of our terrorism dollar , ” Schneier said .
Officials announced on Tuesday the system has been added to several entry points at Kennedy and is already in use at airports in Washington , Atlanta , Boston , Chicago and other major U.S. cities .
The upgrade , to be installed at all U.S. ports of entry by September , will cost around $ 280 million , according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security .
The U.S. government has been collecting digital fingerprints and photographs of nearly all non-citizens aged 14 and up entering the country since 2004 , officials said , in a Homeland Security program called US - VISIT , at a cost of $ 1.7 billion .
Visitors ’ fingerprints are checked against federal criminal and immigration records , and boosting the system will allow authorities to match fingerprints against a larger number on record , U.S. officials said .
On an average day , almost 14,400 international visitors undergo the fingerprinting process at Kennedy , officials said .
More than 2,000 criminal and visa fraud cases have been detected by the screening process , introduced in response to security concerns following the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , U.S. officials said .
Great Britain has introduced ten - finger scans of visa - carrying foreigners into the country , while Canada and the European Union are working on similar programs .

Working at home was too lonely for Summer Powell , a 35 - year - old freelance graphic designer who had recently moved to San Francisco .
She tried working in cafes but found it too distracting .
So Powell called a friend and together they joined a communal drop - in office space called Sandbox Suites - an example of a new and growing work arrangement called co-working .
" This seems more like in between home and office , " Powell said , sitting with her laptop in a carrel last week in the airy main room of Sandbox Suites , while several other freelancers typed quietly nearby and two Web entrepreneurs conferred over lunches and laptops at a big table on a second - floor landing .
" It gives me a scrappy startup feeling in a good way . "
Laptop nomads - that growing tribe of folks who can be found typing away at any cafe with wireless Internet access - are starting to put down roots .
And some , like Powell , are doing it through co-working , a 21st century twist on the old idea of the shared artists ' studio .
In co-working , a group of freelancers or other solo entrepreneurs share one big office space with perks that they might not get at home , such as conference rooms , espresso machines and opportunities for socializing .
Co-working sites usually give members the option of renting a desk that becomes their own reserved space .
But most also provide a drop - in option , where people can stop by and work in an unreserved common area for a lower fee - or sometimes even for free .
" We went through a spurt of roaming around people 's apartments , but the ergonomics are n't there so it starts to hurt after a while , " said Anthony Young , 31 , one of the Web entrepreneurs working upstairs from Powell at Sandbox Suites .
" Having a consistent , reliable place to go work is good for keeping your head straight . "
The spaces are as varied as their founders , ranging from funky industrial lofts to sleeker sites with a more corporate ambiance .
But most of them are part of a grassroots international movement that is loosely connected through the Internet .
And the Bay Area - with about a half dozen co-working sites up and running - is one of the hotbeds of the movement .
" We definitely have a stronger presence , " said Steve King of Emergent Research in Lafayette , who studied co-working as part of a report on the future of small business .
" We have a vibrant personal - business community in the Bay Area .
And because it 's very tech - and media - focused , it fits in well with the concepts of co-working . "
If it 's possible to identify a founder of the movement , it might be Brad Neuberg , a 31 - year - old San Francisco inventor and open - source software developer who coined the term " co-working . "
Neuberg had left a tech startup to work for himself but missed the camaraderie of an office .
" I started asking myself , ' Why can't I combine the structure and community of a job with the freedom and independence of working for myself ? ' " he said .
In 2005 , Neuberg arranged to rent space two days a week from a Mission District event venue , setting up card tables each day to provide a work surface .
Gradually other people started joining him - a computer science researcher , an entrepreneur , open source developers and a filmmaker .
" I remember some great conversations , brainstorming sessions , and lunches as we all got to know each other and zinged ideas off one another , " he said .
" I even led some yoga classes in the space for awhile . "
Neuberg eventually disbanded his site , but some participants went on to start other co-working sites such as the Hat Factory near Potrero Hill and Citizen Space on Second Street .
Co-working is certainly not the only form of shared work space .
Painters and other cash - strapped artists have shared studios for as long as anyone held a brush .
Writers have clustered in shared offices such as San Francisco 's Grotto .
On the corporate side , business centers such as the Regus Group or , in the Bay Area , Pacific Business Centers offer private offices and conference rooms that can be rented for short amounts of time .
Such centers are popular among traveling salespeople and startup firms that are not quite ready to lease permanent space .
There are also business incubators - shared work spaces typically run by local government or nonprofit groups , dedicated to helping new ventures grow and become sources of local jobs .
Co-working differs from incubators in that it is aimed at solo freelancers , not just businesses with the potential for growth and job creation .
It differs from Regus - type business centers not only in cost - co-working is much less expensive - but also in its goal of creating a sense of community among users .
Many co-working pioneers came out of the open - source software movement , which believes in making source code freely available for use by anyone around the globe .
They approached co-working not just as a business model but as a mission - a way to extend open - source - style collaboration into other parts of life .
So co-working sites often host a variety of after - hours gatherings that range from movie nights to " hackathons " where scores of programmers converge to solve software problems .
" We 've had some interesting open meetings , " said Tara Hunt , co-founder of Citizen Space .
" One tenant wrote a plan on the whiteboard for something that included mock - ups .
Some drop-ins came in and edited it like a wiki ( a collaborative Web site ) , with a bunch of really cool suggestions .
He said , ' Omigod , I did n't think of that . ' "
At Citizen Space last week , Hunt worked on decorating the room 's cinderblock walls while several members typed quietly at their keyboards .
A whiteboard in the middle of the room was filled with notes from someone 's business meeting .
Across town at Sandbox Suites , owner Roman Gelfer brewed espressos while Powell hovered over her laptop .
Young talked with his colleague Jesse Andrews about a dance - related Web site they were developing that was not yet public .
Both scenes illustrated one potential pitfall of co-working - lack of privacy .
With strangers dropping in to work at adjacent desks , how can people ensure that their whiteboard notes or pre-launch conversations do n't fall into a competitor 's hands ?
Co-working participants say privacy has n't turned out to be a problem .
" If it 's really sensitive , I can take my phone and go into a conference room , " said Greg Burton , 57 , an online marketing consultant who works out of Sandbox Suites .
" The amount of productivity that would be lost in roaming from coffee shop to coffee shop is greater than any potential competitive losses here , " said Andrews , 29 .
For now , the precise direction that co-working will take remains unclear .
One possible route is the creation of more grassroots , mission - driven sites like Citizen Space .
Another possibility is the rise of co-working chains - cookie - cutter facilities like health clubs that are less of a movement and more of a corporate enterprise .
In Santa Clara , a traditional business center , Bowers Office Center , started offering a co-working option several months ago .
" There could be a Starbucks - ification of co-working , or in fact , Starbucks could do it themselves , " said Chris Messina , who co-founded Citizen Space with Hunt .
Workplace expert King predicts that , regardless of its form , co-working is poised for a big takeoff .
That 's due to the growing number of one - person businesses , which rose from 16.5 million in 2000 to 20.4 million in 2005 , according to the U.S. Census Bureau .
" We 're seeing a clear trend to free agents and personal businesses , due to outsourcing , layoffs , and people looking for work - life balance or more work flexibility , " said King .
" That 's going to result in more people working on their own either full or part time .
Those folks need support .
And what 's really cool about co-working is it solves that problem for a very modest amount of money . "

Forty years ago , mathematician Mark Kac asked the theoretical question , " Can one hear the shape of a drum ? "
If drums of different shapes always produce their own unique sound spectrum , then it should be possible to identify the shape of a specific drum merely by studying its spectrum , thus " hearing " the drum 's shape ( a procedure analogous to spectroscopy , the way scientists detect the composition of a faraway star by studying its light spectrum ) .
But what if two drums of different shapes could emit exactly the same sound ?
If so , it would be impossible to work backward from the spectrum and uniquely surmise the physical structure of the drum , because there would be more than one correct answer to the question .
Credit : Hari Manoharan
It took until the 1990s for mathematicians to prove that , in fact , two drums of different shapes could produce the same sound .
In other words , you can't hear the shape of a drum .
That outcome , which was physically verified in one instance with vibrations on the surface of soap bubbles , raised theoretical questions about spectroscopy .
" This revolutionized our conception of the fundamental connections between shape and sound , but also had profound implications for spectroscopy in general , because it introduced an ambiguity , " according to Stanford physicist Hari Manoharan .
For Manoharan , the next step in studying this conundrum was to take the drum question to another level — a much lower level .
He and his students investigated the drum question in the quantum realm , where it could have an effect on real nano - electronic systems .
Using a tunneling scanning microscope and two roomfuls of equipment to move around individual carbon monoxide molecules on a copper surface , they built tiny walls only one - molecule high and shaped them into nine - sided enclosures that could resonate like drums ( because of the quantum wave / particle duality of the electrons within the enclosure ) .
Manoharan calls these enclosures quantum drums .
Each drum has only 30 or so electrons inside .
They are walled in by roughly 100 carbon monoxide molecules .
The result ?
Just as in the normal world , two nanostructures with different shapes can resonate in the same way , a phenomenon known as isospectrality .
Manoharan , along with his graduate student Chris Moon and others , published their result in the Feb 8 edition of the journal Science .
To reinforce the point , they created a video , complete with two quantum drums beating with the same sound .
( The real " sound " is at ultra - high frequencies in the terahertz range ; in the video , the sound has been converted to the range of human hearing . )
The practical value of having two different nanostructures with identical properties may lie in the design of ever - smaller computer chip circuits , Manoharan said .
Designers of nano - electronic circuits will have two ways to get the same result .
" Now your design palette is twice as big , " he said .
While the chip industry attempts to shrink existing circuitry , Manoharan is literally coming from the opposite direction .
" My research asks , what if you start at the bottom of the ladder ?
We assemble structures one atom at a time , " he said .
The unexplored gap between bottom - up research and the industry 's shrink - down effort " is where the excitement is , " he said .
The work has a natural connection to the problems of quantum computing , he said .
The research may also have connections to string theory , used by cosmologists attempting to understand the structure of the universe , Manoharan said : " There is somehow embedded into the topology of our universe this bizarre spectral ambiguity . "
String theories describe complex surfaces that are higher - dimensional analogues of these two - dimensional quantum drums .
The drum research has another finding important to the world of quantum mechanics .
While it is impossible to directly observe the quantum phase of the wave functions of the electrons inside the drum structure , Manoharan 's team has devised a way to extract that information by taking measurements from two isospectral drums and then mathematically combining the information , a process called quantum transplantation .
" We discovered that this extra degree of freedom in geometry provides us with a method to ' cheat ' quantum mechanics and obtain normally obscured quantum - mechanical phase information , " Manoharan said .
There are other ways to experimentally determine quantum phase information from atoms or molecules in gases , or from quantum dots and rings , all of them relying on a process called interferometry .
The addition of a new method , " geometry over interferometry , " will benefit researchers , Manoharan said .
UNLIKE such ill - starred peers as Countrywide Credit or Ameriquest , Thornburg Mortgage was supposed to have been a different kind of home loan company : one that did n’t make so - called Ninja loans ( no income , no job , no assets ) or engage in any of the other risky practices that led to the subprime debt debacle .
And Thornburg , the nation ’s second - largest independent mortgage company , after Countrywide , was indeed more prudent when it came to making loans to prospective home buyers .
Mortgage - backed securities issued by Thornburg in 2006 show that only about one - half of 1 percent of the borrowers are delinquent with their payments , compared with a delinquency rate of 6.9 percent in Countrywide ’s $ 1.5 trillion mortgage servicing portfolio .
Indeed , the chief executive of Thornburg , Larry A. Goldstone , has been openly critical of the practices of Countrywide and its leader , Angelo R. Mozilo .
During an interview last August with my colleague Floyd Norris and me , Mr. Goldstone pointed out that his company was n’t even in the subprime business .
True enough , but it hardly matters now .
That ’s because Thornburg holds billions in mortgage - backed securities that have gone from being regarded as safe to just short of radioactive in recent weeks , causing longtime lenders to demand more collateral from Thornburg .
Scrambling to raise cash to pay these margin calls , Thornburg found itself facing bankruptcy rumors last week when its shares dipped below $ 1 .
It closed at $ 2.28 on Friday .
She ist one of the faces symbolizing the Iraq war .
Pictures showing her abusing Iraqi detainees in Abu Graib prison brought her notorious fame throughout the world .
In her first interview in three years Lynndie England talks about Abu Ghraib , about Charles Graner , about guilt , her current life - and the role of the Bush administration .
Mrs. England , a year ago you were released from jail after serving 521 days of a three - year sentence .
How are you feeling now ?
Not great but good .
What does that mean ?
( She sighs )
Oh , it 's just little things going wrong .
I 'm just trying to get by .
Trying to find a job , trying to find a house .
It 's been harder than I expected .
I went to a couple of interviews , and I thought they went great .
I wrote dozens of applications .
Nothing came of it .
I put in at Wal - Mart , at Staples .
I 'd do any job .
But I never heard from them .
Do you think your name has anything to do with it ?
I am starting to wonder if they realize who I am and they do n't want the publicity .
I do n't want to lie .
On my resume I have a brief little paragraph about what I did in the army and about being in prison and that I 'm still on parole .
I want to be totally honest .
I have to find a job by September , that 's part of the parole regulations .
If you break the rules , then they can bring you back .
That would be a big deal because I do n't want to leave my son .

Sie im neuen stern .
How do you get by ?
What do you live on ?
We just got our taxes back .
Thank God .
Otherwise , I do n't know .
I live in a trailer with my parents .
My Dad works for the railway and he tries to help out with bills and my Mom helps me with what she gets .
You live in Ashby , a small town with a population of 1300 .
How do people treat you now ?
They do n't treat me any different .
I have n't met a person yet that 's been negative to me .
Not since I got home .
Most of them back me up one hundred percent .
They say , " What happened to you was wrong . "
And some even say they would have done the same thing .
What do they mean by " They would have done the same thing " ?
That they would have followed orders , just as I did in Abu Ghraib .
Why did you join the army at the age of 17 and against the express wishes of your mother ?
I always wanted to be in the military .
My whole life .
I just did n't know what branch - Navy , Army , Coast Guard , Marines , Air Force .
I just wanted to serve my country and be a patriot , I guess .
As a child I mainly grew up on military gung - ho movies so that 's where I got the idea .
Old Chuck Norris movies , " Delta Force " , " Rambo " , " Missing in Action " , " Platoon " .
It was always said that you saw the army as an opportunity to finance your education .
That was a bonus , no more than that .
It was n't the main reason .
Just look at this place .
There are n't very many jobs to be had outside of the army .
You were a reservist with the 372nd MP unit .
That is where you first met and fell in love with Charles Graner , the so - called " ring - leader " at Abu Ghraib .
Yes , that was right before we were deployed .
I really did n't even notice him because at the time I was married .
He kept following me around , like when I went out for a smoke break .
He did n't even smoke but he started smoking just to hang out with me .
I started talking about my problems at home and he suggested I leave my husband .
I was dumb enough to listen to him and I ended up believing him .
What did you like about Graner ?
I really do n't know .
We do n't believe you .
Even though he was 34 when I met him , 14 years older than me , he sure as hell did n't act like it .
He was an outgoing guy , and he was charming , always said and did the right stuff .
I fell in love with him .
Was he in love with you ?
I can't speak for him because apparently he was playing with me the whole time .
And then you were deployed to the Gulf region ?
At first they did n't know where to deploy us .
We had no idea right up till the last minute .
We left the country on May 13 , 2003 .
That was at the start of the Iraq War .
No , technically the war was over .
I mean , President Bush had already announced " Mission Accomplished . "
What was your first impression of the war ?
The heat , the smell , the noise of the mortars .
But at least we managed to tame the town we were in , Al Hila .
And then around the end of September we got orders to go to Abu Ghraib because they were getting hit with mortars every night .
When we got up there , they sent us to guard the prisoners although we really were n't trained to do that .
What was your first impression of Abu Ghraib ?
I remember on our way up they had to shut down the road because there was a reported I.E.D .
The prison itself was huge .
When you drove up to it , all you could see was this wall and the wall went on for a mile .
And then , of course , there were all the prisoners .
It was very overcrowded .
What kind of job did you do at Abu Ghraib ?
I did paperwork .
That was my job in the military .
So why did you spend so much time in the prisoners ' block Tier One Alpha , although that was n't part of your job ?
Our sleeping quarters were about half a mile away , in the open , and we usually got mortared at night .
So I ended up hanging out with my buddies from the 372nd MP unit that was only 50 yards away .
That 's where I 'd hang out with Graner , Megan Ambuhl , Frederick and all the others .
When they 'd finished their shift , at 4 in the morning , I 'd catch a ride back with them .
What happened during the nights you 'd hang out together ?
At first I 'd just sit in the office and let them do whatever .
And then they started getting shorthanded as we got more prisoners so they asked if I could help out .
That 's how it all started .
When did you realize that something was n't quite right in this block ?
Graner told me about some of the stuff they were doing .
When we first got there in September the prisoners were already naked , they had them wear women 's underwear , and they had them in stress positions .
The company that we relieved was doing the exact same stuff .
We just took over from them .
Was Graner already a part of that ?
There was a three - week ride - a- long where two of our guys would work with two of their guys to get to know the ropes and during those three weeks Graner would tell me how they were doing this and that .
What do you mean by " this and that " ?
Pushing them around , stripping them down , putting them in stress positions , yelling at them .
Why did they choose Graner ?
After all he had a past history of violence .
Graner had a very commanding voice and they wanted him in that tier specifically .
Who do you mean by " they " ?
The people from Military Intelligence .
How did you react when Graner told you how the detainees were being treated ?
Of course it was wrong .
I know that now .
But when you show the people from the CIA , the FBI and the MI the pictures and they say , " Hey , this is a great job .
Keep it up " , you think it must be right .
They were all there and they did n't say a word .
They did n't wear uniforms , and if they did they had their nametags covered .
Which photos did Graner present to them ?
All of them .
He showed them on his laptop .
He 'd say , " Hey , let me show you this , this is what we 're supposed to be doing . "
And they said , " Yeah , we got great results , keep it up , you 're doing a good job . "
He actually got a letter of commendation for the stuff he did .
Where were you when the M.I. guys said , " Keep up the good work " ?
I was there , within earshot , or Graner told me about it .
What did you think when you first saw the detainees wearing women 's underpants or rubbing feces on themselves .
Did you feel sorry for them ?
Well , it was kind of weird at first .
But once I started to see the big picture , I thought , okay , here come these guys , the OGAs , the MIs or even officers , and they do n't even look twice at it .
If they approve , then I 'm not going to say anything .
Who was I to argue ?
These photos made you famous the world over .
Even the Rolling Stones wrote a song about you .
You have become a symbol , the face of this war .
That 's how I read about it in the papers .
People stare at me a lot .
When we talk about the negative things that happened in the war , then Abu Ghraib is one of the first things to come up , and they usually name me by name .
Although I was only in five or six pictures , I am the most famous .
So I suppose I am a symbol of this war .
Unfortunately .
Let 's talk about the photos , especially the one with Gus , the man on the dog - leash .
Why Gus ?
The MPs who escorted him named him Gus because they could n't remember or pronounce his real name .
I know that picture happened first .
It was in late October .
It was like 10 o'clock at night , so I had just gotten off my shift .
It was pretty quiet on the tier and all of a sudden I heard a pounding on the door of the isolation cell below us .
I said , " What the hell is that ? " and Graner said , " We have this crazy guy in there who keeps shouting that he wants to kill Americans . "
Gus had been in the cell for four hours already and it was time to bring him out .
So Graner said , " You gotta back me up , right ?
He already had his camera .
He always carried his camera with him .
Megan Ambuhl and I went down with him .
Graner opened the door and Gus is lying on the floor .
Graner put the tie - down strap around his neck and said , " Come out of the cell . "
Gus was crawling on all fours and then Graner asked one of us to hold the end of the strap because he wanted to document the method of extraction from the cell .
So I took the strap and he took three pictures .
Can you understand that people who look at this photo are offended ?
Well , they were n't there .
And they do n't know what went on and they do n't know how we felt at the time , in that environment and what we were told to do .
But do you understand the outrage ?
To be honest , even if I was n't there , I might think , " Yeah , what the hell was going on here ?
What are they doing to him ? "
But then I 'd realize where it was .
And then I 'd think , " Oh , well , that 's like standard procedure there . "
Did you feel sorry for Gus ?
At the time , I did n't .
No .
He was mentally ill .
Well , now they said that he was .
But at the time it was never mentioned .
The only English he ever spoke was , " I hate you .
I want to kill you . "
So I never really felt sorry for him .
Do you feel sorry looking back now ?
To be honest , the whole time I never really felt guilty because I was following orders and I was doing what I was supposed to do .
So I 've never felt guilty about doing anything that I did there .
Guilt is one thing but feeling sorry is something else .
( Long silence ) Like I said , what he was saying to us , and when he was thrashing out at us , I did n't even feel sorry for him at the time .
And he 's probably out there killing Americans now .
Let us talk about the other pictures , like the infamous pyramid of humans .
None of us knew what Graner was doing .
He said he was stacking the men up to control them because it was seven of them in an enclosed area .
Once he had got them into that position , somebody said , " That looks odd " and that they wanted a picture .
And Graner took pictures too .
Nearly everybody took pictures .
What 's the sense in making a pyramid out of prisoners ?
It has nothing to do with controlling them .
It does n't make sense .
At the time I thought , I love this man , I trust this man with my life , okay , then he 's saying , well , there 's seven of them and it's such an enclosed area and it'll keep them together and contained because they have to concentrate on staying up on the pyramid instead of doing something to us .
You are seen smiling in the picture .
What was so funny ?
Sabrina Harmon took the picture and she said , " Hey , smile for the camera " .
So we did .
It was a kind of the moment thing .
Have you never felt regret about smiling at a stack of naked Iraqis next to you ?
I never really thought about it .
Do you feel ashamed looking back now ?
( Long silence ) .
Can you understand that it 's demeaning for Muslim men to be naked in front of a female American soldier ?
That was n't part of the reason of why it was done .
It was done to search them and to get them into a jumpsuit .
And why were the detainees forced to masturbate in front of you ?
Well , that happened right after .
They were standing and kneeling in front of the wall .
They still had sandbags on their heads and by this time most of the guards had gone .
Frederick and me stayed downstairs to watch them .
Freddie went up to the guy on the end and tried to get him to start by touching his arm and moving it back and forth .
And when he did n't really catch on to what he meant he took his sandbag off and motioned to him what he wanted him to do and then he put the sandbag back on .
And so he started doing it .
You can't even say the word " masturbate " .
( remains silent )
You stood next to him and allowed it to happen .
Did you not protest just once ?
I did .
I asked Frederick , " Why are you doing this ? "
And he told me , " I just want to see if he 'll do it . "
So I was like , " Whatever . "
No more ?
No .
I was like , " Fine , you know , whatever . "
Then Graner and Frederick tried to convince me to get into the picture with this guy .
I did n't want to , but they were really persistent about it .
At the time I did n't think that it was something that needed to be documented but I followed Graner .
I did everything he wanted me to do .
I did n't want to lose him .
Would you say that what happened at Abu Ghraib was torture ?
( Long silence and then she grins . )
Is a smile your answer to that ?
Torture ?
Would I say that what happened there was torture ?
Hm ?
To the Iraqis ?
Definitely , being naked .
That was n't only torture it was humiliating .
Then having me , a female , point at them , that was double humiliating .
I would n't say that when we had them running up and down the tier , crawling and just wearing themselves out , that that was torture .
It was just to get their mind - set prepped for interrogation .
To get them exhausted .
Who told you to soften the prisoners up for interrogation ?
The OGA and MI - guys ...
... the Other Government Agencies , meaning CIA and FBI ...
Do n't ask me their names because I do n't know .
They always spoke to Graner directly .
And what was the term they used ?
" Soften ‘ em up . "
" We 're trying to get information out of this guy and he has n't been cooperating for so many days . "
So they would give us instructions on sleep deprivation , on what we could feed them , and if they wanted them to be naked , we would be told to take their mattress and blankets away so they 're sleeping on the cold floor .
After the end of October it gets pretty damned cold .
Did you do any water boarding ?
No , I did n't .
And I did n't witness it .
But that does n't mean it was n't done .
Because a lot of the time the interrogators would take the prisoners into the showers and close the doors and we would have to put like sheets or blankets up over the windows .
We could hear what was going on but we could n't see .
You heard screams ?
Yeah .
Sometimes .
At the time , were you aware of people being killed while at Abu Ghraib ?
One of them was the guy they called " The Iceman " .
Yeah , I heard about it .
Actually , I was there the night the Iceman was killed .
I went to Tier One and someone said this guy had been taken to the showers and they had the water running , and you could hear this guy just screaming bloody murder .
It got to the point where it was so loud and unbearable that I went back to my room .
And the next day when I came back there was this puddle of water outside the shower .
And I asked , " What 's that from ? "
And they said , " Oh , its ice from keeping the body till they could transport him . "
The Iceman was one of the " Ghost Detainees " that officially never existed .
And who took care of him ?
The Other Government Agencies .
CIA and FBI .
Did they kill the Iceman ?
I wo n't respond to that .
The torturers and the politicians who are responsible for their actions are getting away with it .
Does that make you angry ?
Yeah , I think they used us because the unit that was there before us , the 72nd MP Company , was pretty much doing the same things we were .
Only they were n't documenting it .
I 'm pretty sure that it was the same at other prisons .
Only there are no pictures .
Why did the people from the intelligence units allow photos to be taken ?
I do n't know .
They never said , " Hey , you 're not supposed to be taking pictures . "
I never heard them say that at all .
They never even said , " Do n't get caught . "
Everybody knew what was going on .
Once they heard there were pictures , they wanted to see .
Graner started making copies on floppy disks or memory sticks .
And he did n't even want money from them .
So they took it and they showed it to their buddies and their buddies wanted a copy and so on and so on .
And the hearsay around was that it was okay .
It was approved by MI and the OGA .
And then a sergeant named Joe Darby brought the whole scandal to light .
Darby had those pictures at the beginning of November .
Later on , somebody - it was probably Graner - pissed him off about something and he was like , " Okay , I 'm gonna get back at him . "
So he turned those pictures into the CIA and became a whistleblower .
He was with our unit for years .
He was our buddy .
And then he turned his back on us .
He betrayed us .
You just mentioned the word " scandal " .
Do you regard what happened at Abu Ghraib as a scandal or just something that happens in war ?
I 'm saying that what we did happens in war .
It just is n't documented .
If it had been broken by the news without the pictures it would n't have been that big .
You apologized for it during your trial .
You said that your actions probably led to the death of many GIs afterwards .
Yes .
I received letters that accused me of being responsible for their deaths because the insurgents wanted to take revenge by attacking Americans .
I can't say for sure I killed thousands of people .
I can say I killed all these people , but I did n't kill them directly .
Thousands of Americans ?
Both .
I guess after the picture came out the insurgency picked up and Iraqis attacked the Americans and the British and they attacked in return and they were just killing each other .
I felt bad about it , ... no , I felt pissed off .
If the media had n't exposed the pictures to that extent then thousands of lives would have been saved .
How can you blame the media ?
If you had n't committed the crimes in the first place , we would have no reason to report on it .
The government had the pictures in December but they did n't come out till the end of April .
But you took the photos .
Yeah , I took the photos but I did n't make it worldwide .
Yes , I was in five or six pictures and I took some pictures , and those pictures were shameful and degrading to the Iraqis and to our government .
And I feel sorry and wrong about what I did .
But it would not have escalated to what it did all over the world if it would n't have been for someone leaking it to the media .
Hell , I was at Fort Bragg when the pictures came out and I had no idea .
Can you tell us about the day you heard the pictures had been made public ?
The pictures came out on a Thursday , April 27 or 28 .
I called my Mom on Saturday .
I was pregnant at the time , I did n't have a car , I did n't get the newspaper , I did n't have a TV , I did n't have a radio .
I called my Mom from a payphone and she said , " There 's a hundred reporters out in the front yard .
You 're all over the news , your face is in the papers , on CNN . "
I just said , " What are you talking about ? " I did n't believe it .
She started talking about the pictures and describing them .
And I 'm like , " Oh shit , how did they get out ? "
Were you scared when you realized the pictures were out there ?
I did n't really believe it .
It was kind of like I was still in shock .
I was like " No , me ? "
But you knew at that stage that the investigation had been underway since January ?
Yeah , but I did n't know it was so public with America , or even the world .
So I went to this buddy I knew in the barracks , and I looked it up on the Internet and thought , " Oh my God . " I could n't believe it .
And then I started getting paranoid .
I was really getting scared at that point and thinking somebody 's gonna beat the shit out of me .
And I was only three months pregnant and I was n't showing so they could beat the hell out of me and I could have lost the baby .
I was pretty much alone , and I was scared .
I could n't trust anybody .
It was crazy .
Did you feel ashamed when you saw the pictures in public for the first time ?
At the chow hall they had these two huge big - screen - TVs so you could watch while you were eating .
I was sitting there eating and there was this big TV in front of me and they started showing the pictures of me , and everybody in the room turned and looked at me .
So I left and went back to my room .
So you did feel shame ?
I was scared , I thought " Man , I 'm gonna get the shit kicked out of me . "
Any shame , any guilt ?
Yeah , I thought , " These people are gonna think I 'm horrible and , you know , I am horrible for doing this and getting into that . "
But somewhere in my mind I was thinking , you know they do n't really understand the whole story .
Mrs. England , we 've listened to you for hours .
And the whole time we 've been asking ourselves :
Where is your feeling of regret ?
Looking back on it , if I could change it I would .
I would have never met Graner , I never would have gone over there , I would have stayed in my little work area in Abu Ghraib , did what I had to do .
How did your relationship with Graner end ?
We were in Camp Victory at Baghdad International Airport .
It was February 5 and the investigation was already underway .
About that time , he finally decided it was time to break off the relationship .
He said , " It 's over .
We do n't even have to talk about it . "
He had said that he was going to marry me .
We were going to have kids .
I was just so pissed off with him .
You were pregnant .
Yes , but I did n't know it .
Did you know that he was having an affair with Megan Ambuhl , one of the other accused soldiers , at the same time ?
I only found that out at his trial .
Megan and I were friends at the time .
He married her later on .
Does your son Carter remind you of Graner ?
Yes , I try not to think about it but it gets harder the older he gets .
The more he grows , the more he looks like him .
What will you tell Carter about his parents and Abu Ghraib ?
I do n't know .
I 'm trying to get together a scrapbook right now .
My Mom kept every single article .
And I 'll probably cut them out and put them in a scrapbook and let him look at that .
I still do n't know what I 'm going to tell him about his father .
I guess the truth .
The former Secretary of Defense , Donald Rumsfeld , called you and your colleagues the " rotten apples " of the military .
Bush claimed to be ashamed of what you did .
Well , back then I thought :
How can they say that when it was happening all over Iraq .
The same thing is happening in Guantanamo now and other places .
We knew that our officers knew about it and our sergeants .
We thought if they know then somebody else knows .
And I really do still think that Rumsfeld knew what was going on .
I mean he had been there while I was there at that prison .
And if he was there I know he knew what was going on .
How could he have not known ?
And Bush ?
He 's the headman .
Do you feel more like a victim or an offender ?
I feel more like a puppet .
First I was played by Graner .
Then the media portrayed me as their puppet so they could flash my picture out over and over and over and over again .
And then I became the government 's puppet because they did n't back me up , or remotely take my side .
They just agreed with what the media said .
Saying you were a puppet again makes you sound like a victim .
Okay , I do take responsibility .
I was dumb enough to do all that .
And to think that it was okay because of the other officers and the orders that were coming down .
But when you 're in the military you automatically do what they say .
It 's always , " Yes Sir , No Sir . "
You do n't question it .
And now they 're saying , " Well , you should have questioned it . "
There is talk about new pictures that are even harsher than the ones we know .
I know there were some harsher pictures they had at the time of the trial that the media decided not to expose .
What was on those pictures ?
You see the dogs biting the prisoners .
Or you see bite marks from the dogs .
You can see MPs holding down a prisoner so a medic can give him a shot .
If those had been made public at the time , then the whole world would have looked at those and not at mine .
Was Abu Ghraib the turning point of the war ?
I actually thought about that before the pictures came out .
I thought , " I hope this never comes out because it 'll change the way people see the war .
And the way people see America . "
And it did , it changed everything .
I felt bad about that .
I felt sorry .
And I still do .
Did you think three years was the correct punishment for your crime ?
No .
It 's ridiculous .
It was much too long .
If you look at my charge sheet , I was only charged and convicted for posing in pictures .
Not for physically abusing prisoners .
How were you treated in prison ?
Literally , it was like flies on shit , man .
When I got there , they were all like , " Oh my God . "
They loved me .
I was like a celebrity .
How do you live with the burden today ?
I do n't know .
I try to look forward and not to think about it anymore .
If I think about it , then I get down ; I get feeling sorry and pissed off .
Do the pictures still haunt you ?
Hell , I 'm seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist .
I'm on antidepressants and meds for anxiety .
If it was n't for that I 'd probably lose my mind .
I just get freaked out .
I 'm paranoid as hell at people .
So it 's getting worse over time ?
According to the psychiatrist , yes .
I 'm going to blame it on my Mom because right now she is flipping out over little shit , and I do n't know why .
She tells me almost every day how she had to put up with my son for a year and a half because of what I did to get myself in trouble when I was n't there for him and I was in prison .
But you still live with your parents .
I want to get a house of my own but at the same time I 'm scared to do that because what if somebody finds out where I live and they 're against me and they try to do some shit .
I can't protect Carter .
It sounds as if you are a prisoner .
A prisoner of yourself and your own actions ?
Now it 's like I have to think about everything I do before I do it .
What plans do you have for the future ?
What are your hopes and dreams ?
Living a normal life .
Not having to worry about looking over my shoulder every day , about thinking ten years down the road somebody 's going to recognize me and come shoot me because of something I did when I was young and stupid and in love .
I 'm scared to death because Carter starts school this fall .
What if somebody does n't like me , and kidnaps him because of what I did .
Have you ever thought about going away to some place where people do n't know you ?
I can't go anywhere because everyone recognizes me .
You 've let your hair grow .
But everybody recognizes my face and my voice .
I even dyed my hair , but even then people still recognized me .
They even recognize me when I 'm wearing sunglasses and a hat .
So that 's why you stay here in West Virginia ?
Well I know more people support me here than are against me .
It 's that one crazy one that you do n't know that finds out where you live and comes after you .

Snubbed in Fox debate , Paul says network has ' lost all credibility ' David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Monday January 7 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Still smarting after being excluded from Sunday night 's GOP debate broadcast on Fox News , Republican presidential hopeful Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) on Monday slammed the network as having " lost all credibility . "
Appearing on CNN's American Morning program , the internet fundraising phenom said voters had been cheated by Fox 's debate protocol , which required participating candidates to notch at least 10 percent support in national polling .
" I think this is an awful embarrassment for Fox to do something like this , " said Paul .
" We got 10 percent in Iowa , raised more money than any other candidate in the Republican side in the last quarter , and our polls in New Hampshire are much better than Giuliani . "
The latest polling out of New Hampshire shows Paul actually running slightly behind Republican rival Rudy Giuliani , with 6 to 11 percent support .
But the candidate does appear to be fairing better than former Sen. Fred Thompson ( R - TN ) , who despite low single - digit support in New Hampshire was invited to participate in the Fox debate .
" All of a sudden they say I do n't qualify to be in the debate ? " asked Paul .
" They 're making a mockery of the whole situation and I think they 're going to suffer for it , quite frankly , because they 've lost all credibility . "
The New Hampshire Republican party axed its partnership with Fox prior to the event , citing the network 's exclusion of " lesser - known , lesser - funded underdogs . "
" They never talked to us , " said Paul of Fox News .
" We even had Fox affiliates around the country calling them .
They would n't talk to them ... the New Hampshire Republican Party used good sense and they got out of it .
They did n't co-sponsor the event .
They knew it was a sham , and it did n't represent what New Hampshire stands for . "

There is this weird man who goes to a noodle shop and orders noodle soup .
He asks for exactly 100 noodles in his soup .
Once his noodle - soup arrives , he gets to work .
He extracts two noodle ends from under the soup , ties a knot , and lets it slip into the soup again .
He does the above 100 times - so that now all the noodle ends are tied .
Now he reaches his hand into the soup .
What is the probability that he would extract a garland containing all the 100 noodles ?

A pack of cards has 52 cards .
You are in a dark room with this pack of cards .
You have been told that inside the pack there are 42 cards facing down , 10 cards facing up .
You have been asked to reorganize this pack of cards into two decks - so that each deck contains an equal number of cards that face up .
Remember , you are in the darkness and can't see .
How will you do it ?
Hint :
The two decks need not contain an equal number of cards .

A Boeing 737-100 has exactly 100 seats for passengers .
A 100 passengers are waiting in a line outside this aircraft , their boarding cards in their hands .
Now the first passenger gets onto the plane .
He drops his boarding card on purpose and chooses a seat at random .
When the second passenger comes in , if he sees that his seat is occupied , he chooses another seat at random .
If his seat is not occupied , he takes his own seat .
Like this , one by one , 99 passengers board the plane .
If one finds one 's seat occupied , he chooses a seat at random .
Finally , the 100th passenger enters the plane .
There is only one seat left in the plane - he has to take it .
What is the probability that he gets the seat assigned to him on his boarding card ?

There is an evil king .
And like all evil characters in James Bond movies , this evil king likes making extremely devious plots - but unfortunately they are all ridden with loopholes .
... Just like in James Bond .
So anyway , let us come to the point .
The king has 20 political prisoners .
He wants to kill all of them .
One night he goes to the prison and tells them that the next morning he is going to make them stand in line and place hats on their heads .
White or black hats .
They will not be able to see their own hats - but of course , they will be able to see all hats of people in front of them .
They will have to guess ( in any order - front to back , back to front - as they wish ) the color of their own hats .
Those who are correct will be pardoned and set free .
Those who make a mistake - die .
That night the prisoners discuss a strategy among themselves .
The next morning during the hat trial , only one of them becomes a martyr .
The remaining 19 are pardoned - as promised by the king - since they could guess their hat 's color correctly .
What strategy did they adopt ?
What was the great loophole in the king 's evil plot ?
Np gave me this puzzle over the phone
This is ancient lore - from the time Empire State Building was being built .
They had raised the structure successfully , had made all the floors , had built the elevator shaft .
They had laid cable inside the elevator shaft .
However , just before installing the elevator , they found out the blunder - the cables were not color coded .
They contracted this one electrician and asked him to color code all the wires .
There was a set of N=25 wires running from the top of Empire State Building to the bottom through a cable sheath .
The electrician can assume that the wires are all insulated , and the cable sheath is conductive ( although this is not necessary for a solution ) .
The only equipment that the electrician has is a continuity meter .
He knows how to connect and disconnect wires and how to use the continuity meter .
How will the electrician color code all the cables ?
Needless to say , the electrician has to do it in as few climbing - ups and climbing - downs as he can , and as few connections - disconnections ( although , this does not carry as much weight ) as possible .
A continuity meter is a voltage source in series with a light bulb .
If both ends of a continuous wire are connected to the two ends of the continuity meter , the bulb switches on .
If the wire is not continuous , the bulb remains off .
Once you have a solution , extend it to arbitrary N. ( both , N odd , N even . )
Professor Tsividis gave this problem in one of our lab group meetings .
Given two points , without using any ruler or scale , using only a compass , you have to construct the remaining two points of a square , so that the given two points form the vertices of a side of the square .
Professor Tsividis gave this problem in one more of our lab group meetings .
There is this job for which there are three applicants - there is only one vacancy .
The job requires the person to be very intelligent .
Somehow all three applicants went through all the sieves equally well .
Finally the interviewer devised this ingenious test :
He made all three of them sit together in a room .
Four hats were brought in the room - three were black and one was yellow .
The applicants were blind - folded and then one of the hats was kept aside while the remaining three hats were placed on the heads of the applicants .
If the blind folds are opened the applicants would not be able to see their own hats , but they would be able to see the hats on others .
Three assistants now stood ready to open the blindfolds .
The firt person who would be able to say what the colour of his hat was would get the job .
At this juncture , before the blinds were opened , one of the participants raised his hand and said that his hat was coloured ...
What was the colour of his hat , and how did he deduce that ?
This was borrowed from Car Talk on WNYC !
This brain teaser is the one I love the most :
There are these five robbers - let 's call them A , B , C , D and E .
They rob a bank of 1 million $s .
Now they want to divide the money among themselves .
They come up with this brilliant plan of division of money :
First robber A will suggest a method of division of money .
All the robbers , including A , will vote on this .
If there is an absolute majority for A , the method as suggested will be followed .
If A loses in the vote , he will be killed and the money will be divided among B , C , D and E with B suggesting a method of division of money .
The same procedure will follow .
Note that B needs a vote division of 3 - 1 for him to get an absolute majority .
The robbers are all intelligent and have a strict sense of priority in making their decisions .
The following are what they want to achieve , in strict sense of priority : Life
As much money as possible Kill as many other robbers as possible Now it is A 's turn to suggest a method of division of money .
What will he suggest ?
( Assume that the smallest unit of money is $ 1 . )
Hint : try out the two robber case first , then go up to three robbers - extend to five robbers .
I first got this problem from a mail sent by Satish Verma .
This is another classic :
There is this small island where the people are all very very intelligent , and very very patriotic .
However , they cannot speak , read or write .
The only mode of communication they have is by looking at each other .
They understand English when it is spoken .
This doctor reaches this island and observes that several islanders have a terrible disease which is very contagious .
The only escape from the disease is through death .
The doctor calls all the islanders together at their community center and tells them about this .
Unfortunately one who has the disease will not know that he has the disease .
However others will be able to recognise him as being infected .
The doctor tells them that to save the race , all those who have the disease have to commit suicide .
The doctor suggests that the islanders meet every day at 7 am in the morning at their community center and look at each other .
After 10 days all those who had the disease committed suicide on the same day .
How many islanders had the disease and how did they find out ?
I was first asked this problem as a youngster by Rajada .
A cheeky problem :
There is one bulb inside a room but three switches outside the room .
Only one of these switches operates the bulb .
There is no way to see the state of the bulb from outside the room .
You have to fiddle with the switches , enter the room once and only once , and have to be able to tell which switch operated the bulb .
What will you do ?
If you have answered the first question , extend the problem to four switches .
Ajith Kamath first asked me this when I was in IITM .

There are two possible solutions .
Try to find out both of them .
Shyam asked me this before an Asha meeting .
The report , to which Bloomberg Philanthropies contributed $ 2 million , is the first to compile global data on how many smokers or tobacco chewers each country has , how much they pay in tobacco taxes , and how antismoking efforts are faring .
Among its conclusions : poor and middle - income countries collect 5,000 times as much in tax revenue from tobacco as they spend in fighting its use .
Only 5 percent of the world has no-smoking laws like those in New York City .
Uruguay does more than any other country to reduce smoking .
Mayor Bloomberg , who is well known for his antipathy to smoking , said in presenting the report that it would be re-issued annually and would grade countries .
“ The United States would get a C or D , ” he said , New York , an A or a B .
His statement puts him at odds with W.H.O .
The agency has traditionally been cautious about offending members , and in interviews , officials from its Tobacco Free Initiative specifically said countries would not be graded .
Perhaps the oddest aspect was that the report itself was presented as if it were a campaign for menthol cigarettes , full of pictures of happy children and mottos like “ fresh and alive . ”
It even came with what appeared to be a pack of Mpower - brand cigarettes , with a cheerful blue bubbles logo and a mock warning on the box  which actually contained a pad and pens .

“ My generation does n't know how to be thrifty , ” writes Eve Conant in the current issue of Newsweek .
She describes how her grandfather — who fled his native Ukraine during World War II — would store plastic bags filled with leftover bread crusts in the closet of his new home in California , a house he bought with $ 13,000 cash .
“ He could n't shake old habits , ” Conant writes .
“ Or were they old virtues ? ”
Now , many decades after Arkady 's arrival , I also have plastic bags in my closet .
But they 're filled with nice clothes I 'm giving away because my wardrobe is too full .
The biggest life issue facing me when I open my closet door is whether to put on an Ann Taylor jacket or a Gap sweater .
As talk of recession and belt - tightening makes headlines , I wonder where and how I lost my grandfather 's sense of thrift .
These sentiments are n't exactly new .
For decades — centuries , even — people have complained that younger generations have n't inherited the financial wisdom of their elders .
During the 1750s , Benjamin Franklin bemoaned the lack of money skills among the American colonists .
But these warnings took on greater urgency with the dawn of the age of easy credit .
In the introduction to Ain't We Got Fun ? , Barbara Solomon writes :
Prior to the 1920s the public had held generally negative attitudes toward credit purchasing .
Young people were warned against burdening themselves with a lifetime of debt and were made fearful of losing their possessions should they fail to make payments on time .
In the Twenties all that was turned around .
Advertisers promised an acquisitive public that it needed no money down and could get liberal terms .
Millions of ready buyers were convinced that there was no need to deprive themselves of the magnificent new appliances and machines of this age of progress .
In 1927 six billion dollars ' worth of goods ( about 15 percent of all sales ) were bought on installment plans .
And the factories kept on producing more merchandise .
The general sense of prosperity , coupled with the disillusionment of wartime idealism , became the basis of a new theme that dominated the age .
The mass of Americans believed that they had an inalienable right to the good life and particularly to “ a good time ” .
And a good time they determined to have .
Never before had a generation set out to be so self - consciously different from their forebears .
What had been one of American history 's recurring motifs now became a primary theme .
Attitudes toward money , debt , and credit actually did begin to change .
During the next several decades , the use of credit lost its stigma ; it became an accepted — even celebrated — way of life .
In Conant 's Newsweek article ( which I recommend highly ) , the author worries that this lifestyle of debt has made her generation ill - equipped to handle financial hardship .
“ How often do the words ‘ frugal ' or ‘ thrifty ' come up in conversation , especially as a compliment ? ” she wonders .
From her story :
“ People in their 30s have n't really experienced a significant or long recessionary period , ” says consumer behaviorist Larry Compeau of Clarkson University .
“ I am concerned that they wo n't be able to respond quickly enough to mitigate what may be the damage ahead .
Not only do people under 40 save less , but they have less to save . “
My worry is not that we 're saving less , it 's that we 're no longer saving at all .
The personal saving rate in the United States has been declining for years .
In the 1970s and early 1980s , it frequently climbed above ten percent .
More recently , it has hovered around zero .
But the general trend is downward .
Americans are not saving .
The personal saving rate began to drop in the mid-1980s .
A 2002 publication [ PDF ] from the Federal Reserve Board of San Francisco notes three possible causes :
The “ wealth effect ” :
When people become richer ( or perceive themselves to become richer ) , they spend more .
Americans have become more productive and are , in general , earning higher wages .
If they believe these increased incomes are likely to continue , they 're willing to spend more because they believe they 'll have money in the future .
Easy access to credit .
Though the first major credit card was created in 1958 , and use grew in the sixties and seventies , credit cards did n't play a prominent role in American life until the 1980s .
Though the Federal Reserve Board believes consumer credit plays some part in the low saving rate , it is n't considered a primary factor .
I 'm not convinced .
The total level of consumer credit outstanding has waxed even as the saving rate has waned .
I realize that correlation does not imply causation , but I 'd love to see more information about how the following graph relates to the first :
From what I understand , this does not include debt secured by real estate .
What does all this mean ?
Does it matter to you and me ?
Is the subprime debacle related to personal saving at all ?
Could the stock market collapse ?
Will the credit industry implode ?
And what happens if the worst comes to pass ?
I do n't know .
The financial picture seems bleak .
Even the most optimistic believe we 're in for a couple years of rough times financially .
The pessimistic are whispering we could be heading for an economic collapse to rival the Great Depression .
In either case , prudence would indicate that it 's time to buckle down .
For myself , I will continue following the tenets of the “ get rich slowly ” philosophy .
I 'm going to stick to the basics .
I 've shed my non-mortgage debt , and I do n't intend to take on any more .
I will continue to save .
I 'll stick with the frugality that has served me well over the past three years .
I will live below my means .
If my friends ask my advice , I 'll recommend that they do the same .
Now is not the time for $ 2,500 plasma televisions .
Nor is it yet time to store bread in the closet .
But it is time to stop spending and to begin saving .
Just like our grandparents did .
Note : Please see the comments for some important clarifications of these economic notions .
For example , real - life economist JerichoHill writes : “ The Personal Saving Rate is a very poor metric .
Most folks save via IRA and 401K .
So we should look at that savings rate , which is the National Saving Rate .
The NSR shows the same disturbing downward trend , but is the more proper metric to use , in my opinion . ”
This does n't change my primary point — that a return to frugality and thrift is the best way to cope with financial hard times .
Saturn 's moon Titan is the second largest in the solar system -- and the only one with a dense atmosphere .
The atmosphere , nitrogen and methane , resembles that of the early Earth .
NASA 's Cassini spacecraft peered through the atmosphere , imaged the haze layers -- and ESA 's Huygens probe landed on the surface .
UCL - built equipment on the orbiter detects an unexpected component in Titan 's high atmosphere -- extremely heavy hydrocarbon - based negative ions .
Their mass is at least 10,000 times that of a hydrogen atom , detected at 953 km above the surface ; about the distance from London to Milan .
The image shows Titan 's haze and the heavy ions .
These are part of the haze in the atmosphere , and may fall towards Titan 's surface as organic gunk .
They are Carl Sagan 's tholins ; a brown residue appearing in the Miller - Urey experiment , where a spark excites a mixture of gases resembling that of Earth 's early atmosphere .
The right hand side of the image shows the negative ion signature at 4 different encounters , including T16 where we see the 10,000 amu ions .
The vertical stripes show the ions seen as the instrument is scanned through Cassini 's direction of travel and increasing numbers of ions are seen as they ram into our sensor .

Scientists analysing data gathered by the Cassini spacecraft have confirmed the presence of heavy negative ions in the upper regions of Titan ’s atmosphere .
These particles may act as organic building blocks for even more complicated molecules and their discovery was completely unexpected because of the chemical composition of the atmosphere ( which lacks oxygen and mainly consists of nitrogen and methane ) .
The observation has now been verified on 16 different encounters and findings will be published in Geophysical Research Letters on November 28 .
Professor Andrew Coates , researcher at UCL ’s Mullard Space Science Laboratory and lead author of the paper , says : “ Cassini ’s electron spectrometer has enabled us to detect negative ions which have 10,000 times the mass of hydrogen .
Additional rings of carbon can build up on these ions , forming molecules called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , which may act as a basis for the earliest forms of life .
“ Their existence poses questions about the processes involved in atmospheric chemistry and aerosol formation and we now think it most likely that these negative ions form in the upper atmosphere before moving closer to the surface , where they probably form the mist which shrouds the planet and which has hidden its secrets from us in the past .
It was this mist which stopped the Voyager mission from examining Titan more closely in 1980 and was one of the reasons that Cassini was launched . ”
The new paper builds on work published in Science ( May 11 ) where the team found smaller tholins , up to 8,000 times the mass of hydrogen , forming away from the surface of Titan .
Dr Hunter Waite of the South West Research Institute in Texas and author of the earlier study , said : “ Tholins are very large , complex , organic molecules thought to include chemical precursors to life .
Understanding how they form could provide valuable insight into the origin of life in the solar system . "

Ethiopian Police Say They Have Foiled Terrorist Plot
Police in Ethiopia say they have prevented a rebel group called the Oromo Liberation Front from carrying out a plan to bomb public buildings and assassinate officials in the Ethiopian city of Nazareth .
VOA Correspondent Alisha Ryu in our East Africa Bureau in Nairobi reports Ethiopia 's government in Addis Ababa also accuses neighboring Eritrea of sponsoring the alleged plot .
The state - run Ethiopian News Agency reports that members of the national police anti-terrorism task force have detained a number of people they believe had responsibility for coordinating and carrying out the plot .
The news agency says police confiscated nine explosive devices , 12 fuses , and an AK - 47 assault rifle during the arrests .
It is not clear how many people have been arrested or where they were caught .
But the Ethiopian police say they are certain that members of the Oromo Liberation Front were planning to bomb infrastructure and public buildings in Nazareth , 76 kilometers southeast of the capital , Addis Ababa .
The rebels reportedly had a second plot to assassinate prominent officials , including the head of a local university .
Nazareth , called Adama by the ethnic Oromo people , sits in the middle of a 600,000 - square - kilometer area the rebels call Oromia .
Since 1973 , rebels have fought the Ethiopian government for Oromia 's autonomy .
They accuse Addis Ababa of marginalizing and exploiting the Oromo people .
VOA was unable to reach the Oromo Liberation Front for comment on the terror allegations .
But the rebels say the Ethiopian government has fabricated stories in the past about the rebel movement and its activities .
Earlier this month , the Oromo Liberation Front vehemently denied a report by Ethiopia 's Defense Ministry its fighters were captured in the Ogaden region , where another Ethiopian rebel group , the Ogaden National Liberation Front , is fighting for autonomy .
The Oromo Liberation Front also denied government accusations it has ties to al - Itihaad , a radical Muslim group the United States considers a terrorist organization .
In a telephone interview with VOA , Eritrea 's senior government spokesman , Yemane Gebremeskel , dismissed Addis Ababa 's assertion that the Eritrean government in Asmara recruited rebels to carry out the attacks in Nazareth .
" That is absolute rubbish and they know it .
We know it .
Ethiopia does not want this border problem to be solved , " said Gebremeskel .
" So , it is trying to associate Eritrea with acts of terrorism or other violations because they want to circumvent the critical issue of what is creating tension in this region .
They want to deflect that tension . "
From 1998 to 2000 , Ethiopia and Eritrea fought an unresolved border war that killed more than 70,000 people and displaced more than 100,000 others .
The United Nations has warned that the border stalemate threatens regional security .
MITROVICA , Kosovo 
A day after Kosovo ’s ethnic Albanian leadership declared independence from Serbia , 7,000 Serbs took to the streets of this divided city , waving Serbian flags , chanting “ Kosovo is Serbia ! ” and burning an American flag covered with the words “ The Fourth Reich . ”
A small clutch of radicals stood at the bridge leading to the Albanian side of the city shouting , “ Kick , shout , kill the Albanians ! ”
Old men and women wept , some expressing disbelief that Kosovo was no longer theirs .
A NATO military helicopter hovered overhead .
Armed police officers formed a human shield to keep the protesters from trying to cross to the other side of the bridge , where crowds of Albanians looked on defiantly .
Mitrovica is divided between Albanians , who live south of the Ibar River , and Serbs , who live to the north .
The city has long been a flashpoint for violence in Kosovo , a territory of two million people , where a Serb minority of 125,000 people ekes out an existence in isolated enclaves surrounded by Albanians , who make up 95 percent of Kosovo ’s population .
An explosion went off Monday night in the northern part of Mitrovica , near the building where the United Nations police and mediation offices are situated , Agence France - Presse reported .
The police said that there were no injuries and that damage was confined to a few shattered car windows .

We will shortly consider making right the things that are wrong with the so - called Protect America Act , a second - rate piece of legislation passed in a stampede in August at the behest of the Bush Administration .
It is worth for a moment considering why making this right is so important .
President Bush pressed this legislation not only to establish how our government can spy on foreign agents , but how his administration can spy on Americans .
Make no mistake , the legislation we passed in August is significantly about spying on Americans – a business this administration should not be allowed to get into except under the closest supervision .
We have a plain and tested device for keeping tabs on the government when it ’s keeping tabs on Americans .
It is our Constitution .
Our Constitution has as its most elemental provision the separation of governmental powers into three separate branches .
When the government feels it necessary to spy on its own citizens , each branch has a role .
The executive branch executes the laws , and conducts surveillance .
The legislative branch sets the boundaries that protect Americans from improper government surveillance .
The judicial branch oversees whether the government has followed the Constitution and the laws that protect U.S. citizens from violations of their privacy and their civil rights .
It sounds basic , but even an elementary understanding of this balance of powers eludes the Bush administration .
So now we have to repair this flawed and shoddy “ Protect America Act . ”
Why are we in Congress so concerned about this ?
Why is it so vital that we energetically assert the role of Congress and the Courts when the Bush Administration seeks to spy on Americans ?
Because look what the Bush Administration does behind our backs when they think no one is looking .
For years under the Bush Administration , the Office of Legal Counsel within the Department of Justice has issued highly classified secret legal opinions related to surveillance .
This is an administration that hates answering to an American court , that wants to grade its own papers , and OLC is the inside place the administration goes to get legal support for its spying program .
As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee , I was given access to those opinions , and spent hours poring over them .
Sitting in that secure room , as a lawyer , as a former U.S. Attorney , legal counsel to Rhode Island ’s Governor , and State Attorney General , I was increasingly dismayed and amazed as I read on .
To give you an example of what I read , I have gotten three legal propositions from these OLC opinions declassified .
Here they are , as accurately as my note taking could reproduce them from the classified documents .
Listen for yourself .
I will read all three , and then discuss each one .
1 . An executive order cannot limit a President .
There is no constitutional requirement for a President to issue a new executive order whenever he wishes to depart from the terms of a previous executive order .
Rather than violate an executive order , the President has instead modified or waived it .
2 . The President , exercising his constitutional authority under Article II , can determine whether an action is a lawful exercise of the President ’s authority under Article II .
3 . The Department of Justice is bound by the President ’s legal determinations .
Let ’s start with number one .
Bear in mind that the so - called Protect America
Act that was stampeded through this great body in August provides no – zero – statutory protections for Americans traveling abroad from government wiretapping .
None if you ’re a businesswoman traveling on business overseas , none if you ’re a father taking the kids to the Caribbean , none if you ’re visiting uncles or aunts in Italy or Ireland , none even if you ’re a soldier in the uniform of the United States posted overseas .
The Bush Administration provided in that hastily - passed law no statutory restrictions on their ability to wiretap you at will , to tap your cell phone , your e-mail , whatever .
The only restriction is an executive order called 12333 , which limits executive branch surveillance to Americans who the Attorney General determines to be agents of a foreign power .
That ’s what the executive order says .
But what does this administration say about executive orders ?

Brooke Shields is BACK ( Photos )
, 42 , is very excited about her latest venture on NBC .
The new dramatic comedy , Lipstick Jungle , premiere 's next week .
The plot lines has several modern New York career women supporting each other .
She is also featured on the cover of this week 's Parade magazine , which will appear as a supplement in Sunday papers across the country .
Shields is no stranger to the ways of Hollywood .
She has traveled that road since she was a young child model .
We 've seen her career ebb and flow .
Her first major film role was in the controversial movie Pretty Baby .
The media came down heavily on Shield 's mother for allowing her 12 year old daughter to be involved in child pornography .
In the early 1980 's she had roles in The Blue Lagoon and Endless Love .
She won The People 's Choice Award for Favorite Young Performer in four consecutive years from 1981 - 1984 .
Shields put her career on hold in order to attend Princeton University .
She graduated in 1987 with a degree in French Literature .
The actress had several career stalls along the way .
She cited her 6 foot height as a stumbling block with many leading men being of shorter stature .
She had a two year marriage to tennis star Andre Agassi from 1997 - 1999 which was annulled .
She has been married to television writer Chris Henchy since 2001 .
The couple have two young daughters .
Shields went public after the birth of her first daughter , Rowan , with the fact that she had suffered from postpartum depression .
Tom Cruise attacked the actress during an interview on NBC with Matt Lauer .
Public sentiment went with Shield 's and cast Cruise as the enemy .
Ironically , both couples eventually had babies born on the same day , in the same hospital .
Their young daughters , Suri Cruise and Grier Henchy , are now nearly 2 years old .
Cruise visited Shield 's at her home and apologized for his personal attack on her .
They made peace that day and the two families have become close friends .
Lipstick Jungle premiere's on February 7th at 9:00 pm CST .
We 've gathered some great photos of Shields so check them out .

Sun Microsystems has announced an important update to its ubiquitous Java plugin which allows Java - based web applications to run across all the supported operating systems and browsers .
The new version , labeled Java SE Update N includes several performance improvements , like a kernel online installer which quickly installs a core set of Java interfaces so first time Java users can access the application faster , instead of waiting for the full install .
A new pre-fetching feature keeps parts of Java in memory so Java applets and applications load faster .
Update N also supports hardware acceleration based on Microsoft Direct3D 9 API , and a new patch - based update mechanism for faster updates and that , thankfully , wo n’t add several entries to the Add / Install Programs applet on Windows .
According to the FAQ , Mozilla and Sun have been working closely for this update and it was decided that the new features will not be available for the Firefox 2 branch .
Instead , the necessary work on the Firefox side , has been added for Firefox 3 and is already available in Firefox 3 Beta 3 and later nightlies .
Sun has been releasing Update N betas for a few months now and the final version is expected for mid-year for Firefox 3 on Windows XP , Vista , Solaris and Linux .
Internet Explore 6 and 7 are also supported .
The possibility of generating hydrogen from sea water using sunlight energy is now one step closer , say scientists at Atmos Technologies .
They claim to have successfully developed a completely new , environmentally friendly technique for the production of photo voltaic diodes at a lower cost and with a substantially lower carbon footprint than that created by conventional methods .
They say the hydrogen produced using their technology can be generated economically and efficiently and utilized either in fuel cells or in conventional engines as a replacement for petrol .
Current techniques cost more in energy to generate the hydrogen than what is given out when the hydrogen is used .
Photo voltaic diodes work by using sunlight to generate electrical power , which is applied to two terminals submerged in sea water .
The sea water is separated by the electrical power , generating hydrogen at one terminal and oxygen at the other .
The oxygen can either be collected or released back into the atmosphere .
The hydrogen is collected and stored for use either in fuel cells which can power electric motors or in conventional engines .
Production of the photo voltaic power generating diodes involves a new ' flame spraying ' method as an alternative to conventional silicon based diodes that have been used to - date .
The objective of this new development is to produce photo voltaic power generating diodes , with the same efficiencies as current silicon devices , but at substantially lower costs , both financially and to the environment .
Traditionally , the production of all silicon power generating diodes consumes a total of 150 kilowatt hours of electricity required to manufacture 1 kg of silicon for production into power generating devices .
This means that it takes up to five years before more energy is produced than was used during manufacture , even when operated in tropical regions .
Furthermore , ' clean room ' conditions are always required due to the necessary use of toxic substances , such as phosphorous , arsenic and hydro - fluoric acid .
In contrast , the Atmos power generating diodes are produced by a unique flame spraying method - a more flexible process that uses no toxic chemicals , does not require clean room conditions and does not generate hard to dispose of toxic waste .
Current tests show that Atmos ' flame spraying method uses approximately 1/60th of the energy required to make conventional elements .
This results in a substantial energy saving and a much faster energy payback .
Jeff Boardman , Managing Director at Atmos Technologies said : " Atmos ' non toxic manufacturing process means that it is now demonstrably possible to generate hydrogen from sea water without harming the environment in the process .
In fact , our technique can be considered a virtually pollution - free means of generating hydrogen from seawater using sunlight , providing an ever renewable , non polluting fuel from a free energy source that could be used in fuel cells for petrol engines or to produce electricity for homes . "
Professor Colin Whitehouse , STFC's Director of Knowledge Exchange said : " Atmos Technologies has made a major breakthrough in what stands to benefit both the UK economy and the environment .
The UK has an ever - increasing reputation for commercialising science and this is yet another credible example of what happens when a small , innovative company benefits from access to the advanced skills and facilities such as those provided at the Daresbury Science & Innovation Campus . "
Five years after the invasion of Iraq : A debacle for US imperialism
the editorial board
19 March 2008
Five years after Washington inaugurated its “ shock and awe ” campaign , striking Baghdad with cruise missiles and precision - guided bombs , it has become abundantly clear that the war of aggression against Iraq has produced the greatest geo-political disaster in American history .
The war ’s costs , in terms of both US imperialism ’s global position and sheer dollar amounts , have eclipsed the immense damage wrought by the protracted intervention in Vietnam nearly four decades ago .
It has already lasted longer than the American Civil War , World War I , World War II and the Korean War .
Even in Vietnam , after five years of major troop deployments , the withdrawal of American forces had already begun .
A “ war of choice ” that was launched as a demonstration of the overwhelming and irresistible force of American militarism has turned into an operational debacle that has strained the US armed forces to the breaking point and eroded the strategic position of the United States in every corner of the world .
For the Iraqi people , the war has produced a catastrophe .
For the American people , as well , it has yielded nothing but suffering and tragedy .
It unquestionably constitutes the single greatest war crime of the twenty - first century .
In both its motivation and execution , it embodies the essential characteristics of similar crimes carried out in the last century .
The International Tribunal at Nuremburg that convicted the leaders of the Third Reich summed up its verdict with the following observation : “ War is essentially an evil thing .
Its consequences are not confined to the belligerent states alone , but affect the whole world .
To initiate a war of aggression , therefore , is not only an international crime , it is the supreme international crime , differing from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole . ”
The “ accumulated evil ” wrought by the decision to launch a war of aggression in Iraq continues to unfold .
According to the most credible estimates , it has cost the lives of over 1 million Iraqis , while turning over 4 million more into refugees , driven by violence and destruction either out of their country or into internal exile .
A poll released this week that was conducted for the British Broadcasting Corporation , ABC News in the US and German and Japanese television found that nearly half of the residents of Baghdad said at least one family member had been killed since the occupation began .
The same poll found that over 70 percent of Iraqis want US troops out of their country , a sentiment that has remained steady throughout the occupation , but which is consistently ignored by the US political establishment and the mass media .
The divide - and - rule strategy employed by the US occupiers and Washington ’s attempts to fashion a puppet regime based on ethnic politics created the conditions for a savage sectarian war that claimed untold victims and “ ethnically cleansed ” large sections of Baghdad and other areas where Shia , Sunni and Kurdish Iraqis had previously lived side - by - side .
The destruction of social infrastructure caused by American high explosives five years ago — as well as the previous years of punishing sanctions — has only been exacerbated by the disintegration that has unfolded under US military occupation .
Essential infrastructure remains devastated , with the population deprived of electricity , fuel , clean water , sanitary facilities and garbage collection , creating hellish conditions and an immense public health crisis .
The killing of over 600 doctors and medical professionals and the flight of thousands of others , together with severe shortages in medicine and equipment , have left Iraq ’s health sector in a state of collapse .
The death toll among US troops will soon top 4,000 .
At least 60,000 more have been wounded , and many thousands more American soldiers and Marines sent into this dirty colonial war have come back with severe psychological problems .
As for the costs to American society , it is now estimated that the occupation is consuming some $ 12 billion a month and could total as much as $ 3 trillion .
A report by the Joint Economic Committee of Congress found that the war thus far has cost an average American family of four $ 16,900 , an amount projected to rise to $ 37,000 by 2017 .
These vast sums have been diverted from pressing social needs in the US itself , while the massive expenditures have contributed significantly to a raging financial crisis that threatens to plunge the economy into a depression .
It is a measure of the perverse mindset of the US president — and his criminal indifference to the loss of human life — that in a video conference last week with US military personnel in Afghanistan , Bush declared himself envious of those fighting in America ’s colonial - style wars , calling it “ a fantastic experience ” and “ in some ways romantic . ”
Equally delusional were the comments made by Vice President Dick Cheney during an unannounced visit to Baghdad .
Cheney called the five - year war a “ successful endeavor ” that “ has been well worth the effort . ”
The reality is that five years after a US invasion that was expected by its organizers to swiftly replace the government of Saddam Hussein with a stable US client regime , 160,000 US troops remain deployed in the country and — as the extraordinary security measures surrounding Cheney , even in the fortified Green Zone , make clear — no area can be claimed to be fully secure .
The surge initiated by the Pentagon a year ago has yet to create conditions in which American commanders believe they can reduce occupation forces even to the level that existed at the beginning of the invasion .
The surge , which Cheney said was responsible for a “ remarkable turnaround , ” has not halted the daily bloodbath .
Even according to US government figures , on average 26 Iraqi civilians were killed every day in the month of February .
To a large extent , the reduction in what remains a horrific death toll is attributable not to US pacification efforts , but to the fact that the sectarian violence unleashed by the occupation has largely separated Sunni and Shia populations , leaving fewer people to kill .
Meanwhile , the Pentagon is financing and arming former Sunni insurgents , who have no loyalty either to Washington or the US - backed government , but who for the moment see the Shia - dominated security forces and militias as the greatest threat .
As for Iraqi perceptions of conditions in their own country , the recent poll indicated that more than half believe the beefing up of the US troop presence in Baghdad and Anbar Province has made matters worse .
A war based on lies
As is now universally recognized , the war was prepared in 2002 and early 2003 with a campaign of deliberate lies and fabrications about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and ties between Baghdad and Al Qaeda , both of which proved to be non-existent .
The Bush administration , with the complicity of congressional Democrats , sought to exploit the fears and political confusion in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks to implement long - prepared plans to seize control of a country holding the world ’s second - largest proven oil reserves and turn it into a platform for the extension of US military power throughout the region .
Notwithstanding the popular disorientation fostered by a relentless propaganda campaign waged by both political parties and backed by a subservient media , there was broad opposition to the drive to war , reflected in massive demonstrations both in the US and around the world .
The five years since the invasion have not only seen the original lies thoroughly exposed , but also a complete discrediting of the US government and US policy in the eyes of the world ’s population .
The old attempt to drape predatory US policies in the mantle of democracy — used to some effect during the two world wars and the Cold War that followed — is now rejected with contempt by people around the globe , who have been repulsed by the killings and repression in Iraq and atrocities such as the sadistic torture practiced at Abu Ghraib .
Of equal importance is the discrediting of the political system within the US itself .
Rejecting the official story relentlessly sold by the mass media and the two major parties , the American people by a large margin have come to oppose the war .
Yet it continues unabated , and the president who launched it — who is despised by millions and retains the support of less than a third of the population — retains undiminished power to pursue a policy of unrestrained militarism .
Nothing could expose more thoroughly the undemocratic character and political rot that pervade the entire governmental system within the United States .
The global eruption of American militarism and the crisis of US and world capitalism are inextricably linked .
In the final analysis , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and the threat of a new war against Iran , are a product of the attempt by the US ruling class to maintain the hegemonic position of US capitalism by military force , under conditions in which it can no longer do so by virtue of its economic weight .
The most important war aims of Washington are to establish a stranglehold over the oil resources of the Middle East and Central Asia , in order to gain a decisive strategic advantage over its economic rivals in Europe and Asia .
The Iraq war is not an aberration .
War is the inevitable product of a world situation dominated by the increasing tensions between a globally integrated economy and the capitalist nation state system in which the decline of US imperialism poses the most explosive consequences .
Despite the failure of the US adventure in Iraq , objective pressures are pushing Washington towards new confrontations with enemies ranging from China to Russia to Venezuela .
The economic crisis that is driving this policy is not merely conjunctural , but systemic .
It is now acknowledged widely within financial circles that the credit crisis that has erupted with the bursting of the housing bubble has put the United States on the edge of the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s .
The sharpest expression of this economic crisis is the unrelenting growth of social inequality .
The financial elite ’s policy of using military force to gain control of world markets is pursued at the direct expense of the masses of working people , who are paying for it through attacks on their jobs , living standards and basic democratic rights .
The Democrats and the war
The evolution of the 2008 election campaign has already made it clear that the American people will once again be denied the right to decide at the polls whether Washington should continue its criminal war against the Iraqi people .
The Democratic Party , following a now well - worn path , is once again preparing to politically disenfranchise the substantial antiwar majority of the American electorate .
In the 2002 midterm elections , the Democratic leadership in Congress took a deliberate decision to deliver the votes needed to authorize the invasion of Iraq , reasoning that it would thus take the question of war “ off the table ” and enable it to wage a successful campaign based on economic issues .
The result was a severe defeat that delivered both houses of Congress to the Republicans .
In 2004 , the party leadership steered the nomination to two US senators — John Kerry and John Edwards — who had voted for the war in 2002 and who made it clear they had no intention of withdrawing American forces .
Indeed , Kerry suggested that , if elected , he would launch his own “ surge . ”
In 2006 , the Democrats won back control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate in a vote that clearly represented a popular repudiation of the war .
Having gained control of Congress , the Democrats proceeded to do nothing but provide funding for the war to continue .
Now , the two remaining candidates for the Democratic nomination are locked in a national security campaign aimed at proving themselves best qualified to serve as commander - in - chief .
Both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have advanced platforms that provide for the continued presence of the US military in Iraq for purposes of counter - terrorism operations , the protection of US facilities and interests , and the training of Iraqi puppet forces — meaning that tens of thousands of troops would remain in the country indefinitely .
Obama ’s former senior foreign policy advisor spelled out in a recent interview with the BBC that no one should take his promises regarding troop withdrawal too seriously , as they would be scrapped the moment he entered the White House and began consultation with the military brass .
No doubt , there exist within the ruling elite bitter divisions over the conduct of the war and plans for future US policy in Iraq .
These differences , however , begin from the standpoint of advancing the interests of imperialism on a world scale and whether the tying down of immense US military power in Iraq is hindering the use of that power elsewhere .
Many of the Democrats advocating troop withdrawals from Iraq are calling for these same troops to be sent to Afghanistan .
The character of the supposedly liberal opposition to the Iraq war found its most grotesque expression in last Sunday ’s opinion section of the New York Times in which the paper ’s editorial board called upon nine “ experts on military and foreign affairs to reflect on their attitudes in the spring of 2003 ” to the war .
All nine , without exception , were advocates of the war , most of them drawn from within the administration or from right - wing think tanks .
Some , such as Richard Perle and Paul Bremer , bear direct responsibility for the atrocities carried out against the Iraqi people .
The implication is that in March 2003 , everyone agreed that war against Iraq was necessary .
Differences arose only afterwards due to the exposure of “ faulty intelligence ” and because of the Bush administration ’s flawed execution of this necessary act .
This is a lie .
There were millions who recognized that the war was an act of criminality carried out on the basis of lies .
For its part , the World Socialist Web Site had no illusions as to what was behind the war or what it would produce .
As we wrote in “ The crisis of American capitalism and the war against Iraq ” on March 21 , 2003 : “ All the justifications given by the Bush administration and its accomplices in London are based on half - truths , falsifications and outright lies .
At this point , it should hardly be necessary to reply yet again to the claims that the purpose of this war is to destroy Iraq ’s so - called ‘ weapons of mass destruction . ’
After weeks of the most intrusive inspections to which any country has ever been subjected , nothing of material significance was discovered . ”
And we predicted accurately : “ Whatever the outcome of the initial stages of the conflict that has begun , American imperialism has a rendezvous with disaster .
It can not conquer the world .
It can not reimpose colonial shackles upon the masses of the Middle East .
It will not find through the medium of war a viable solution to its internal maladies .
Rather , the unforeseen difficulties and mounting resistance engendered by war will intensify all of the internal contradictions of American society . ”
Today , an effective struggle against the war cannot be waged based on protests and appeals to the existing two - party system , or on yet another attempt to place greater power in the hands of the Democrats by putting Clinton or Obama in the White House and giving the party a larger majority in the Senate .
What is required is a rejection of imperialism itself .
Ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and defeating the already well - advanced plans for further and even bloodier wars in Iran and elsewhere is possible only through the fight to mobilize the working class against the capitalist system that is the source of war .
This means an irreconcilable break with the Democratic Party and the building of a new mass political movement of working people based on a socialist and internationalist program .
This is the alternative which the Socialist Equality Party and the World Socialist Web Site will fight to place at the center of the struggles to come in the run-up to the November election , advancing the demand for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all US troops from Iraq and Afghanistan and demanding that those who conspired to launch these wars of aggression be held accountable , both politically and legally .
We urge all of our readers and supporters to draw the lessons of five years of the Iraq war and join us in this fight for the independent political mobilization of working people in the United States and internationally against imperialism .
CBC , Canada 's public television broadcaster has plans to release the upcoming TV - show " Canada 's Next Great Prime Minister " for free via BitTorrent .
This makes CBC the first North - American broadcaster to embrace the popular filesharing protocol .
According to an early report , high quality copies of the show will be published the day after it aired on TV , without any DRM restrictions .
CBC is not alone in this , European broadcasters , including the BBC , are currently working on a next generation BitTorrent client that will allow them to make their content available online .
The benefit of BitTorrent is of course that it will reduce distribution costs .
The popularity of movies and TV - shows on BitTorrent has n’t gone unnoticed .
We reported earlier that some TV - studios allegedly use BitTorrent as a marketing tool , and others leaking unaired pilots intentionally .
It is safe to say that BitTorrent is slowly replacing Tivo .
Approximately 50 % of all BitTorrent downloads are TV - shows , and some episodes of popular shows such as “ Lost ” , “ Prison Break ” and “ Heroes ” get up to 10 million downloads per episode , spread over thousands of sites .
It is good to see that broadcasters slowly start to realize that they can benefit from sharing their content via BitTorrent .
Last month Norwegian Broadcasting ( NRK ) made the popular TV - show “ Nordkalotten 365 â €³ available in a DRM - less format .
This experiment turned out to be a huge success , while the distribution costs were close to zero .
I interviewed Gary Taubes by phone a few weeks ago , shortly after he gave a talk about the main ideas of his new book — " Good Calories , Bad Calories " — at UC Berkeley .
The interview lasted about 2 hours .
SETH : I just spoke to someone who reduced the carbohydrate in his diet , for various reasons , including your book .
He found that his performance on mental problems started improving again .
It had stopped improving ; it had been constant for a long time , and then it started getting better .
So it may be that when you reduce the carbohydrate in your diet , your brain starts working better .
GARY TAUBES :
Well , there is evidence that your brain works more efficiently on ketones , as does your heart .
So if he reduced his carbohydrate consumption sufficiently , he probably increased the level of ketones in his blood .
But I ’m just speculating here .
SETH : The book seems to have had an unusual beginning .
You ’d been writing about salt , and you learned that a scientist you did n’t trust about salt was also talking about obesity ?
GARY TAUBES : Well , I ’ve spent over 20 years now writing about controversial science .
In the mid-1980s , I lived at CERN for ten months , the big physics lab outside Geneva , watching physicists discover non-existent elementary particles .
Then I wrote a somewhat infamous story about prions , the supposed causative agents of Mad Cow Disease .
I wrote a book about cold fusion : I got obsessed with this question of how it happened , because it was so obviously wrong .
After all that , I developed what I believe is a very good feel for who ’s a good scientist , and who ’s a bad scientist , just by talking to them .
There are certain ways that good scientists describe their data , describe the caveats , and describe the conditions by which they may or may not be right .
I had also , obviously , with cold fusion , interviewed some of the worst scientists in the world .
I used to joke with my friends in the physics community that if you want to cleanse your discipline of the worst scientists in it , every three or four years , you should have someone publish a bogus paper claiming to make some remarkable new discovery — infinite free energy or ESP , or something suitably cosmic like that .
Then you have it published in a legitimate journal ; it shows up on the front page of the New York Times , and within two months , every bad scientist in the field will be working on it .
Then you just take the ones who publish papers claiming to replicate the effect , and you throw them out of the field .
A way of cleaning out the bottom of the barrel .
SETH : I thought your NY Times article , “ What if It ’s All Been a Big Fat Lie , ” sort of did that .
The people who came out against it , they were the bad journalists .
Just throw them out !
GARY TAUBES : Well , how I got onto that : I was doing this story for Science on salt and blood pressure , looking into the controversy about whether salt consumption plays any role at all in raising blood pressure and causing hypertension .
One of the prime players in this salt / blood pressure controversy was obviously one of the worst scientists I ’d ever met — one of the five worst … you ca n’t say , in that five , who is the very worst , but they ’re all pretty bad .
This is a group that includes guys like Stan Pons and Martin Fleischman who claimed to have discovered cold fusion .
While I ’m on the phone with this guy , interviewing him , he takes credit for getting Americans to eat less fat and fewer eggs .
I literally finished the interview , called my editor at Science , and I said “ You know , one of the worst scientists I ’ve ever interviewed just took credit for getting Americans to eat less fat and fewer eggs , and I do n’t know what the story is , but when I ’m done with this salt story , I ’m going to look into fat , cholesterol , and saturated fat . ”
I had a great relationship with Science .
My editors had faith in me .
If I said there was a story there , they ’d give me the support I needed to pursue it .
A year later , I ended up with that first story in Science , saying that there ’s no evidence that reducing the total fat in the diet makes a damned bit of difference in our health .
The evidence that saturated fat and monounsaturated fats are players is , at best , marginal .
And that led to the N.Y .
Times article .
SETH : What did that scientist say that made you rank him so low ?
GARY TAUBES :
There are all kinds of signs .
He told me there was no controversy , when there was obviously a controversy .
His side might have been right , but to deny there as a controversy was ludicrous .
He talked about the legitimacy of throwing out negative data .
You measure salt consumption one way ; you do n’t see any effect on blood pressure , and so you decide that ’s obviously the wrong way to measure it .
The implication of everything he told me was that he knew what the answer was before he did his experiments , and then he adjusted his experimental techniques and methodology until he got the answer that he wanted .
And he believed this was legitimate science .
There are other signs .
I ’m a stickler about the use of words like “ evidence ” and “ proof ” .
So if someone tells you there ’s no evidence for some controversial belief , you can be fairly confident that they ’re a bad scientist .
There ’s always evidence , or there would n’t be a controversy .
If somebody says that “ we proved that this was true ” or “ we set out to prove that this was true ” that ’s another bad sign .
The point here , as Popper noted , among others , is that you can never prove anything is true ; you can only refute it .
So researchers who talk about proving a hypothesis is true rather than testing it make me worried .
SETH : Yeah , I see what you ’re saying .
They overstate ; they twist things around to make it come out the way they want .
They are way too sure of what they …
GARY TAUBES : Yes , and the really good scientists are the ones , almost by definition , who are most skeptical of evidence that seems to support their beliefs .
They ’re most aware of how they could have been fooled , how they could have screwed up , or how they might have missed artifacts in their experiment that could have explained what they observed .
They ’re very careful about what they say .
If you ask them to do play devil ’s advocate , and tell you how they could have screwed up , then at the very least , they ’ll say “ Well , if I knew how I could have done it , I would have checked it before I made the claim ” .
So when I ’m talking about discerning the difference between a good scientist and a bad scientist , I ’m talking about how they speak about their research , the evidence itself , it ’s presence or absence .
My friends in journalism would often ask me this question : by what right do I think make decisions about who ’s a good scientist and who ’s not .
I ’d say “ Well , when you ’re an English major , you can be confident that Norman Mailer was a better writer than John Grisham , even though John Grisham makes 10 to 100 times more money ” .
It ’s just a feel for what you do ; I do n’t know how else to describe it .
I know a good scientist when I talk with one .
I might be fooled , on occasion , but ….
SETH : It ’s not particularly well - correlated with how famous they are , or how many Nobel Prizes they ’ve won .
GARY TAUBES : My first book was about a Nobel Prize winner who discovered non-existent elementary particles .
SETH
Who was that ?
GARY TAUBES : An Italian physicist named Carlo Rubia .
This is a project developed by a young Argentinean designer named Ignacio Pilotto .
It may look as the usual deckchair but it 's sure not ordinary .
The fabric covering glows in the dark thanks to dozen of luminous inserts .
A chair that glows in the dark it 's more than useful for a cruise ship and not only .
In the case of blackout there will be no problem to find a comfortable seat while waiting for the light ... or , if you live in a porch house this chair would make a lovely summer night setting .
Just dreaming on ...

The net 's core address books are being updated
On Monday the master address books for the net are being updated to include records prepared in a new format known as IP version 6 .
Widespread use of this format will end the shortage of addresses that sites can be given .
The net 's current addressing scheme is expected to exhaust the pool of unallocated addresses by 2011 .
Short stack
Although people use words to navigate around the web , computers use numbers .
A human may type news.bbc.co.uk into a browser bar but the PC trying to reach that site will use a numerical equivalent that it gets from the net 's master address books .
At the moment the vast majority of numerical net addresses are written in a format specified by version 4 of the Internet Protocol ( IPv4 ) .
On 4 February the master or root servers for the net will have a small number of records added that are written in IP version 6 ( IP v6 ) added to them .
This means for the first time that computers using IP v6 , typically a PC and a server , can find each other without involving any IP v4 technology .
" There 's pressure for people to make the conversion to IPv6 , " he said .
" We 're pushing this as a major issue . "
The reason for the urgency , he said , was because the unallocated addresses from the total of 4,294,967,296 possible with IP v4 was rapidly running out .
" We 're down to 14 % of the unallocated addresses out of the whole pool for version 4 , " he said .
Projections suggest that this unallocated pool will run out by 2011 at the latest .
" There 's not a Y2 K problem per se , " said Mr Twomey , " but there 's going to be a crush so we need to get people applying for them now . "
Under IPv6 an effectively inexhaustible pool of addresses becomes available .
Jay Daley , technology director at Nominet which oversees .uk domains on the internet , said many large companies were already using IP v6 as it helped ease administration on large internal networks .
Cable TV suppliers such as Comcast and NTT were using it to pipe IPTV to set - top boxes in customer 's homes , he said .
Take up of IP v6 should start to increase , he said , as only recently regional organisations that handed out blocks of net addresses had relaxed the rules about who could get them .
" People are going to have to do it as IP v4 addresses become much more difficult to get hold of , " he said .
For a long while , he said , the effects on consumers would be minimal though eventually home routers may have to be upgraded or swapped so they can use the longer addresses .
Survival names winner of the ' most racist article of the year ' award
March 19 , 2008
An article comparing Paraguayan Indians to cancer and describing them as ‘ Neolithic ’ , ‘ out - of - date ’ and ‘ filthy ’ has been named by Survival as the ‘ most racist article ’ in the mainstream media published in the last year .
The award marks March 21 , the UN International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination .
The article was published in the Paraguayan newspaper La Nacion .
It also describes the Indians as having a ‘ withered ’ culture , argues that they ‘ need to become civilised ’ , and calls into question their humanity .
The ‘ most racist article of the year ’ award is the latest feature of Survival ’s ‘ Stamp it Out ’ campaign which aims to challenge racist descriptions of tribal people in the world ’s media .
The winner will receive a certificate inscribed with a quotation from Lakota Sioux author Luther Standing Bear :
‘ All the years of calling the Indian a savage has never made him one . ’
Stamp it Out is supported by prominent journalists such as the BBC ’s World Affairs correspondent John Simpson , Sandy Gall and George Monbiot .
Survival ’s director Stephen Corry said today , ‘ Racism often underpins , or is used to justify , abuses of tribal people , whether it ’s stealing their land , exploiting them or even killing them .
This article makes it clear that in the media such racism continues to exist , even among people who are supposed to ‘ know better ’ .
This is n’t about political correctness – it has very real consequences for tribal peoples ’ livelihoods , land and , ultimately , their lives . ’

" More insidiously , those independent non-partisan voters who did successfully manage to get registered as " Decline to State " ( or DTS , or Non-Partisan ) , were allowed to vote in the Democratic Presidential Primary if they requested to do so when voting .
However , without filling in a certain bubble on the ballot , specifying they wanted it to be counted in the Dem Primary , their vote for President , according to LA County 's Registrar of Voters , will not be counted . "
Is n't it great that in this primary , where independents could vote , and did , that just indicating the candidate on their ballot is not enough ?
Why the " double - check " system ?
This does not appear to be a closed primary .
If it can be clearly ascertained who they voted for , those ballots should be counted .
Seems like a way to create undervotes without adjusting the scanner to " not see " certain marks that did n't fill in enough of the space or were n't dark enough .
Who were those DTS voters predicted to break for - Obama or Clinton ?
Think the DTS voters have right to legal recourse ?
Logan did n't have to go along with McCormack 's scheme .
But then , his hiring did n't make sense after the Washington Governor 's election .

The media never really explained why the NH exit polls were so far off of the actual results from the primary in NH .
I do n't want to add fuel to the fire of conspiracy theories , but I just did the math of all of the exit polls released late afternoon to the actual results as of 12:29 PST right now and this is what I got .
If you take the actual results and match them up against what the exit polls indicated the results should have been , the discrepancy with the exception of 3 states is in favor of Clinton .
And in some cases by huge numbers .
How can exit polls which are supposed to be based on what people actually just voted be so in favor of one candidate and so against another ?
Georgia : Obama - 9 , Clinton +5
Connecticut : Obama - 1 , Clinton +2
Illinois : Obama - 6 , Clinton +2
Alabama : Obama - 6 , Clinton +5
Delaware : Obama - 3 , Clinton +0
Massachusetts : Obama - 9 , Clinton +9
Missouri : Obama - 1 , Clinton +3
Tennessee : Obama - 1 , Clinton +2
New York : Obama - 2 , Clinton +1
New Jersey : Obama - 8 , Clinton +7
Arkansas : Obama +1 , Clinton - 2
Oklahoma : Obama +1 , Clinton -6
Arizona : Obama - 9 , Clinton +6
New Mexico : Obama - 5 , Clinton +3
Utah : Obama - 3 , Clinton -1
California : Obama - 7 , Clinton +3
Most inaccurate exit polls by total point difference ( all in Clinton 's favor ) : Massachusetts : 18 points
New Jersey : 15 points
Arizona : 15 points
Georgia : 14 points
Alabama : 11 points
California : 10 points
Illinois : 8 points
Is there any rational explanation for this ?
Or can someone shed more light as to why exit polls are so skewed ?
Particularly in favor of the Clintons ?
Yet Obama blows expectations away in the caucus states where voting is out in the open and there is accountability .
The reason I always hear is that Obama has a great grassroots organization .
And for the skewed polling , they always say it 's The Bradley Effect and people do n't want to be honest .
But exit polls are n't like phone polls --- they fill out a form that is completely anonymous and they do n't have to tell anyone face to face how they voted .
So that pressure to lie just would n't be there .
So why the huge difference ?
And is it just plain coincidence that the biggest discrepancy was in Massachusetts which next to New Jersey and California would have been considered a huge upset to the Clintons ?

This is Off topic .
I might be naive here , but I just found this page and it lists delegates and superdelegates who have n't endorsed First question :
Why are we bothering to care about voting integrity if these " delegates and superdelegates "
( Which kind of looked like a stacked deck of existing senators and representatives to me ) are going to choose the candidate ?
Second question :
How can they be wearing two hats like that ?
I guess I really really do n't understand this .
I have nothing but contempt for this delegate garbage .
When did all this start ?
I thought the " electoral college " was the problem .
You mean to tell me theres a delegates college too !?
I mean why did we just vote ?
Apparently ( according to that website ) they have already voted for us .
This is seriously just opened the rabbit hole for me .
If that list was n't bad enough , maybe this list will do it for you ?
( a list of superdelegates to the 2008 Democratic Convention that have officially announced who they plan to nominate . )
Should delegates need Secret Service protection if this ever comes into the light of day .
( I mean they 're basically stealing the vote from the voters right ?!)
I have had it with this bullshit .
With lists like those , it seems to me the elected are selecting the elections .
No wonder the PNAC / AIPAC / CFR candidates always win !!!
If the deck is stacked this way , then perhaps I should just get out of this " defending the vote " crap right now .
Since this stuff is really taking a toll on my health since 2004 .
I am getting like two hours sleep at a time now .
I do n't see how this can go on and we call ourselves a constitutional republic .
The United States is so done , it 's just people do n't know it yet .
Maybe time for me to go out and party with bands or something and get out of this forever .
I am talking " burned out I am " from this latest stinking revelation .
Maybe better for me to stop all this noise I post on BradBlog , and just go try to enjoy what 's left of my diminishing civil rights , health , freedom and braincells .
I Am Seriously depressed on learning this .
I am so naive , I do n't think the people even care .
I think that 's the reason why there 's only been a hand full of us saying a god damn thing .
Even though I just learned this about delegates , I wonder now about the electoral college .
It appears that our government is lost and digging a grave for all of us .
Unless someone out there wants to tell me why I should still care anymore , then I think I am going to give up .
Because 99 % of the people out there do n't care anyway right !
Who ever all these nasty fucking people are they have ruined this country .
Alright , back to the regularly scheduled voter disenfranchisement games for now .
Did n't mean to interrupt this thread and story about the wrong ballots for the wrong party , decline to state .
IMO - it 's just another line of dirty tricks , only now I wonder if it is n't just smoke and mirrors while the delegates do their dirty work .
( If I 'd have seen an open thread I would have used that instead .
as this post has NOTHING to do with this thread .
But I think I am done here .
I 'll keep the links up on my websites to support Bradblog , but what the hell else is there with these delegates and electoral college ?
I might as well go waste brain cells and create art . )

What is interesting here as noted by JW is that these differences are reciprocally different .
Would this statistical information be credible evidence that voting machines could have been preloaded with negative and positive votes to create a clean zero report but still come out with skewed results ?

It looks like the problems will follow the pattern the constitution ( we used to have ) experienced during its demise .
The problems increase and are so many that like Dylan 's " there 's so much oppression , ca n't keep track of it anymore " .
And the money is getting more and more scarce that could have been used to fix American instead of f**king up Iraq :
There is a growing risk of defaults on loans on commercial property this year , in a trend that could spill over into tumbling values and create more jitters in the credit world , analysts and bankers warn .
...
Analysts warn of a pattern that could spread .
US commercial property prices have fallen 10 per cent in some markets since August , after rising more than 90 per cent since 2001 , according to Real Capital Analytics .

Brad , re your # 2 problem , that was not the case in Sonoma County .
For every NP voter , we simply asked them which ballot they wanted to vote on : Dem , AI , or NP .
Then , we gave them that ballot , the same ballot that all voters who voted under whatever party they requested used .
What 's with having a completely separate ballot altogether ?
Re your # 1 problem , we did not have that many cases of AI people in our precinct , but I agree , I think it 's shameful to have a party called the American Independent Party , when it results in people thinking they 're registering as independents when they are not .

California : Obama 46 ( 42 ) - 4 , Clinton 50 ( 52 ) +2
Kind of interesting that CA started down by as much as 20 points and ended up only with a 10 point difference .
Many counties ( not mine ) switched to paper ballots because of distrust of electronic voting machines .
It would be interesting if someone could do some homework and get vote totals for hand counted election day votes vs. machine counted tallies .
Not counting absentee ballots with this amount would give us two samples to compare side by side .
We 're basically looking for the hand counted and machine counted votes of folks who actually voted election day .
One thing we know for sure is that the later reported votes tended to be heavier for Obama than the early reported ones just based on his percentage going up to 42 % .
There may not be a difference , but I am curious .

OK , so I 'm getting caught up on the reading about the NP voter debacle in CA , complete with confused voters and uninformed poll workers .
Here 's the simple deal : A voter walks into your precinct and you look him up on the roster .
He registered as a non-partisan ( declined to state ) .
So after he 's signed in , you look him directly in the eye and recite the following : " You registered as a non-partisan voter , which means that , for this election , you must choose which one of three ballots you want to cast your votes on ... Democrat , American Independent , or non-partisan .
Do you understand what that choice means ? "
If the answer is " yes , " you recite the following : " Which ballot do you want ? "
If the answer is " no , " you recite the following : " If you choose to vote on a Democrat ballot , then you will have the opportunity to vote for one of the presidential candidates who is running for the Democrat party .
If you choose to vote on an American Independent ballot , then you will have the opportunity to vote for one of the candidates who is running for president for the American Independent party .
If you choose to vote on a non-partisan ballot , then you will not have the opportunity to vote for any presidential candidate .
Which ballot do you want ? "
If there are further questions , then the voter may look through the voter guides offered at all polling places to learn who is running on which ballots , and to read about them .
It 's just not that difficult , folks .

I am one of the people told specifically that I did not have to punch the Democratic Party bubble .
Further , although I had proof of registration , my name was not on the list .
As I was forced to fill out a provisional ballot , I filled in decline to state .
The poll worker told me to just write ' independent . '
I did not .

I 've been registered as a Democrat for over 20 years , yet when I received my absentee ballot , I was surprised to find that I was now registered as " Non-Partisan " and therefore not entitled to vote for any of the candidates .
I assumed there must 've been some hidden box on the absentee ballot request that I did n't see , because this the first time I ever encountered such a problem .
First I laughed it off that it must 've been due to my own oversight ; now I 'm hearing that many others in Californa were similarly given the wrong party affiliation on their absentee ballots or when they went to the polling centers .
I 'm fairly politically outspoken in my disgust of the Bush - Clinton dynasties through my emailings and the websites I visit , and am now wondering if somehow I was intentionally removed from Democratic Party affilitation .
This is a topic that needs further investigation .

Linda , that is how it SHOULD be done .
Our registrar did not do it that way .
Instead they got a non-partisan ballot with an extra box to check IF they wanted to vote for president .
In addition , voters were not warned of this , even though at a meeting between election protection people in LA COunty and the Registrar 's office two weeks ago , we pointed out that this method would cause huge confusion and undervotes .
We also pointed out that each party 's ballot was a different pastel color , very difficult to tell them apart .
In the pollworker training videos these same ballots are clearly makred Democrat and Republican in huge bold black letters .
We asked for assurance that the actual ballots had that bold printing on them .
We were promised by the Registrar 's right hand man that YES every ballot would have clear black writing stating the party .
There was NO such labeling .
The problems were obvious way before the election .
They were NOT unforeseen problems .
In addition there were large purges of the voter roles .
it looks like there is an undervote for president in LA County of 11 % .
I 'm not sure what average is , but I believe it is in the range of 3 % .
if anyone knows , please let us know .
Time for a hand count !

I ’m glad someone else noticed the issue of Obama , grass roots , and winning the caucus states .
I watched ABC off and on last night and noted that throughout the night , they kept talking about Obama taking the caucus states and the “ grassroots ” organization that supposedly carried him to those wins .
Granted , you would need that when people have to be there in person to “ vote . ”
But I find it hard to believe that the grassroots surge would not also apply to primary states where ballots are used .
One of those “ Huh ? ” moments .
According to the following sites : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)_presidential_primaries,_2008
http://www.washingtonpost.com/
.... Obama has won almost all of the caucus states except Nevada .
New Mexico seems to be up in the air but I ’ve seen one report giving New Mexico to Obama , which would be a huge upset , I would think , given the “ conventional ” thinking that the Latino vote will break for HRC .
Even if Obama is close in New Mexico , it should raise some red flags .
As for Nevada , well , here goes the tin foil hat thing - Nevada has a large Mormon population .
Just about guaranteed it would vote Romney .
In the Democratic caucuses , you could register at the door and change party affiliation - which can be changed back after .
According to stories there was cross over voting of disenchanted Republicans .
The HRC camp made no friends when they tried to limit caucus sites that had been agreed upon months ago .
Convention says those crossovers would never vote for HRC .
Except I think the GOP would rather run against HRC than Obama .
So IMHO , Nevada is enough of an anomaly to just ignore it when examining the caucus states .
But I have read elsewhere the HRC camp dissing caucuses .
Something else to ponder .
Nebraska , Washington , Maine , Hawaii , and Wyoming are the caucus states left , according to the wikipedia site .
I do n’t know who is projected to win those states at this time .
It will be interesting to see if Obama continues winning in states where bodies are counted and not ballots by computerized vote counting machines .
Ohio and Texas are the big delegate states left and Ohio of course is worrisome and I do n’t know what kind of Hybrid thing Texas does or how transparent it is .
I think the disparity in Obama winning caucuses vs. ballot states is as interesting as the switch in New Hampshire where he won hand counted counties vs. HRC winning the machine counted ones .
On another note , Diane Sawyer , ( Never liked her ) said that according to young people ( Who appear to be turning out in droves so this is one of those things that makes you go , “ Huh ? ” too ) they would be more inclined to vote if they could vote ONLINE .
To his credit , Stephanopoulos appeared to shoot her down but I did n’t get to hear all of it because someone took that moment to engage me in conversation .
I ’d like to think he put that idea where it belongs - in the trash heap .

Scott # 15 … there were a lot of voters at my precinct who described the same scenario you described .
They believed they were registered under a particular party , only to discover upon entering their polling place that they had been changed to non-partisan .
In my county , there were always logical explanations for this scenario , involving situations such as they had moved and not notified the registrar of their new address and so the registrar could n’t get ahold of them and they had n’t voted since 1986 and blah blah blah and so the registrar kept them on the roster as non-partisan rather than removing them altogether , which at least gave them the opportunity to vote , in the event they turned up on election day .
Upon close scrutiny , it turned out in every case that the voter had messed up somehow , overlooked something critical .
It was never the case that the Registrar had just arbitrarily moved them from one category to another .
Every voter for whom this happened needs to call their local Registrar of Voters office and find out what their particular circumstances are , to rectify those circumstances , and to determine if indeed there was any roster purging / party manipulating that occurred .
I am confident that , in my county , these problems were legitimate .
I ’m not sure about LA County , as it appears from what I have read from various sources over the past several years that its Registrar of Voters is not as well - run , and may actually be engaging in fraudulent elections processes , whether they are aware of it or not .
I know that is a huge accusation to make .
But as far as I am concerned , as a citizen , as a voter , as a resident of CA , and as a poll worker who works and votes in a well - run jurisdiction , the onus is on THEM to clean up their act and serve their voters more competently .
It is not up to the voters to defend their position , since LA County has problem after problem after problem after problem …

I read a comment from an official yesterday ( will look for the link ) that the poll workers are " not required " or obligated to inform DTS and NP party voters of their option to vote in the Dem primary .
The official said that voters needed to know that they had to ask .
I guess it comes down to what are reasonable expectations in the very complicated elections we have these days , where there are several dfferent pastel - colored paper ballots ( I could n't see the difference between the colors , but I 'm told it 's there ) , and different booths with different party designations , simply multiplies the entry points for error .
This is very illuminating , although these specific errors appear to be limited to the primary due to the party affiliation problem --- these specific errors do n't seem to be applicable to the general election in November .
But there will be likely be a whole new breed of errors there .

Yes , that is technically a true statement .
But what a load of crap !
If poll workers are not interested in informing voters of their options to vote , then why do they get up at 4:30 in the morning , work all day long from 6 a .m. to sometimes close to midnight , on election day ?!
They 're certainly not doing it for the money .
It 's a community service , a labor of love .
I would love to learn who said that , and send them a piece of my mind .
It is very rewarding to work the polls on election day .

Linda @ # 26 --- " BTW , DTS and NP are the same thing . "
Oh , thanks for correcting me !
I was under the impression that they were two separate designations , which did n't make sense , but then so much else in the design of LA Co. 's does n't make sense ....
I can see having the ' double bubble ' for statistical purposes ---
I do n't know the rationale behind that requirement , but I can understand somebody might 've thought it'd be neat to track how many voters " crossed over " from DTS to vote for the Dems for statistical purposes .
But it defies logic that the precinct - level op - scan ballot readers are apparently NOT programmed to spit that ballot back out as an error when the ' double bubble ' for a DTS voter is NOT filled in .
( I am not a programmer , so perhaps there 's a perfectly good reason for it on that particular system . )
The double bubble does n't appear on the Dem ballot .
Yet the central tabulator will apparently NOT COUNT any DTS ballot voting in the Dem primary unless the ' double bubble ' is filled in .
The whole point of the precinct - level op - scans ( I thought ) was to catch errors so the voter can correct them .
I wonder if anyone previously mentioned this disconnect in the programming for these two devices .
I also wonder if the machines record any stats on how many ballots get spit back out at the precinct - level .

Our county tracked this by having the poll workers indicate on the roster for every NP voter which ballot they were given .
Next to the column on the roster for party affiliation , in the case of NP voters only , there was a column that included little boxes next to NP , Dem , or AI .
The poll worker simply marked the box for whatever ballot was given to the voter .
If there 's one thing any moron who 's ever voted can figure out , it 's this : Keep ballots as simple as possible .
Voters represent a cross-section of our population .
Some have had very little education .
Some have less - than - great language skills .
Not everyone is skilled at filling out forms , and believe me , that is a skill that those of us who made it through school long enough to graduate from high school have honed to a greater degree than those who have not .
And if you were fortunate enough to go to college , well , you 're even better at those dang forms .
The ability to fill out a form successfully is not an intelligence indicator ; it 's a socialization indicator .
Do n't put stuff on to ballots for voters to deal with like that .
All voters should have to do , once they get their ballot , is vote !
I can't say this enough .
It 's just not that hard to run good , honest , easy - to - follow elections , if that 's what your goal is .

I voted in LA County .
I have been registered as a Non-Partisan ( i.e. , Independent ) since 2000 , and there was no mistake with that .
When I arrived at Seaside Elementary ( my polling place ) and asked to vote in the Democratic Primary , I was given a a clearly marked Non-partisan ballot and specific instructions to mark both the party bubble , and then my candidate choice .
Kudos to my local poll workers .
However , I have to agree , this new methodology was screwy .
In previous years , I asked to vote in the Dem Party primary , and I was given a Dem Party ballot , the same ballot a Dem voter was given .
The simplicity was n't broke , and did not need to be fixed .
Glad to hear it was only a one county affair , and hopefully will be abolished next time .
With respect to someone else 's comment that " American Independent " should n't be allowed as a name because it is too easy to confuse with " Independent " , I respectfully disagree .
I refuse to be a part of the shockingly large number of Americans who believe they deserve to live in a protective bubble and it is someone else 's responsibility to protect them from the slightest thing that might require their neurons to fire .

I am a veteran pollworker and have experienced two closed primaries ( not this year as I did exit polling ) .
Eventually I 'll write something up on Daily Kos doing the math on the double bubble problem .
But this problem is endemic .
The evidence is right on the Registrar 's web site : 1 . The reason the extra bubble is required is because ALL nonpartisan ballots are the same .
When the voter walks in and announces a party , it is merely recorded on the roster next to the voter 's name , by law , and the ballot clerk hands them a NP ballot and is supposed to show them to a Democratic or American Independent booth .
Filling the bubble allows the computer to determine which primary they voted in , because the ballot positions for the AI and Democratic candidates are the same ( 8 - 10 for AI and 8 - 16 on the Democratic ballot ) .
Thus , voter intent is going to be tricky for non -bubble fillers , since who 's to say that , if they voted for a candidate in ballot positions 8 - 10 , that they did n't want to vote in the American Independent primary ?
( If they voted for someone in positions 10 - 16 , then intent would be clear .
Remember that candidates rotate between each assembly district , but the 8 - 10 and 8 - 16 stay the same .
Unfortunately Logan has pulled the sample ballots so I can't verify how many ballot positions there were . )
2 . Yes , the American Independent Party is a really bad name .
Here 's how you check how confusing it is : look at the number of people that voluntarily choose to participate in the AI primary ( by filling in the AI bubble ) , and look at the number of votes cast in the AI primary .
Sometimes , there are more independents choosing to be AI than there are actual votes cast in the AI primary ( in other words , people chose AI and did n't actually vote in the primary that they chose ) .
It would be interesting to note the number of undervotes for the AI primary .
3 . There were 85,000 Dem crossover voters in this primary , but in the 2000 blanket primary ( where all individuals could vote for a list of all candidates on the nonpartisan ballot ) , there were 81,500 Democratic votes , and about 61,000 Republican votes .
But the electorate has grown significantly since 2000 , and the interest in this election is much higher among independents than the 2000 primary , which was essentially decided at this point .
4 . The solution that still complies with state law is to simply hand nonpartisan voters that request a party ballot that party 's ballot ( instead of the special NP ballot ) ; or , continue the existing process but change the ballot positions ( so that Dem candidates are in the first column , Rep candidates are the second column , etc .... did you notice how many blank pages there were in this year 's ballot ? ) so that there is no doubt of voter intent .
It is not difficult to have the Republicans turn one or two pages before they start voting and you can have the computer scan for votes across multiple columns and reject those as being incorrect " blanket primary " votes .
Ultimately , the blanket primary was a decent system , but it is illegal because of California Democratic Party v. Jones .

With recent news about Internet Explorer 8 's imminent beta , Microsoft 's long and checkered history with web standards compliance has been hurled back into the harsh , unflattering spotlight .
Even though IE8 will have a new " standards compliant " mode , it wo n't be perfect , stirring up a new wave of grumbling about Microsoft 's attitude and position in the browser market .
Opera CTO
Håkon Wium Lie has weighed in with a new editorial at The Register about " How to fix Microsoft 's browser issues . "
He begins by stating that because of Microsoft 's monopolistic practices , no real browser market exists , and the company does n't feel the need to actually listen to its users .
" A monopoly does n't have to consider its customers ' wants or needs .
In a functioning market , vendors must consider such things in order to compete successfully .
But the market is n't functioning , " Lie wrote .
Lie has a number of suggestions for Microsoft that he believes would improve both the IE experience and the overall browser market .
For one , he says that IE needs to support Acid2 and Acid3 by default — without requiring users to select standards mode first — and that Microsoft should commit to supporting the underlying specifications of the Acid tests .
He also demands a publicly - available set of documentation for exactly which standards IE uses , limitations , bugs , and extensions .
Finally , Lie calls for an end to mode switching in the future and a commitment to interoperability .
" If two or more major web browsers , in official shipping versions , add standards - related functionality that 's generally considered useful to the progress of the web , and described in a publicly available specification , Microsoft must add the same functionality , " he said .
These are good suggestions for any browser , of course , although Opera has a particular bone to pick with Microsoft because it produces a competing product to IE .
Opera , along with Firefox , Safari , and a smattering of smaller browsers , have been fighting tooth and nail to grab market share from the browser giant for some time now .
That has proven to be somewhat difficult — at least for Opera — as Microsoft still ties its browser into its dominant operating system .
And as long as Internet Explorer does n't ( by default ) work towards the same set of standards as the other browsers , standards do n't carry the significance they should .
That 's the crux of Opera 's recent antitrust complaint to the European Commission over Microsoft 's dominance .
In addition to requesting that Microsoft be forced to unbundle its browser from Windows , Opera also asked that the company be forced into " fundamental and open " standards .
If IE came close to rendering things the same way as Opera , Firefox , and Safari ( none of which are perfect , of course ) , then web developers of the world would n't have such a headache on their hands when creating new sites .
The one shortcoming with Opera 's antitrust complaint is that Firefox has made significant headway against Microsoft .
From its 1.0 release in November 2004 to the present , Firefox has gained over 125 million users worldwide , and as of July last year , Firefox held over 40 percent of the market in several EU member nations .
Firefox has managed a huge surge in popularity where Opera has failed over the last 10 years , demonstrating that it is possible to make inroads against IE 's dominant position .
Lie makes some excellent points in his editorial , and , although Microsoft 's recent actions with regards to web standards are encouraging , the company 's history in that area speaks for itself .

Oil market analysts think OPEC is likely to cut production in March
In New York , the main contract for light sweet crude oil hit a record high of $ 100.10 a barrel before closing at $ 100.01 , up $ 4.51 .
Market analysts say Opec producers might cut production in response to the slowdown of the US economy .
There was also concern over supplies from Nigeria and the ongoing row between Exxon Mobil and Venezuela .
Opec oil producers meet on 5 March .
" Production is not going to increase .
It will either decrease or be stable , " Opec President Chakib Khelil said on Monday .
Analysts think a cut in production is increasingly likely .
" Opec is showing every sign that it will move to cut production at it March meeting , " said Phil Flynn , an analyst at Alaron Trading .
" It seems that Opec is only focused on price and the economy be dammed . "
This cuneiform text dates back to the 6th year of prince Lugalanda who ruled about 2370 B.C. in southern Mesopotamia .
It is an administrative document concerning deliveries of three sorts of beer to different recipients ( to the palace and to a temple for offerings ) and gives the exact quantities of barley and other ingredients used in brewing .
Each Monday , this column turns a page in history to explore the discoveries , events and people that continue to affect the history being made today .
Humans had been speaking for a couple hundred thousand years before they got the inspiration or nerve to mark their ideas down for posterity .
But when a Mesopotamian people called the Sumerians finally did scratch out a few bookkeeping symbols on clay tablets 5,000 years ago , they unknowingly started a whole new era in history we call , well … history .
The presence of written sources denotes the technical dividing line between what scholars classify as prehistory versus what they call history , which starts at different times depending on what part of the world you 're studying .
In most places , writing started about the same time ancient civilizations emerged from hunter - gatherer communities , probably as a way to keep track of the new concept of " property , " such as animals , grain supplies or land .
By 3000 B.C. in Mesopotamia ( present - day Iraq ) , and then soon after in Egypt , and by 1500 B.C. in China , people were scribbling , sketching and telling their world about their culture in a very permanent way .
When memory failed
When ancient Mesopotamians started settling down onto farms surrounding the first cities , life became a bit more complicated .
Agriculture required expertise and detailed recordkeeping , two elements that led directly to the invention of writing , historians say .
The first examples of writing were pictograms used by temple officials to keep track of the inflows and outflows of the city 's grain and animal stores which , in the bigger Sumerian urban centers such as Ur , were big enough to make counting by memory unreliable .
Officials began using standardized symbols — rather than , say , an actual picture of a goat — to represent commodities , scratched into soft clay tablets with a pointed reed that had been cut into a wedge shape .
Archaeologists call this first writing " cuneiform , " from the Latin " cuneus , " meaning wedge .
The system developed quickly to incorporate signs that represented sounds , and soon all of Mesopotamia was taking notes , making to - do lists and ( presumably ) writing love letters .
Egyptian writing — the famous hieroglyphics — developed independently not long thereafter , under similar circumstances , historians think .
A few thousand years later , as variations on the two systems spread throughout the region , the entire ancient world had writing schemes that vastly improved the efficiency of economies , the accountability of governments and , maybe most importantly to us , our understanding of the past .
Literacy a privilege
Reading and writing in ancient times was n't for the masses , however .
Daily life in Mesopotamia and Egypt was time - consuming , and so writing became a specialized profession , usually for members of the elite class .
The highly - regarded scribes of ancient Mesopotamia were even depicted in art wearing cuneiform writing implements ( a bit like a set of chopsticks ) in their belts as a mark of their importance .
Literacy remained a privilege of aristocratic males in most societies all the way until the 19th - century , when public education became more widespread around the world .
That means that while the historical period is exponentially better understood than the experiences of humans before writing was invented , written accounts are largely about the experiences of the upper classes , historians say .
About one in five people today , concentrated mostly in Third World nations , are illiterate .
In 610 A.D. , Muhammad ibn Abdallah , a forty - year - old man from a prosperous merchant family in Mecca , repaired to a cave on nearby Mt. Hira to meditate — a retreat he had made many times .
That year , though , his experience was different .
An angel appeared and seized him , speaking to him the words of God.
Muhammad fell to his knees and crawled home to his wife .
“ Wrap me up ! ” he cried .
He feared for his sanity .
But , as the voice revisited him , he came to believe that it truly issued from God .
It called on him to reform his society .
Poor people were to be given charity ; slaves were to be treated justly ; usury was to be outlawed .
Muhammad ’s tribesmen , the Quraysh , were polytheists , like most people in the Arabian Peninsula at that time , but this God , Allah , proclaimed that he was the only God .
He was the same deity that the Jews and the Christians worshipped .
Jesus Christ was n’t his son , though .
Christ was just a prophet , like the prophets of the Old Testament .
Their word was now superseded by Muhammad ’s , as their creeds were supplanted by this new one , Islam .
When Muhammad started preaching in Mecca , people saw him as a harmless crank , but as he gained followers he began to be regarded as a menace .
Mecca was an important trading hub , with rich merchants .
Muhammad ’s God forbade all ostentation .
Furthermore , if , as he instructed , the pagan idols were to be discarded , that would mean no more revenue from their shrines .
In 622 , Muhammad and his followers were driven out of Mecca .
They fled to Yathrib , which became known as Medina , and from there they warred with their native city .
In the beginning , Muhammad ’s treatment of his fellow - monotheists the Jews and the Christians was conciliatory , but new religions do not normally establish themselves with the help of older religions .
The local Jewish tribes conspired against him .
After a decisive battle in 627 , Muhammad had seven hundred Jews beheaded in Medina ’s central market .
In 630 , he and his men took Mecca .
Muhammad ordered the destruction of the three hundred and sixty idols around the city ’s great temple , the Kabah .
He proclaimed the supremacy of Islam , and reportedly sent messengers to the rulers of Persia , Byzantium , Yemen , and Ethiopia bidding them to convert .
According to his biographer Karen Armstrong , he spent his few remaining years trying to establish peace , sometimes over the objections of his lieutenants .
Soon after Muhammad ’s death , in 632 , the record of what God had said to him was collected in the Koran , and his contemporaries ’ testimonies about his life were gathered in the Hadith .
At the same time , Islam expanded , with a speed unique in history .
One of the obligations imposed on the faithful by the Koran was jihad , or struggle .
This has been translated as “ holy war , ” and there are passages in the Koran to support such a reading , notably the recommendation that Muslims kill enemies of the faith : “ Fight against them until idolatry is no more and Allah ’s religion reigns supreme . ”
But just a few paragraphs later the Koran makes the opposite decree : “ There shall be no compulsion in religion . ”
Some interpreters of the Koran — particularly in recent years , when holy war has become a matter of public alarm — have argued that “ jihad ” actually means spiritual combat , every Muslim ’s fight within himself against the temptations of evil .
I do n’t know why a book that was collected , rather than composed , should have to be internally consistent , or why a religious document that originated within a nomadic society in the seventh century and includes such things as the moon splitting in two should be asked to conform to post -Enlightenment thought .
The Bible also contradicts itself , and has water turning into wine .
Such matters are a problem only for literalists .
As for slaying one ’s enemies , this is enthusiastically recommended in Psalms ( “ Happy shall he be , that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones ” ) , as it is in many premodern writings .
In any case , however much Muhammad ’s immediate successors may have struggled with their souls , they also , in the eighty - some years following his death , conquered Syria , Egypt , North Africa , Anatolia , Iraq , and Persia .
By the beginning of the eighth century , Muslim forces stood at the northwest corner of Africa .
There , only the Strait of Gibraltar , nine miles wide , separated them from the Iberian Peninsula .
Iberia at that time was ruled by the Visigoths , a Christian people who did their best to wipe out other religions within their territory — Judaism , for example .
There is some evidence that the Iberian Jews invited the Muslims to invade .
In 711 , they did so .
The state that they established in Iberia , and maintained for almost four centuries , is the subject of David Levering Lewis ’s “ God ’s Crucible : Islam and the Making of Europe , 570 to 1215 ” ( Norton ; $ 29.95 ) .
This book has to be understood in context , or , actually , two contexts .
The first is post - colonialism , the effort on the part of scholars from the nineteen - seventies onward to correct the biases that accompanied and justified the colonization of eighty - five per cent of the earth by European powers between the sixteenth and the twentieth centuries .
In that period , according to Edward Said ’s 1978 “ Orientalism ” — the founding document of post - colonial thought — history - writing about the Near East and the Middle East was an arm of empire .
Its goal was to make non-Western peoples seem uncivilized , so that European control would appear a boon .
Since Said , much writing on Europe ’s former colonies has been an effort to redress that injustice .
The other context in which Lewis ’s book must be read is , of course , the history of terrorism , since the late nineteen - seventies , on the part of people claiming to be instructed by the Koran .
When this started , most Westerners had little idea of what the Muslim world was .
Harems , hookahs , carpets — that was about it .
Nor , after the terrorist attacks , was it easy to catch up in any proper way , for , while there has been an outpouring of books on Islam in the past two decades , many of them were for or against it .
A number of prominent intellectuals have denounced Islam .
Other people have protested that the vast majority of Muslims do not support terrorism .
Some historians have condemned not just the demonization of Islam but the West ’s ignorance of the Muslim world — a failure now seen as political folly , not to speak of arrogance .
Scholars went to their desks to testify to the glories of Islamic cultures .
Salma Khadra Jayyusi , in the foreword to her magnificent anthology “ The Legacy of Muslim Spain ” ( 1992 ) — a collection of forty - nine essays describing not just the politics and the religion of Muslim Iberia but its cities , architecture , music , poetry , calligraphy , and cooking — calls the omission of Islam from the West ’s story of civilization a “ historical crime . ”
Lewis ’s book is part of that revision .
The Muslims came to Europe , he writes , as “ the forward wave of civilization that was , by comparison with that of its enemies , an organic marvel of coordinated kingdoms , cultures , and technologies in service of a politico - cultural agenda incomparably superior ” to that of the primitive people they encountered there .
They did Europe a favor by invading .
This is not a new idea , but Lewis takes it further : he clearly regrets that the Arabs did not go on to conquer the rest of Europe .
The halting of their advance was instrumental , he writes , in creating “ an economically retarded , balkanized , and fratricidal Europe that . . . made virtues out of hereditary aristocracy , persecutory religious intolerance , cultural particularism , and perpetual war . ”
It was “ one of the most significant losses in world history and certainly the most consequential since the fall of the Roman Empire . ”
This is a bold hypothesis .
The Muslims took most of Spain in a little over three years .
The Visigoths had more men , but the Arabs were very skillful warriors , seeming to dance in front of the enemy , attacking , retreating , attacking again .
Here and elsewhere , Lewis appears to see them as clever underdogs , David to Goliath , Muhammad Ali to George Foreman .
He inventories the great sacks of gold and silver and precious stones that , together with vast numbers of slaves and young women ( harem - bound ) , they sent back to their caliph in Damascus , the capital of the empire .
Included in the shipments were the heads , pickled in brine , that they had removed from Visigoth grandees .
In 714 , they were just short of the Pyrenees , the northern border of Iberia .
The peninsula was now theirs .
They renamed it Al Andalus .
As news of the conquest spread , Arabs from the East streamed into Iberia , and they brought with them the conflicts brewing among them — above all , a nasty feud between northern and southern Arabs .
The first twenty - two emirs ( governors ) of Al Andalus had an average reign of two years apiece .
Stability , or as much of it as Muslim Spain ever had , began with the reign of Abd al - Rahman I , a Syrian - born prince who took over in 756 and managed to stay in power until his death , thirty - two years later .
Rahman is the hero of “ God ’s Crucible . ”
Lewis loves him , and calls him by his sobriquet , the Falcon .
Rahman was a firm ruler — he had taken his throne by force — but he was also a man of the people .
Lewis describes him strolling about the capital city , Córdoba , in a white djellabah , without bodyguards , and preaching at Friday services in the mosque .
Raised in a palace , he was an arts lover .
It was he who built the Great Mosque of Córdoba , the most spectacular extant example of Muslim Spain ’s architectural achievements .
He also botanized , and imported to Spain its first date palms , its first lemons , limes , and grapefruit , as well as almonds , apricots , saffron , and henna .
This of course was good for trade , which flourished during his time .
Accordingly , so did Spain ’s cities , led by Córdoba , which under Rahman had an estimated population of about a hundred thousand .
Lewis describes the metropolis that the emir left to his successors : “ The _qasr ” — _palace — “ was new , completed just as the Falcon ordered the foundations laid for the Friday ( Great ) Mosque .
Not many steps away were the public baths .
Nearby was the central market , where basic commodities of bread , vegetables , fruit , oil , and lamb at regulated prices were upstaged by Persian carpets , Damascus metalware , China silks , fine leather and jewelry , slaves , and much else supplied on demand by the Muslim world economy .
. . .
The capital ’s streets , following no particular pattern from the long wall beside the gray Guadalquivir River , linked neighborhoods where Jews , Berbers , Catholics and Orthodox , Arabs and _muwalladun ” — _non -Arab converts to Islam — “ lived as though in their own separate worlds .
Sephardic apothecaries , Visigoth blacksmiths , and Greek surgeons offered services in these long , narrow arteries . ”
Orange and lemon trees in the public gardens perfumed the air .
Outside the city , “ the long Guadalquivir plain , abundantly irrigated by waterwheels , was carpeted with cereal plantations of wheat , rye , and barley , and olive trees forever . ”
You want to move there .
Rahman was the founder of Muslim Spain ’s famous convivencia .
Translated literally , the word means “ living together , ” in spite of differences , and this idea is the burning center of “ God ’s Crucible . ”
I think it is the reason that Lewis chose to write about Muslim Spain .
He is not an Arabist .
He is best known for a two - volume biography of W. E. B. Du Bois ( 1993 and 2000 ) , which won two Pulitzer Prizes , one for each volume .
But that book , if it is not about Arabs , is about racial justice , and it is for the furtherance of such justice that Lewis so admires Rahman .
Nevertheless , as he points out , the convivencia had its limits .
It was not just a humane policy — an act of obedience to the Koran ( “ There shall be no compulsion in religion ” ) and a way of being civilized — but also a matter of Realpolitik .
Iberia was a ragbag of religious and ethnic groups .
Tolerance , what we would now call multiculturalism , was more likely to hold them together than forced conversion .
Furthermore , the convivencia never involved complete equality .
In the early years , a number of restrictions were placed on Jews and Christians .
They had to wear identification badges .
They could not proselytize , and they were required to pray quietly .
Their houses could not be taller than Muslims ’ houses .
Most important , they had to pay a heavy tax , called the jizya .
In time , many of these rules ( not including the tax ) fell away .
Jews , especially , were allowed to enter public service , as scribes , clerks , advisers .
They taught the Muslims how to run a government , Lewis writes .
The golden age of Al Andalus , he says , was also the golden age of Sefarad , the Sephardic Jews .
But even those who did not have brilliant careers no doubt found badges and taxes preferable to forced conversion or death .
Eventually , many Jews and Christians did convert — probably , in many cases , to avoid the tax .
At the end of the eighth century , the vast majority of people in Iberia were Christians .
Two hundred years later , the majority were Muslims .
The Muslims never ruled all of Iberia .
Certain regions , particularly in the north , remained independent , or were only loosely allied with the emirate , and they repeatedly rebelled .
Then there was the strife within the Muslim populace .
Christians and Jews were not the only ones who received unequal treatment — any non-Arab did .
That included the descendants of the North African Berbers whom the Arabs had added to their empire at the beginning of the eighth century and who came with them to Spain .
The Iberian Berbers were Muslims , and the emirate ’s best warriors .
( Tariq ibn Zayid , who led the invasion of Iberia , was a Berber , and so was his cavalry . )
They also outnumbered the Arabs in Spain .
Therefore , they resented their second - class status .
For much of the history of Al Andalus , the emirs had to deal with Berber revolts .
Another reason the Iberian Arabs had to go back to war was that the conversions to Islam , in freeing people from the jizya , were depleting the treasury .
The emirs had to find more infidels to tax .
Finally , there was the command of jihad .
The Arabs had never meant to stop at the Pyrenees , and , in 732 , only twenty - one years after they entered Iberia , they scaled the great mountains and went down the other side .
The kingdom they were invading was Frankland — roughly , France , Belgium , and parts of western Germany — under the rule of Charles the Hammer , or , in French , Charles Martel .
The Muslims lost some engagements and won others , but because of a Berber revolt at home they were soon forced to withdraw .
In 778 , the Franks — now under the leadership of Charles Martel ’s grandson , Charles I , the Great , or Charlemagne — retaliated .
Second to Rahman , Charlemagne is a hero in Lewis ’s eyes : not just a military genius but a good man and a dashing fellow .
Lewis tells us three times that the Frankish king stood six feet three inches tall .
He pictures him , his blond hair flowing , his blue cape billowing behind him , astride a huge white stallion .
If the Franks were primitive , Lewis says , the peoples whom Charlemagne had conquered — the Saxons , the Lombards , the Avars — were more so .
Their new king tried to improve them .
He imposed chastity on the priests , to their distress ; he forbade incest , apparently a popular practice among the people .
To elevate the culture of Frankland , he founded the Palace School , a combination think tank and college , and imported learned men to staff it , but his efforts were limited by the fact that he was constantly in the field .
Charlemagne ’s neighbors did not submit easily to his rule — especially since , unlike the Muslims , he required them to convert .
So when he was n’t conquering he was reconquering .
That is what ended his Spanish campaign .
After a few months , he received news that the Saxons were in revolt , and he had to go home .

All your other friends could n't come either because you do n't have any other friends because of how unlikable you are .
Unlikable , it says so here in your personnel file : Unlikable .
Liked by no one .
A bitter , unlikable loner whose passing shall not be mourned .
SHALL .
NOT .
BE .
MOURNED .
That 's exactly what it says .
Very formal .
Very official .
It also says you 're adopted , so that 's funny too .

Il generale Roberto Speciale , ex comandante della Guardia di Finanza , è da tempo indagato per aver fatto uso illecito delle strutture e dei mezzi del suo Corpo .
Nonostante si dichiari “ un uomo dalla schiena dritta ” , un servitore della sua Patria , utilizzava mezzi militari e in particolare aerei Atr - 42 come jet privati , non solo per questini di servizio , ma anche per andare in villeggiatura .
Famosi i suoi viaggi Pratica di mare – Bolzano , per raggiungere in fretta Passo Rolle , dove dava feste e passava le vacanze private .
Ovviamente il motivo ufficiale era “ saluto alla componente alpina ” della GdF .
L’inchiesta che la Corte dei Conti sta conducendo ha fatto luce su questi comportamenti , evidenziando una sfacciataggine senza limiti : un ’ora di volo di quegli aerei costa allo Stato 3.885 € , ma il generale pare non se ne curasse .
Nell ’agosto del 2005 ha addirittura richiesto ( in Alto Adige ) una cassa di spigole freschissime , trasportata appunto in aereo .
E’ stata apprezzabile la reazione del pilota , maggiore Venditti : il piano di volo prevedeva “ trasporto autorità ” ( e già qui… ma c’era abituato ) ; vistosi consegnare una cassa di pesce , il maggiore si rifiuta di partire , perchè il piano di volo è semplicemente falso .
Verrà costretto a partire dopo una modifica allo stesso .
A Speciale verrà richiesto un risarcimento di diverse decine di migliaia di euro , a cui va aggiunto “ il danno di immagine al Corpo e alle Istituzioni ” .
Ovviamente la chiusura dell ’inchiesta , arrivata ieri , porterà a nuove polemiche e strumentalizzazioni politiche : dopo lo scontro con il ministro Visco , che lo ha rimosso dalla sua carica ( probabilmente sbagliando il modo e il tempo , ma non a sostanza ) , il generale è stato accolto tra le fila del PdL , ed è candidato n.3 in Umbria .
Seggio sicuro insomma , come le polemiche .
Version Control : Design for Integration July 30 , 2007
Posted by Ian Clatworthy in Bazaar
Can you name a single successful software product where more resources ( time and money ) were spend on developing it than integrating it with other products and systems ?
I do n’t believe such software products exist .
Is that likely to change ?
If not , what can we do about it as software developers ?
And what does that mean for those of us interested in streamlining how developers work in general and delivering better version control tools in particular ?
# 5 on my list of criteria for evaluating version control tools is Integration .
Software exists to get things done and it rarely , if ever , exists in isolation .
The more successful software is , the more pressure there is to integrate it with other tools and systems .
I believe lack of mature integration with other systems will be the # 1 reason for many teams delaying their move from a central VCS tool ( like CVS and SVN ) to a distributed VCS tool ( like Bazaar , Git or Mercurial ) in the next 12 months .
The good news is that the new breed of VCS tools all do a lot right in terms of enabling integration but we need to do much more .
Firstly , we could and ought to be doing more at the core of the new products .
Secondly , we need to get behind the really important integration add - ons and help them reach maturity faster .
At the core product level , Design for Integration comes down to four key things …
The software must be open .
The software needs a layered architecture .
The total solution needs to be manageable .
A rich domain model is highly desirable .
Closed systems are extremely difficult to integrate with .
To ( partially ) quote my own blog title …
Open Software – life is too short for anything else .
At a minimum , systems need to support open protocols or open APIs so other products can talk to the product in a stable way .
Ideally , the system will be open source so integrators can access , understand and improve the integration points .
The benefits of a layered architecture where the UI is decoupled from back - end services is well understood these days .
As well as multiple layers though , multiple communication models are needed – both synchronous and asynchronous .
In other words , systems wanting to integrate cleanly with a product usually need some way of hearing about interesting events in the core product – even if that is just via email – in addition to the more common request - response communication model .
Once the various pieces exist and talk to each other as desired , application management issues become really important .
The big issues here are things like security ( e.g. sharing authentication credentials ) and dependency management between the core product and add - ons .
Do all the pieces have to be upgraded at exactly the same time or can the core be upgraded then the other pieces at another time ?
Finally , it greatly helps if the core product has a rich semantic model at its core .
This makes it easier for external products to communicate in a logical way and minimises the amount of data loss when interchanging data with the core product .
Mark Shuttleworth captures this point nicely in Choose lossless VCS tools if you have that luxury .
Truly caring about integration goes even deeper in my opinion : it means explicitly making it easier to carry / manage attributes from external systems that you may not have nor want in your core model .
Round - tripping between systems , particularly central <-> distributed VCS tools , is and will remain a fact of life .
Once again , I think the leading distributed VCS systems are all off to a great start in terms on enabling integration .
All are open source .
All have a layered architecture .
On the ease of management front , I think Bazaar and Mercurial are ahead of Git thanks to their better plug - in architectures .
On the rich domain model front , Bazaar leads the pack .
As Robert Collins commented in a discussion on Bazaar vs Git , facts plus heuristics is a better direction than just heuristics alone .
As part of the Bazaar team , of course I think it ’s best !
But the things that are common across Bazaar , Mercurial and Git are arguably more important than their differences .
Can we share integration designs and code better across the various distributed VCS communities so all of us get to where we need to be faster ?
So what are the really important integration projects we need to get behind ?
In the Bazaar community , I believe these are :
GUI integration projects , particularly bzr - Eclipse and TortoiseBZR
VCS migration / round - tripping projects , particularly bzr -svn .
To some people , projects like these are uninteresting sugar .
If that ’s you , please help with our performance and documentation drives !
To me though , these projects are some of the most important things going on in the Bazaar community today .
Many developers , let alone less technical project contributors , want version control to be largely transparent .
After all , in great development tools right now , the VCS interface is unified so whether the central repository is hosted in CVS , SVN , Perforce , etc. is largely irrelevant in day to day programming .
Mass adoption of distributed VCS technology will need that same level of ubiquitous integration .
If you ’re looking to get more involved in Bazaar development , integration projects are a great place to help .
In true open source tradition , a small number of passionate people can really make a really big difference .

How to attach a radio tag to a buzzing bumblebee
In a laboratory in the heart of the east end of London , an unmistakeable buzz fills the air .
The small room is packed with bumblebees - hundreds upon hundreds of them going about their business in small wooden hives .
Despite their scientific setting , the insects look just the same as bumblebees found in the wild , apart from one small - really small - difference .
" Bumblebees have a relatively small brain ... but they can achieve rather impressive feats of learning and memory
Dr Nigel Raine
Most are adorned with minuscule silver tags , so tiny that at first they are hard to see .
But every so often , as they catch the laboratory lights , they glint and sparkle , standing out from the bees ' fuzzy bodies .
These tiny accessories are Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) tags - the same technology used to track stock in warehouses or supermarkets or employed for transport systems such as the Oyster Card payment scheme used on the London Underground .
They have been fitted to the bees by scientists at Queen Mary , University of London ( QMUL ) , who want to keep track of the animals ' whereabouts so as to better understand these brainy bugs .
The tiny RFID tag can be just seen above the bee 's wings Biologist Nigel Raine said : " Bumblebees have a relatively small brain - they have about 950,000 brain cells , humans have 100 billion - but they can achieve rather impressive feats of learning and memory given what they have got . "
Recent research has revealed that bees are able to recognise individual human faces , which , according to Dr Raine , is not that surprising given the daily challenges they face whilst foraging .
He explained : " When you think about your average park or meadow there might be dozens of species of flowers which are all different in terms of colour and shape and scent , and they are all differing in the rewards they are providing .
" Ultimately , the bees ' job is to go and find the best rewards from these flowers and they have to be flexible and learn and remember information , all the while making and breaking associations .
This is all really quite complicated . "
Their navigational skills are impressive , too .
" These tiny animals leave their nests , fly back and forth between flowers , then they are somehow able to add all of these vectors together and fly back to their nest in a straight line , " said Dr Raine .
Artificial flowers
The QMUL team , led by Professor Lars Chittka , is now using RFID tags to better explore these feats of memory .
The lab is abuzz with bees " These tags allow us to collect data from the bees without disturbing them and they help us to monitor a lot of bees simultaneously , " Dr Raine told the BBC News website .
" Before we had them , we would have to stop the bee , record which bee it was , weigh it , then put it back to continue its business . "
The RFID devices , which are incredibly small so they do not affect behaviour , store information about the individual bees ( the researchers are studying Bombus terrestris , one of 16 species of true bumblebee ) .
The tags are attached to enable the team to monitor bee foraging Each time the bees pass by an RFID reader , the reader records and saves information about the individual bee , where it is and when it is there .
The scientist said : " As well as placing readers at the entrances of the hives to see who is going in and out of them , we are starting to use the RFID readers on artificial flowers - feeding stations that function like a flower - so we can measure who is visiting them and when . "
Aiding conservation
In the wild , bees will often visit flowers in a sequence that they repeat time and time again .
" This makes sense biologically , " explained Dr Raine .
" If you take the nectar out of the flowers , they will begin to refill , so you do not want to visit that flower again until it is as full up as possible . "
But what is really clever , he adds , is that the bees will work out shortcuts so that they can create the shortest , most efficient journey possible .
" We are really interested to see how they form these routes - we call them " traplines " - and we are using RFID technology to help us to understand how the bees are performing these feats of spatial learning . "
Bees solve complex problems while foraging
The results of the study could lead to some unusual future applications .
Dr Raine said : " There are a number of problems in computer science , logistical problems to do with how you move through networks and how you go the shortest distance between various points .
" We are hoping the RFID tags will help us to find out how bees , with their small brains , can find optimal or near optimal solutions to finding the shortest routes between flowers .
" And by finding out how they are doing this , we are hoping it could lead to some simple rules of thumb to solving similar network problems in computing . "
But computer science is not the only application of the RFID work .
Bees around Europe have suffered a huge drop in numbers in recent years : three species in the UK have recently become extinct ; another eight are in serious decline .
Scientists believe that habitat degradation around their nesting and foraging sites could be to blame .
Dr Raine said : " In terms of biodiversity , bumblebees are hugely important pollinators , yet most species are becoming increasingly rare .
" Understanding the differences in how they actually forage is very important for aiding conservation . "

Books with more than 100 pages are a turn - off Gossip magazines and song lyrics are the favourite reading material of children aged 11 to 14 , says a study .
The National Year of Reading report shows that more youngsters are choosing online sites as a reading source .
Not all parents are comfortable with this shift and many have told off their children for choosing material that is not " proper reading " , says the survey .
Anything set for homework , and Shakespeare , come out as the least favourite reading materials .
The Read Up , Fed Up report is an insight into the reading habits of young people and the conclusion of a month - long research project co-ordinated by National Year of Reading and online teen community Piczo .
In the Read Up section of favourites , Heat magazine came first with Bliss magazine and online song lyrics joint second .
We may be only just starting to understand the dynamics of online reading , but adults need to feel more positive about it and to learn more about it
Honor Wilson - Fletcher , director , National Year of Reading Other favourites in the top 10 were the Harry Potter series , Anne Frank 's Diary and the BBC website .
The Fed Up column had homework in first place , followed by Shakespeare and books with more than 100 pages .
Others in this list of 10 least favourites included " reading about skinny celebrities in magazines " , " the books I am made to read by school / my teachers " - and the Financial Times .
More than 1,300 young people took part in the survey , which found that 45 % of youngsters had been reprimanded by parents for reading something that was not " proper reading " .
Gender differences National Year of Reading director Honor Wilson - Fletcher said : " Young people are web natives - exposed to a wider variety of reading material than any previous generation through the explosion of digital media .
" It seems not all adults are comfortable with this shift , and are often discouraging teens from taking advantage of this new reading landscape .
" Accessing the digital universe is absolutely central to life 's opportunities for teens .
" We may be only just starting to understand the dynamics of online reading , but adults need to feel more positive about it and to learn more about it . "
The research found a gender divide to reading with 31 % of boys saying they love reading because it helps them become better at their hobbies , like sport , films or music .
On the other hand 39 % of girls said they loved it because it is an escape - quiet time they can enjoy on their own .
Schools Minister Jim Knight said : " It is vital that young people have the opportunity to read widely .
" It is wonderful that 80 % of the teenagers surveyed write their own stories and keep up - to - date with current affairs by using sites like BBC Online .
" It 's wonderful that Anne Frank 's Diary is still proving so popular among teenagers 60 years after it was written . "
Compiling their own online blogs came fourth in the Read Up rankings and 80 % of those taking part said they had written their own story , film , play or song .

When the US sneezes the world catches cold
Continued .
Read Part
I of the article here
When the US sneezes the world catches cold
It is said that when the US sneezes the world catches cold .
This was true before but the world has started to think that it can decouple itself from the US economy .
Here the umbilical cord is the US dollar ; once that is cut , slowly but surely the decoupling will take place ; with dire consequences for the US .
As I mentioned before , already some important oil producing nations have decided to abandon the dollar .
Others have decided to de-peg their currencies .
Others such as China have started thinking about reducing their reserves in dollars .
Once others begin to do the same the dollar will cease to be the international reserve and trade currency of choice .
Meanwhile , major trading partners have to just bite the bullet and accept the consequences of holding to the dollar .
You know the saying that if you owe the bank one hundred thousand dollars you are in trouble , but if you owe the bank one hundred million dollars , the bank is in trouble .
Currently US owes foreigners over two trillion dollars .
In addition many trillions of dollars are also held in foreign central banks .
These countries are in trouble and they will try hard to stabilise the US economy , if only for saving their own money .
But they do n’t do this out of love .
They just need stability to reduce their dollar holdings gradually and hence save as much of their reserves as possible .
If they mention this openly , the dollar will collapse over - night and they lose .
So the long - term plan would be to reduce their exposure to the dollar as gradually and as quietly as possible .
This of course does n’t mean that the value of dollar will not fluctuate ; it simply means that over time dollar will become just like any other currencies and will be treated similarly .
The Federal Reserves will no longer be able to just print money and refuse to publish the M3 statistics .
US will also need to begin building reserves in other currencies .
Today US dollar has no backing .
People accept dollar on faith alone .
Imagine if that faith suddenly disappears .
Will you exchange 1 kg of green paper for 1000 Microwaves ?
I doubt it .
But meanwhile the world ’s economy will experience the negative effects from the US economic downturn .
The most affected areas will be China and other Asian “ emerging ” economies and European Union .
The case for the European Union is straight forward .
A flight from dollar to Euro makes the EU ’s export much more expensive , just when one of its biggest trading partners “ US ” goes into recession .
European Union will also feel the pains of financial crisis of the US .
Many EU financial institutions had invested in US and now they will have to accept the losses .
So we will see a down ward trend in Europe , but not as severe as the one in US .
In addition European Central Bank has still a lot of room for manoeuvre .
It can reduce interest rates substantially .
EU also has smaller total deficit than US .
Most importantly , most of the EU countries have solid social security nets in place which will dampen the effects on their citizens .
China on the other hand lacks this social security net , but has large foreign reserves .
Most of this reserve has been the result of its exports .
Last year its trade surplus with US was over $ 200 billion .
This surplus will diminish substantially over the coming year , unless of course the US continues to spend the money that it does n’t have .
But in general , a recession in US and a slowing economy in EU will impact China negatively .
Its exports will decline and its unemployment will increase , something that the Chinese government is very sensitive to .
China suffers from double digit unemployment rate , something that the Chinese government is reluctant to discuss openly .
For example in 2004 the RAND estimated the actual Chinese unemployment to be 23 % .
Things have n’t improved that much since then .
Even if the unemployment rate was down to 15 % , it still presents a very large number .
So China will most likely embark on large infrastructure projects to keep unemployment levels stable .
The government will also try to improve its social security programs and pay more attention to the interior of the country , where the benefits of double digit growth has not reached yet .
The economic growth will also be reduced to single digits , relieving some pressure off the oil prices .
India will fare worse than China simply because its population growth is higher than China while it lacks the Chinese reserves and resources .
According to the Indian government forecast , India needs to create 10 million new jobs per year to keep its unemployment rate steady .
But others put that figure at 15 million .
An Indian national report on employment situation has warned that nearly 30 % of the country ’s 716 million - strong workforce will be without jobs by 2020 .
This of course is a conservative estimate based on continued solid economic growth ; something that , at least with the current economic outlook , is highly unlikely .
Stock - market : The Near Term- outlook
The outlook as you have guessed is not good .
I have been waiting for this crash since mid 2006 and what kept it from happening was what Greenspan called the “ irrational exuberance ” of the investors .
The market , especially the US markets , will plunge further .
I see Dow Jones below 11500 and Nasdaq at 1900 .
The full picture of financial crisis is still hidden and full cost of the coming bailouts will not be known till autumn .
Of course this is not written in stone .
The US government may come to its senses and decides to act responsibly and allow many companies and banks to go under .
It may try to support dollar .
It may try to cut the budget deficit or the trade deficit .
It may even decide that its war in Iraq was not and is not such a good idea and withdraw its troops .
It may even try to get friendly with Venezuela and Iran , thereby reduce both the price of oil and pressure on the dollar .
The truth is that it is the US president that can do these things and not the Federal Reserves .
We just have to wait for the elections and see who is elected as the next president .
It is my opinion that no other US president has ever damaged United States as much as George Bush , and he will be remembered by both the Americans and others as one of the most unpopular US presidents ever .
But he is at the end of his second term and has only a year to destroy the rest of the economy .
Let us hope that he will be busy with other things and does n’t do more damage .
Let us also hope that the American people will not fall for promises of further tax cuts and glories in battle fields abroad .
Neither brings peace and prosperity .

Raising the Bar on China German Pole Vaulter Plans Tibet Protest at Olympics

Although Olympic regulations prohibit political statements , Battke wants athletes to dress up as Tibetan monks and Chinese officials and symbolically shake hands .
Feb 22 , 2008 ( CIDRAP News ) – Influenza activity was widespread in 49 US states by the end of last week , up from 44 states a week earlier , but the epidemic 's growth was not as dramatic as it was the previous week , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) said today .
Nancy Cox , MD , chief of the CDC 's influenza division , told reporters at a media teleconference today that Florida is the only state reporting only regional activity .
" Flu activity has continued to increase , but not quite as dramatically as the increases we 've seen over the previous 2 weeks , " she said .
" From a 10 - year perspective , we are within the normal parameters of what we 'd expect for an influenza season , " she said .
Cox said the predominant influenza subtype in the United States is still A /H3N2 , though H1N1 subtypes were more common at the beginning of the season .
Most of the H3N2 isolates the CDC has analyzed so far involve the A / Brisbane / 10/2007 - like variant , which does not match this season 's vaccine .
According to the most recent surveillance information , for the week ending Feb 16 , 79 % ( 55 ) of the H3N2 samples the CDC analyzed were the Brisbane variant .
Among the 69 influenza B samples the CDC has analyzed , 94 % ( 64 ) were in the Yamagata lineage , which also is not included in this year 's vaccine .
In contrast , 88 % ( 124 of 141 ) of H1N1 isolates analyzed so far matched the Solomon Islands strain used in the vaccine .
The number of pediatric deaths related to the flu rose to 22 last week , up 12 from the previous week 's total , Cox reported .
Although only one of the three flu subtypes circulating this year is well matched by the vaccine , CDC officials say they have n't noted any unusual patterns of clinical consequences .
Cox said the CDC often receives anecdotal reports of influenza in patients who have received the vaccine , even in years when the circulating viruses and the vaccine are well matched .
She said the CDC is conducting studies of the effectiveness of this year 's vaccine and will publish the results in an upcoming issue of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report .
Physicians ' impressions of flu season
Some physicians contacted by CIDRAP
News this week stopped short of describing the flu season as worse than usual , despite the irregularities that have been reported with the vaccine and circulating strains .
William Schaffner , MD , chair of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville , said flu has been increasing in Tennessee recently , but he expects the season to be no worse than average .
Schaffner also is vice president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases .
" In the middle Tennessee area we 're certainly seeing a lot of flu - like illness , and my sense is when the more specific diagnostic tests are being used , they 're coming up positive , " he said .
" My sense is that we 're going to have a moderate influenza season , not one that 'll fill every bed in every hospital .
But it 's brisk — doctors and emergency rooms are getting lots of calls . "
Noting that one flu strain in the vaccine ( H1N1 ) matches well with viruses circulating in the United States , Schaffner said he was not worried about the imperfect match between the vaccine and viruses .
" I 'm not at all distressed that we have one bull 's eye , one a little off the bull 's eye , and one that misses the target completely .
That 's pretty good , " he said .
" The major reason we give influenza vaccine is to prevent the complications of flu , " Schaffner added .
The vaccine may provide complete protection for young people with robust immune systems , he explained .
In frail people , the vaccine often yields incomplete protection , but it may still prevent pneumonia , hospitalization , or worse , he said .
He added that mismatches between the vaccine and the viruses happen " with some frequency . "
Most of the time , " The issue is not whether there 's a mismatch , but by how much .
Analyses almost always indicate you have some protection . "
Henry " Hank " Bernstein , DO , chief of general pediatrics at the Children 's Hospital at Dartmouth , in Lebanon , N.H. , said the flu season was quiet in his area until a few weeks ago .
However , Bernstein , a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics ' Committee on Infectious Diseases , said he has heard anecdotal reports from across the nation of vaccinated patients who were sick with flu .
" I emphasize that there are still vaccine doses available and that people should continue to get their immunizations until the spring , " he said .
" There are different peaks at different times throughout the season . "
Priya Sampathkumar , MD , an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn. , said in an e-mail that she has seen influenza infections in vaccinated patients , but that the disease seems less severe in such instances .
Tamiflu resistance
European health officials have reported increasing rates of oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ) resistance in circulating influenza A / H1N1 viruses this season , and the CDC has also found a higher prevalence of resistant isolates than in previous years .
In its most recent update , the CDC said it has tested 471 flu viruses and found that 27 ( 5.7 % ) had the oseltamivir resistance mutation , up slightly from the 4.6 % reported a week ago .
All were H1N1 viruses .
In contrast , less than 1 % of H1N1 viruses tested last year showed resistance .
Cox told reporters today that the CDC has received only sporadic reports of antiviral resistance from eight states .
" We are increasing our surveillance for it , and we 've solicited a lot of samples from state health departments , " she said .
The Illinois Department of Public Health ( IDPH ) on Feb 14 issued an alert to healthcare providers about 10 Chicago - area patients that had antiviral - resistant flu infections ; eight were from an outbreak at a single facility , which has not been named , according to a Feb 17 report from the Chicago Tribune .
The IDPH statement advised that influenza patients who are in intensive care should receive a combination of antiviral drugs until their viral samples are analyzed , the Tribune reported .
Schaffner said the reports of oseltamivir resistance are not affecting physicians ' treatment decisions : " That 's not playing a role at all in how physicians in this neck of the woods are using Tamiflu .
Doctors are using it a lot .
They 're urging patients to come in early .
Physicians have really gotten the message that you can shorten the duration and severity of influenza by treating [ with antivirals ] . "
" I think it would be very difficult for those of us in practice to detect that [ resistance ] on a clinical level , " he commented .

John McCain will likely go down in history as the first GOP presidential nominee who vaulted to the front of the pack despite failing to win a plurality among self - identified Republicans in any of the early state primaries .
According to Florida exit polls , the Arizona senator tied Mitt Romney among voters who described themselves as Republican but pulled away to victory with a nearly 2 - 1 advantage among independents .
That formula -- battle to a draw for Republicans , stomp all comers among independents -- powered McCain ’s wins in New Hampshire and South Carolina and has made him the front - runner heading into Super Tuesday .
It ’s no mystery why independents gravitate toward McCain .
He ’s a country - first , party - second kind of guy who speaks bluntly and delights in poking fellow Republicans in the eye on issues such as campaign finance reform and global warming .
But there ’s a bizarre disconnect in the warm embrace between McCain and the electorate ’s mavericks .
They hate the Iraq war , while he ’s willing to fight it for another century .
The most pro-war presidential candidate in a decade is winning the 2008 GOP nomination thanks to the antiwar vote .

A full 66 % of independents think that the U.S. should completely withdraw from Iraq no later than 12 months from now , according to a Jan. 18- 22 L.A .
Times / Bloomberg poll .
McCain , meanwhile , said last month that the U.S. might stay in Baghdad for another 100 years .
He continually expresses bafflement at the idea that that might not be such a good thing .
“ It ’s not the point !
It ’s not the point ! ” he snarled at reporters recently .
“ How long are we going to be in Korea ? ”
And yet he dominated the antiwar vote in New Hampshire , with 44 % to Romney ’s 19 % , according to CNN exit polls .
Ron Paul , the only actual antiwar Republican running , drew just 16 % of voters who said they were against the war .
The three finished in the same order among antiwar voters in Michigan , even though Romney won the state overall .
The same pattern holds true in the case of voters who despise George W. Bush .
In Florida , for example , McCain clobbered Romney 48 % to 18 % among those who described themselves as “ angry ” at the president , according to MSNBC exit polls .
So the voters most hostile to the war are backing a potential commander in chief who makes Bush look gun-shy .
More than three years before the Bush administration elucidated the radical doctrine of preemptive war , McCain unveiled a plan during his first run at the presidency called “ rogue - state rollback , ” in which “ we politically and materially support indigenous forces within and outside of rogue states ” -- including Iraq , North Korea and Serbia -- “ to overthrow regimes that threaten our interests and values . ”
And if the “ odious regimes ” crack down on freedom fighters , the U.S. should respond with force .
In that campaign , McCain was the neocons ’ choice against the more internationally “ humble ” George Bush .

McCain has advocated threatening North Korea with “ extinction , ” and memorably sung about how we should “ bomb bomb bomb , bomb bomb Iran . ”
He agitated for military intervention in Darfur , regrets that we did n’t send troops to Rwanda and is fond of rattling sabers in the general direction of Moscow and Beijing .
During the U.S. bombing of Kosovo in 1999 -- when McCain showily suspended his presidential campaign because he ’d rather lose a campaign than lose a war -- the senator drew media raves for managing to support the intervention while simultaneously slamming the president for not threatening more overwhelming force .

If the U.S. has an imperialist class , as historian ( and informal McCain advisor ) Niall Ferguson has advocated , then John McCain sits at its head .
Still , too many people , wowed by the candidate ’s considerable charm , have convinced themselves that launching wars is for icky people like that Bush fellow , not Our John .
“ He knows war , ” the Des Moines Register wrote , in one of roughly 17,000 newspaper endorsements of McCain over the last two months , “ something we believe would make him reluctant to start one . ”
For Californians tempted by such delusions , it ’s wise to recall the famous words of the last septuagenarian to successfully seek the presidency :

Sir Tony Hoare - British computing pioneer and senior scientist at Microsoft Research - believes the computer industry needs a " grand challenge " to inspire it .
In the same way that the lunar challenge in the 1960s sparked a decade of collaborative innovation and development in engineering and space technology , or the human genome project united biologists around the globe , so too must computer scientists pull together on such a scale to take their industry to its next major milestone .
Speaking last Tuesday at an open day at Microsoft Research 's lab in Cambridge , Hoare told the audience of around 60 journalists and analysts that there are seven such challenges facing researchers today .
Significantly , these are not purely computational challenges , but involve a mix of disciplines from biology and psychology , right through to quantum physics .
This reflects how much other areas rely on and use IT to support their research , but also the changing nature of computer science itself .
By 2020 , Hoare predicts , the world will contain 100 times as many computers as it does now , each with 100 times as much power and memory , all interconnected .
And to best understand this world , he says , we should not think of it as containing many discrete computing devices , but as a global ubiquitous computer ( GUC ) .
He argues that in this world , the classical theory of computation , based on Turing 's description of a single , localised machine sequentially executing a deterministic program to completion , no longer applies .
One of the grand challenges , then , is to re-write the basic foundations of the science , to find a theory of computation that is " more realistic than the Turing model , and can take into account the discoveries of biology , and the promise of the quantum computer " .
" Computations carried out in nature , for example in the brain and body of a living organism , are nothing at all like that .
They are widely distributed over space and over time ; they essentially involve massively parallel operation ; they involve continuous interaction with their environment ; and they are highly non-deterministic , " Hoare says .
In this way , the global ubiquitous computer is much more like a living organism than the Turing machine .
Wanted : life models
The links between the computing and biological sciences do n't stop there .
Perhaps the grandest of the grand challenges for computing are about modelling life , in particular , developing a model of an organism that will make predictions that will be experimentally testable .
To make progress , Hoare suggests the project " will probably concentrate on the same simple organisms that are the subject of widest biological experiments , for example the thale - weed Arabidopsis Thaliana " .
But Hoare has grander plans still .
" An ultimate joint challenge for the biological and the computational sciences is the understanding of the mechanisms of the human brain , and its relationship with the human mind , " he says .
" A single human brain has about a hundred million million nerve cells ... and a computer program that throws light on the mind / brain problem will have to incorporate the deepest insights of biologists , nerve scientists , psychologists , physiologists , linguists , social scientists , and even philosophers .
This challenge is one that has inspired Computer Science since its very origins , when Alan Turing himself first proposed the Turing Test as a still unmet challenge for artificial intelligence . "
Computational phenomena
The Cambridge facility is one of five facilities run by Microsoft Research , an independent sub-section of the software giant .
The other labs are based in China and the US , with the bulk of the research coming out of Redmond .
The group 's remit is to research pure computer science , rather than to develop products .
Hoare , who was knighted in March 2000 for his services to computer science , joined the lab when he retired from Oxford University .
Among his achievements in his career in industry and academia , is the development of the first commercial compiler for the programming language Algol 60 .
He argues that the approach to Grand Challenges , in any discipline , is driven primarily by scientific curiosity and idealism and a desire to understand basic phenomena , in this case computational phenomena .
" It is easy to predict that some of the discoveries of research directed towards Grand Challenges - but only the most unexpected ones , and at the most unexpected times - will be the basis of revolutionary improvements in the way that we exploit the power of our future computing devices . " ®

Trial participants will wear the helmet for 10 minutes a day
It delivers low levels of infra-red light , which researchers at the University of Sunderland , believe may stimulate the growth of brain cells .
Tests in mice showed it improved learning ability and a study in humans is due to begin in the summer .
Current treatments for Alzheimer 's delay progression of the disease but cannot reverse memory loss .
The infra-red therapy was first developed to treat cold sores .
We look forward to further research to determine whether it could help improve cognition in humans
Alzheimer 's Society
But when researchers studied how it worked , they found it stimulated growth of cells and may have applications in other conditions .
Daily therapy
In tests in people with dementia using infra-red lasers , eight out of nine people showed some improvement , said Dr Gordon Dougal , a GP and director of Virulite , a medical research company based in County Durham .
However , in order to safely deliver the treatment through the scalp , he developed a helmet which bathes the brain in low levels of infra-red light and would only need to be worn for 10 minutes a day .
Trials of around a 100 people with age - related memory problems will now look to see if the beneficial results seen in mice can be replicated in humans .
Dr Dougal said as cells age they lose the ability to repair and regenerate themselves , which in the brain leads to loss of memory .
" Currently all you can do with dementia is to slow down the rate of decay - this new process will not only stop that rate of decay but partially reverse it , " he added .
The Alzheimer 's Society said it was a potentially interesting technique .
" A treatment that reverses the effects of dementia rather than just temporarily halting its symptoms could change the lives of the hundreds of thousands of people who live with this devastating condition .
" We look forward to further research to determine whether it could help improve cognition in humans .
" Only then can we begin to investigate whether near infra-red could benefit people with dementia . "
Emil Sundberg asks :
When serving thousands of customers with Basecamp , Highrise etc there must be a lot of advanced features though , how do you document your projects ?
How easy is it for a newly hired developer to understand how your products work .
The short answer is that we do n’t document our projects .
At least not in the traditional sense of writing a tome that exists outside of the code base that somebody new to a project would go read .
I have n’t ever seen that work consistently and successfully at any software company I ’ve been involved with .
Further more , I do n’t really find it necessary for the kind of work that we do .
Our biggest product , Basecamp , is about 10,000 lines of code .
That really is n’t a whole lot in the grand scheme of things .
Everything we do is build is also using Ruby on Rails , which means that most Rails programmers would know their way around our applications straight away .
It ’s the same conventions and patterns used throughout .
We try to do a fairly good job at keeping our test suites current and exhaustive as well .
Basecamp has a 1:1.2 ratio of test code ( thanks to the persistence of Jamis ! ) , Highrise has a ratio of 1:0.8 ( bad me ! ) .
So you can change things in the applications and feel fairly comfortable that you at least have n’t killed the entire application if you make a mistake as the tests would catch that .
Finally , we write our application in a wonderfully expressive and succinct programming language like Ruby that leads itself very well to a programming style like the one Kent Beck preaches in Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns .
Keep your methods short and expressive .
On average , our models have methods just four lines long .
Adding documentation to a method should usually only be done when you ’re doing something non-obvious that ca n’t be rewritten in an obvious way .
Writing documentation for your code base is a very heavy , upfront , planning kind of way to go about things .
Maybe that ’s what you need some times if you work in an environment that ’s especially onerous or if you have very complex policies and strategies you ’re implementing .
But if you ’re not burdened with such things , I ’d recommend trying to work on the quality of the code itself and see if you can get by with sparring with new developers .
Got a question for us ?
Got a question about design , business , marketing , etc ?
We ’re happy to try to provide some insight into how we ’d tackle the problem .
Just email svn [ at ] 37 signals dot com with the subject “ Ask 37signals ” .
Thanks .
Concerned that it could lose several primaries and caucuses through the rest of February , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s campaign sought to create an alternate storyline of success on Thursday by announcing that Mrs. Clinton had raised $ 7.5 million online so far this month .
That unusually high figure was quickly overshadowed by Senator Barack Obama ’s announcement that he had raised the same amount in 36 hours since the 22 - state contest on Tuesday , in addition to the $ 32 million that he raised in January .
Mrs. Clinton drew $ 13.5 million in January .
With Tuesday behind them , the rivals have turned some of their ferocity away from voters and toward their donors , seeking the clear - cut victory in fund - raising that neither could secure at the ballot box this week , when Mr. Obama won 13 states and Mrs. Clinton 9 .
Mr. Obama ’s fund - raising dominance , especially his announcement on Jan. 31 that he had raised $ 32 million , has sent jitters through Mrs. Clinton ’s donor base .
Some of her biggest donors grew even more concerned on Wednesday when her advisers said that she had lent the campaign $ 5 million of her own money and that some senior aides were working this month without salaries .
Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney remarked recently that , as president , he would focus on the problems of the great bulk of the American people rather than on the very poor , who enjoyed a “ safety net . ”
Since Governor
Romney seemed to think that the very poor , plus perhaps the very rich , constituted maybe 5 % of the population , one might parse his comments to mean that he was thinking of disabled people of working age .
That did not prevent his opponents from taking the occasion to portray him on one hand as a neo -Social Darwinist who hoped that the poor would die in the snow to reduce the surplus population and on the other as a guardian of the welfare state who believed that the 20th - century social safety net was sustainable and desirable .
Frankly , the governor ’s remarks were plainly made off the top of his head , and cannot reasonably be used to ascertain anything he might think about social policy in general or the care of the poor in particular .
Such remarks are best used as hooks to hang speculation about points the governor might have made had he had any interest in the matter .
* * *
Editorial Note : Readers will have noted that although Mr. Romney has not been governor of anything for some time , he is nonetheless referred to as “ Governor ” above .
The usage conforms to this blog ’s policy of encouraging the restoration of honorifics before surnames in public discourse ; it is good practice to normally refer to people who have held important public office with their last title .
So , even people who are no longer associated with pubic institutions should still be referred to as “ Senator , ” Ambassador , ” or “ Prisoner 6754Xc5 , ” as the case may be .
* * *
As a rule , the people who care about the poor really should not design public institutions with them in mind .
When you do , the result is often public services fit for indigents .
The most conspicuous example of this is mass - transportation policy .
There is an argument to be made that rail - based urban transportation is not particularly efficient , but the fact is that people like trains .
At any rate , people in nice suits can tolerate getting into a train or trolley in a suburb in the morning to come to a city center .
Buses , on the other hand , tend to become a filter against the bourgeois .
Middle - class people will take them out of necessity , but not after they can afford not to .
Good transportation systems , in the sense of systems that are reasonably comfortable to use , do not force this choice .
They are designed for the respectable ; the unworthy benefit as an afterthought .
The same principle applies to health care systems and education .
Governments might , for budgetary or cultural reasons , decide that these things should normally be provided by the market , with a public “ safety - net ” for people the market ca n’t serve .
That decision means that you have decided to tolerate the formation of social castes .
By and by , you will discover that the lower caste is not going to be frictionally small .
It is going to be a large part , perhaps a plurality , of a society that is intransitive , not of a piece , whose members identify horizontally rather than vertically .

The Next American Nation by Michael Lind is a book I reviewed 17 years ago .
( 17 years !?!)
Though I did not and do n’t find the author ’s views ideologically congenial , nonetheless the book is has held up depressingly well as description , if not necessarily as forecast .
American “ elites ” really did decide at some point in the 1970s for efficiency over solidarity , with what results we see in the decline in income equality and the redistribution of insecurity downward .
“ Elite ” has to go into scare quotes .
The search for the Responsible Parties tends to degenerate into political sloganeering .
The silliest slogan is perhaps the Occupy Movement ’s villainous 1 % ; to the extent , you can use the term “ class ” here , the group in question is more like 20 % , and the Occupiers are members of it .
Lind ’s depiction of the Overclass is a better approximation in terms of size and ideology , but his model is still “ populist . ”
He still assumes the existence of a people whose virtue is being outraged .
Furthermore , his view of the Overclass may need updating .
Perhaps a more recent book I should read is Charles Murray ’s Coming Apart : The State of White America , 1960 - 2010 , which apparently deals with many of the issues in the Lind book ( no honorific needed : “ Lind ” is an adjective here ) .
I know the book only from reviews and editorials , like this one from David Brooks
Roughly 7 percent of the white kids in the upper tribe are born out of wedlock , compared with roughly 45 percent of the kids in the lower tribe .
In the upper tribe , nearly every man aged 30 to 49 is in the labor force .
In the lower tribe , men in their prime working ages have been steadily dropping out of the labor force , in good times and bad … .
People in the lower tribe are much less likely to get married , less likely to go to church , less likely to be active in their communities , more likely to watch TV excessively , more likely to be obese … Murray ’s story contradicts the ideologies of both parties .
Republicans claim that America is threatened by a decadent cultural elite that corrupts regular Americans , who love God , country and traditional values .
That story is false .
The cultural elites live more conservative , traditionalist lives than the cultural masses …
The truth is , members of the upper tribe have made themselves phenomenally productive .
They may mimic bohemian manners , but they have returned to 1950s traditionalist values and practices .
They have low divorce rates , arduous work ethics and strict codes to regulate their kids …
Members of the lower tribe work hard and dream big , but are more removed from traditional bourgeois norms .
They live in disorganized , postmodern neighborhoods in which it is much harder to be self - disciplined and productive .
The proportions of the total population in the upper group is about 20 % , in the lower about 30 % .
Again , we are to some extent just seeing the return of older social patterns .
In 18th - century England , there was a similar tendency for the lower orders ( a majority of the population ) to have informal family structures , only spotty connection with organized religion , and regrettable personal habits that involved gin , a cowboy rug , and communicable diseases .
Their betters , fearing with some reason their servants might murder them in their beds if they did not take matters in hand , then undertook to make cosmic busybodies of themselves in terms of social reform .
By the middle of the 20th century , the campaign had produced remarkably egalitarian societies with high political morale .
Within two decades the elites relaxed , perhaps believing that Spanish - speaking servants will be better behaved .
This attitude of nonchalance may not wholly misplaced .
A less labor - intensive society does not require such a self - disciplined working class , particularly if the upper caste is large in absolute terms .
* * *
Where does this all lead ?
If you believe the Roman analogy , we are almost due for something like a post - Gracchan Restoration , which was a revolution tricked out as a conservative reaction .
( The constitutional gimcrackery advocated by so much of the American Right smacks of what Sulla did to the Republican Constitution somewhat later . )
Such events are nominally conservative , but they are in fact a case of one faction of Optimates leapfrogging over another .
So here is a paradox for the 2012 election : President Obama could be the forlorn conservative , standing astride the train tracks of history and crying “ Halt ! ” to the Spengler Express . …

Houston Chronicle :
CNN said it should n't have used a former U.S. attorney who quit his job after allegedly biting a stripper as an analyst about New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer 's prostitution scandal .
No mention of Kendall Coffey 's past was made when anchor Tony Harris interviewed him Tuesday on the legal questions surrounding Spitzer 's case .
Coffey quit his job in May 1996 after being accused of biting a topless dancer on the arm during a visit to an adult club after losing a big drug case .
Coffey talked on CNN about what kind of charges the New York governor could face .
Spitzer is accused of having a high - priced call girl visit his hotel room during a visit to Washington last month .
While Coffey 's past is known to CNN 's booking department , it was n't to the person who set up Harris ' segment .
CNN spokesman Nigel Pritchard blamed a " miscommunication . "
" Coffey has been a guest on CNN in the past but was probably not the right one for this story , " Pritchard said .
There were a few real estate related funds in the UK that took similar actions last month .
As much as the big financial companies would like us to believe they ’re OK , this is alarming .
This is not that different from a traditional run on the bank .
Citigroup has barred investors in one of its hedge funds from withdrawing their money , and a new leveraged fund lost 52 percent in its first three months , the Wall Street Journal reported Friday .
The largest U.S. bank suspended redemptions in CSO Partners , a fund specializing in corporate debt , after investors tried to pull more than 30 percent of its roughly $ 500 million of assets , the newspaper said .
Citigroup injected $ 100 million to stabilize the fund , which lost 10.9 percent last year , the newspaper said .
Britney Spears Weekend Paparazzi Caper ( Videos , Photos )
has been dying to take back the spotlight from little sisand we 've got the goods to show the trainwreck celebrity doing what she does best - looking foolish for all the world to witness .
The singer apparently called up a well known photographer and asked him to meet her at The Peninsula Hotel .
From there , they went joy riding and make many stops along the way .
During the course of the evening the obliging paparazzi shot video of the bizarre antics of Britney .
Kevin Federline 's lawyers are likely to have a field day with this new batch of evidence .
Smooth move , Britney .
We 've got video and still photos too .
Enjoy the ride .
The first video shows Britney stopping along the way to take some photographs of a mural .
She gets mad and throws her camera to the ground .
When the memory stick pops out she accuses the Pap of taking it .
When it is discovered practically under her feet , she gets over her snit .
Britney appears to need the restroom at regular intervals .
We 're not sure what she does behind closed doors but we can guess .
This video is at the end of the evening when Brit 's favorite Pap of the evening leaves her hotel room at 4:30 am and chats it up with his fellow photogs .
He admits that he should have taken many more pictures of the evening but declared that he did n't care .
He had the best night of his life .
Must have gotten lucky with the trainwreck - if you can call it that .
Hope he 's had his shots .
We 've got additional pictures from the weekend romp .

Kate Moss may be a cocaine addict with awful taste in men - but at least she has a big heart .
Obviously feeling sorry for a certain High School Musical actress , the model was once again spotted without a shirt on in public .
It 's a valiant effort to take attention away from Vanessa Hudgens nude photos .
But we doubt it 's gonna work .
We wonder if this Kate Moss nude picture is also intended for Drake Bell .
Probably not .
Feb. 15 , 2008  --
Here 's a toast to the superiority of pragmatists over idealists .
Of entrepreneurs over bureaucrats .
And most of all to those buzz - cut , buttoned - down engineers and scientists of a half - century ago who thought they were just making cheaper transistors – and now may help save the world .
Amidst all of the gloomy – or , at best , hesitant – corporate financial news of the last few weeks , one industry sector literally seems aglow : solar .
And therein lies an interesting morality – or more accurately , amorality – tale .
Just this week , First Solar Inc. , a Phoenix - based solar module manufacturer with a design center in Ohio and a big manufacturing plant in Germany , announced spectacular quarterly numbers .
For the fourth quarter , company earnings were $ 63 million , up nearly 800 percent from the same quarter a year ago .
Meanwhile , revenues only quadrupled to $ 201 million .
Not surprisingly , company stock jumped 30 percent , to nearly $ 230 , on the news .
These are the kinds of numbers you see in small electronics start - ups , and usually during booms – not an infrastructure equipment company at the beginning of an economic downturn .
And First Solar was n't alone .
The company 's announcement set off a surge in most other solar power stocks as well .
My favorite ( for reasons I 'll soon explain ) , SunPower Corp. , currently has a market cap of $ 3.2 billion , but recently reached a peak valuation of $ 10.4 billion – and seems to be headed in that direction again .
SunPower is majority owned by Cypress Semiconductor .
And , of course , Cypress is run by one of my favorite people , T.J. Rodgers .
Even if you know nothing about Silicon Valley or the semiconductor industry , you 've probably heard of T.J .
He is easily one of the most controversial figures in American business and a lightning rod for everything people who hate business hate about business .
Needless to say , we reporters love T.J. , because he 's always good for an outrageous and inflammatory quote .
T.J. is an unapologetic capitalist and an absolutely ferocious competitor .
During the early 1990s , when the tech world , and especially chip companies , was suing everyone in sight over intellectual property , T.J. alone refused to cave in to the blackmail and sign licensing deals .
He fought every single suit , bar none , and then wallpapered his office with copies of the complaints .
Then there was the nun , Sister Doris Gormley of the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia , who , acting as a social activist , wrote to Rodgers asking him to put more women and minorities on Cypress 's board .
T.J. , a pure meritocrat who happens to be one of the great supporters of allowing more trained immigrants into the U.S. , politely told the Sister to go to hell .
He later did the same thing to Jesse Jackson .
T.J. also came up against his own industry 's joint venure project , Sematech , arguing that the government 's money would be more wisely placed if it were broken up into small pieces and invested into new start - up companies .
And , most recently , T.J. was back in the news battling the closed membership of the Dartmouth College Board of Trustees .
His efforts in the last fight , along with Hoover Institution fellow Peter Robinson , set off a national debate about academic oversight that continues to this day .
So , it goes without saying that when the word " green " comes to mind , T.J. Rodgers , the ultimate free market libertarian , is probably the last person you 'd ever think of .
And yet , here he is , at the absolute epicenter of the Green Revolution , helping lead the charge that will likely very soon make solar power as inexpensive as other sources of electricity .
And SunPower is rapidly becoming a more important business to Cypress than semiconductors themselves .
The story of how T.J. got to this point is one of the great untold business stories of the new century .
And it should serve as an object lesson to those who wish to change the world by fiat , rather than by market forces .
A column is too short a space to tell it all , but I can give you a quick summary .
In 2001 , at the very moment when the chip industry was sliding into one of the worst slumps in its history , T.J. went before the Cypress board and asked its permission to purchase , of all things , a solar power company .
Needless to say , the board was skeptical – even more so when it turned out that the solar company was owned by one of Rodgers ' grad school buddies .
When the board resisted , T.J. went ahead and invested $ 750,000 of his own money to keep SunPower afloat .
In the end , it took 15 months , basically , until the chip industry began to turn around — before the Cypress board agreed to invest $ 9 million into SunPower .
But what T.J. , who just happened to have invented one of the basic chip fabrication formulas ( VMOS ) , understood that his board , his industry , and most of the rest of the world did n't appreciate , was that in its heart the solar power business was in fact a semiconductor industry .
It did n't start out that way , but look at today 's solar electric panels :
Most are made using semiconductor - thin film technology that is a direct descendent of the pioneering work done by companies such as Fairchild , Motorola and Texas Instruments in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
What those guys were trying to do was take the greatest product of the age , the solid - state transistor , and figure out how to make it smaller and easier to reproduce .
They did so first by making it flat ( Noyce 's and Kilby 's integrated circuit ) , then turning it into a kind of printing technique ( Hoerni 's planar process ) .
A decade later , one of the scientists who worked with Noyce and Hoerni , Gordon Moore , by then co-founder of Intel , realized that this miniaturization / mass - production technique was advancing at a rate never seen before in human endeavor .
This formulation was the famous Moore 's Law , which defines the modern world .
Most of us now understand , and appreciate , Moore 's Law , but in the semiconductor industry they live it every day .
And T.J. is one of the best of them .
And what he saw in SunPower was the impending arrival of Moore 's Law to the alternative power world … and more than anyone , he knew what that meant .
As he has admitted , what he saw was n't Green , as in environmentalism , but " green , " as in money .
That 's why he made such an unlikely move — and why he is now an even richer tycoon .
This takes a singular combination of vision , guts and the kind of strategic thinking that is only found in real , business - oriented entrepreneurs – not in government bureaucrats , or , for that matter , reporters .
The husband of a woman I grew up with has worked for T.J. for many years in international sales .
It 's been a good job , so when I heard a few years ago he was being transferred to SunPower , I felt sorry for him , figuring it was a demotion .
These days he 's adding new wings to his house .
You may not like their politics , or their attitude , or their style .
But if we really do have an energy revolution in this country and free ourselves from our addiction to fossil fuels , it will be because of hard - charging , take - no - prisoners entrepreneurs like T.J. Rodgers — not UN committees , environmental groups , or government officials .

The inaugural flight of the SR - 71 took place on December 22 , 1964 , becoming the most impressive Christmas present ever to slip out of Lockheed 's Skunk Works facility at Burbank airport .
Amazingly , the SR - 71 took to the air less than 17 years after Chuck Yeager first broke the sound barrier .
On paper , this titanium - skinned monster was capable of Mach 3.2 , although pilot Brian Shul has since admitted that he once pushed a Blackbird to Mach 3.4 in his haste to leave Libyan airspace well in advance of looming surface - to - air missiles .
He reported that the aircraft seemed to fly smoother than ever at those unbelievable speeds , cruising at well over 80,000 ft .
Propulsion came from a pair of Pratt & Whitney J58 - P4 engines that produced a total of 65,000 lbf of static thrust and operated on afterburner at all times .
The Sunkworks team had initially played with the idea of using liquid hydrogen for propulsion , but were unable to figure out how to cram the storage tanks into the airframe .
They settled upon a much safer fuel known as Jet Propellant 7 , which featured a high flash point of 60 C that reportedly could n't be lit with a match ( convenient , since the SR - 71 leaked fuel like a sieve while on the ground ) .
The SR - 71 's skin was subjected to extreme heat due to the friction generated by flying at Mach 3 + for extended periods of time .
The designers settled on a Titanium - composite alloy that revolutionized high - speed design .
The shadowy monster flew her first operation sortie in early 1968 , and a total of 32 aircraft were built before the tooling was ordered destroyed .
They remained in and out of operation with the USAF until the last three aircraft were formally retired from military use in 1998 , although several SR - 71s were flown by NASA until the final flight of the SR - 71 on October 9 , 1999 .
Almost a decade later the Blackbird remains the stuff of legends .
No other aircraft embodies the essence of raw speed and technological might to such an impressive degree .
Unfortunately , modern advances in digital satellite imaging have probably ensured that the United States Air Force will never again be able to unleash such an impressive and untouchable reconnaissance vehicle .

PORTLAND , Ore.  Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico delivered a forceful endorsement of Senator Barack Obama for president on Friday , urging Democrats to unite behind his candidacy to move the nation beyond its racial and partisan divide .
“ It is now time for a new generation of leadership to lead America forward , ” Mr. Richardson said , speaking to thousands of supporters at a rally here .
“ Barack Obama will be a historic and a great president , who can bring us the change we so desperately need by bringing us together as a nation here at home and with our allies abroad . ”
Mr. Richardson , who sought to become the nation ’s first Hispanic president , dropped out of the Democratic race in January after finishing behind Mr. Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in the opening contests of Iowa and New Hampshire .
Since then , he had been aggressively courted by his former rivals , but he said Friday that he could no longer stand on the sidelines of his party ’s nominating fight .
“ My great affection and admiration for Senator Clinton and President Bill Clinton will never waver , ” Mr. Richardson said .
“ It is time , however , for Democrats to stop fighting amongst ourselves and prepare for the tough fight we will have against John McCain in the fall . ”
Rep. Howard " Hollywood " Berman ( D - CA ) is n't happy with Marshall , Texas , seat of the federal Eastern District of Texas .
The town now boasts a luxury hotel and several nice restaurants , owing in part to the huge influx of patent lawyers .
The federal court in Marshall has become one of the hottest jurisdictions in the country for patent cases because it 's deemed to be plaintiff - friendly and relatively quick to act .
That has led to a serious case of " venue shopping , " and Berman wants to fix it with the patent reform bill currently trudging though Congress .
But he knows it 's an uphill fight , and with his own chairmanship of the House subcommittee that deals with intellectual property coming to an end , he 's turning his hope this year another IP bill instead : the PRO - IP Act .
At a talk given at Tech Policy Summit in California last night , Berman showed himself a thoughtful legislator when it comes to IP issues like patents and copyright .
For instance , he noted that he and Rep. Rick Boucher ( D - VA ) spend plenty of time worrying about the danger of " squeezing fair use " too much with new copyright legislation , and he also noted his belief that copyright does n't exist to " pad the wallets " of content creators ; it 's to create public good .
But Berman also showed his long - standing sympathies to content creators , strongly backing the PRO - IP Act and saying that " stealing intellectual property is like stealing property . "
With the passing of Rep. Tom Lantos a few weeks back , Berman has since moved to the House Foreign Affairs Committee .
Due to a quirk of Democratic party rules , though , he will actually chair both of his committees through the end of this year ( " I ain't doing this next year ! " he said of running two committees ) , and he 's determined to push through the PRO - IP
Act before he steps off the IP subcommittee .
Rep. Berman
" I think this is going to pass " this year , he said , noting that the PRO - IP
Act has n't generated the intense industry fights that patent reform has .
( The most controversial proposal was pulled from the bill by Berman 's subcommittee . )
But what happens next year with a new Congress ?
Speculation has run rampant about who might succeed Berman , with Boucher 's name figuring prominently in those speculations .
Berman 's acknowledges that he has " heard things " and that he " has thoughts " about the succession , but he then grinned and added , " I 'm not sure why I 'd want to share them . "
No matter what happens , though , Berman is n't getting out of the IP business .
Foreign Affairs does still touch on IP issues like piracy , which is " sucking huge economic value out of our economy , " and Berman will continue to press for US copyright interests abroad .
And with that , it was off to a Lakers game with his grandson .
More than two miles above the Pacific surf , at the summit of the world 's largest volcano , the evidence of human influence on global warming is in the air .
For a half century , sensors atop Mauna Loa on the island of Hawaii have captured the world - wide signature of increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , due largely to burning coal , oil and natural gas .
The carbon dioxide traps heat .
For 50 years , these CO2 readings , known as the Keeling Curve , have been climbing steadily , setting and then breaking a new record every 12 months or so .
( See the Keeling Curve )
Global concentrations of CO2 in 2006 , not surprisingly then , reached the highest level since the record - keeping began in 1958 , the World Meteorological Organization recently announced in its annual greenhouse - gas bulletin .
Based on samples from 40 countries , the level of carbon dioxide in the air reached 381.2 parts per million , up fractionally from 2005 -- concentrations not seen in 650,000 years , scientists said .
This week , while diplomats from 180 countries argued over the cost of staving off predicted climate changes , the Mauna Loa readings started to approach even higher levels .
These annual measurements are the world 's longest continuous record of CO2 concentrations and , plotted as data points in a rising arc , form one of the most important graphs in science .
Floyd Mayweather Jr. , the world 's No. 1 boxer , is strongly considering a revolutionary jump to mixed martial arts under a deal being discussed with Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban .
Leonard Ellerbe , Mayweather 's adviser and best friend , told ESPN.com Friday night that the five - division world champion , who generated 3.25 million pay - per - view buys and more than $ 200 million in revenue in two megafights in 2007 , came away from a Thursday meeting with Cuban giving serious thought to taking his game and considerable drawing power to MMA .

" It 's definitely something he is interested in , and when Floyd makes his move , obviously it 's going to be a mega event , " Ellerbe said .
" We do n't have a timetable .
Floyd is taking some time off , but Floyd understands what is involved .
You have to take time to go out and understand what you 're getting involved in , and he 's ready to do that .
But it 's something he 's definitely interested in doing .
" Mark Cuban is a very successful businessman and has some very , very successful business ventures that we 've discussed .
We 're looking to do a lot of business with Mark .
He 's a great guy , and we had a great meeting .
Doing an MMA event with him is most definitely something we are looking at , among many things we are looking at doing with Mark Cuban . "
Mayweather 's interest in participating in an MMA event was sparked after he struck up a friendship with Cuban during their participation this season as contestants on the ABC reality series " Dancing with the Stars . "
Cuban was Mayweather 's guest at the fight and even carried two of his championship belts into the ring before he knocked out England 's Ricky Hatton to retain the welterweight world championship Dec. 8 in Las Vegas .
Mayweather and Cuban were together again Thursday in Las Vegas , where they met to discuss various business ventures , including Mayweather 's participation in an MMA event .
A few boxers , such as former heavyweight contenders Ray Mercer and Frans Botha , have attempted to compete in mixed martial arts , but with little success .
Mayweather 's entrance would bring it to another level , especially at a time when the sports have been pitted against each other by fans and media -- MMA as the hotshot newcomer trying to overtake the century - old , more traditional sweet science .
One of Cuban 's many business interests is ownership of HDNet Fights , a fledgling mixed martial arts promotional company that airs its bouts on Cuban 's HDNet .
Cuban promoted his second event Dec. 15 in Dallas .
" Floyd is considering fighting with HDNet Fights , " Cuban told ESPN.com .
" We are going to let him visit some gyms to talk to some folks about what it would take to learn .
He knows it wo n't be easy .
But he is getting involved with MMA and HDNet Fights one way or another .
He is pumped about it .
He wants to go on to the next big thing .
Floyd is a brilliant marketer .
He follows the money . "
Indeed , Mayweather , like Cuban , knows how to make money .
Mayweather , 30 , won the year 's two biggest fights , a decision against Oscar De La Hoya in May in a fight that shattered all boxing revenue records and a 10th - round knockout of Hatton that did 850,000 buys and $ 47 million in television revenue on HBO PPV .
Mayweather - De La Hoya , with 2.4 million buys , set the all - time PPV record .
Mayweather - Hatton was the biggest PPV fight in history not involving De La Hoya or heavyweights Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield .
Mayweather earned about $ 50 million for the two fights .
" If I said there 's a guaranteed $ 30 million payday , Floyd would be lacing them up , " Cuban said , optimistic that Mayweather would participate in an MMA match eventually .
" If not , I could see him working to train and develop and invest in MMA fighters , knowing the upside .
He can teach them how to be a better boxer and add to their other skills . "
After each of his past three fights , Mayweather has talked about retirement , or at least an extended break .
Ellerbe said that Mayweather is on vacation now but that when he returns , they 'll discuss the prospect of an MMA bout in more detail .
" Floyd is about taking on challenges , " Ellerbe said .
" This ain't some kind of prank .
That is one of many things we 've talked about with Mark .
Floyd would have to take time to really understand it , but it is most definitely something he is interested in . "

A group of athletes gave its support to Steven Spielberg Wednesday for his decision to withdraw as aritistic director for the Beijing Olympics because of the Chinese government 's policy on Sudan and the conflict in Darfur .
" I have a lot of respect for those who use their visibility to create awareness , " said U.S. Olympian Jessica Mendoza .
" I have to respect his passion for trying to bring awareness to a genocide that is occurring in Africa right now . "
Mendoza , an outfielder on the 2008 Olympic softball team , joined Team Darfur this summer .
The coalition of athletes was formed by 2006 Olympic gold medalist Joey Cheek to raise awareness about the crisis in Darfur , where 200,000 people have been killed and millions more displaced , and about China 's role in that conflict .
China is a big investor in Sudan 's oil industry and also provides military weapons .
" I think what Spielberg did carries a lot of weight , " said Cheek .
Cheek said he 's recruited more than 200 athletes from 41 countries to join Team Darfur .
" It really became an entity about a year ago , " said Cheek .
" They basically make a commitment to learn more about Darfur and try to take some action to do something to improve what 's going on there .
" Fortunately , it 's not me just screaming this into the void .
The United Nations has called this the largest humanitarian crisis on earth . "
What about an Olympic boycott ?
The U.S. boycotted the 1980 Olympics in Moscow over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan .
The U.S. government has rejected calls for a boycott of the Beijing Games .
Cheek said a boycott is not his aim either .
He wants people to be able to compete this summer and " be able to speak about what they believe . "
" I know it might not seem this way , but I want these Games to be the best Games ever , " said Cheek .
" I 'm a massive fan of the experience and the ideal . "
Added Mendoza : " So many negatives there ( boycotts ) .
Olympic Games are n't supposed to be a negative political platform .
" Everyone should take some responsibility for making this world a better place .
We think we can do that by bringing awareness to the issue . "
Jennie Finch , a teammate of Mendoza's , summed up their sentiments : " Bring an end to the genocide . "

This is not a step - by - step guide to reducing debt .
Rather , it is a collection of a lot of the wisdom I have read so far on this topic and a list of some of the things that worked for us .
As you go through the list , I would recommend sorting it out into things that will definitely work for you and things that could possibly work for you .
Start implementing the things that will work for you right away and start working on incorporating the others when possible .
Believe me , soon it will become an obsession ( if it already is n’t ! ) and slowly but surely you will be free of debt .
And that feeling is worth any short - term pain you have to go through .
Stop adding more debt :
No kidding right ?
Well , if it ’s so simple why are n’t you doing it ?
Think of your debt as a small hill of dirt in your back yard .
To get rid of that dirt hill , you need to dig out a shovel at a time .
Now imagine for every 2 - 3 shovels of dirt that you dig out , you toss 4 shovels back on .
How long will it take to get rid of that little hill ?
Piling on more debt while you are trying to get out of it does n’t make much sense either .
Get rid of your credit cards :
One of the biggest down falls that most of us have is the reliance on credit cards .
Unlike spending real cash , when you charge it to a card you do n’t feel the burn .
So if you cannot control how much you spend on your card , then cut up your cards , leave them locked up at home , freeze them or bury them until you are out of debt .
( Note :
Do n’t close the accounts since that can result in reducing your credit score
When I was in college , I went a little wild with student credit cards .
I learned the hard way that I needed some control , so I froze the cards in a large pan of water .
If I wanted or needed something badly enough to wait for the cards to thaw out , then it was probably worth purchasing .
If not , I saved the dough .
My mom still laughs about this , but I saved thousands in forgone impulse purchases .
— Kelly Colucci , Cumming , Ga. –quote source : Kiplinger Change your attitude :
Like everything else in life , getting out of debt is heavily dependent on your attitude .
Switch to a “ Can Do ” attitude .
Stop giving into the victim mentality or self - doubts of whether you can do it .
Start attacking debt and do n’t stop until its all gone .
Stay busy :
An idle mind is a devil ’s work shop and a retailer ’s dream .
If you go to the mall just because you are bored , you are bound to end up buying stuff you likely do n’t need .
If you laze in front of the TV doing nothing , then the advertisers are bound to instill a yearning for something that you would n’t have wanted otherwise .
Throwing away money to keep yourself entertained when you could be using that time a lot more productively just wo n’t cut it if you are serious about getting out of debt .
Change your spending habits :
Do you always plan before you buy something or do you just pick things up ?
Do you ask yourself if you really “ need ” it , or justify your “ wants ” and keep indulging yourself ?
Do you spend an excessive amount of money on showing off to your friends ?
Take a long hard look at your spending habits and fix any short comings that you see .
Cut your spending :
Can you still save some money after all of your bills are paid ?
For instance when you look at your groceries , can you replace some brands with generics so you can save some cash ?
Can you stock up during sales to save some money ?
How about making sure you use your utilities wisely to save on water , electricity and gas bill ?
Look at all aspects of your spending to pinch some more money out that you can throw at debt .
Embrace a simple , frugal lifestyle :
We are in a land of excess .
We believe that we need a lot of things to survive .
But in reality we can get on by with very little .
The more of the excesses you can trim out the sooner you will be out of debt .
Yes , life will seem a bit drab without some of the indulgences you are used to .
It ’s your call which one you like more – temporary indulgences and sleepless nights worrying over debt , or a few sacrifices now to be free of debt issues for the rest of your life !
Always lookout to improve your current income :
The more the money you make , the more you will have left over to throw at your debt .
So always look for opportunities for picking up tasks with higher commission , or over time pay or something that will result in a bonus .
Take your job seriously and work hard everyday , at some point it will pay off for you .
Create additional sources of income : Sometimes it is not easy to simply increase your current income at your day job .
If that ’s the case , look at means to create additional sources of income .
Do you have a hobby that you can monetize ?
Do you have skills ( musician , carpenter , writer , etc. ) that you can use to get some part time gigs ?
Do you have computer knowledge that you can use online ?
Creating additional sources of income not only helps you get out of debt but provides you with better cushion to survive through primary job loss .
Build an emergency fund :
As you attack your debt , remember to put away a small amount for the rainy day .
If something unexpected comes along or if you are forced to borrow money again , you will have a rough time getting out of debt .
So stash away small amounts of money in an emergency fund , and make sure you use it – well , only for emergencies !
Avoid paying fees when possible : Get organized .
Make sure you are paying your bills on time .
There is no point in paying fees in addition to interest !
Also , look out for other options where you can save on fees – for instance , going into a bank to withdraw money may seem like a hassle , but is it really worth spending $ 3 in ATM fees every time you withdraw money ?
Booking your movie tickets online may seem convenient , but is it really worth paying an extra dollar for the ticket ?
Use balance transfers :
Call up every single one of the credit card companies and ask them if they can lower your interest rate or offer you special interest on balance transfer .
Repeat with all the credit cards you have , and consolidate your loans onto the cards that offer the best interest rate .
Watch out for the “ balance transfer fees ” and make sure you are really coming out ahead .
Again , do NOT close paid off credit cards because it will lower your credit score !
Make a budget : A budget is not really that difficult to make or follow .
You do n’t need fancy software or tools , just a simple notebook and pen , or a trusted spreadsheet program .
List all your recurring bills like rent / mortgage , groceries , utilities , bills and put a limit on it .
Then create a category for miscellaneous expenses to cover what you cannot plan for and an indulgence category .
If you do n’t have enough for paying towards debt , tweak and tune these categories , until you find enough .
Reuse and recycle : Reuse and recycle whatever you can .
I never buy garbage bags .
Instead I have small waste bins in my kitchen and bathrooms that I line with grocery bags .
I do n’t care if someone thinks that is cheap – it saves me money and is a small way to reduce my environmental footprint .
So why should I bother about what snobs think .
And since they are smaller waste bins , they get cleaned our more regularly , reducing the possibility of stench in the kitchen .
You will be amazed at how many different places you can apply the reuse and recycle principle to save a few bucks !
Make your intentions public :
When you start digging into your debt , make your intentions public .
Say it out loud – maybe to your spouse or your family or friends .
When people know that you are tackling debt , they will give you dirty looks and lectures when you slip up 🙂
It may be an unsavory experience , but if it keeps you on track and gets you out the hole faster , why not ?
Maybe it will also stop them from enticing you to eat out or buy that new pair of pants !
Start a blog about your effort :
If you are not comfortable about sharing it with the people you know , share it with strangers !
The internet makes it so easy to have an anonymous public image !
Use it !
Create a blog and chart your progress .
You can create free blogs using software like blogger – it is fairly easy and you do n’t need to be tech - savvy to be able to do it .
Nothing makes you obsessive about getting rid of your debt like encouragement from a bunch of strangers whom you have never met !
Besides , depending on your success , you may be able to monetize your blog and make it an additional source of income .
Here are a few blogs to get you started Blogging Away Debt , No Credit Needed , The Simple Dollar .
A simple search for “ blog debt ” on Google will show you many more if you are interested .
Surround yourself with the right type of people :
If you are surrounded by people who keep spending , then it is difficult to get out of the consumerist mentality and slip into the more sensible mentality of living within your means .
This may mean changing friends or keeping your distance from those that influence you negatively .
It is a very difficult tip to follow , but a necessary one , if you want to really get out of debt .
Move !
Drastic times require drastic measures !
If you are really deep into debt you might want to consider more drastic steps like moving to a city with lower cost of living , to a smaller house , to an apartment with lower rent etc .
If something is available for free , do n’t pay for it .
Throw the money at your debt instead !
If you can take public transportation to get around , skip the driving .
Better yet , ride your bike and get a little workout at the same time .
At the end of the month you may have used one less tank of gas .
Make sure you bump up your debt repayment by that amount .
It may not seem like much , but over a course of time , this can add up beautifully to free you from debt a lot sooner .
Always pay more than the minimum payment toward your debt .
If you only pay minimum payments , you will be old and gray before you pay off a the debt .
Here is a calculator that shows the true cost of paying minimum .
For example , if you only pay the minimum payment on a credit card loan of just $ 1000 , at an APR of 18 % , then it will take you around 13 years to pay off that debt .
In that time you would have paid $ 1,115.41 in interest .
That is more than the principal borrowed !
Imagine how much worse it is with larger loans .
So always try to make more than the minimum payments if you are serious about getting rid of debt .
Do n’t hesitate to take help from loved ones :
When you are down and battling with debt , if loved ones offer to help do n’t hesitate to accept .
This could be in cash or kind .
For instance , can your mother baby sit your kids so you can save some money that is spent on daycare and apply it to your debt ?
Can your parents loan you some money at low or zero interest that will help you reduce the amount you pay in debt ?
If you are just starting out , can you move back with your parents for a few months and throw the rent money towards your debt ?
These may be very tough but they can save you several years of slaving to pay off your debt .
Make it automatic / manual : I know that ’s ambiguous , but pick what works for you .
If it hurts you every month to go over the bills and make the payments , then just set up automatic payments so that a fixed portion of your income goes towards paying debt .
Your sole responsibility then is to make sure that your bank balance stays above the required amount and to avoid overdraft fees .
On the other hand , if it gives you pleasure to watch your debt shrink and motivates you to keep at it , then make it manual .
Pay your bills by yourself each month .
Ultimately , getting rid of debt is like going on a financial diet ; it is not easy and the temptations to give in are high .
There will be that tiny voice in your head that says , “ what ’s the point of money if you ca n’t enjoy life ? ”
But if you are in debt , and constantly worrying about it , you are in fact enslaved to your financial miseries .
Unless you make some sacrifices , it is unlikely that you will be able to get out of it .
Not all of these tips will work for you , so pick what does and stick to it !

SANTA ROSA – A boy in his mid-teens learned Wednesday afternoon that it is not a good idea to try to rob a former U.S. Marine at knifepoint , even if the former Marine is 84 years old , police said today .
Santa Rosa police Sgt. Steve Bair said that ’s what happened around 2 p.m. in the 1600 block of Fourth Street .
The elderly man was walking with a grocery bag in each arm when the boy approached him with a large knife , Bair said .
The boy said , “ Old man , give me your wallet or I ’ll cut you , ” Bair said .
The man told the boy he was a former Marine who fought in three wars and had been threatened with knives and bayonets , Bair said .
The man then put his bags on the ground and told the boy that if he stepped closer he would be sorry .
When the boy stepped closer , the man kicked him in the groin , knocking him to the sidewalk , Bair said .
The ex-Marine picked up his grocery bags and walked home , leaving the boy doubled over , Bair said .
The man reported the attempted robbery to police 45 minutes later .
Bair said the teen is described only as 15 or 16 years old .
Anyone with information is asked to call the Police Department .

Summary : Find here suggestions and techniques to deal with failure and the fear of failure and accepting it as a learning opportunity to achieve success and reach your goals .
Nothing hurts us more than failure and loss .
The pain and fear associated with failure can be serious and crippling .
It hurts even more those who suffer from poor self - esteem and low self - confidence .
Repeated failure contributes to low morale and expectations , while fear of failure prevents many from using their skills and potentials fully to reach their goals .
Since we live in a competitive world , where your social status and public image depend upon your financial success , people from all wakes of life react negatively to failure and experience despair and unhappiness .
Unless you have a tough mindset , it is difficult to recover from failure and refocus upon your goals and tasks ; and unless you develop positive attitude , with each failure a part of your hopes and dreams begin to die .
Since it is not possible to predict the outcome of our actions and we cannot be sure that we will always succeed in our actions , we must learn to cope with failure in healthy ways and learn to keep our morale and confidence high .
The following suggestions are helpful in this regard .
Know that you can deal with failure
A friend mine started an Indian restaurant in a small town in the USA .
He suffered heavy losses and had to sell his house to repay the debt when the chef and the manager whom he recruited to look after the business betrayed him and ruined his reputation .
Yet , within two years he recovered from the failure and started another restaurant .
He is now doing fine as his business picked up .
He told me that he learned from his father never to give up .
Human tenacity is such that you can deal with any failure or problem in your life .
For that you must have courage , confidence and belief in yourself .
With determination and confidence in your skills , knowledge , and abilities , you can overcome any failure in your life and find solutions to every problem .
A setback may temporarily upset your plans and halt your progress , but with determination , right effort and right state of mind , you can recover from even the worst failure .
One effective way to deal with failure is to treat it like any other problem , and apply your knowledge and intelligence to find solutions .
Accept failure as normal
Society degrades failure , but you do not have to .
If your car broke down while you were driving , it does not mean that it is worthless , but that it may need repairs and some maintenance work .
The same is the case with failure .
In any goal oriented action , success and failure are just two possibilities .
You must be prepared for both .
We stumble before we learn to walk .
We fail before we succeed .
We cannot guarantee the result , but we can always guarantee a sincere effort .
Our success and failure in any situation depend upon many factors which are not entirely within our control .
Therefore , however hard we may try , we can not be sure how our actions will turn out .
A failure is success in the making ; a phase within a process ; a problem within a solution ; and a disturbance within a dream .
Each failure has a message to deliver and a lesson to teach .
The good thing about failure is that it is temporary , manageable , and solvable with further effort .
Accept failure as a learning opportunity
You can either learn from your failures , or feel depressed or dejected and nurse your wounds .
The choice is yours .
Whether you are aware of it or not , you always have this choice .
Your life is largely shaped by what you choose .
We fail in our actions because we make mistakes .
It may be caused by a wrong decision , a defective process , a bad judgment , or an incorrect tool we use .
Since we are not perfect , we are bound to make mistakes .
What happens when your computer develops an unusual glitch ?
You do some research and try various options before you find the right solution .
If you cannot solve it , you consult someone or hire a professional .
You just do not give up .
Once the problem is solved , you use the knowledge you gained to deal with a similar problem next time .
You can bring the same attitude into your other actions also .
The cost of finding solutions and resolving problems in each case may vary , but the approach is the same .
You should learn from your failures and mistakes , and move on .
Failure grounds you in the reality of life , puts things in proper perspective , lets you know where you stand on the path to success , and what skills and effort you still need to move forward .
In short , it prepares you for success .
If you consider failure with this attitude it paves the way for your improvement and increased awareness , without lowering your morale and spirits .
Anticipate problems to prepare for them
Optimism is good , but it is always better to assess the risks involved in any situation and prepare for them .
You should anticipate failure by identifying possible causes .
You have to do it as preventive measure , just as you lock your house and start the security alarm before you leave .
It is a proactive approach .
Have you ever wondered why auto manufactures equip every vehicle with two headlights instead of one ?
Having one light is technically a good option because it prolongs the battery life .
However , with two lights you can continue to drive in the night if one fails or is damaged .
Systems are designed in such a way that for every failure there will be a fallback option .
For example , even though most passenger planes are put on autopilot in the midair , for the safety of passengers they are always flown by two or more pilots .
If one loses consciousness , the other can safely land the plane .
Before you initiate any goal oriented action , anticipate what problems , bottlenecks , and possible breakdowns you may face in future and prepare for them with suitable alternatives and backup plans .
It may not guarantee a hundred percent fail - safe system , but it will reduce your chances of failure .
Monitor your actions
In science fiction movies , astronauts may travel to distant galaxies while they are asleep in frozen chambers , but in real life you have to be awake and pay attention to your actions , especially those that may affect your success .
Negligence can prove very costly and time - consuming , besides distracting you from your main goals and tasks .
When you drive a vehicle , you cannot fall asleep .
The same degree of attentiveness is required when you perform any important action .
Do you know what is common to many successful companies ?
They pay attention to quality and strive for excellence .
They make sure that errors arising from human negligence or prevented or minimized .
Even the most automated systems require human supervision to intervene and rectify errors and malfunctioning .
If you have visited a factory or a manufacturing plant , you will notice how the machines are constantly monitored by qualified people so that the processes would run smoothly .
Nothing works on its own , without human intervention .
You can not put your duties and responsibilities on autopilot .
Successful small business owners know the importance of monitoring .
They do not take anything for granted .
They go to great lengths to keep their customers happy and settle their grievances .
You can do the same to increase your chances of success and minimize the possibility of failures and setbacks .
Accept responsibility for your failure
You might have seen people routinely blaming others when things go wrong , even if they have nothing to do with it .
It frequently happens in politics .
It happens in personal , and family matters also if there are people with questionable integrity .
When you lose your way in the middle of a desert , you will gain nothing by blaming the sun or the sand or fate .
You have to accept responsibility for what happened , and try to survive .
The first step in dealing with a setback or a failure is to own it .
It is the right approach .
There is no shame in forgiving yourself for your failures or faults .
We all make mistakes and occasionally fail in our actions .
In fact , our rate of failure depends upon the complexity of the tasks .
If you are doing something which no one has done before , your chances of failure are even more .
Hence , you must accept failure as the risk that comes with any action .
If you are honest about your failures , you will increase the odds of finding better solutions , friends , and opportunities to resolve them .
If you blame others , you may lose any support you may get from them .
Even if they are at fault , you may have to forgive them because you may still need them to complete your tasks .
Therefore , own your failures , keep an open mind , and move on with the task of fixing the problem rather than becoming stuck in fixing the blame .
Keep your emotions under control
Emotions are bound to flood your mind when you deal with problems , conflicts and failures .
They do serve an important purpose in your life .
They call your attention to the problems , flaws , and risks hidden in your plans , decisions , methods and approaches and alert you to situations that they might create .
In every failure and setback there is a hidden message that wants to teach you something .
You can decipher it using your emotions .
There is an aspect of intelligence called emotional intelligence , which helps you to decipher situations and make sense of them .
It is normal for people to feel depressed or dejected by failure .
Fear of failure also prevents them from taking bold actions .
Since each failure cuts into your self - esteem , with each failure you feel increased pressure and negativity to reignite your motivation .
However , you can do it by increasing your enthusiasm for doing the task rather than for the results .
Do the task as excellently as you can and leave the results to God .
You can not control the outcome of your actions , but you can control your actions and approach .
Have you seen how tight rope walkers manage to cross long distances on a thin rope without losing their balance ?
They focus on each step until they reach the other end .
You can bring that kind of Zen attitude into your actions .
If you focus on the processes , techniques and methods rather than the results , your actions will improve and you will be more balanced , peaceful , and less emotional .
Therefore , keep your emotions under control and perform your tasks sincerely , without unduly worrying about the outcome of your actions .
Be persistent
Weak minds are disheartened by failure and give up after a few setbacks .
When they face problems , they stop trying , or find excuses to blame others or circumstances for their failures .
Several years ago my friend and I went to a remote place in India in the countryside to climb a hill .
Since we could not drive the car all the way to the hill , we had to park it in a nearby village and walk a few miles to reach there .
If you are familiar with Indian summers , you know how hot it can get .
By the time , we reached there , it was midday , and we were already exhausted as we walked in the glare of the summer sun on an uneven ground that kept rising gradually .
From the ground level , the hill looked very steep at the top , foreboding the trouble we might have once we reached there .
I enjoyed climbing hills both for the physical and mental challenges it posed .
From each climbing experience , I learned lessons about life , human behavior , and myself .
Halfway through the climb , we were exhausted by the heat from above and the heat from the rocks .
My body refused to move as I felt no strength in my legs .
My friend managed to reach the peak ahead of me when I was still struggling about twenty feet below .
For a few minutes , I wondered whether I should continue .
My friend kept encouraging me to join him and see the beautiful panorama from up there .
Although I was extremely tired , I managed to reach the top and saw the beautiful valley spread below .
I was able to do it because by observing people , who were tenacious and perseverant , I learned not to give up easily .
Some of my teachers in this regard were poor farmers whom you might not consider successful .
But they had that tenacity , which taught them to survive the worst of calamities .
You may even mistake them for being stubborn , but it is the same quality , which fuels their purpose and enthusiasm and keeps them focused upon their goals .
Sometimes you may not have friends or family members to encourage you when you think that you have reached the end of the road .
It does not mean it is the end of all .
You have to step back , weight your options , and move forward again in another direction .
The end of a cliff is not the end of the world .
In any discouraging situation , the strength and motivation to continue must come from within .
In the face of failure , strong - willed people continue their effort , by keeping their hopes alive and their minds firmly set upon their goals .
They respond to failure with actionable solutions .
For them persistence means more than doing the same task again .
They improve with each repetition , as they learn , adapt and try again , until they reach their goals .
Seek help from others
Successful people respond to failure positively .
If they conclude that their failure was caused by a deficiency or defect in their methods , skills , or techniques , they either try to work on that area or seek other people 's help .
Prudence dictates that you should seek the help of those who are known for their integrity and reputation .
Everyone is endowed with certain skills , strengths and weaknesses .
Your strengths are your resources , which help you to reach your goals .
Since your weaknesses may interfere with your strengths or success , you need to find people who can compensate for them , especially if they are going to interfere with your work .
You can deal with your weaknesses by learning and training , which may require time and effort , or by seeking the help of those who are strong in those areas .
When you seek help from them , you have to consider the risks and costs involved .
For example , when you hire others you may have to share proprietary information , which may be used against you or shared with your competitors .
Be creative
We learn from history that under pressure people manage to find creative and inspiring ideas to overcome their problems .
They survive under the most pressing situations by learning to use their minds creatively .
It is true that some of the world 's best ideas and solutions were discovered during difficult times when there were wars , natural calamities , or epidemics .
Businesses routinely use adverse situations to improve their productivity or restructure their operations through innovation and creative solutions .
You can follow the same approach and view your problems and setbacks as opportunities to think creatively and improve your methods and techniques .
Psychologists recognize three phases in creativity , getting to know the problem , letting your mind rest and think of other things , and illumination when your mind suddenly becomes aware of the solution .
You can follow the same approach to let your mind find creative solutions to your problems .
Think positively
Every significant failure brings out the worst in us before it brings out the best .
In many situations when there are problems people experience negative emotions such as fear , anger , frustration , and low self - esteem .
They may even begin to wonder whether their lives will ever be normal again .
In the face of failure , you may become your own worst enemy and feel too critical of your abilities and actions .
Out of frustration or anger , you may turn against your own friends and refuse to accept their help or advice .
As we have seen before , people internalize success and externalize failures to protect themselves against their own fears and negativity .
Even it does not guarantee peace because of the subconscious fears that people experience habitually about their own future .
It is very difficult to live with failure when one has lost hope of resolving it .
To overcome these habitual reactions , you have to train your mind to remain calm under pressure , focus on the possibilities and opportunities , and act rationally in the face of fear and dejection .
You have to learn to dispute you negative self - talk , irrational beliefs and assumptions , and internalize positive affirmations .
By staying focused on your goals and strengths , working around your weaknesses , increasing your knowledge and expertise , and improving your efficiency and effectiveness , you can keep your hopes alive and your chances of success .
Be systematic
If you organize your life and actions , you will greatly reduce the chances of failure .
Being organized means keeping things in an orderly and verifiable fashion , having a place for everything and ensuring that everything is in its place .
It means planning and performing your tasks with precision , imparting a method and structure to what you do and what you have , and keeping your work environment clean and manageable .
It also means having rules , following discipline , enforcing order , prioritizing things , keeping task lists , following well laid out action plans , removing unnecessary clutter , and focusing only on essential tasks .
If you are organized and systematic , you stay focused , conserve your resources and improve your performance .
It helps you to remain in control of your environment , and maximize your effectiveness .
With an organized and systematic approach , you will recover swiftly from your problems and failures , as you can identify the causes , locate and organize your resources and implement your solutions .
It will also help you to plan and control your actions , conserve your resources , measure your progress , and stay on course .
Use the power of failure
Failure is not an option in a competitive world , where you are constantly challenged by people and circumstances to prove your ability and talents , and stay on top .
When you are unable to reach your goals , you have to consider the options that are available to you and take right decisions , so that your failures will not hurt you or make you feel small and defeated .
You have to use defensive pessimism to anticipate problems and stay prepared .
To avoid repeating the same mistakes , you should improve your methods and processes constantly and minimize their occurrence .
You can turn your fear of failure into a motivating factor to safeguard yourself from the risks that are inherent in your plans and actions .
You must learn to face your failure with courage and accept the challenges they pose , without taking them personally .
Each failure is like a storm in the long voyage of your life .
In most cases , you can anticipate its coming by noticing the changes in your environment and take precautions to sail through it safely .
You may consider each failure a part of achieving success , which demands timely and skillful action , planned effort , positive mental attitude , confidence and conviction .
It is part of the learning and perfecting process and a means to self - improvement .
You have to face your failures with courage and right attitude to make them propel you towards success .
There are plenty of recession naysayers .
Average hourly wages and salaries have not fallen , and some economists argue that unless  or until  that happens , consumer spending will hold up despite widespread economic unease .
According to these economists , what happened in December was a temporary blip .
“ Incomes have managed to hold up , ” said Chris Varvares , president of Macroeconomic Advisers , an economic forecasting firm , who added that the data to date did not support the view that a recession was inevitable .
Even in tough economic times Americans rarely reduce their consumption , preferring instead to slow the growth in their spending .
Since 1980 , they have cut spending in only five quarters  a total of 15 months  most of them in the depths of a recession .
The 2001 recession passed without a cutback in consumer spending .
Only once before , in 1980 , did consumer spending fall during a presidential election year , helping Ronald Reagan in his campaign against Jimmy Carter , the Democratic incumbent .
Official statistics do not yet show that consumer spending has dropped , but they do suggest that in late 2007 , it slowed in areas like automobiles , furniture , building materials and health care , said Mark M. Zandi , chief economist at Moody ’s Economy.com .
Fresh evidence of a pullback is pouring in from many quarters as Americans confront the triple threats of higher energy costs , falling home prices and a volatile stock market .
Perhaps the strongest barometer over the last 30 days is the performance of the country ’s big chain stores .
December turned out to be a blood bath for retailers at every rung on the economic ladder , with sales for the month growing at the slowest rate in seven years .
ROME , Italy ( CNN ) --
The garbage crisis in Naples encompasses the worst Italian clichés , and in particular those of the southern part of this lovely peninsula : mismanagement , political interference , mafia profiteering and the ability of those responsible to deflect the attention and the blame elsewhere .
There is a popular saying here that roughly goes like this : everybody is competent enough ( to find a solution ) but nobody is responsible ( for actually carrying it out ) .
In many parts of the world waste disposal is a business -- and usually it is a good business .
Garbage can be transformed into various sources of energy and then sold for a profit .
In Naples , garbage is also good business , but in the sense that millions , if not billions , of euros have been wasted -- and nobody really knows how .
The problem is as old and ugly as rotten trash .
The region 's dumps reached full capacity more than a decade ago , and since then a state of emergency has been declared every year .
Eight different commissioners have been appointed , but they have all failed to solve the problem .
State of emergency means government money : € 1.8 billion ( more than $ 2.5 billion ) in emergency funds have been devolved to deal with the problem .
It is still difficult to find out where or how that money has been spent .
Incinerators that were supposed to be built were never finished , either because the companies in charge of constructing them could not finish the job , or else because magistrates stopped the work , pending ongoing criminal investigations into alleged mafia involvement .
One Italian newspaper suggested that a good 20 % of the money went to pay for the salaries of those in charge of coming up with a solution to the problem .
More worrying perhaps , is another suggestion : that the local mafia , known as the Camorra , is taking advantage of the situation .
As the crisis has worsened over the years , so the Camorra 's profits , estimated now at around € 1 billion ( roughly $ 1.45 billion ) , are alleged to have increased .
How does the local mafia make money ?
The Naples prosecutor in charge of environmental crimes says city government officials use the state of emergency to quickly award contracts which otherwise would have to be checked by complicated anti-racketeering legislation .
Once they receive the money , companies linked to the underworld dispose of the waste either in the open or , ironically , at regular city dumps , even if they are overflowing .
The mafia clans have now managed to burrow their way so deeply into the system that every attempt to fix the problem has proved futile .
But why are citizens protesting now ?
Well , the government wants to re-open a previously shut dump to dispose of 3,700 tons of waste which is laying in the streets of Naples and surrounding areas .
The problem is that when the site was closed years ago , locals were promised that a golf course would be built there .
As a result , many residents invested savings to construct apartments and residences in the vicinity -- in some cases just a few yards away from the site .
They are now waking up to a mountain of trash instead of 18 holes .
A rotten deal indeed .

All About Naples
As New York ’s attorney general , Eliot Spitzer had broken up prostitution rings before , but this 2004 case took on a special urgency for him .
Prosecuting an international sex tourism business based in Queens , he listened to the entreaties of women ’s advocates long frustrated by state laws that fell short of dealing with a sex trade expanding rapidly across borders .
And with his typical zeal , he embraced their push for new legislation , including a novel idea at its heart :
Go after the men who seek out prostitutes .
It was a question of supply and demand , they all agreed .
And one effective way to suppress the demand was to raise the penalties for patronizing a prostitute .
In his first months as governor last year , Mr. Spitzer signed the bill into law .
Now the human rights groups , which credit him with what they call the toughest and most comprehensive anti-sex - trade law in the nation , are in shock .
Mr. Spitzer stands accused of being one of the very men his law was designed to catch and punish .
Several big-name Bushies are lining up to boost McCain .
Mehlman , Rove boost McCain campaign
John McCain is getting much more than President Bush 's endorsement and fundraising help for his campaign .
He ’s getting Bush 's staff .
It ’s no secret that Steve Schmidt , Bush ’s attack dog in the 2004 election , and Mark McKinnon , the president ’s media strategist , are performing similar functions for McCain now .
Advertisement
But other big - name Bushies are lining up to boost McCain , too .
Ken Mehlman , who ran Bush ’s 2004 campaign , is now serving as an unpaid , outside adviser to the Arizona Republican .
Karl Rove , the president ’s top political hand since his Texas days , recently gave money to McCain and soon after had a private conversation with the senator .
A top McCain adviser said both Mehlman and Rove are now informally advising the campaign .
Rove refused to detail his conversation with McCain .
The list could grow longer .
Dan Bartlett , formerly a top aide in the Bush White House , and Sara Taylor , the erstwhile Bush political adviser , said they are eager to provide any assistance and advice possible to McCain .
Rove explained that he and McCain “ got to know each other during the 2004 campaign . ”
In a separate interview , Mehlman noted that “ McCain was completely loyal to the president in 2004 and worked incredibly hard to help him get elected . ”
According to Taylor , “ The Bush Republicans here in town are excited for John McCain . ”
Despite the president ’s low approval ratings , there are clear benefits to McCain for this cozy relationship with the Bush team .
They are seasoned operatives with a track record of winning back - to - back national elections in tough political environments .
But there are obvious drawbacks .
First and foremost , any association with the Bush administration helps Democrats make their case that McCain represents a clear extension of an unpopular presidency .
One of those making that argument is Matt Dowd , Bush ’s chief strategist in 2004 .
“ [ McCain ] has sided himself so closely to the administration , especially on Iraq , now having various Bush advisers — that does n’t sit well with the public , ” said Dowd , who has recently broken with the Bush inner circle .
“ The public wants the non-Bush candidate . ”
Dowd also argued that he believes that the proximity of Bush ’s advisers could lead McCain to a strategic mistake : refighting the 2004 campaign .
“ There is a real danger of that , ” Dowd added .
“ And I think some of the things John McCain has done , and how he ’s done it , has been a fight or a battle that ’s gone .
I do n’t think this is going to be a terrorism election or a national security election . ”
The McCain adviser said Dowd 's concern is unwarranted , pointing to the campaign ’s belief that the economy will play a far greater role in the 2008 race than it did in 2004 .
That has n’t stopped Democrats from seizing upon the Bush - McCain axis .
When Bush and McCain met at the White House on Wednesday , a Democratic leaning group aired an ad that day in the swing states of Pennsylvania and Ohio titled “ McSame , ” attacking McCain as a Bush clone with similar policies on taxes , health care and the war in Iraq .
The Democratic National Committee quickly posted a video of the news conference on its website .
Beneath the video , it read that McCain would carry on Bush ’s “ failed economic and foreign policies . ”
The McCain campaign , for its part , has been coy about how — or whether — the senator will distance himself from the president .
McCain said that he intended to campaign with Bush but quickly added a caveat : only “ as it fits into his busy schedule . ”
The scheduling disclaimer followed each of the five times — in the 10 - minute press conference — that McCain invited Bush to join him on the trail .
For now , said a senior adviser to McCain who spoke on the condition of anonymity , the “ the No. 1 strategic goal ” was “ to solidify the base of the party . ”
A strong majority of Republicans continue to approve of the president .
Yet independents and Democrats do not share Republicans ' approval of Bush .
And former Bush aides recognize the political exigencies surrounding the McCain - Bush relationship .
“ We agree on far more than we disagree on , ” Bartlett said .
“ Everybody will do everything they can to help .
And if part of being helpful means [ to ] stay away , I ’m sure people will stay away . ”
At the moment , McCain ’s campaign seems to believe Bush ’s assistance is more valuable than not .
But the McCain adviser noted that , down the road , the campaign will “ reinforce that [ McCain ] is an independent . ”
Not only have some public schools lost enrolments ; they have become racially segregated .
In pockets of rural and remote NSW , Aboriginal students fill public schools and white students attend Catholic and other private schools in the same town .
Around Sydney , the parents of some Anglo - European students are avoiding what they perceive as predominantly Lebanese , Muslim and Asian schools .
In New England , in towns such as Armidale , white middle - class students are flocking to Catholic and independent schools .
In their report , principals say this is so the students can " get away from their local school " .
" This is almost certainly white flight from towns in which the public school 's enrolment consists increasingly of indigenous students , " the report says .
" The pattern is repeated in the Sydney region .
Based on comments from principals , this most likely consists of flight to avoid Islamic students and communities . "
The report , its pages stamped confidential , was based on responses of 163 high school principals , representing a third of the Secondary Principals Council membership .
It was presented to the NSW Government after it was completed in February 2006 , but has not been released .
Principals in New England said 56 per cent of the Anglo - European students who had left their schools had gone to a nearby Catholic or independent school .
In North Sydney , 35 per cent of students who had left the public system went to a nearby private school .
The report shows the percentage of Anglo - European students in public schools has decreased by a third in western NSW , by 42 per cent in North Sydney and 37 per cent in New England .
A University of Western Sydney academic , Carol Reid , has also found that one in four male students surveyed in Sydney 's south and west had been involved in ethnic conflict .
She had received anecdotal reports from principals about white students avoiding what were regarded as Asian schools on the North Shore and some selective high schools that had high proportions of Asian students .
Dr Reid , who is the associate head of the school of education , surveyed 350 high school students aged between 14 and 17 in south - western Sydney , after the Cronulla riots of 2005 .
" I 've been involved in education for 30 years and I 've never seen this polarisation around class , but also around ethnicity and race , " she said .
" What I have discovered is principals are losing the last of their white kids to Catholic schools across the road .
A principal in the Middle Eastern part of the city was saying that he had no white kids in his school .
" I 'm concerned that social cohesion is going to be at risk through this .
I see signs of that .
You have a lot of segregation going on . "
The survey of principals reports one saying : " The Asian students are scared off by Lebanese enrolment at our school following the Cronulla riots - we had 18 no - shows on day one in year 11 , mostly Asian . "
Another said : " I 'm seen as a Muslim school , so I do n't attract very many non-Muslims , whether Anglo or not .
I 've worked hard to raise the school profile and gradually increase enrolments , but the Muslim label appears to alienate other groups . "
Noel Beddoe , a former principal in Narrandera for 20 years who is involved in Aboriginal education , said a " de facto apartheid " had developed in some towns in the west and north of NSW , including Mungindi , near Moree , where Aboriginal students attend the public school and whites attend the Catholic school .
Busloads of white students from towns including Boggabilla cross the Queensland border every day to attend a Catholic and public school in Goondiwindi .
The same is happening in southern NSW , where students are bypassing Balranald Central School and crossing the border to go to schools in Victoria .
Up to 15 years ago , Boggabilla Central School , near the Queensland border , had a relatively even mix of white and Aboriginal students .
The proportion of white students has dropped from around 40 per cent in the early 1990s to 10 to 20 per cent today .
Owen Hasler , the NSW Teachers Federation organiser for the New England region , said : " There has been a significant movement of white Anglo students away from quite a few of the schools in the New England and Western region .
It is clearly evidenced by the numbers and proportion of Aboriginal students in those schools . "
He said around 8 per cent of the 1100 students at Gunnedah High School during the 1970s were Aboriginal .
That proportion had grown to about 25 per cent of the 600 students now enrolled .
" Public schools are becoming de facto Aboriginal schools , " Mr Hasler said .
" It appears to be a result of the last 10 to 15 years of funding .
We can understand people making the choice to send their kids away to other schools when there is a financial incentive to do so .
But is that fair to the kids who want to stay in their own local community ? "
Dr Reid said policies of the Howard government and the Liberal state government that had strongly supported parental choice in schooling , including de-zoning , had contributed to " white flight " .
Parents were no longer restricted to schools close to home and could use generous government subsidies for transport .
Boarding school allowances of up to $ 6396 per child were also available , making it easier for some families to avoid their local school .
The Isolated Parents Association is lobbying to have the $ 54 million federal government boarding assistance scheme extended to more families in rural and remote areas .
It is means - tested and restricted to children of families who live more than 56 kilometres from the nearest government school , or more than 4.5 kilometres from the nearest transport to school .
The association 's national president , Roxanne Morrissey , said families who lived near a public school should be supported in their choice of another school that offered a wider curriculum choice .
The NSW Greens MP John Kaye said the State Government spent $ 443 million a year on a transport scheme that " encourages travel past local public schools to private schools in other suburbs " .
" It 's a recipe for educational segregation , " he said .
Rick Johnston , director of Catholic schools in the Armidale diocese , said enrolments of Aboriginal students were increasing .
In 1985 there were 6557 students in Catholic schools in the Armidale region and of these , 196 were Aboriginal .
Last year there were 465 indigenous students out of 5892 students .
" I am committed to improving education outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students , " he said .
" I believe that education is the most important key to breaking the cycle of disadvantage experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander people . "
Sharon Cooke , who is employed by the Catholic schools office in Armidale as an Aboriginal education consultant , said there were 25 schools within the diocese that employed 20 Aboriginal education assistants and two Aboriginal language teachers .
" We are committed to increasing the number of teachers within our schools who are of Aboriginal heritage , " she said .

Articles of Impeachment ?
Bear Stearns Buyout Illegal ?
Karl Denninger
“ On or about March 16th , 2008 , George W. Bush , both personally and through his Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , caused to be provided to JP Morgan / Chase a bribe ( 1 ) ultimately flowing from the United States Treasury in an amount not to exceed $ 30 billion dollars US , via The Federal Reserve , in order to induce JP Morgan / Chase to assume the liabilities and assets of Bear Stearns and Company at a price not determined in the free market or via public bidding , in violation of the limitations expressly set forth in The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , 12 USC Ch 6 . ”
(1) Bribery is defined by Black ’s Law Dictionary as the offering , giving , receiving , or soliciting of any item of value to influence the actions of an official or other person in discharge of a public or legal duty .
I have spent a solid week both reading The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and thinking about the circumstances of this transaction trying to find a means under which “ backstopping ” Bear Stearns debt via The Federal Reserve is legally permissible .
Despite my best efforts I ca n’t find explicit or implicit authorization for “ a put ” , as differentiated from a loan , anywhere in The Federal Reserve Act .
You can call something whatever you ’d like but if in point of fact there is no recourse then it is not a “ loan ” at all ; it is a “ PUT ” or a “ conditional payment ” , and under The Federal Reserve Act such an action appears to these eyes to be a direct violation of the law .
It is widely reported that both Hank Paulson and George Bush personally “ signed off on ” The Bear Stearns “ bailout ” last Sunday .
As such their direct and indirect actions , in my view , constitute a “ High Crime and Misdemeanor ” within the meaning of the United States Constitution and therefore subject George W. Bush to impeachment proceedings as proposed in the above sample article for same .
By the way , I ’m not the only one who thinks this is an illegal transaction .
John Hussman , of The Hussman Funds , has this to say in a letter with a publication date of tomorrow , March 24th :
“ In my view , the deal would be palatable if J.P. Morgan was to remain fully responsible for any losses on the ‘ collateral ’ provided to the Federal Reserve , assuming shareholders were to consent to the buyout .
As it stands , Congress should quickly step in to bust the existing deal and demand an alternate resolution , by clearly insisting that the Fed ’s action was not legal .
The Fed did not act to save a bank , but to enrich one .
Congress has the power to appropriate resources for such a deal by the representative will of the people “ “ the Fed does not , even under Depression era banking laws .
The ‘ loan ’ falls outside of Section 13 - 3 of the Federal Reserve Act , because it is not in fact a loan to either Bear Stearns or J.P. Morgan .
Bear Stearns is no longer a business entity under this agreement .
And if the fiction that this is a ‘ loan ’ to J.P. Morgan was true , then the only point at which the ‘ collateral ’ would become an issue would be in the event that J.P. Morgan itself was to fail .
No , this is not a loan .
It is a put option granted by the Fed to J.P. Morgan on a basket of toxic securities .
And it is not legal . ”
Finally , it appears that even the SEC Chairman , Christopher Cox , is n’t sure that Bear was “ done ” ; that is , this entire transaction might smell like dead fish :
“ In what is likely to be a bit of a blockbuster , SEC chairman Christopher Cox sent a letter to Swiss regulators indicating the Bear Stearns ( NYSE : BSC ) did not have to go the way of all flesh .
According to The New York Post “ the fate of Bear Stearns was a lack of confidence , not a lack of capital , ” Cox , the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission , wrote in a five - page letter sent to a Swiss regulator . ” ”
So there you have it .
Now , the question is , do our Congressfolk have the necessary will to stop this raiding of the public treasury for the enrichment of a private firm – if necessary , by bringing the above article of impeachment ?
If you think they should , then I have a solution for you .
SIGN THE PETITION
to Congress for the purpose of raising debate on this exact issue and stop the mockery of our legal and regulatory systems .
PS : I ’m a lifelong registered Republican , voted for George W. Bush twice , and have one of Gingrich ’s “ Speaker ’s Gavels ” on the credenza behind my desk , so before you go accusing me of being a “ leftwing nutjob ” , think again .
Nonetheless , what ’s right is right and I must stand for what ’s just , and when the political party I am a member of does something wrong , they must admit to it and face the consequences .
Sorry Mr. President ; I like you a great deal , but what happened here was , in my opinion , blatantly unlawful .
The $ 30 billion “ backstop ” must be rescinded until and unless Congress explicitly authorizes that act through legislation and you sign same .

Quick test .
Which of the following were acts of terrorism : a ) Al - Qaida 's bombing of the USS Cole in 2000 , which killed 17 American sailors ; b) Hezbollah 's raid on an Israeli military patrol in July 2006 , killing three soldiers and capturing two , and triggering a 34 - day war ; c ) The Hamas ambush last week of an Israeli patrol on the Gaza border , killing one Israeli soldier ; d) Attacks on American troops in Iraq , which have killed about 3,500 soldiers ( not including some 800 nonhostile deaths ) ; e) None of the above .
The answer is ( e ) -- none of the above .
It may be impossible to agree on a single definition of terrorism .
It 's easier to agree on what terrorism is n't .
Attacking military personnel or military installations is n't terrorism .
It 's an act of war .
This definition would hold even according to the U.S. Code , which states : " The term ' terrorism ' means an activity that involves a violent act or an act dangerous to human life , property , or infrastructure and appears to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population ; to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion ; or to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction , assassination , kidnapping , or hostage - taking . "
Civilians are the common denominator .
But neither government nor the press follows that definition .
They have no definition .
They improvise according to prejudice and expediency .
As Caleb Carr , author of " The Lessons of Terror " ( 2002 ) noted , " almost every agency of the U.S. government that deals with the threat of terrorism maintains its own definition of that phenomenon .
More surprising still , among these definitions , no two are identical or even , in some cases , easy to reconcile with one another .
The same phenomenon applies to America 's academic and intellectual communities . "
The nonsensically named " war on terror " is supposedly the central conflict of our time .
Yet as a nation we do n't agree or even discuss much what " terrorism " really is .
It 's ignorance by necessity .
There is no way to have an honest discussion of terrorism without quickly discovering that " Islamists " are among its most recent and rather selective practitioners , while Westerners have been its more systematic enthusiasts and euphemists .
Any reading of Richard Wright , Maya Angelou , James Baldwin , Carter G. Woodson , Frederick Douglass ( among other black voices ) and , obviously , innumerable slave narratives , clarifies why Cornel West derided the notion that the 9/11 attacks brought terror to " the homeland . "
Terror -- systematic , state - sponsored , genocidal -- was the daily bane of black existence until a few decades ago .
Defining terrorism is contentious only for those who want to hide from the implications of definition , which to me is simple : Violent acts directed primarily at civilian targets , or that produce primarily civilian casualties , are terrorism .
So are violent acts directed at any imprisoned individual , soldiers or guerrillas included -- especially those held illegally , without charge , which makes Guantanamo 's detainees hostages , not prisoners .
The favored Israeli tactic of legitimizing mass civilian killings , as in Gaza last week , by saying that the attacks were directed primarily at " terrorists " is bogus .
Whatever the rationale , civilians are deliberately targeted when the civilian casualties bloodily outnumber noncivilian casualties , making those attacks acts of terrorism no different from suicide bombers blowing up restaurants .
The Marines ' massacre of civilians at Haditha in Iraq , the American military 's deliberate bombing of civilian targets in Vietnam , the nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki ( neither of which had significant military value ) , the British and American razing of European cities in World War II -- they all fit the classic definition of terrorism .
State terror 's apologists , Westerners especially , love to say that in " total war " there are no innocent civilians .
That 's a rationalization to ease consciences .
It 's equally necessary to dispense with such bromides as " one man 's terrorist is another man 's freedom fighter . "
It 's never who the perpetrators are or even what their goals are .
It 's what they do .
There is no such thing as a Palestinian or Iraqi " freedom fighter " who shoots up Yeshivas , blows up malls and mosques , murders passers - by .
Those , like the 9/11 attacks , are unquestionable , indefensible acts of terrorism .
But if terror is also coercion and deliberate violence against those who can't defend themselves , waterboarding , or what George W. Bush , our apologist - in - chief of torture , calls " specialized interrogation procedures , " is terrorism in its most distilled -- because utterly controlled -- form .
" But ' terrorism ' no longer means terrorism , " to quote Robert Fisk , the longest - serving Western journalist in the Middle East .
" It is not a definition .
It is a political contrivance .
' Terrorists ' are those who use violence against the side that is using the word . "
Until we get past the contrivance , using the word " terrorism " is itself an act of belligerence .
Its false distinctions conceal our own terrorism .
It absolves its perpetrators .
And it makes us complicit in the duplicity , if not the terrorism , for standing united behind the contrivance .

ADD Virginia , Maryland and the District of Columbia to the list .
Barack Obama has swept on without a loss since fighting Hillary Clinton to a draw in last week 's “ Super Tuesday ” voting for the Democratic presidential nomination .
He won four contests over the weekend and , on Tuesday February 12th , added three emphatic wins in the Potomac river region .
For the Clinton campaign the list is different .
Mrs Clinton 's advisers find a variety of reasons to dismiss almost all of Mr Obama 's recent successes .
Some ( such as Maine and Washington ) are “ caucus ” states that reward enthusiastic party activists but which leave many ordinary voters at home .
Others are Republican - heavy states ( Nebraska ) that Democrats are unlikely to win anyway in the general election in the autumn .
Others still ( Louisiana , Maryland , Washington , DC ) have big black populations that can be expected to vote for the first black candidate with a decent shot at the presidency .
But Mrs Clinton is running out of good reasons for why she should lose so many different states and by such big margins .
Virginia voted for Mr Obama by 64 % to 35 % .
Maryland went to him 59 - 37 % , and Washington , DC , by a whopping 75 - 24 % .
Virginia , especially , is hard to ignore .
Its demographic mix is not too different from neighbouring Tennessee , which Mrs Clinton won handily on Super Tuesday .
It sends over 80 delegates to the summer 's nominating convention .
And although not usually considered to be a swing state , the suburbs of Washington , DC , and the capital ( Richmond ) are growing more Democratic , giving the party a hope of snatching it from its usual place in the Republican win column come November .
Moreover , Mr Obama won nearly every significant group : among men and women , church - goers and church - avoiders , liberals and moderates , the well and the less educated .
He nearly tied with her among white voters and took 90 % of blacks .
Most polls had predicted Mr Obama would win ; none said that he would win by 28 percentage points .
Those looking for signs of a Clinton collapse will also note that her deputy campaign manager quit on Tuesday , after her campaign manager stepped down on Sunday .
They will also point to Wisconsin and Hawaii , which vote next Tuesday .
Polls now show Mr Obama to be strong in Wisconsin and he grew up in Hawaii , which is also expected to be favourable .
But Mrs Clinton is not out yet .
Pundits rushed to declare her campaign fatally wounded before she triumphed in New Hampshire in January .
They pronounced a wave of Obama momentum before she took all the big states she needed on Super Tuesday .
Equally , it would be unwise to count her out now as she can claim roughly the same number of delegates as Mr Obama , if not so many states .
Mrs Clinton's “ firewalls ” are the states of Ohio and Texas , which vote on March 4th .
Both are huge delegate hauls , and polls show her to be strong in both .
Her problem is that the proportional system the Democrats use — and especially in Texas 's convoluted system — mean that she cannot just win them to right her campaign .
She needs to win them big .
Her campaign strategist , Mark Penn , dismisses the idea of momentum in the Obama campaign , noting Mrs Clinton 's comeback in New Hampshire and the perceived fizzle of Mr Obama 's momentum before Super Tuesday .
But as February wears on , with Mr Obama notching win after win , some have started to compare her strategy to that of Rudy Giuliani .
New York 's former mayor tried to ignore early Republican contests , which he derided as small and disadvantageous for him , betting on Florida and Super Tuesday .
That failed spectacularly .
Counting on huge wins in Ohio and Texas looks risky for Mrs Clinton too .
On the Republican side , John McCain swept the Tuesday primaries as expected , and is the certain Republican nominee .
Mr Obama , in his victory speech , began to act like the Democratic standard - bearer , taking shots at Mr McCain 's staunch support for the Iraq war and for promising to keep George Bush 's tax cuts .
Mr McCain fired indirectly back , saying “ To encourage a country with only rhetoric rather than sound and proven ideas that trust in the strength and courage of free people is not a promise of hope .
It is a platitude . ”
This was an unveiled reference to Mr Obama 's habit of sounding grand themes more often than policy details .
Both men could be jumping the gun .
Mrs Clinton 's resilience and the political machine she built with her husband cannot be counted out .
And there is the unresolved question of the “ superdelegates ” , unelected Democratic Party bigwigs and certain officeholders , who may upset the Democratic apple - cart by voting for a candidate who did not win among ordinary , elected delegates .
But Mr Obama is savouring yet another big night .
He is now the front - runner .
One of the more outlandish claims John McCain routinely makes on the campaign trail is his boast that he called for Donald Rumsfeld ’s ouster before he resigned .
Part of the problem with the bogus claim is that major media personalities believe the claim , and keep passing it on to national audiences as if it were true .
Download Download ( h/t Heather )
On the March 5 edition of CNN’s The Situation Room , host Wolf Blitzer asked about Sen. John McCain : “ [ C ] an he disassociate himself … distance himself from the president ? ”
After CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said it would be “ [ t ] otally impossible , ” CNN senior political analyst Gloria Borger responded : “ [ B ]ut on the war , McCain has said over and over again , you know , ‘ I would have fired [ former Secretary of Defense ] Donald Rumsfeld . ’ ” When Toobin interrupted , asking : “ Did he call for Rumsfeld to be fired ? ” Blitzer said “ Yes ” and Borger agreed , saying : “ He did .
He did . ”
Despite Toobin ’s further protestations , Borger said of McCain ’s purported call for Rumsfeld to be fired : “ [ H ]e called for him to be fired while — in the Senate , ” “ Yeah .
Oh , absolutely , ” “ No , he did , ” and “ [ H ]e said I think Rumsfeld ought to be fired , you know , a long time ago .
Yeah . ”
Part of the problem , I suspect , is that Blitzer and Borger have heard McCain make the claim , and they assume he ’s telling the truth .
Of course , if Blitzer and Borger were better journalists , they ’d actually check to see if McCain ’s claim was accurate before repeating the lie for a national television audience , but my hunch is , they both think , “ McCain would n’t just make something like that up .
He keeps saying it , so it must be true . ”
It ’s part of the larger problem of McCain ’s media adulation — there ’s simply no skepticism .
They accept his “ straight - talking ” persona , which they ’ve helped manufacture , at face value .
With this in mind , it ’s worth setting the record straight .
Every time McCain claims credit for calling for Rumsfeld ’s ouster , he ’s not telling the truth .
Campaigners say protesters are " emboldened " by wide support
Foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said the authorities had " stabilised " the situation .
Unconfirmed reports earlier this week said as many as 600 monks had taken part in rallies , and that police used tear gas to disperse them .
Rights groups said the demonstrations were the biggest display of opposition to Chinese rule in Tibet since 1989 .
US - based Radio Free Asia reported on Tuesday that dozens of monks had been detained as the authorities sought to crack down on dissent .
However , little information emerged from Tibet and the authorities remained tight - lipped until Thursday , when Mr Qin confirmed that a series of rallies had taken place .
" In the past couple of days , a few monks in Lhasa have made some disturbances in an effort to cause unrest , " news agency AFP quoted him as saying .
" Thanks to the efforts of the local government and the democratic administration of the temples , the situation in Lhasa has been stabilised . "
Everest closure
Radio Free Asia reported that a number of monks were arrested on Monday after a march marking the 49th anniversary of a Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule .
The radio station , which is funded by the US government , said hundreds of monks took to the streets the following day to demand the release of their fellow monks - and were dispersed by tear gas .
Campaigners based outside China say protesters in Lhasa are being spurred on by rallies in other Chinese provinces and in India .
Matt Whitticase from the UK - based Free Tibet Campaign said protesters in Lhasa had been " emboldened " by the support they were receiving from across the world .
" Tibetans inside Tibet are aware that Tibetans in India are marching towards the Tibet border , " he said .
Tibetan exiles in India began a march to the border with China on Monday - one of several events protesting against the Beijing Olympics and campaigning for an independent Tibet .
But Indian police arrested more than 100 of the exiles , saying their march breached an agreement between Delhi and the Tibet 's India - based government - in - exile , headed by the province 's spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama .
A surge in Tibetan activism could become a security headache for China in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics , correspondents say .
This week the Chinese leadership closed the north face of Mount Everest until after the Olympic Flame ascends in May , for fear that activists might use it to stage photogenic Tibet - related protests .
China says
Tibet has always been part of its territory , though Tibet enjoyed long periods of autonomy before the twentieth century , and many Tibetans remain loyal to the Dalai Lama , who fled in 1959 and currently lives in exile in India .
Are you in Tibet or do you know anyone currently in Tibet ?
Did you witness the rallies this week ?

During Nvidia ’s fourth - quarter financial results conference call , Nvidia shed a little more light on its acquisition of Ageia and what it plans to do with the firm ’s PhysX technology .
Nvidia CEO
Jen -Hsun
Huang made no announcements regarding the deal until asked in the question - and - answer session , but he was happy to divulge a decent number of details .
Huang revealed that Nvidia ’s strategy is to take the PhysX engine and port it onto CUDA .
For those not in the know , CUDA stands for Compute Unified Device Architecture , and it ’s a C - like application programming interface Nvidia developed to let programmers write general - purpose applications that can run on GPUs .
All of Nvidia ’s existing GeForce 8 graphics processors already support CUDA , and Huang confirmed that the cards will be able to run PhysX .
We ’re working toward the physics - engine - to - CUDA port as we speak .
And we intend to throw a lot of resources at it .
You know , I would n’t be surprised if it helps our GPU sales even in advance of [ the port ’s completion ] .
The reason is , [ it ’s ] just gonna be a software download .
Every single GPU that is CUDA - enabled will be able to run the physics engine when it comes .
. . .
Every one of our GeForce 8 - series GPUs runs CUDA .
Huang thinks the integration will encourage people to spend more on graphics processing hardware , as well :
Our expectation is that this is gonna encourage people to buy even better GPUs .
It might — and probably will — encourage people to buy a second GPU for their SLI slot .
And for the highest - end gamer , it will encourage them to buy three GPUs .
Potentially two for graphics and one for physics , or one for graphics and two for physics .
Last , but not least , Huang said developers are “ really excited ” about the PhysX - to - CUDA port .
“ Finally they ’re able to get a physics engine accelerated into a very large population of gamers , ” he explained .
Huang was unwilling to get into a time frame for the release of the first PhysX port .
However , considering this will be purely a software implementation and Nvidia now has Ageia engineers on its payroll , the port may not take too long to complete .
Certainly the outlook for democracy seems pretty bleak — and how could it be otherwise ?
The surest way to make a problem worse is to pretend it is n’t there , which is exactly what our press and politicians have been doing ; and the rest is , unfortunately , history .
But history can be changed , as We the People have continually learned , from our refusal of colonial subjection , to our ( partial ) establishment as a democratic republic , to the abolition of slavery , to the enfranchisement of women , to the end of formal segregation and the passage of the Voting Rights Act .
After that , our progress seemed to stop , and it must now resume : for history can be changed , and for the better , but only through our own unbreakable commitment to , and action for , enlightened policies for the renewal of our democracy .
Based squarely on America ’s first principles , such policies would not be wholly new , however revolutionary they must sound in these bad , backward times .
As it was certain policies that got us into this horrific situation , certain other policies can get us out .
The fact is that We the People are in lousy shape , and must get straight as soon as possible .
For we are all addicted to the horse race — and we ca n’t win , because it ’s fixed .
And so , before we end up losing everything , we need to pull ourselves together , face the music , and then take all necessary steps to change the tune .

If you believe in a Divine Creation , and some other group is studing the same creation from a different view point , would not there be some differences ?
They are both sharing their Truth ... now you must find your TRUTH .
My TRUTH says they are both right ...
Science is right in their views , and since I believe GOD 's day is much longer than 24hours , why can't Adam be the missing link , making the pastor 1/ 2 right as well .
( and my TRUTH holds that I call GOD by many other names as well .
I hold the belief that LOVE is GOD 's greatest gift , and SEX is a form of expressing that love , and the DEVIL has tempted man with it , so man has made it an evil thing ...
I Hold that the DEVIL 's job is to tempt man , and he does some of the best work on earth if you allow him ...
I for one do not allow him in my life . )

Question -
What do you do with passages like James 1:12 - 15 where it states that YAHWEH does n't tempt man ?
How could
He be responsible for temptations if he does n't do that ?
Answer -
If Yahweh does not tempt any man ( according to James 1:12 - 15 ) , why then do most Christians say the Lords prayer as : " And lead us not into ' temptation , ' but deliver us from evil " ( Matt . 6:13 ; Luke 11:4 ) KJV ?
Do the passages in James 1:12 - 15 , and Matt. 6:13 contradict each other ?
We must again go into the Greek language of the New Covenant to find the correct understanding .
Matt .
6:13 - " And bring us not into testing ( a situation were we are put to the proof ) , but rescue us from the bad ... "
James 1:12 -15 - " Let no one say when he is tested ( put to trial ) , " I am tested by Yahweh , " for Yahweh is not temptable by evils ( the bad ) ; furthermore He Himself temps not even one .
But everyone is tested ( put to trial ) by his own desire , drawn away and trapped ; then the desire having been conceived ; gives birth to sin ; and sin having been completed , brings forth death . "
Yahweh does not directly tempt or entice .
Does
He does bring about the conditions or situations that puts us to the proof ( testing ) ?
Yes ,
He does !
Like
He did in the story of Job , when He permitted the adversary to inflict Job 's family with evil ( bad things ) .
And , even like
He did with Yahshua , the first born son , who was tested by the adversary ( Matt. 4:1 ) .
And , many times Yahweh inflicts evil ( the bad ) to accomplish
His purpose , sometimes even He Himself becomes an adversary ' satan ' ( I Chron . 21:1 ) .
Many times ( according to Scripture )
He directly causes ' the bad ' ( the evil ) .
But ultimately , the evil Yahweh causes is used to accomplish
His good will , and is for our own good .

How To Make a Bloody Valentine Heart
It 's almost Valentine 's day and nothing says LOVE more than a card and a heart and a ring !
Now , whether you 're making a Valentine wish of your own , or simply making a gruesome dessert , this Bleeding Heart recipe is guaranteed to shock your guests and delight your friend (s ) !
What The Heck Is This ?
The mangled heart above once looked like this :
It 's a gelatin heart with a bag of " blood " inside , so that once cut / stabbed / slashed , the blood within sprays and oozes out .
The heart itself is strawberry flavored , and the blood is cherry flavored .
It 's perfectly edible .
I used this for my Cannibal - Themed Halloween Supper as a dessert .
But here , as part of a Valentine 's day wish it had a ring hidden inside .
A knife and a gentle hint as to what to look for , and your sweetheart is guaranteed to be touched .
Or horrified .
How To Make One
You will need the following items :
One heart - shaped mold ( an anatomically - correct one is available at The Anatomical Chart Company .
You can also use a Valentine heart - shaped cake pan or tray if you like . )
1 large package Strawberry flavor gelatin ( 6oz , or 170g )
1/2 can evaporated skim milk .
Food coloring - pastes are preferred .
Clean paintbrush to apply food colors with .
A clean produce bag for the blood .
Corn syrup and Grenadine .
Non -stick cooking spray .
Mix 1 cup of boiling water into the gelatin powder .
Stir until the powder is dissolved .
Add 1/2 a can of evaporated skim milk and stir well .
The result should look like the image on the left .
Now , prepare the mold by spraying it lightly with some cooking spray .
This will prevent the heart from sticking in the mold later .
Sit the mold in a bowl surrounded by a towel to hold it upright .
Pour in a small amount of the liquid .
Just enough to cover the bottom about a half - inch worth .
Stick this in the fridge to cool .
We will come back to it later .
Now , let 's make the blood - bag while we 're waiting for that little bit of gelatin in the mold to firm up .
Pour some clear corn syrup and Grenadine in the blood bag .
Use more Grenadine if you want the " blood " to be runnier ( more of a ' spurt ' if the heart is stabbed ) or more corn syrup if you want it thicker ( more of an ' ooze ' ) .
( This version is an " oozer " .
For an example of a " spurter " , take a look at this video . )
Add red food coloring if it 's not red enough .
Add a couple drops of green food coloring to make the red darker if needed .
If you want any " extras " to be inside the heart ( like a ring ) , you should put them in the blood bag .
Now tie off the bag carefully so you have a triangle or cone - shaped bag of blood .
Cut off the " tail " of the bag right above the knot .
This bag will sit inside the heart .
Note that while the heart and the blood is edible ( and even kind of tasty ) , the bag is not !
If your intention is to use the heart as a dessert and not just a prop , you may want to consider making two hearts -- one with a blood bag for show , and one without a blood bag for eating .
Once the gelatin in the bottom of the mold has firmed up enough , place the bag of blood on it and center it as best as you can .
Try to keep it away from the edges of the mold .
Then , pour the remaining gelatin mixture over the blood bag until you fill the mold .
Cover it with plastic wrap and stick it in the fridge until it sets ( preferably overnight ) .
TIP : If you lay the plastic wrap directly on the surface of the liquid , it will prevent the top layer from forming a tough " skin " .
After the heart has set , loosen the edges of the mold with your fingertip , then simply turn it out onto a plate .
Trim away the excess from the sides of the heart with a knife .
Cut on a bevel ( i.e. at an angle towards the bottom - inside of the heart ) so it looks better .
Scoop out the arteries with a spoon .
Use a drinking straw for the smaller one .
It 's starting to look like a heart !
Painting and Finishing Touches
Now we apply some food coloring with a brush to make it look more realistic .
Of course , we 're only making look " realistic " in a comic - book sense .
The colors wo n't really be much like a real heart fresh from a ribcage would look - but it will look like what most people expect a heat to look like .
Use purple for the ridged areas shown .
Try to paint darker near the bottoms and sides , and lighten up on the tops .
You can paint a little red on the top part as a highlight .
Just do n't overdo it and you should be fine .
Now go over each vein with red .
Just a little should do it .
Color some parts of the heart 's surface with a bit of red too to bring out color .
Looking pretty good so far !
Now , only a couple more things to do .
Trace each vein with a little bit of pale blue .
Do n't do the whole vein - just enough to give it a tint .
Finally , color in the holes we made in the arteries with black .
Done !
Presentation and Uses Well , the presentation is up to you .
I combined it with a card , and hid a ring inside the heart - a knife was needed to cut open the heart and fish out the bloody ring .
Here are some other ideas :
This works great with a traditional " My Heart is Yours " kind of Valentine 's Day Card .
It can be a good dessert for a Valentine 's Day meal .
( Remember , do n't serve anyone a piece of plastic bag from inside !
To paraphrase Penn and Teller , this is to help you amuse and terrify your guests - not be a criminally negligent dumbass . )
Use it to impress that Goth girl you 've been swooning over , or :
Use it to drive away a too - square - for - your - tastes boy / girlfriend .

“ But it ’s a holiday theme ! ” Terrific , but that does n’t change the fact that the girl I ’m undressing in front of is now trying to decide whether to fuck me or read me a Bernstein Bears story .
# 2 . Whatever “ For Dummies ” book pertains to the career I ’m actively pursuingI know that certain scientific laws make it impossible to give gifts that are n’t tangible like “ running ” or in this case , “ spitting in my face , ” but I must say , you ’ve come close with your choice to give me this , “ For Dummies ” book .
I know you do n’t understand what I do for a living , but just because Michael Douglas did n’t pay for a limo to drop me off at the party you should n’t assume that I ’m failing miserably .
Your lack of faith would n’t be more obvious if you just gave me a job application to Wal - Mart .
#3 . The DVD first season of some short - lived , completely forgettable showThere is absolutely no reason anyone ( including Andy Griffith ) should ever need to have instant access to any specific episode of Matlock .
Is this one where Matlock wastes the court ’s time to make reference to his love of Southern cooking or is it the one where the black guy goes to a seedy bar and uses his street smarts to wrangle information ?
The whole point of daytime television is to bore people into canning the “ I ’m sick ” bullshit so they can get back to work .

Oh neat , it even snaps shut so there ’s no way my sandwich , chips , or chances of ever having sex again will fall out .

I ’ll set it on top of that dresser I keep my baseball cards in .

If you really want to distract God from what a huge asshole I am , just help me build this brick wall in front of the hooker I ’m about to have sex with .
#8 . Christmas decorationsGifts that offer a type of delayed satisfaction are fine when it ’s something like concert tickets .
However , giving someone a Christmas decoration as a gift on Christmas will make people hope aloud that you did n’t drive yourself there .
In fact , it ’s so ridiculous ; it actually creates feelings of sadness and pity rather than disbelief .
Your friends and family will wonder if you even know how the holiday works .
Some might even wonder why you did n’t just take it to the max and hand out coupons offering to help shovel dirt onto their coffin after they ’ve passed away .

“ Oh ha !

The only reason assholes like Scrooge make their employees work late on Christmas Eve is because from 10 am to 3 pm , those same employees were pissing away company money with trivial gift exchanges .
Wrapping up boxes of paper clips and handing them out as gifts is n’t entertaining .

If ever the day arrives that I ’m reduced to the type of mongoloid who spends his days puttering around the backyard with a butterfly net , I give you full permission to take me down to the creek , tell me about the rabbit farm , and then blow my fucking brains out .#11 .
Any gift that serves as an attempt to include me in whatever cultish fad you ’re currently wasting your time with .
Yes , I ’ve heard of The Secret and honestly I ’m glad you ’ve found something to momentarily distract you from the fact that your job is slowly driving you to suicide and you ’re about a spilled drink on the couch away from your third divorce .
However , because I do n’t see you often enough to warrant showing any real concern with your life , please realize that it ’s just easier for me smile and nod in response to whatever cup of poisonous Kool - Aid you happen to be drinking at the moment than to give you my honest opinion .
All I ask is that you just leave me the hell out of it .
I ’m pretty into porn , but you wo n’t see me trying to throw that at you …except for redtube.com .
It ’s pretty impressive with the search engine and what not .
MERRY CHRISTMAS !!!!

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - A Chinese bride burned her new husband to death after he got into bed after a drunken argument without washing his feet , state media reported on Wednesday .
“ Wang and his wife , Luo , were married on February 2 .
The couple , however , frequently fought over trivial things while still on their honeymoon , ” the official Xinhua news agency quoted a local newspaper as saying .
The couple , from the central province of Hubei , had another fight on the night of March 4 , “ and in frustration they together drank a bottle of liquor to ease their anger . ”
“ At about 10 p.m. , Luo watched her husband get into bed without cleaning or washing his feet .
In a fit of anger and intoxication , she set fire to the sheet he was sleeping in , ” the report said .
“ When he awoke , the two began fighting before a very drunk Wang collapsed .
As fire engulfed the bedroom .
Luo escaped to the living room , leaving her other half to burn , ” it added .
The woman has been arrested , Xinhua said .

[ digg - reddit - me ] A few weeks ago , I wrote a post listing the reasons Senator Hillary Clinton should bow out of the race for the presidency for the good of liberalism , the Democratic party , and the nation .
Predictably , she did not do so .
But the list also happens to double as a catalog of some of the top reasons not to vote for her .
( Here is a more subtle argument against her candidacy and in favor of Mr. Obama ’s . )
But now , today , the day before the crucial February 5th primaries , I make the positive case for why you should vote for Senator Barack Obama tomorrow – if you happen to be lucky enough to be in one of the Super Tuesday states .
At the moment , Barack has the momentum : the money ; the rising polls ; and a string of major endorsements ( from MoveOn.org to Ted Kennedy to Maria Shriver to Susan Eisenhower to La Opinion . )
It will still be difficult to overcome the substantial lead Ms. Clinton has – based on her name recognition , her long history in the public eye , and the generally competent campaign she has run .
Some have taken to describing this coming Super Tuesday as a battle between an immovable object and an unstoppable force – with Ms. Clinton ’s base – some 15 % of the general electorate and 30 – 40 % of the Democratic primary electorate – as the immovable object and coalition of the growing youth vote , the independents , the crossover voters , the black voters , and a majority voters under the age of 45 as the unstoppable force .
I ca n’t say who is going to win tomorrow – and some sort of tie seems most likely .
This , however , is my attempt to influence the decision , to fire up those already backing Barack , and help , in whatever way I can , the next President of the United States of America :
The case for Barack Obama in 12 parts ( with a bonus ) .
Bonus reason :
He inspires me , and many others as well , to believe in America again – to believe in the promise of a great nation fallen , to give of our time and our energy to make a better tomorrow ; Barack Obama inspires me :
( N.B . The speech is still moving , even if you do n’t play Hans Zimmer ’s Gladiator soundtrack behind it .
But Hans Zimmer gives it an extra kick . )
In trying to understand Mr. Obama ’s thought , it is also worth checking out his Call to Renewal keynote address , his video internet sensation the Ebenezer Sermon , his complete speech to the 2004 Democratic National Convention that launched him into the public spotlight , his prescient speech against the war in Iraq , his Iowa caucus victory speech beginning with the weighty : “ They said this day would never come , ” his South Carolina victory speech that best captured his response to Clintonism , and finally , the Jefferson - Jackson Dinner speech that catapulted Obama to the forefront of the Iowa polls and gave him , in the words of the influential Iowa columnist , “ The Big Mo ’ “ .
All of these speeches were excellent – far above the level of any other politician today .
More important , they speak to the moment we are in as a country in a way that no other politician tries to .
At the same time , they give insight into how Obama ’s politics works – and what drives him .
( It ’s also worth noting that Mr. Obama ’s head campaign speechwriter is an acquaintance of mine from college , Jon Favreau . )
Concluding thoughts
Tomorrow , liberals and Democrats get to decide who can best fight for a progressive agenda in Washington ; independents and Republicans ( in some states ) get to choose which man or woman they want to lead our nation in troubled times ; the younger generation can demonstrate in emphatic fashion that they are not a political force to be ignored – that we are taking responsibility for our politics and our country .
We realize that America is in a state of moral , political , legal , and economic decline , and that our choice is between Ms. Clinton who will competently manage our country ’s decline and Mr. Obama who has a chance to restore and renew our civic life .
So when you stand in the voting booth tomorrow – alone , with only your judgment as a guide – think about who can lead our country , who can call forth the better angels of our nature , who will be prudent in his use of the powers of the presidency .
Dare to hope :
But in the unlikely story that is America , there has never been anything false about hope .
For when we have faced down impossible odds ; when we ’ve been told that we ’re not ready , or that we should n’t try , or that we can ’t , generations of Americans have responded with a simple creed that sums up the spirit of a people .
Yes .
We. Can .

Hold the Hysteria
WASHINGTON --
Regarding the economy , it 's hard not to notice this stark contrast :
The " real economy " of spending , production and jobs -- though weakening -- is hardly in a state of collapse ; but much of today 's semi-hysterical commentary suggests that it is .
Financial markets for stocks and bonds are described as being " in turmoil . "
People talk about a recession as if it were the second coming of Genghis Khan .
Some whisper the dreaded word " depression . "
Meanwhile , Americans are expected to buy about 15 million vehicles in 2008 ; though down from 16.5 million in 2006 , that 's still a lot .
There 's a disconnect between what people see around them and what they 're told is happening .
The first is upsetting ( rising gas prices , falling home prices , fewer jobs ) but reflects the normal reverses of a $ 14 trillion economy .
The second ( " panic , " " financial meltdown " ) suggests the onset of something catastrophic and totally outside the experience of ordinary people .
The economy , said The New York Times last week , may be on " the brink of the worst recession in a generation " -- an ominous warning .
Perhaps , but so far the concrete evidence is scant .
A recession is a noticeable period of declining output .
Since World War II , there have been 10 .
On average , they 've lasted 10 months , involved a peak monthly unemployment rate of 7.6 percent and resulted in a decline of economic output ( gross domestic product ) of 1.8 percent , reports Mark Zandi of Moody's Economy.com .
If the two worst recessions ( those of 1981 - 82 and 1973 - 75 , with peak unemployment of 10.8 percent and 9 percent ) are excluded , the average peak jobless rate is about 7 percent .
No one doubts that the economy has slowed .
Many economists think a recession has already started .
Zandi is one .
He forecasts peak unemployment of 6.1 percent ( present unemployment : 4.8 percent ) and a GDP drop of 0.4 percent .
If that comes true , the recession of 2008 would actually be milder than the average postwar recession and milder than the last two , those of 1990 - 91 and 2001 .
Broadly speaking , the story is similar for stocks .
So far , their weakness is unexceptional .
A standard definition of a " bear market " is a drop of 20 percent or more .
Last week , the market was at times close to that .
Declines would have to get much worse to qualify as momentous .
Since 1936 , there have been 11 bear markets as measured by the Standard & Poor 's index of 500 stocks , says Howard Silverblatt of S&P .
On average , they 've lasted 20 months and involved a decline of 34 percent .
One was 60 percent ( 1937 - 42 ) and two were nearly 50 percent ( 1973 - 74 and 2000 - 02 , the last being the " tech bubble " ) .
Some causes of the present hysteria are familiar : media hype ; political finger - pointing -- always given to exaggeration ; and whining from Wall Street types .
But there 's also another large cause : disagreement over whether the economy is highly unstable or whether business cycles are mostly self - correcting .
" This argument is as old as economics , " says economic historian Barry Eichengreen of the University of California , Berkeley .
" There is no more consensus ( now ) ... than there was 70 years ago . "
Those who think the economy is highly unstable talk now of an alarming " negative feedback loop " -- a " vicious circle " to most people .
Housing prices fall , creating more foreclosures ; losses on mortgages increase , eroding the capital of banks and causing them to curtail lending -- which weakens the economy , depresses housing prices and causes more foreclosures and losses .
Just as in the Depression , a crippled financial system spreads the slump .
Only forceful government intervention can break the downward spiral .
Not necessarily , if most markets self - correct .
As housing prices fall , more buyers come into the market ; sales and construction revive .
If inventories get too high , production slows and surpluses are sold ; then production accelerates .
If consumers or businesses are overindebted , they reduce spending to repay loans ; spending speeds up when debt burdens drop .
Government can help smooth business cycles and prevent financial panics .
But if it 's too aggressive , it may make matters worse .
That occurred in the 1970s when easy credit created double - digit inflation -- and then required harsh recessions to suppress it .
Hardly anyone adheres rigidly to either view but many favor one or the other .
That explains why today 's situation seems so threatening to some and less so to others .
The Great Depression does n't settle the issue .
True , massive bank failures converted an ordinary recession into a calamity ; but it's also true that government policy -- excessive rigidity by the Federal Reserve -- actually aggravated the banking collapse .
Still , economic conditions in the 1930s ( average unemployment : 18 percent ) were so different from today 's that casual references to " depression " amount to fear - mongering .
If catastrophe strikes , it will probably result from something we do n't now know or we have n't yet imagined .

In 2000 , Mr. Snipes sought a federal permit for a military training compound on land next to the Nuwaubian camp ; the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms rejected the request .
“ Snipes is already drawing whole new demographics to the movement , ” Ms. MacNab added .
“ Tax protesters used to be white , 50 or older , blue - collar , rural and often connected to racist movements , but Snipes is young , urban and famous . ”
She and others said the movement got a boost in 2005 when a jury acquitted Joseph Banister , a former criminal investigator for the I.R.S. , who used his acquittal as proof that his views on the tax law were correct .
One problem with that case was that even though his co-defendant , Al Thompson of Lake Shasta , Calif. , was acquitted of conspiracy in a separate trial , Mr. Thompson is serving six years in prison for failing to withhold taxes from his employees and turn the money over .
Federal prosecutors also failed to convict a Louisiana lawyer , Tom Cryer , who , like Mr. Snipes , said he sincerely believed that he was not required to pay taxes .
Another resister , Robert Lawrence of Peoria , Ill. , had his case dropped in 2006 after arguing that tax forms violate the federal Paperwork Reduction
Act  a strategy that had been falling out of favor among tax opponents but has since gained new adherents .
Both men were still liable for the taxes after their cases .
Prosecutors also failed to convict a FedEx pilot , Vernice Kuglin of Memphis , who said she wrote the I.R.S. asking what law makes her liable for taxes , but got no response .
She later signed papers conceding she owed more than $ 600,000 in taxes , and last week her goods , including her 14 - year - old vehicle , were auctioned in Memphis .
Ms. Kuglin said that despite the court filing , she continues to believe that she does not owe taxes .
Tax specialists and lawyers say that the Snipes case hinges on whether he can persuade jurors that he sincerely believed that he did not have to pay taxes , while prosecutors will argue that he was just trying to avoid them .
The Supreme Court has ruled that people can make such an argument , but two leading defense lawyers said that Mr. Snipes might have a hard time using it as a defense .
Michael Louis Minns , a Houston lawyer who has defended and won acquittals for tax protesters , said that the three bad checks that Mr. Snipes sent the government to cover $ 14 million of taxes would seem to destroy a defense based on that argument .
Nanotechnology researchers go ballistic over graphene
( Nanowerk Spotlight ) Carbon comes in many different forms , from the graphite found in pencils to the world 's most expensive diamonds .
In 1980 , we knew of only three basic forms of carbon , namely diamond , graphite , and amorphous carbon .
Then , fullerenes and carbon nanotubes were discovered and all of a sudden that was where nanotechnology researchers wanted to be .
Recently , though , there has been quite a buzz about graphene .
Discovered only in 2004 , graphene is a flat one - atom thick sheet of carbon .
Existing forms of carbon basically consist of sheets of graphene , either bonded on top of each other to form a solid material like the graphite in your pencil , or rolled up into carbon nanotubes ( think of a single - walled carbon nanotube as a graphene cylinder ) or folded into fullerenes .
Physicists had long considered a free - standing form of planar graphene impossible ; the conventional wisdom was that such a sheet always would roll up .
Initially using such high - tech gadgets like pencils and sticky tape to strip chunks of graphite down to layers just one atom thick , the process has now been refined to involve more expensive instruments such as electron beam and atomic force microscopes .
Despite being isolated only three years ago , graphene has already appeared in hundreds of papers .
The reason scientists are so excited is that two - dimensional crystals ( it 's called 2D because it extends in only two dimensions - length and width ; as the material is only one atom thick , the third dimension , height , is considered to be zero ) open up a whole new class of materials with novel electronic , optical and mechanical properties .
Mother of all graphitic forms .
Graphene is a 2D building material for carbon materials of all other dimensionalities .
It can be wrapped up into 0D buckyballs , rolled into 1D nanotubes or stacked into 3D graphite .
( Artistic impression of a corrugated graphene sheet : Jannik Meyer )
" Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum , graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of relativistic condensed - matter physics , where quantum relativistic phenomena , some of which are unobservable in high - energy physics , can now be mimicked and tested in table - top experiments " Dr. Kostya Novoselov explains to Nanowerk .
" More generally , graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick , and , on this basis , offers new inroads into low - dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications . "
Novoselov , The Royal Society Research Fellow , and a member of the Mesoscopic Physics Group at the University of Manchester , is one of the original team , led by Professor Andre Geim , that discovered graphene in 2004 .
In a recent progress article in Nature Materials ( " The rise of graphene " ) Novoselov and Geim report on the current knowledge , ongoing efforts and expectation regarding graphene research .
Experiments with graphene have revealed some fascinating phenomena that excite researchers working towards molecular electronics .
Geim 's team found that graphene remains capable of conducting electricity even at the limit of nominally zero carrier concentration because the electrons do n't seem to slow down or localize .
Novoselov says that the electrons moving around carbon atoms interact with the periodic potential of graphenes honeycomb lattice , which gives rise to new quasiparticles that have lost their mass , or ' rest mass ' ( so - called massless Dirac fermions ) .
That means that graphene never stops conducting .
It was also found that they travel far faster than electrons in other semiconductors .
In the ultimate nanoscale transistor – dubbed a ballistic transistor – the electrons avoid collisions , i.e. there is a virtually unimpeded flow of current .
Ballistic conduction would enable incredibly fast switching devices .
Graphene has the potential to enable ballistic transistors at room temperature .
Already , efforts to develop graphene electronics are underway .
A first report on confined geometries in graphene ( graphene quantum dots ) was done by Geims group in their above - mentioned review .
At the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute they are working on graphene nanoribbons .
These ribbons have also been demonstrated by IBM and the Kim group at Columbia University .
At Delft 's Kavli Institute for Nanoscience they attach graphene to superconductors to get a a bipolar transistor for superconducting currents .
" Whichever approach prevails " says Novoselov , " there are two immediate challenges : First , despite the recent progress in epitaxial growth of graphene , high - quality wafers suitable for industrial applications still remain to be demonstrated .
Second , individual features in graphene devices need to be controlled accurately enough to provide sufficient reproducibility in their properties .
" The latter is exactly the same challenge that the silicon technology has been dealing with successfully .
For the time being , to make proof - of - principle nanometer - size devices , one can use electrochemical etching of graphene by scanning - probe nanolithography . "

Despite all the excitement , do n't expect ' graphenium ' microprocessors for at least another 20 years .
Just look at carbon nanotubes .
First observed in 1991 , they have created tremendous excitement ( and hype ) .
But today , 16 years later , there are no commercial CNT - based breakthrough products on the market – although they supposedly make your golf balls go straighter ( a breakthrough for some golfers at least ) .
In the meantime , other graphene - based applications might come of age .
Besides its electronic properties , graphene is also researched for its mechanical , thermal and optical properties .
Already , existing graphene samples grown on silicon carbide substrate are of sufficient quality to be used for gas sensors .
At Northwestern they work on graphene oxide paper and at Cornell they are building graphene resonators .
Novoselov and Geim themselves have just reported a few days ago that graphene based sensors could sniff out dangerous molecules .
Max Planck scientists , who work with Geim and Novoselov , are also interested in graphene sheets as membranes for biomolecular sensors .
This idea to use graphene as a substrate to study biomolecules originated at the University of Zurich and there currently is a joint project – Structural Information of Biological Molecules at Atomic Resolution ( SIBMAR ) – where graphene could play a role .
" The most immediate application for graphene is probably its use in composite materials " says Geim .
" It would allow conductive plastics at less than one volume percent filling , which in combination with low production costs makes graphene - based composite materials attractive for a variety of uses .
However , it seems doubtful that such composites can match the mechanical strength of their nanotube counterparts because of much stronger entanglement in the latter case . "
Another enticing possibility mentioned by Geim is the use of graphene powder in electric batteries that are already one of the main markets for graphite .
" An ultimately large surface - to - volume ratio and high conductivity provided by graphene powder can lead to improvements in the efficiency of batteries , taking over from the carbon nanofibers used in modern batteries .
Carbon nanotubes have also been considered for this application but graphene powder has an important advantage of being cheap to produce . "
CHICAGO  Stunning many who considered the district west of Chicago reliably Republican territory , Bill Foster , a physicist and Democrat , won a special election on Saturday to fill the Congressional seat that J. Dennis Hastert , the former speaker of the House , held for two decades .
Mr. Foster ’s success deeply disappointed Republicans , in part for its broader implications : the victory in this early race may buoy Democrats as they look ahead to a string of Republican retirements this fall .
Mr. Hastert was one of the best - known Republican members of Congress and he was elected from what was once a Republican stronghold .
Mr. Foster defeated James D. Oberweis , a dairy company owner , in a contest for the 14th Congressional district , a long swath that runs from the far western suburbs of Chicago nearly to the state ’s Iowa border .
He will fill the remaining months of Mr. Hastert ’s term .
I was expecting someone to pull the truck over on top of himself , but no , no one gets hurt ( I think ) .
Still , the result is not what these guys expected !

Print This Email This Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton carefully sidestepped questions Monday about the sex scandal engulfing Eliot Spitzer , her home state governor and political ally .
" I do n't have any comment on that .
Obviously I am sending my best wishes and thoughts to the governor and to his family , " Clinton said , opening her first campaign swing through Pennsylvania , which holds its presidential primary April 22 .
Spitzer apologized Monday after he was accused of paying for sex with a high - priced call girl .
Authorities say he was caught on a federal wiretap arranging a tryst with the woman at a Washington hotel room .
It was a blow to Clinton , who recently had intensified her criticism of rival Barack Obama 's relationship with Antoin " Tony " Rezko , a political patron on trial in federal court in Obama 's hometown of Chicago for alleged fraud and corruption .
The website Radar reports that within an hour of the Spitzer story breaking , Clinton 's campaign website removed the news that Spitzer had endorsed her .
However , the Clinton campaign later blasted the story as a rumor .
" There is a rumor online that the Hillary campaign ' scrubbed ' Elliot Spitzer from our website , " the New York senator 's campaign site complains .
" This is untrue . "
According to the site , " the press release on Spitzer 's endorsement was never posted to our website , [ and n]either was the endorsement of Sen. Chuck Schumer .
But there are numerous mentions of Spitzer support for Hillary on HillaryClinton.com including here , here and here . "
While not personally close , Clinton and Spitzer have been friendly colleagues since the former first lady first ran for the Senate in New York in 2000 .
Her aides said Clinton deeply respected Spitzer 's work during his two terms as state attorney general , where he became a national crusader against corporate corruption and Wall Street investment excesses .
But indirectly , Spitzer also caused Clinton a significant political headache late last year when he proposed a plan to provide illegal immigrants with drivers ' licenses .
During a nationally televised debate , Clinton tripped over a question about whether she supported the proposal , prompting criticism that she was being evasive .
She later said she opposed the plan but had n't wanted to damage Spitzer by saying so .
Spitzer later killed the idea .
Spitzer was slow to endorse Clinton 's White House bid and has not been among her more forceful surrogates .
But he is one of her all - important superdelegates , elected officials and party leaders who could play a decisive role in determining who becomes the presidential nominee .
Clinton declined to say whether she believed Spitzer could survive the scandal , which drew immediate calls for him to resign .
" Let 's wait and see what comes out of the next few days , " she said .
" Right now I do n't have any comment .
I think it 's appropriate to wish his family well and see how things develop . "
No stranger to the public humiliation of sex scandals , the former first lady stood by her husband in 1998 through the investigation of his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky and subsequent impeachment .
Coincidentally , a handful of Clinton 's high - profile supporters have been forced to apologize for sexual misbehavior .
Early in 2007 , San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom publicly apologized for having a relationship with the wife of a top political aide .
He blamed alcohol dependence for his actions and checked into rehab .
Shortly after endorsing Clinton in May 2007 , Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa , a rising Hispanic star in the Democratic Party , announced he was divorcing his wife after carrying on monthslong affair with a local television news anchor .
With wire services .
This is the sixth of eight stories in our Web feature on self - experimenters .
When Seth Roberts began suffering from insomnia in the early 1980s , waking up tired in the morning only to nod off again within a few hours , he could easily have taken sleeping pills for relief .
But that would have deprived the Berkeley , Calif. , experimental psychologist the satisfaction of spending the next decade trying to solve the problem himself .
Roberts , you see , is a die - hard experimentalist , and his favorite experimental subject is himself .
For the past three decades , he has deliberately tinkered with his daily routine , slowly introducing one small change after another in his diet and other habits , all the while keeping careful track of the effects on his state of being — specifically , his weight , mood or sleep cycle .
Although he has n't convinced everyone that his methods are up to snuff , his bestselling book suggests someone is paying attention .
Roberts , 54 , discovered his inner lab rat as a graduate student in psychology at Brown University in Providence , R.I. , where he had to figure out how to design experiments on actual rodents .
He found that practicing on himself was quick and easy , starting with his acne .
By counting his blemishes daily , he discovered that a prescription cream cleared his complexion , allowing him to toss the antibiotics he had also been taking .
So began a life of systematic trial and error .
To cure his insomnia , he tried exercise , calcium and adjusting the settings on fluorescent lamps near his bed .
" I came to realize how ignorant I was , " says Roberts , whose day job was studying rat learning at the University of California , Berkeley .
On October 2 , 1993 , thinking that his choice of breakfast might play a role , he tried delaying his morning meal until 11 A.M. to get a baseline reading .
Within a week the problem that had plagued him for years was gone .
He resumed eating breakfast at 7 A.M. more than three months later , and his insomnia was back the next day .
A 2004 paper published in Behavioral and Brain Sciences set out the data behind the unexpected breakfast effect along with nine other findings from self - experiments .
Among them : an hour of morning sunlight made his sleep even more restorative ; so did being on his feet for nine hours a day .
Watching faces on television talk shows early in the morning elevated his mood the following day — he guesses it reflects an ingrained response to social contact .
( He has since switched to watching himself in the mirror , to see if any face will do . )
His weightiest finding , so to speak , was that he could regulate his appetite by drinking unflavored fructose water between meals .
He dropped 35 pounds ( 16 kilograms ) in this way from a starting weight of 185 ( 84 kilograms ) , then gained 10 of them back because friends said he looked gaunt .
Later he found that a couple of tablespoons of flavorless vegetable oil worked equally well .
Roberts put forth his theory of weight loss in a slim volume called The Shangri - La Diet , which cracked The New York Times Best Sellers list in 2006 .
On his Web site , he invites readers of his book to share what worked for them and what did n't .
Skeptics abound .
Experimenters who test ideas on themselves may be biased to produce the result they expect to see , says David Katz , an internist and associate professor adjunct at Yale School of Public Health .
The kind of self - experimentation that inspired Roberts 's diet " does n't reach the ground floor of evidence " for the general population , he says .
Whatever its limitations , Roberts , now professor emeritus at U.C. Berkeley and working on his second book , says self - experimentation is an easy way to generate new ideas .
He sees nothing unusual in the practice .
He 's recently begun testing whether oils rich in omega - 3 fatty acids ( found in fish and eggs ) improve his reaction time and balance [ see image ] .
" Everybody makes these little tweaks in their life , " he says .
" The simplest , easiest thing will probably have something to teach you . "
You might want to clear it with your doctor first , though .

Could there be a more devastating - and humiliating - domestic drama for a wife and mother to find herself caught up in ?
It began when Julia Richards discovered her husband , Clive , 49 , a religious education teacher , was having an affair with a 16 - year - old former pupil and took an astonishing twist when , three days after Julia had walked out on him , he installed his teenage lover in the family home .
Incredibly , the girl , Jess Anderson , is now acting out the role of " stepmother " to Julia 's 14 - year - old son Benjamin .
Scroll down for more ...
Every day , Jess and her " stepson " Benjamin take the bus to the Penzance school , where Clive was working until last April .
Julia is powerless to remove her son from the house because he has said he wants to stay with his father - a man who , unbelievably , was training to be a vicar until the scandal blew up .
According to social services , Benjamin has " rights " and must have the final say on where he lives , regardless of his distraught mother 's wishes .
" It is absurd , " says Julia .
" Jess is 16 and she 's got her ' rights ' according to social services , who insist she can live with Clive if she wishes .
Benjamin is 14 and he's got his ' rights ' .
I'm Benjamin 's mother and I have n't got any rights , Jess 's mother has n't got any rights to get her home safely .
They are children , for goodness ' sake .
" Benjamin has said to me : ' It 's not right , Mummy , Jess goes to the same school as me . '
But Clive is normalising the situation to Benjamin .
What they are doing may be legal , but it is morally wrong .
I can't believe a schoolgirl is now living in my house with my husband . "
Last weekend , Julia allowed her other son , who is seven , to stay overnight with his father in an attempt at retaining a vestige of normality for the child .
When she picked him up , he said to her : " Mum , you 'll never guess what I saw when I was at Dad 's house .
I saw Dad and Jess naked on the bed . "
" When my son told me , I was so angry it was all I could do not to crash the car , " says Julia , a 38 - year - old teaching assistant who is studying for a degree with the aim of becoming a teacher .
" But I managed to stay calm and just said : ' Really ? , ' and changed the subject .
" I am so worried about Benjamin .
As a parent I need to protect my son , but that right has been taken away from me .
What is going to be the long - term effect on him ?
Clive may insist this ridiculous situation is normal , but I 'm sorry , it 's most definitely not . "
Sadly , Jess Anderson , who is deputy head girl at her school - and it must be said bears a striking resemblance to a younger Julia - has swallowed Clive Richards ' " love has no boundaries " line .
In her mind , they 're just two people in love ; the 33 - year age gap is incidental .
But if that is the case , what will she make of Julia 's revelation that Jess is not the first girl at the school in Penzance , Cornwall , with whom Clive Richards has had a relationship ?
How will she feel to discover that another girl of 16 , also a pupil at the school , became involved with him at the end of 2006 ?
Julia describes lovey - dovey texts between her husband and this other girl , talking about " kisses and cuddles " , clandestine meetings at Tesco and - eventually , under duress - a confession from her husband that the girl had visited the family home to meet him alone on at least one occasion .
" When I found out about Jess , I thought , ' oh no , here we go again ' , " says Julia .
" Looking back , I should have reported him to the school the first time , but I was so fearful of what might happen , that he might even be sent to prison .
It was a terrifying prospect .
" I should have left him then and there , but I was afraid of the emotional impact it would have on our children . "
And so she stayed - only to walk out last month after finding out about Jess .
Today , Julia and her younger son are in limbo , camping out in a room at a friend 's house .
Meanwhile , Jess has the run of Julia 's lovely house in the village of Goldsithney , outside Penzance .
Unsurprisingly , she is appalled that her marriage could have come to this .
Julia was 19 when she met Richards in 1989 .
Both were working for the Beneficial Bank in Birmingham : Julia as a cashier , Richards as a mortgage manager .
The Marlborough - educated son of a vicar had already clocked up two marriages , but his consummate charm displaced any worries Julia may have had .
" Clive was a sophisticated , intelligent man .
He is a very convincing character , which is how he gets away with what he does , " she explains .
They were married in 1990 , and their first son was born in 1993 .
" We were happy enough at first .
I suppose it started going downhill after Benjamin was born .
Clive likes to have lots of attention and he was jealous . "
After completing a part - time degree in education at Warwick University , where he specialised in philosophy and religious education , Richards took up teaching .
It was in September 2005 that he took up his post at the Penzance school , and a year later Julia met Jess Anderson for the first time at the girl 's 15th birthday party on a local beach .
At the time , however , he appears to have had his eye on the other girl .
Just three months later , in December 2006 , Julia found a text on her husband 's phone .
" It was along the lines of : ' I ca n't wait to see you at the usual place for a hug and a kiss , ' " says Julia .
Scroll down for more ...
" I was stunned .
I recognised the girl 's name because she was one of the pupils on his email list - the reason I became suspicious and checked his phone was because he was constantly emailing people .
" I realised I had met this girl at a drama event at the school .
" I knew she was only 16 .
It was hard to take in the enormity of what he was doing and I could not bring myself to confront him immediately .
Perhaps , I was terrified of what I would discover .
" A few days later , he was at the computer with his phone propped up next to him .
I got the impression he was emailing this girl .
" When I checked the message he'd sent back to her , it said something like : ' Ah , my beautiful girl , looking breathless and gorgeous , ' which was just awful .
I knew then that I had to confront him .
" I asked him what on earth he was doing , did he have any idea the trouble he could get into , that this was so wrong ?
But he emphatically denied that anything was going on and made it seem as if it was all in my mind . "
Over the next couple of weeks , Julia discovered more texts .
One mentioned a meeting at Tesco ; in another the girl asked what time Julia was going out , and Richards responded that his wife was leaving the house at 4.15 pm and would be back at 10 pm .
Julia went out as planned , but a couple of days later , she informed her husband that she'd had the house watched and she knew the girl had been there .
It was a lie , but Richards incriminated himself by believing it .
" At first he said how dare I get someone to watch the house , but eventually he admitted that she had come round that night .
He claimed they had n't slept together but had kissed .
I just did n't know what to believe .
" He said how sorry he was for hurting me , he knew it was wrong - wrong in terms of doing this to his wife , mind you , not in having a relationship with one of his pupils .
" I told him that if he ever saw this girl again our marriage was over .
He promised not to , and as far as I 'm aware , that was the end of it between them .
I was appalled at what he had done , but I was terrified of rocking the boat , of opening this can of worms . "
After that , Julia says , their marriage simply " plodded on " , though she was determined to talk to the school 's head teacher about the liaisons .
When she did , after her husband had left her for Jess , she was stunned to discover the school had been aware something inappropriate may have taken place .
" The head said they 'd got wind of a text or something .
She said she had reported it to the authorities , but that no action was taken .
I do n't even know if Clive was questioned . "
Yesterday , a school source said : " The head did hear something , but there was no evidence he'd done anything wrong .
She reminded him he must act professionally at all times . "
And so Clive Richards was free to pursue Jess Anderson .
She was a pupil in his RE class and quickly fell under his spell as Richards subtly flattered her .
In April of last year he took sick leave after his doctor diagnosed depression .
But that did not stop him seeing Jess .
Julia says she cannot be certain of the precise date when Jess 's name started cropping up at home , but believes it was around June or July of last year and possibly even before .
" Clive and Benjamin would go to the beach and our son would say to me : ' We had a nice time , we bumped into Jess . '
But was it accidental ?
" Clive and Jess keep saying now that what has happened is above board because he left the school in April and their relationship did n't start until October , but he did not leave the school , he was off sick .
" He was being paid a full salary until August 31 when his contract came to an end .
The school said it could n't afford to renew it , but I do n't know if that is really the case . "
Julia is highly sceptical about the pair 's claim that their relationship did not begin until October last year .
She points to one suspicious occasion around September 5 or 6 - just over a week before Jess 's 16th birthday , and before it would have been legal for them to have sex .
" Clive , Benjamin , Jess and another friend called Josh were supposed to be going off kayaking for the day .
Later , Benjamin told me that just he and Josh went , and Clive and Jess stayed home and talked .
Am I supposed to believe that is all they did ? "
Around that time , Julia discovered numerous texts between the pair ( she checked his phone after the business with the other girl ) .
One from the teacher to his pupil hinted at tortured passion : " Remember all things are possible in time . "
Another one , Julia suspects , had a far more explicit meaning .
" I got the impression they had pet names for each other 's intimate parts , " says Julia , " and it said something like : ' I can't wait to introduce my one to yours . '
It was disgusting .
" The situation was unbelievable , but every time I confronted Clive about it he denied the existence of any texts .
He was trying to suggest I was mad . "
Relations between Julia and her husband were stretched to breaking point , and in mid-December , at his instigation , they agreed to separate .
Was Clive Richards pushing his wife to the point where she would agree to split - thereby leaving the way clear to pursue Jess .
" It was agreed that we would remain in the same house for the sake of the children , but be separated , " says Julia .
" Things had not been right for a long time between us , and I am the first to say that Jess did not actually break up the marriage , she just hastened its death . "
But Clive was still blindly denying that anything was going on , and the following night Julia insisted he come clean .
" I said it was not right to treat me like a fool and he finally admitted it and said they were in love with each other .
" I was so shocked by his complete absence of any morals .
I said to him : ' I can't stop you , if you want to see her , then fine . '
" People might take that as condoning his actions , but I was n't .
I just felt I had no control over my husband 's appalling behaviour . "
Five days later , Julia was preparing for a day out when she got the sense that her husband might take the opportunity to see Jess .
" I decided to check how many condoms there were in a drawer at home before I went out , and there were eight .
" When I came back there were six .
But worst of all , I found an empty wrapper in the bathroom .
That was when I reached breaking point . "
On January 14 , she packed a small bag and left , taking her younger son with her .
Out of loyalty to his father , Benjamin decided to stay .
It seems Jess moved in sooner than planned because word of their affair had " got out " when Julia informed the head teacher and social services were alerted .
Richards and Jess , who has refused repeated pleas by her own family to return home , are happily ensconced in their love nest .
He is claiming incapacity benefit and now that Julia , who was the wage - earner , has gone , he is claiming housing benefit .
While Julia watched her marriage implode , Jess Anderson 's distraught mother Frances learned that her daughter had moved in with Richards only after Jess sent her a long email explaining that she had fallen in love with her teacher and was legally within her rights to live with him .
Frances told me earlier this week how powerless she feels and how the social services team has done nothing but inform her daughter of her " rights " .
Julia feels similarly impotent .
Her only option to get Benjamin back is to file for a residency order , but that would mean her son having to speak in court , and she is unwilling to put him through that .
She hopes he will find the courage to tell her that he wants to leave .
The other day , Julia went round to the house to pick up some things for her son .
" I thought Jess might have wanted to make herself scarce but she was there , in my kitchen , calmly doing the washing - up .
" I could have picked up a frying pan and bashed her over the head , but what would be the point , so I kept my composure .
She kept her back to me and no words were exchanged .
" Jess is a nice girl , I 'm not going to condemn her .
But she 's obviously got no common sense and is completely deluded .
I hope she has a lot of luck because she is going to need it . "
Words that Jess will probably dismiss as those of a bitter wife .
One day , though - and perhaps sooner rather than later - she will almost certainly realise that her lover 's wife , and her own family , were absolutely right .
DETROIT ( Reuters ) - Henry Ford , who created the automotive industry ’s first mass - market hit with the Model T a century ago , was a proponent of radical simplicity .

In fact , Ford became famous for saying his customers could have the $ 825 Model T in any color -- so long as it was black .
In the century since the first Model T in 1908 , Ford ’s vision of top - down efficiency has been swamped by thousands of feature and color combinations on new cars , trucks and SUVs .
The result , executives say , has been higher production and inventory costs and headaches for customers and dealers in sorting through a complex matrix of choices .
Now , Ford Motor
Co and other embattled U.S. automakers are going back to black , embracing the spirit of Ford ’s notion in response to mounting losses and the risk of a deeper downturn in the United States , the world ’s largest market for new cars , in 2008 .
Ford Chief Executive Alan Mulally said he was amazed by the number of variations Ford offered when he arrived at the No. 2 U.S. automaker from Boeing Co in 2006 .
“ I was looking at the ( Lincoln ) Navigator console , ” Mulally said .
“ We have 128 different options you could choose on the console .
That ’s just the console . ”
With so many variations , a customer inevitably will want a vehicle that is not in stock , leading to a frustrated customer and pressure on the dealer to offer a discount , Mulally said .
“ They ’re unhappy and we ’re losing money , ” he said of Ford , which posted losses of $ 2.7 billion in 2007 and $ 12.6 billion in 2006 .
Ford ’s chief of marketing , Jim Farley , who was hired away from Toyota Motor Co last year , said he was stunned to find that Ford was offering 100,000 combinations of options on its entry - level Focus sedan .
Some 80 percent of Ford ’s sales came from just 4,000 of those combinations , he said .
In response , Ford has cut complexity by reducing the number of “ buildable combinations ” of the 2008 Focus by 99 percent .
On the 2008 Expedition , it has cut combinations by 95 percent .

“ Coming from Toyota , I can tell you that the opportunity is there to reduce the complexity of our line - up , ” Farley told analysts recently .
It ’s a similar story at Chrysler LLC , where sales chief Jim Press -- another high - level defection from Toyota -- has also pushed the struggling automaker to simplify .
“ Previously , we offered too many options , ” Chrysler Chief Executive Bob Nardelli told reporters .
“ That resulted in too much complexity in the plants that build them , too much confusion for the dealers who order them and no added value to the customers who buy them . ”
Nardelli said Chrysler had cut ordering complexity by 93 percent over the past two years by dropping some options and repackaging others .
Chrysler , which lost $ 1.6 billion last year , plans to go further , cutting models and trimming dealers .
That represents a stepped - up restructuring under Cerberus Capital Management LP , which bought an 80 percent stake in the automaker in 2007 .
LESS IS MORE
General Motors
Corp is also paring variations to cut costs and expects to have the vast majority of vehicles on shared global platforms within two years , said Jon Lauckner , GM ’s vice president of global program management .
“ It has tremendous advantages , ” he said .
“ Obviously we ’re going to leverage one of our strengths , which is our scale . ”
GM , the largest U.S. carmaker , increasingly markets vehicles made on common platforms under different names in markets around the world with only minor changes , a process that saves money that can be rolled into product development .
The first GM vehicle with the global architecture -- the Opel Vectra -- will debut at the London auto show and will be on the road in the fall .
The next GM vehicles to be built with the global structure will be small cars from the automaker ’s Korean affiliate Daewoo , Lauckner said .
Japanese automakers are widely seen as leading the way in cutting costs by sharing unseen parts across vehicle lines and reducing complexity .
But Al Castignetti , Nissan Motor Co ’s division manager for North America , said Nissan also sees more room to simplify in the U.S. markets .
Nissan dealers , he said , have said they feel weighed down by having to deal with 250,000 ordering combinations in some cases .
“ We ’ve gotten rid of a decent amount of complexity , but we still have a way to go , ” Castignetti said in an interview .
Nissan ’s Altima and Maxima models were two of the biggest offenders and have gone through major reductions of options such as trim and color and even the platforms , he said .
About 70 percent of Nissan sales in a given car model are sold in the same way because buyers tend to choose the most common options , Castignetti said .
John Tulloch , vice president of client services for marketing agency George P. Johnson , said automakers could sell the “ less is more ” concept to car buyers if the savings are used to improve remaining models and reduce sticker prices .
“ Customers could get a better price beyond incentives or could get better packages , such as a satellite radio or higher end safety features , ” Tulloch said .
" Why is it girls have to always be polite and say yes , when boys can just say no and walk away ? "
My 10 - year old daughter said these chilling words to me after describing how she had been stuck doing a task at school when she really wanted to do something else .
I cringed inside , because I knew just what she meant .
Girls are indeed brought up to be nicer than boys , and I know from a lifetime of experience that being a push - over does n't serve women well .
And I cringed even more deeply because I had just read Lars Kallings ' devastating critique of the HIV / AIDS pandemic in the March issue of The Journal of Internal Medicine , in which he blames the powerlessness of girls and women to say " no " to unwanted or unprotected sex as a major factor keeping HIV alive .
We 'd like to believe that infectious diseases are biological and that we contract them because of bad luck .
Got the flu ?
Poor you must have touched a germ - covered door knob .
Or because we happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time , such as working close to sick birds .
But as infection and mortality rates show , human behavior molded by culture is the real culprit in the spread of HIV .
It starts with our evolutionarily determined drive to reproduce , which , Kallings points out , " dominates over altruistic behavior . "
Since HIV is transmitted primarily through sexual activity , and we'd rather have sex than think about the consequences , right off the bat all humans are at risk .
Culture is also supposed to mitigate our basic animal instincts , and yet the cultural lens has only helped HIV take hold .
And this is especially true for women and girls .
The females of our species are at great risk for HIV because they know nothing ; millions of girls live in cultures where education is reserved for boys , and girls are kept in the dark about everything , especially sex .
In Bolivia , Kallings writes , 74 percent of young women know nothing about HIV / AIDS or they are seriously unclear about the virus .
Apparently , across Asia , most women do n’t even know how babies are born .
Women are also repressed by cultural traditions , historical or religious , which render them powerless and subjugated to men .
A husband in those cultures can have sex with others , bring HIV back home , and there 's no way a woman can refuse his wishes or ask that he use a condom .
That 's why across the world , almost half the victims of HIV are women ; those who still think of HIV / AIDS as a homosexual disease are not only uninformed , they are ignoring the global plight of women as well .
And when those women become pregnant , the HIV virus can be transmitted vertically to their infants .
Thirty - two percent of the pregnant women in Botswana and 26 percent of the pregnant women in South Africa are reported to be HIV - positive .
If their infants live , they could eventually join the legion of orphans that now populate HIV - infected countries .
They become citizens with no parents , no families and no culture that anyone would recognize .
Culture , in the case of HIV / AIDS , is harming , not helping .
And the Western belief that science will put an end to this pandemic , and that girls and women in our culture are free to say " no " whenever they want , is just as culturally wrong .
Like other cultures , we also need to teach our daughters that it 's OK to say " no , " freely and often , because saying " no " is the best way for a woman to survive in any culture .

The Global Impact of AIDS

BBC News , New York
Hill can now revisit old stomping grounds without fear of retribution
Henry Hill 's story GoodFellas was the definitive mafia film - and it is the story of one man , Henry Hill , one of the only survivors of a ruthless gang of robbers and killers .
Hill walked the streets of New York as a king - an associate of the Lucchese crime family .
He stole big , he spent big and took vast quantities of drugs .
Then he got caught and spent 30 years in the witness protection programme , telling the police all they needed to know to put his mafia bosses behind bars .
" I could n't walk around this neighbourhood ten years ago , " he says standing , smoking outside Junior 's diner in Long Island City .
" There 'd be bullets flying all over the place . "
His morning started with fried calamari washed down with a glass of wine and a shot of whiskey .
But it was not the Dutch courage that meant he dared to visit his old haunting grounds on this murky spring day .
" I 'm old enough to die , just as long as they do it quickly , " he says , pointing to his forehead .
If you can't love two people at once , there 's something wrong with you
Hill is a very different looking man from the one shown on the big screen .
He is short , grey - haired , with lines on his face .
A cigarette barely leaves his hand .
The same goes for a bottle of beer .
After Junior 's , it was on to his mistress 's house .
She was called Janice Rossi in the film , Linda in real life , and Hill confirms the famous scene where his wife , Karen , is madly pressing apartment buzzers and screaming that Janice is a " whore " .
But he says in reality he was in the apartment too and had to climb down the drainpipe to get out and reach home before Karen returned .
Hill says : " If you can't love two people at once , there 's something wrong with you . "
Hill has no idea how many millions of dollars he stole or spent I point out that his wife probably did not see it that way .
" Obviously she didn't , " says Hill .
After a short interlude where he tries to persuade a traffic warden not to give us a ticket - " Sistergirl , please , " he says - we are off to Robert 's Lounge .
The club was owned by Jimmy Burke ( Robert de Niro 's character in the film ) and was the scene of Spider 's ( played by Michael Imperioli ) death .
" Spider was killed in the basement , " Hill says .
He describes the dark room filling up with smoke and the deafening echo of bullets in the tiny space .
He says Spider was buried in the basement along with several others killed there or nearby over the years .
With a grim look he says : " This is a graveyard . " ' Bust some heads '
GoodFellas contained several scenes of visceral , shocking violence and it was not an exaggeration .
Joe Coffey became a policeman because the mafia shot his dad .
It happened when he was eight and they did it right in front of him .
" GoodFellas is probably the best mafia movie as far as showing them for what they really are , " he says today .
" The Godfather , Casino , they show them as sort of folk heroes .
GoodFellas pins them down to exactly what they are - street thugs . "
We stole anything we could sell
Hill says he never killed anyone although he did '' bust some heads " , and he admits he does not know whether his victims lived or died .
He smiles as he talks of how much he stole , though .
" We stole anything we could sell , " he says , as we pass a Bulova watch factory .
He claims they used to stake out the trucks as they brought shipments in and then hold up and pay off the drivers .
The watches could then be sold on the black market .
His most famous crime was the Lufthansa robbery of 1978 when a reported $ 5 m ( £ 2.5 m ) was taken from a vault at New York 's John F Kennedy International Airport .
Pasta sauce
Hill says the police told him more than $ 100 m ( £ 50 m ) had gone through his hands , although he himself has no idea how much he stole and spent .
He knows where it went though : " Slow horses , drugs and rock and roll . "
Now he makes his money selling his story .
He is promoting a new Sky Movies mafia season , and has written several books ( including a cookbook - real spaghetti and marinara sauce , not egg noodles and ketchup ) .
He adds that he made half a million dollars advising on GoodFellas .
I ask him how he thought the victims of his crimes would feel knowing about that .
He takes a drag of his cigarette and replies : " Do you know something ?
I do n't give a heck what those people think , I 'm doing the right thing now . "
Henry Hill was speaking to Heather Alexander for BBC News 24's E24 programme .

What are these ?
The Bush administration has maintained a low profile over the last month , as waves of indignation over the destruction of CIA videotapes showing the torture of two " high value " detainees have lapped ever closer to the White House .
In the last few weeks , as coverage of the presidential primaries has consumed the media , both President Bush and Vice President Cheney must also have been hoping that they would be able to escape scrutiny on this bleak anniversary .
It is , however , imperative that they are not allowed to do so .
Despite its claims that it " does not torture , " this is an administration drenched in torture , which must one day be made answerable for its crimes .
Six years ago , on January 11 , 2002 , the first of 778 prisoners  referred to as " detainees , " and identified only by numbers  arrived at a hastily erected prison in the US naval base at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , where , ever since , they have been subjected to a disturbingly lawless experiment .
Under the terms of a military order initiated in November 2001 , the President claimed that he could hold the detainees indefinitely , without charge or trial , as " enemy combatants . "
Guantánamo , leased from Cuba in 1903 under an arrangement that cannot be broken unless both countries agree to it , was specifically chosen for this experiment because it was presumed to be beyond the reach of the US courts .
For two and a half years , the administration succeeded in its aims , running an illegal offshore interrogation center , which mutated into a torture prison when the detainees proved resistant to interrogation .
The " enhanced interrogation techniques " introduced by the administration included prolonged solitary confinement , forced nudity , sexual and religious humiliation , sleep deprivation , the use of extreme heat and cold , and the use of painful stress positions .
Despite condemnation by world leaders , international legal experts , global bodies including the United Nations and an unprecedented array of former US military commanders , the administration defined torture so narrowly  as being equivalent to organ failure or death  that it refused to concede that it was actually engaged in torture .
The irony , which only became apparent later , was that the reason that so many of the detainees were not forthcoming in their interrogations was not because they were al - Qaeda terrorists who were trained to resist interrogation , but because they had no information to give .
When the governments own documents were analyzed , in reports by the Seton Hall Law School , and in my book The Guantánamo Files : The Stories of the 774 Detainees in America ’s Illegal Prison , it became apparent that the majority of the detainees had not been captured by US forces on the battlefield , as alleged , but had been sold to them by their Afghan and Pakistani allies , at a time when bounty payments of $ 5000 a head for al - Qaeda and Taliban suspects were widespread .
In June 2004 , the US courts finally caught up with Guantánamo .
In a momentous ruling , the Supreme Court insisted that Guantánamo was " in every practical respect a United States territory , " and that the detainees had habeas corpus rights  the right to challenge the basis of their detention before an impartial court .
Undeterred , the administration allowed lawyers access to the detainees , but refused to allow them anywhere near the US courts , establishing , instead , a system of military tribunals  the Combatant Status Review Tribunals  as a mockery of their habeas rights .
In these tribunals , the detainees were allowed to tell their own stories , in response to the governments allegations against them , but were not allowed legal representation .
Moreover , the tribunals were empowered to accept secret evidence , obtained through the torture , coercion or bribery of other detainees , which was not revealed to the defendants , and could not even be challenged .
In some ways , of course , there is more to celebrate today than there was on Guantánamos fifth anniversary .
In the last year , a number of whistleblowers  former military officials who worked on the tribunals  have bravely stepped forward to condemn the tribunal process .
Lt. Col. Stephen Abraham , who spoke out in June , described them as a sham , reliant upon vague , unsubstantiated and generic evidence , and designed merely to approve the detainees  prior designation as " enemy combatants . "
In October an Army Major , speaking anonymously , added his complaints , revealing the deliberate exclusion of exculpatory evidence , the reconvening of tribunals when an unfavorable result was produced , and the pressure exerted on tribunal members from higher up the command structure .
Plans to scale down the prison population also continued throughout 2007 .
492 detainees have now been released  122 in the last year alone  and the majority of those have been freed on their return home , but the gross injustices of Guantánamo have not come to an end .
Two detainees died at the prison last year ( to add to the four who died in 2006 ) , and five more detainees were transferred into the facility , even while the President was claiming in public that he wanted to close the prison .
For the 281 detainees who remain , moreover , life remains as hard as ever .
Although a few are housed in Camp 4 , which contains communal dorms , the majority are held in solitary confinement for up to 23 hours a day in the newest camps , Camps 5 and 6 , and are deprived of the meager comforts  including access to TV , and some sort of a social life  that are routinely enjoyed by the majority of convicted criminals on the US mainland .
Others continue to be held in complete isolation , an unknown number are suffering from severe psychiatric disorders , and for the few dozen long - term hunger strikers the prison remains a torture center .
Prevented from exercising the only power they still hold  the right to starve themselves to death in protest at their endless detention without charge or trial  twice a day they are held in restraint chairs , using 18 separate straps , and are fed through a thick tube inserted into the stomach through the nose , which is removed after each feeding in a deliberate attempt to " break " their will .
To compound the detainees  misery , it s unclear how some of them will ever be freed .
Up to 70 have been cleared for release  some for more than two years  but the majority are still held because of international treaties preventing their return to their homelands  including China , Uzbekistan , Tunisia , Libya and Algeria  where they face the risk of torture .
Attempts by the authorities to bypass these treaties through " memoranda of understanding , " guaranteeing the humane treatment of returned detainees , recently came unstuck after two returned Tunisians received jail sentences following dubious trials , and the decision by a District Court judge to prevent the return of a third Tunisian seems to have put the whole errant project on hold .
Another 80 are scheduled to face trial by Military Commission , a system of show trials concocted by Dick Cheney and his advisors in November 2001 , but as these , like the tribunals , rely on secret evidence obtained through the torture , coercion or bribery of other detainees , and have yet to produce a single significant victory , it remains unclear if they will ever function adequately .
As the uproar over the destroyed CIA tapes has demonstrated , the administration is desperate to conceal all evidence of torture by US forces , because it remains illegal under domestic and international law , and it seems inconceivable that military trials which conceal evidence of torture can ever be regarded as legitimate .
An alternative solution is to free the other 130 or so detainees who are currently regarded as too dangerous to release , but not dangerous enough to be charged ( which is , of course , another extraordinary invention on the part of the authorities ) and to bring those regarded as genuinely dangerous  no more than 40 , according to various intelligence estimates  to trial on the US mainland .
This proposal is almost taboo in the United States , but it may yet come to pass .
It relies on the hope that pliable juries can be persuaded to overlook the torture of " high value " detainees , including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , who confessed in a tribunal last year that he was the architect of 9/11 , and Abu Zubaydah and Abdul Rahim al - Nashiri , two other allegedly senior al - Qaeda operatives , whose destroyed interrogation tapes are the reason that would - be investigators are currently circling the White House .
This is a gloomy scenario , and it still doesnt explain what will happen to the cleared detainees who cannot be repatriated , or how to begin dismantling the completely unaccountable web of secret and semi-secret prisons  in Afghanistan , Iraq and elsewhere  that underpins Guantánamo .
It is , however , honest and considered , which is more than can be said for the motivations of those who dreamt up the whole malign experiment in the first place .
A write - up of the Commercial Users of Functional Programming meeting held this October is available , for those of us who did n't attend .
The write - up is well written and thought provoking ( it was written by Jeremy Gibbons , so that 's not a surprise ) .
The goal of the Commercial Users of Functional Programming series of workshops is to build a community for users of functional programming languages and technology .
This , the fourth workshop in the series , drew 104 registered participants ( and apparently more than a handful of casual observers ) .
It is often observed that functional programming is most widely used for language related projects ( DSLs , static analysis tools and the like ) .
Part of the reason is surely cultural .
People working on projects of this type are more familiar with functional programming than people working in other domains .
But it seems that it may be worthwhile to discuss the other reasons that make functional languages suitable for this type of work .
There are plenty of reasons , many of them previously discussed here ( e.g. , Scheme 's uniform syntax , hygiene , DSELs ) , but perhaps the issue is worth revisiting , seeing as this remains the killer application for functional programming , even taking into account the other types of project described in the workshop .
I am normally not one for historical fiction , but a couple of years ago I read The Other Boleyn Girl by Philippa Gregory and thoroughly enjoyed it .
So much , in fact , that I immediately went and bought the rest of the series .
Now the movie version with Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman is coming out and I 'm going to have to check that out to see if it measures up to the book .
The whole thing really roused my interest in the Tudors ( The Tudors the TV series is currently in my Netflix queue ) and I spent an embarrassingly large amount of time on Wikipedia reading about them .
Prior to the books , all I really knew about Henry VIII is that he got married to the widow next door and she 'd been married seven times before ( I kid , I kid ) .
In honor of the recent anniversary of his death ( January 28 , 1547 ) , I give you eight random facts about Henry VIII .
1. Henry was never supposed to be King .
It was always intended that Henry 's older brother Arthur would take over from their father as the King of England .
While Henry was merely the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and the Earl Marshal of England , Arthur held the Prince of Wales title .
Arthur died rather unexpectedly at the age of 15 , not long after getting married to Catherine of Aragon from Spain .
Thus began Henry 's rein " “ he pretty much just stepped in and picked up where Arthur left off , including Catherine .
Prior to his brother 's death , it was assumed that Henry would have a prosperous career with the Church .
Pretty funny , considering how cavalierly he played with the Church 's rules to suit his marriages and divorces later in life .
2 . He apparently compared his fourth wife to a horse .
Fast forward through Henry 's annulment with Catherine , the beheading of Anne Boleyn , and the death of Jane Seymour and we have wife # 4 , Anne of Cleves .
His motives for marrying her were purely political " “ she was the sister of the Duke of Cleves , who was Protestant .
The Duke was an important friend to have in case the Roman Catholics decided to invade England , and so the marriage was arranged .
The problem ?
The picture that Henry based a large part of his decision on was apparently more than a little flattering .
When he met her in person just prior to their marriage , he apparently compared her to a horse .
They got married anyway , and by all accounts it was pretty miserable .
The marriage was annulled and she received the title of " The King 's Sister , " which totally baffles me .
If anyone can explain this to me , please do .
3 . He had an affair with Anne Boleyn 's sister .
One of the plots in The Other Boleyn Girl is about Henry having an affair with Anne Boleyn 's sister , Mary .
This really happened when Mary served as Catherine of Aragon 's lady - in - waiting for ten years .
Her first two children are rumored to be Henry's , but this was never proven .
After her first husband died , Mary wed a commoner with no social status and was thus disowned by Anne .
She is the ancestor of Winston Churchill , Princess Diana and Sarah , Duchess of York ( among others ) .
4 . He was a sickly fellow .
Henry 's health problems were vast .
Although he was athletic in his youth , a jousting mishap left him unable to exercise .
As a result , his waistline climbed to 54 inches .
He had severe migraines and suffered from terrible insomnia .
It 's speculated that he also suffered from gout , and eventually the jousting wound in his thigh became ulcerated ( which may have actually helped to cause his death ) .
Modern doctors suggest that Henry probably had type II diabetes .
5 . Supposedly his last words were " Monks , monks , monks ! "
This is also the name of a Houston - area law firm ( well , almost : Monks , Monks , Monks & Hiran ) .
6 . He was buried with his third wife .
Henry was buried at St. George 's Chapel at Windsor Castle with third wife Jane Seymour .
He considered her his only " true " wife , since she was the only one of the six to bear him a son .
7 . He could be haunting Hampton Court Palace .
In October 2003 , security at the Palace checked their surveillance tapes to see why one of the fire doors kept opening .
As they watched , a strange figure appeared in the doorway and closed the doors .
The figure appears to be wearing period dress .
If Hampton Court is haunted , it 's with good reason : Jane Seymour died there after giving birth and fifth wife Catherine Howard was arrested there in 1542 for cheating on King Henry ( which was treason at the time ) .
When she found out she was being arrested , she fled down the long Gallery screaming for the King to save her .
8 . He left his mark .
Despite his many marriages and his rage issues , Henry left quite a legacy .
He , Alfred the Great and Charles II are traditionally referred to as the founders of the Royal Navy .
He invested quite heavily in shipmaking , including the Mary Rose , which he named after his sister ( although some speculate he was trying to impress Mary Boleyn ) .
By the way , one of the ways to keep track of Henry 's six wives and how they came to be separated from him is to use this little rhyme : Divorced , beheaded , died ; divorced , beheaded , survived ( even though they were technically annulments and not divorces ) .
What do you guys think ?
Fabulous leader or horrible tyrant ?
Both ?

DAR ES SALAAM , Tanzania  President Bush has been smothered with affection here , never more so than on Sunday , when he sat at a wooden desk under a sweltering sun with President Jakaya Kikwete by his side and signed a $ 698 million grant of foreign aid to Tanzania .
But while people here in the capital city of this East African nation are excited about Mr. Bush , another American politician seems to excite them even more  Senator Barack Obama .
Mr. Bush is on a six - day , five - country tour to spotlight American efforts to fight poverty and disease in Africa .
Though the president ’s face is on billboards all over town , the name Obama is on the lips of Tanzanians  from taxi drivers to city merchants to the artisans who sell wooden Masai warriors in makeshift stalls at a dusty open - air market on the outskirts of town .
Halfway around the world , Mr. Bush can not escape the race to succeed him .
“ It seemed like there was a lot of excitement for me  wait a minute , maybe you missed it ! ” he said , only half in jest , on Sunday , after Mr. Kikwete was asked about Mr. Obama during their joint news conference here .

Ed Gein ’s name has grown in legend .
It was the story that “ shocked the nation . ”
Gein was , and remains , the inspiration for countless books and films , including Robert Bloch ’s PSYCHO and Tobe Hooper ’s TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE , but these stories are nothing in comparison to the truth about “ The Plainfield Butcher . ” Ed Gein was the second son of Augusta and George Gein .
He was born on August 27 , 1906 , near La Crosse , Wisconsin where he attended school with his brother , Henry .
Ed insisted , “ My mother is a saint , ” though every psychologist that interviewed Ed would state that Augusta was actually dominating , inflexible , and abusive .
When Ed was eight years old , his family moved to a 195 - acre farm just outside of Plainfield , Wisconsin .
Ed quit school after the eighth grade to help his family run the farm .
In his spare time , he ’d perform odd jobs for other townspeople , who described Ed as being “ likable , though a little quirky . ”
On April Fool ’s Day , 1940 , Ed ’s father died .
Ed was 34 , still a virgin , and strangely attached to his mother .
That attachment , of course , grew steadfast after George ’s death and caused quite a bit of tension between the brothers .
Henry thought the relationship between Ed and his mother was “ unwholesome . ”
Three years later , Henry met a mysterious death .
On May 16 , 1944 , the brothers started a fire to clear some marsh land on their property , but the fire blazed out of control .
They separated in order to contain the combustion but , afterwards , Henry failed to return to the house .
Ed asked some men to help search for his brother but they were unsuccessful .
However , later that day , Ed was able to lead a second search party ( headed by Sheriff Engle ) directly to where Henry ’s body lay .
Ed ’s only explanation was , “ Funny how that works . ”
Henry ’s body was blackened with soot , but unburned .
Although the sheriff noticed bruising around Henry ’s head , the coroner declared asphyxiation as the cause of death and no further investigation was pursued .
Ed and Augusta managed the farm until December 29 , 1945 , when Augusta died from complications of a series of strokes .
Ed blamed her death on the degeneracy of the citizens of Plainfield , whom Augusta constantly complained about .
Ed Gein , at the age of 40 , was alone for the first time in his life .
After sealing off his mother ’s room from the rest of the house , Ed began his plunge into madness .
The people of Plainfield described Ed as “ helpful ” and “ reliable ” , but “ not overly sociable . ”
He would , on occasion , ask Mary Hogan or Bernice Worden to go to a movie ( both reminded Ed of his mother ) .
Between 1946 and 1958 , the areas surrounding Plainfield experienced a series of unexplained disappearances .
Eight year old Georgia Weckler disappeared after a babysitter dropped her off in the driveway of her home .
Victor Travis , his dog , and a friend never returned from a deerhunting excursion .
Fifteen year old Evelyn Hartly was abducted from a house where she was babysitting .
None of these bodies , nor others whom had disappeared , were ever found .
The beginning of the end for Ed was the disappearance of Mary Hogan .
On December 8 , 1954 , a local farmer discovered her missing when he walked into the tavern she operated and the place was empty , except for a pool of blood and a spent .32 shell on the floor .
A neighbor of Ed ’s had mentioned to him that , “ if you ’d spent more time courting Mary Hogan , she ’d be cooking for you instead of being missing . ”
Ed smiled and said , “ She ’s not missing .
She ’s down at the house now . ”
Between 1954 and 1957 , the rumors regarding Ed Gein grew more and more peculiar and mysterious , but most of the community dismissed them as being part of “ Eddie ’s odd sense of humor . ”
On November 16 , 1957 , Bernice Worden opened her hardware store early .
Bernice ’s first customer was Ed Gein .
She sold him some anti-freeze , wrote up his receipt , and watched him leave , forgetting his receipt on the counter .
Bernice contemplated going out after him to present him with the receipt , but after a moment Ed returned .
He asked Bernice if he could look at the Marlin .22 rifle .
He had some shells in his pocket and wanted to see if the rifle could accommodate both the short and long . 22 shell .
Later that afternoon , Bernice ’s son arrived at the store to find the lights on , but the doors locked .
When entering , he noticed that the cash register was missing and there was a pool of blood on the floor .
On the counter still laid the receipt for the sale of anti-freeze to Ed Gein .
That evening , Ed Gein was taken into custody .
When he was questioned about his activities for the day , Gein abruptly stated , “ Somebody framed me for Mrs. Worden , ” even though there had been no mention of the crime .
Several officials went to Gein ’s farmhouse to look for evidence .
What they found was a house of horrors .
Suspended upside down from the ceiling was the body of Bernice Worden .
She hung naked , slit from her pubic mound to her collarbone , disemboweled and decapitated .
The body cavity had been cleaned and washed in the manner of a dressed deer .
On the kitchen table was the top half of a skull Ed had been using as a soup bowl .
The kitchen chairs had been reupholstered with strips of human flesh .
Bits of dried fat hung from the underside of the strips where Ed had not cleaned the pieces carefully .
In the room used as a bedroom they found two skulls impaled on his bedposts .
A lampshade and wastebasket made of human skin were next to the nightstand , as well as a belt that was made of several females ’ nipples , dried and sewn together .
They found a knife with a handle made of human bone and several more skull caps .
There was a shoebox filled with vulvas with strings attached to each side , a collection of human noses in another container , and sets of lips in another .
The flesh from four faces were stuffed with paper and hung on the wall .
Five other faces were found , carefully peeled from the skulls and preserved , with strings attached to the sides so they could be worn as masks .
Some had lipstick applied to the lips .
The evidence seemed to be endless .
They discovered several pairs of leggings made from human skin and a complete female upper torso ( also made to be worn ) that was later identified as that of Mary Hogan .
There were more human bones , assorted breasts , lips , and noses from an inestimable number of bodies .
Bernice Worden ’s head was found in a burlap sack with two long nails protruding from her ears .
Twine had been tied to the nails so the head could be hung on the wall .
There was so much , in fact , that it took two officials thirty trips with a truck to transport all the evidence to a crime lab .
In questioning , Gein admitted to taking Bernice Worden ’s body and butchering it but claimed he did n’t remember anything about her death .
Later , Gein admitted loading the rifle but that it discharged accidentally .
He was repeatedly questioned and , eventually , admitted to an assortment of perversions , but only two murders .
Ed ’s sanity hearing was held in January , 1958 .
He was found unfit to stand trial and was committed to the Central State Hospital .
Gein showed little conscious and no remorse for the mutilations and murders he had committed .
Ed admitted that many of the body parts he had preserved were meant to be worn .
He would undress and strap on the breasts and leggings , tie a vagina over his penis , and put on a face mask to dance by the moonlight in his yard .
He denied having intercourse with any of the corpses stating , “ they smelled too bad . ”
He , also , denied eating any of the body parts , but admitted that he had studied cannibalism and seemed very knowledgeable on the subject .
After ten years of confinement Gein seemed fit to stand trial .
The trial began on November 7 , 1968 .
Gein was only charged for the murder of Bernice Worden but was found not guilty by reason of insanity .
He was immediately returned to Central State Hospital with a chance for release in 1974 .
In 1974 , Ed Gein ’s request for release was denied and in July , 1984 , at the age of 72 , he died of respiratory failure and was buried next to his mother in Plainfield Cemetery .
It seemed that most of Ed ’s antics were caused by his desire to recreate his mother ; to physically enter and become her .
Alfred Hitchcock ’s PSYCHO clearly pushes this theme in it ’s loosely based version of Gein .
Many other films have featured Gein - like characters and settings , especially TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE , but probably the most accurate film account is the 70’s era classic DERANGED , starring Robert Blossoms .
Gein is , truly , a fascinating character in our country ’s crime history .
We may never understand what was going on in his twisted mind .
Many interesting accounts and examinations have been written about Ed Gein , but I recommend reading DEVIANT , by Harold Schechter ( from Pocket Books ) , and EDWARD GEIN , by Judge Robert H. Gollmar ( from Pinnacle Books ) .
Both books provide a wealth of detailed information on “ America ’s Most Bizarre Murderer . ”
It is a shame Earthlings are still dealing with money issues .
We were surprised when we landed on your beautiful planet that you still use money .
Before we traveled
If you are worried about losing your job or have lost your job , it is essential you take time now to plan your recession survival .
The first thing to do is read our UFO Recession Tip # 10 .
It gives explicit instructions on how to secure your job .
If you have been given the pink slip , then read the information below very carefully .
Earthlings , your recession survival starts here .
Read our UFO recession tips daily , and tell others .
E-mail the Top 10 Recession
Tips to everyone you know to get them started ( click here ) .
As aliens , we come from a very intelligent planet and have survived multiple recessions ( please do not ask our ages ) .
Our alien race finally realized there is no need for the concept of money .
Earthlings , Caller ID is your best friend to surviving a recession .
Face it , most likely your bills are starting to stack up if you are reading our UFO recession advice .
here , we intercepted TV signals from your television series , Star Trek , and we thought your human race was more advanced .
The television program never showed humans with money .
Our planet turned away from money when we realized the following :
Money leads to buying products ...
which leads to purchasing on credit ...
which leads to buying beyond your means ...
which means being placed into collections ...
which leads to Guido , the bill collector , calling at all hours ...
which leads to a lot of unnecessary mental stress .
We have been there , Earthlings .
As a result , we developed products similar to your caller ID on our planet .
Then our intelligent elders banned the concept of money , and our planet became one happy utopia .
Since Planet Earth is not utopia .
You have to deal with money and bill collectors , then you must make sure you do not allow bill collector 's phone calls to over stress you .
Buy a caller ID .
If you already have a caller ID for all your phones , you are ahead of the game .
Do NOT answer the phone if you see the following numbers on your caller ID :
1. 800 Numbers .
Bill Collectors use these numbers because they are dialing out of ' hot boiler ' type rooms collecting money .
2. Unknown .
Most likely it ’s a bill collector trying to catch you off guard .
3. Private .
This type of numbers should stay private .
Please do not answer .
It is likely a bill collector .
If not , the ' private ' person can leave you a voice mail .
4. Out of State Numbers .
If you do not recognize the area code , do not answer it .
5. Beeps during calls .
If you do not recognize the number , for whatever reason , while you are talking on the phone , do not answer it .
You might just be unlucky enough to get Guido , the bill collector on the line .
He is trying to butt into your pleasant friend or family call , in order to ruin your day .
6. NEW !
Couple Names : if you see an innocuous " couple name " on your caller ID , do not answer the phone .
This is a new trick used by collectors .
They use pleasant sounding , ordinary names to trick you into answering , such as " Tom and Jennifer " or " James and Cathy " .
No real numbers have two first names on their caller ID .
Call your creditors .
The best thing to do in order to survive the recession is to call the people you owe , such as credit card companies , and work on getting your monthly payments reduced until you are back on your feet .
Sometimes you can skip a payment or two .
Creditors are more likely to work with people during recession .
But some simply desire to give you a hard time .
If your creditor will not work with you , then think survival .
Pay your creditors something each month to show that you are still trying to pay them .
If you are heavily into debt , then you will have to choose your next steps carefully .
It ’s a catch - 22 .
If you cannot pay your bills on time , your credit is going to go down , depending on the bill .
Credit card companies are going to come after your Earthling ass , and you are going to have to negotiate with them on how to pay , or you will have to seek credit card counseling .
Do not go to a credit repair service .
Just check with the Better Business Bureau and read the list of nightmares on those .
No matter how you slice it or dice it , you are in deep crap if your expenses exceed your revenues .
Focus on survival .
Paying your utilities and feeding your family are you first priorities , no matter how tough Guido or your creditors act .
Please read all our recession survival tips to help you reduce your costs .
If you do happen to get on the phone with Guido , the bill collector , please do not let them harass you .
We have seen evil bill collectors threaten to send people to jail for not paying the bill .
Creditors CANNOT put you in jail for debt in the U.S .
Remember , Guido lies .
And credit card companies will say anything to get you to send them money .
Guido only gets paid when he collects , and he's in this recession too .
Guido cannot harass you or call you at your place of employment , by law .
Tell credit collectors to stop harassing you or you will report them .
Ask them to contact you only by mail .
If they are abusive , simply hang up .
Then use your caller ID .
The worst thing that can happen is that credit card companies can get a judgment against you and garnish your wages to pay back a debt .

An over - the - counter DNA paternity test now offers unknowing families peace of mind – in every state but New York .
Identigene , a Salt Lake City - based genetics company , released an at - home paternity test this month , giving mothers and their offspring a speedy answer to a difficult question .
Unsure mothers swab the inside of their child ’s mouth – and the mouth of the suspected father – then send the swabs to Salt Lake City for testing .
Three to five days later , customers can log on to a secure Web site to view the results .
Identigene discards the DNA after six months , but keeps the results on file for five years .
But in New York , state law says DNA testing has to be court - ordered or prescribed by a doctor .
Identigene executive Doug Fogg says he ’s working with New York ’s Department of Health to get around the DNA - testing law , and hopes to have kits available on Big Apple shelves later this year .
The problem , he said , is New York considers DNA testing diagnostic , as opposed to a pregnancy test , which the state treats more like a thermometer .
“ [ Identigene ] introduces a very convenient and affordable option for individuals looking to establish the paternity of a child , ” Fogg said .
“ In fact , we ’re finding that many people purchased the kit for someone they know that needs the test , ” he said , noting that those types of purchases make up about 30 percent of their sales .
The DNA paternity test sells at Rite Aid stores across the country for $ 29.99 , plus $ 119.99 for lab - processing fees .
Running similar tests on other suspected dads costs extra .
The collection kit includes cotton swabs , containers for the samples and envelopes addressed to the lab .
Experts say the test is about 99 percent accurate .
“ This is not designed for legal purposes , ” Fogg said .
“ The unique concept with this is that you do n’t necessarily have to involve attorneys or physicians .
It ’s a private test that you can simply do yourself . ”
Rite Aid initially bought 10,000 kits to stock in their stores , and is now buying 10,000 more .
Fogg said that 60 percent of their buyers are woman , most of whom are in their 20s .
He added that 6,000 of the tests have been sent to the lab for processing in the past five months when the paternity tests were only offered in West Coast test markets , including California , Oregon and Washington .

If your ideal workspace includes a slide , a games room , a ' chill - out ' aquarium and plenty of free food then you had better get your CV into Google .
Dotcom companies were defined by beanbags and pizza but Google , a company that came to prominence after the bubble had burst , has taken that image to a whole new level .
Meeting ' pods ' in the style of Swiss chalets and igloos , fireman poles to allow easy access between floors and a slide to ensure that people can get to the cafeteria as quickly as possible are all part of a design of its new European engineering headquarters in Zurich Switzerland .
The building was designed for - and partly by - the 300 engineers who will work there .
The wacky office is both a showcase for Google 's unconventional approach to business and a symbol to prove that Google is no longer a US - centric firm .
But as the search giant expands its wings so criticism about its dominance becomes ever louder .
The civil liberties lobby is hot on its heels with questions about what it plans to do with all the data it is collecting while others question its expansion into new areas - with its purchase of advertising outfit DoubleClick causing particular controversy .
Google stresses that it puts users before making money but an 18 % drop in its share price at the beginning of the year proved that it was n't immune to the US economic downturn and some question how long its good intentions can last if profits continue to fall .
Access all areas
It does , without doubt value its staff very highly and engineers are particularly important - over half of the company is made up of them .
They are best served , according to Nelson Mattas , vice president of engineering , by both a creative work environment and a flat , open working structure .
At a press day to launch its new research and development centre , he explained the serious point behind the ' fun office ' .
" The lava lamps , free food and games are all part of the Google culture .
It is informal and a structure that is n't dictated from the top , " he said .
The unconventional design of the office represents what Google hopes is a free flow of information through all parts of the company .
" I was very surprised that on day one of joining Google I had access to every piece of code , design document and confidential information , said Mr Mattas .
A database of all ongoing projects allows engineers to easily locate expertise and a scheme known as 20 % time offers engineers the chance to take that amount of time off from their key objectives to " go do something new " .
It has proven itself , spawning features such as Google News which was built as a 20 % project by an engineer frustrated about the availability of news following the 9/11 attacks .
For Mario Queiroz , vice president of product management at Google , the balance of work and fun is just about right .
" Beyond the good food and cool office it is the case that every conversation that you have here is one of substance , " he said .
Pepsi versus Coke Engineers apparently love the slide Google recruits from the best universities in the US and Europe and now has 12 engineering offices around Europe .
In Poland engineers are working to improve the relevancy of search , while engineers in Denmark are developing virtual machines to improve the speed of applications .
In Israel , engineers have designed Google Trends , a feature that offers users a way to analyse and compare various search terms .
So for instance users can compare the popularity of search terms such as Obama versus Clinton and see the cities where the different US candidates were most popular .
" The tool was developed to understand what people search for in order to improve search but we realised that this information can be useful for everyone else , " explained Yossi Mahas , the head of engineering at Google 's Tel Aviv office .
It has thrown up some fascinating facts .
A comparison between Coke and Pepsi shows that in New Zealand people are more likely to search for Coke while in Turkey and India , Pepsi dominates .
Searches about troubled star Britney Spears show a very direct correlation with her media exposure as well as revealing that there are currently 800 ways to misspell her name .
London has become the European headquarters of all things mobile and alongside its much talked about mobile operating system Android , Google is also working on projects aimed at improving mobile search and tying it ever more closely with location .
Search for a café in London and mobile users will be given results showing the distance away from their current location and the phone number of various establishments .
" The use of location is changing behaviour .
People are going to areas that they do n't know and just opening up Google maps , " said David Burke , a mobile engineer at Google .
Users first ?
Fireman poles offer quick access between floors Engineers work in small teams of three or four , which is reflected at the Zurich HQ with small offices , each of which comes with the requisite ' bean bag ' meeting room .
Whiteboards are everywhere , allowing ideas to be written down wherever they are thought up and there is a heavy emphasis on the idea that work and play can co-exist .
Other areas include a games room , a library in the style of an English country house and an aquarium where over - worked Googlers can lie in a bath full of red foam and stare at fish .
Google is keen to present itself as the company that ' does no evil ' and ' puts users first ' , statements that are becoming more challenged as the company becomes ever more powerful .
A question at the open day about Google 's involvement in China - where search is heavily censored - brought a compromise response : " Our approach in general is users first but we are also obligated to the local laws of the countries we operate in , " said Mr Mattas .
A query about how Google Maps deals with politically sensitive areas such as the Palestinian territories was deflected by the head of the Israel office while a question about how the firm can reconcile being both the provider of ad tools and the seller of media space drew the answer : " They can be complementary " .
The questions about Google 's role as the provider of the world 's information are likely to get louder but few doubt that it is setting new standards in how to get the best out of employees .
And Google assured the more cynical members of the press that the slide is used every day .

A student who is graduating soon was talking with me today about what to read on his own once he is out of school .
It got us to talking about what philosophers are “ must read ” philosophers .
I thought it might be a fun little posting , at least for those that are into “ lists ” .
It is March Madness , so it is the time of year for deciding best teams and arguing about snubs .
So , let ’s cap it at 8 ( arbitrary , but long enough to cause some debate between lists but not so long that you can easily compose your list ) .
Who are the 8 most important philosophers ( I am thinking Western ) ?
Post your list .
You might even include justifications , and perhaps a second list of “ bubble philosophers ” ( ones who were close to being on the list but did not quite make the cut ) .
UPDATE : Here ’s another list of the top ten .
A community driven project for Ruby source code to run natively on Microsoft 's .NET framework has shut down , faced by progress from an official Microsoft effort .
Rather than repeat the work on Microsoft 's own IronRuby , Ruby .
NET is closing its doors just three months after its latest milestone release , and following an initial wave of developer buzz , .
Microsoft , meanwhile , has welcomed Ruby .
NET project participants to its IronRuby project , licensed under the Microsoft Public License ( Ms- PL ) .
John Lam , a Microsoft Dynamic Language Runtime ( DLR ) team programmer , said Ruby .
NET project leader Wayne Kelly is " refocusing " his efforts on IronRuby .
Kelly has moved to head off suggestions Microsoft pressured him to kill Ruby .
NET , which initially received funding from Microsoft Research .
Ruby .NET lags IronRuby overall , but its parser is being added to Microsoft 's effort .
Kelly indicated on the Ruby .
NET mailing list that Ruby .
NET was simply overtaken despite getting a good head start .
Last year 's release of Microsoft 's IronRuby had called into question Ruby .
NET 's " unstated goal " of heading towards a production - quality version .
Kelly got on board with IronRuby following last week 's Lang.NET
Symposium where the projects compared progress .
" I 've come to the conclusion that the DLR is clearly here to stay - it 's becoming an even more important part of the Microsoft platform , " Kelly said .
" Whilst Ruby .
NET initially had a good head start on the IronRuby project ; by incorporating the Ruby .
NET parser and scanner and by leveraging the DLR , I now believe that IronRuby is more likely to succeed as a production - quality implementation of Ruby on the .NET platform , " Kelly said .
The DLR , unveiled by Microsoft in May 2007 , adds a set of features to the .NET framework 's Common Language Runtime ( CLR ) designed to improve the performance of scripting languages on the CLR and to also enable them to share code .
Lam , who joined Microsoft in 2006 having built the RubyCLR for Ruby applications on .NET , welcomed the end of duplicate Ruby efforts .
" More people working in parallel on libraries means that folks will get a working Ruby on .NET that runs real programs sooner .
And that 's goodness for everyone , from the contributors who want to see their code used , to devs who want to write Ruby programs on the .NET , " he said . ®
A mouse resistant to cancer , even highly - aggressive types , has been created by researchers at the University of Kentucky .
The breakthrough stems from a discovery by UK College of Medicine professor of radiation medicine Vivek Rangnekar and a team of researchers who found a tumor - suppressor gene called " Par - 4 " in the prostate .
The researchers discovered that the Par - 4 gene kills cancer cells , but not normal cells .
There are very few molecules that specifically fight against cancer cells , giving it a potentially therapeutic application .
Funded by several grants from the National Institutes of Health , Rangnekar 's study is unique in that mice born with this gene are not developing tumors .
The mice grow normally and have no defects .
In fact , the mice possessing Par - 4 actually live a few months longer than the control animals , indicating that they have no toxic side effects .
" We originally discovered Par - 4 in the prostate , but it 's not limited to the prostate .
The gene is expressed in every cell type that we 've looked at and it induces the death of a broad range of cancer cells , including of course , cancer cells in the prostate , " said Rangnekar .
" The interesting part of this study is that this killer gene is selective for killing cancer cells .
It will not kill normal cells and there are very , very few selective molecules out there like this . "
To further investigate the potential therapeutic benefits of this gene , Rangnekar 's team introduced it into the egg of a mouse .
That egg was then planted into a surrogate mother .
" The mouse itself does not express a large number of copies of this gene , but the pups do and then their pups start expressing the gene , " Rangnekar said .
" So , we 've been able to transfer this activity to generations in the mouse . "
The implications for humans could be that through bone marrow transplantation , the Par - 4 molecule could potentially be used to fight cancer cells in patients without the toxic and damaging side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy .
" When a cancer patient goes to the clinic , they undergo chemotherapy or radiation and there are potential side effects associated with these treatments , " Rangnekar said .
" We got interested in looking for a molecule which will kill cancer cells and not kill normal cells , but also would not be toxic with regard to the production of side effects to the entire organism .
We are thinking of this in a holistic approach that not only would get rid of the tumor , but also not harm the organism as a whole .
Before this animal study , we published a lot of work indicating that in cell culture , there 's no killing of normal cells .
This is the proof that it does n’t kill normal cells because the mouse is alive and healthy . "
Rangnekar admits there is much more work to be done before this research can be applied to humans , but agrees that is the most logical next step .
" I look at this research from the standpoint of how it can be developed to the benefit of the cancer patient and that 's really what keeps us focused all this time , " said Rangnekar .
" If you look at the pain that cancer patients go through , not just from the disease , but also from the treatment – it 's excruciating .
If you have someone in your family , like I did , who has gone through that , you know you can see that pain .
If you can not only treat the cancer , but also not harm the patient , that 's a major breakthrough .
That 's happening with these animals and I think that 's wonderful . "
The research was published in the October edition of the journal Cancer Research .

Behold the Zaky Infact Pillow .
" Zaky — It 's Like Leaving a Part of You with Your Baby . "
It 's $ 38.95 at the Pregnancy Store .
The Zaky is also great when you have to leave your baby with someone else — at your baby 's daycare facility , when he stays with a babysitter , or goes to visit his grandparents .
The Zaky will provide a constant and familiar support giving your baby a sense of security .
The Zaky also assists the caregivers on positioning your baby and your baby will feel and smell mom .
If you have n't given birth yet , the Zaky is great to bring to the hospital when your baby is born .
Scent it with your own scent beforehand to help your baby when he / she is in the bassinet next to you or give it to the nurse when your baby is taken to the hospital 's nursery .
This way you give your baby " your hand " with your scent , and the nurse can use it to support and position your baby .
Also , because your baby smells and feels something constant from birth , the Zaky helps the transition to going home .
The latest economic news is striking .
The U.S. economy has come to a " virtual standstill . "
The bubble has burst and , with anxious global markets registering the shock , other bubble economies worldwide continue to shudder at the possibility that American consumers might be forced to rein in their decade - long buying spree of imported goods .
Though any reader of newspaper business pages has surely noticed that oil news , oil deals , and oil prices have been front and center , the role of oil in our new economic moment has been underemphasized of late .
It 's hard even to remember -- now that the price of a barrel of crude oil has hit the $ 100 mark and still hovers around $ 91 -- that , in the week after September 11 , 2001 , oil was still under $ 20 a barrel .
Think of this as another modest accomplishment of the Bush administration , helped along by its rash war in Iraq , which actually took oil off the market .
In a mere six years , we 've gone from the era of cheap oil to the era of pricy petroleum or " tough oil " , with a new spike at the gas pump expected as early as this spring .
The results are now there for all to see -- in growing misery at home as well as stunning global financial and power shifts .
Michael Klare has long been ahead of the curve .
In the late 1990s , he was already writing about " resource wars " in the coming century ; as that century dawned , his next book , Blood and Oil , arrived ; and now , just in time for a new global era , his latest book , Rising Powers , Shrinking Planet : The New Geopolitics of Energy , is ready to appear .
You could say that he saw much of this coming and here he offers us an assessment of the missing role that energy played in the bursting of the American bubble .

This left home buyers with two unappealing choices :
Take out larger mortgages than they could readily afford , often borrowing from unscrupulous lenders who overlooked their overstretched finances ( that is , their " subprime " qualifications ) ; or buy cheaper homes far from their places of work , which ensured long commutes , while hoping that the price of gasoline remained relatively low .
Many first - time home buyers wound up doing both -- signing up for crushing mortgages on homes far from their places of work .
The great economic mega - bubble arose in the late 1990s , when oil was cheap , times were good , and millions of middle - class families aspired to realize the " American dream " by buying a three ( or more ) bedroom house on a decent piece of property in a nice , safe suburb with good schools and various other amenities .
The hitch :
Few such affordable homes were available for sale -- or being built -- within easy commuting range of major metropolitan areas or near public transportation .
In the Los Angeles metropolitan area , for example , the median sale price of existing homes rose from $ 290,000 in 2002 to $ 446,400 in 2004 ; similar increases were posted in other major cities and in their older , more desirable suburbs .
The economic bubble that lifted the stock market to dizzying heights was sustained as much by cheap oil as by cheap ( often fraudulent ) mortgages .
Likewise , the collapse of the bubble was caused as much by costly ( often imported ) oil as by record defaults on those improvident mortgages .
Oil , in fact , has played a critical , if little commented upon , role in America 's current economic enfeeblement -- and it will continue to drain the economy of wealth and vigor for years to come .
The result was metastasizing exurban home developments along the beltways that surround major American cities and along the new feeder roads that now stretched into the distant countryside beyond .
In some cases , those new homeowners found themselves 30 , 40 , even 50 miles or more from the urban centers in which their only hope of employment lay .
Data released by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2004 showed that virtually all of the fastest growing counties in the country -- those with growth rates of 10 % or more -- were located in exurban areas like Loudoun County , Virginia ( 35 miles west of Washington , D.C. ) or Henry County , Georgia ( 30 miles south of Atlanta ) .
At the same time , cheap oil and changing consumer tastes -- pushed along by relentless advertising campaigns -- led many of the same Americans to trade in their smaller , lighter cars for heavy SUVs or pickup trucks , which , of course , meant only one thing -- a significant increase in oil consumption .
According to the Department of Energy , total petroleum use rose from an average of 17 million barrels per day in 1990 to 21 million barrels in 2004 , an increase of 24 % -- most of it being burned up on American roads .
Let the Good Times Roll ( into the Exurbs )
In 1998 , when the bubble was taking shape , crude oil cost about $ 11 a barrel and the United States produced half of the petroleum it consumed ; but that was the last year in which the fundamentals were so positive .
American reliance on imported petroleum crossed the 50 % threshold that very year and has been rising ever since , while the cost of imported oil hit the $ 100 per barrel mark this January 2 for the first time , an all - time record ( though the price was once briefly higher , as measured in older , less inflated dollars ) .
When that steady price climb , combined with growing dependence on imported petroleum , was translated into the new exurban landscape the economic bubble began to shudder .
As a start , there was that ever - increasing outflow of dollars needed just to pay for all those barrels of crude and the resulting surge in America 's foreign - trade deficit .
Consider this :
In 1998 , the United States paid approximately $ 45 billion for its imported oil ; in 2007 , that bill is likely to have reached $ 400 billion or more .
That constitutes the single largest contribution to America 's balance - of - payments deficit and a substantial transfer of wealth from the U.S. economy to those of oil - producing nations .
This , in turn , helped weaken the value of the dollar in relation to key foreign currencies , especially the euro and the Japanese yen , boosting the cost of other imported foreign goods and so threatening to fuel inflation at home .
Meanwhile , two critical developments kept the cost of oil rising : a dramatic increase in global demand , largely driven by the emergence of China and India as major consuming nations ; and a pronounced slowdown in the expansion of global supply , due mainly to a dearth of new discoveries and recurring political disorder in key oil fields already in production .
This meant that American energy consumers -- including all those long - distance commuters with crippling mortgages and gas - guzzling SUVs -- had to compete with newly - affluent Chinese and Indian consumers for access to ever more costly supplies of imported petroleum .
Something had to give .
As the oil import bill kept rising , the value of the dollar kept falling , and inflationary pressures kept building , the country 's central bankers responded in classic fashion by raising interest rates .
This naturally resulted in substantially higher monthly payments for homeowners with variable - rate mortgages .
For many families already stretched to the limit , this would prove the final blow .
Forced to default on their mortgages , they then precipitated the subprime crisis by , in effect , puncturing the bubble .
Even then , the economy might have had a chance had that crisis not come in tandem with the $ 100 barrel of oil .
By December , consumers were cutting back on nonessential purchases , producing the most disappointing holiday retail season since 2001 .
When questioned , many indicated that the high cost of gasoline and home - heating fuel had forced them to economize on Christmas gifts , winter vacations , and other indulgences .
" If gasoline prices go up , that means there 's less to spend on everything else , " said David Greenlaw , chief U.S. fixed - income analyst at Morgan Stanley .
The high price of gasoline was bad news for another pillar of the economy as well : the auto industry .
While Japanese companies were busy rolling out hybrid vehicles and small , fuel - efficient conventional cars , Detroit stuck doggedly to its now - obsolete business model of producing large SUVs and light trucks , which had , in recent years , been the source of most of its profits .
Once the price of oil went stratospheric , of course , Americans predictably stopped buying the gas guzzlers , signing what looked like an instant death certificate for an improvident industry .
In 1999 , for example , Ford sold more than 428,000 mid-sized Explorer SUVs ; in the first 11 months of 2007 , the equivalent number was 126,930 Explorers ( and even that puts a gloss on the corpse , as November was one of the worst months in recent automotive history ) .
An auto industry in decline naturally means that many ancillary industries will be facing contraction , if not disaster .
Popping the Bubble
Then came January 2 .
Although oil retreated from the $ 100 mark by the end of that day on the New York Mercantile Exchange , the damage had been done .
Stocks on the New York Stock Exchange plummeted , suffering their worst loss on a New Year debut since 1983 .
Gold , meanwhile , soared to an all - time high -- a sure indication of international anxiety about the vigor of the U.S. economy .
Since then , stock market panics have hit major financial centers around the world .
Only a dramatic last - minute decision by the Federal Reserve to reduce overnight lending rates by three - quarters of a point before the markets opened on January 22 averted a further , potentially catastrophic slide in stock prices .
Many analysts now believe that a recession is inevitable -- possibly a long and especially painful one .
A few are even mentioning the " D " word , for depression .
Whatever happens , the American economy will eventually emerge from this crisis significantly weaker , largely because of its now - inescapable dependence on imported oil .
Over the past decade , this country has squandered approximately one and a half trillion dollars on imported oil , much of which has been poured down the tanks of grotesquely fuel - inefficient vehicles that were conveying drivers on ever lengthening commutes from the exurbs to employment in center cities .
Today , a large share of this money is deposited in so - called sovereign - wealth funds ( SWFs ) .
Americans should get used to that phrase .
It stands for giant pools of wealth that are under the control of government agencies like the Kuwait Investment Authority and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority .
These SWFs now control approximately $ 3 trillion in assets , and , with more petrodollars pouring into the petro-states every day , they are projected to hit the $ 12 trillion mark by 2015 .
What are those who control the sovereign - wealth funds doing with all this money ?
For one thing , buying up choice U.S. assets at bargain - basement prices .
In the past few months , Persian Gulf SWFs have acquired a significant stake in a number of prominent American firms , giving them a potential say in the future management of these companies .
The Kuwait Investment Authority , for example , recently took a $ 12 billion stake in Citigroup and a $ 6.5 billion share in Merrill Lynch ; the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority acquired a $ 7.5 billion stake in Citigroup ; and Mubadala Development of Abu Dhabi purchased a $ 1.5 billion share in the privately - held Carlyle Group .
These acquisitions are just a small indication of a massive , irreversible shift in wealth and power from the United States to the petro-states of the Middle East and energy - rich Russia .
These countries , notes the International Monetary Fund , are believed to have raked in $ 750 billion in 2007 and are expected to do even better this year -- and each year thereafter .
What this means is not just the continuing enfeeblement of the American economy , but an accompanying decline in global political leverage .
Nothing better captures the debilitating nature of America 's dependence on imported oil than President Bush 's humiliating recent performance in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia .
He quite literally begged Saudi King Abdullah to increase the kingdom's output of crude oil in order to lower the domestic price of gasoline .
" My point to His Majesty is going to be , when consumers have less purchasing power because of high prices of gasoline -- in other words , when it affects their families , it could cause this economy to slow down , " he told an interviewer before his royal audience .
" If the economy slows down , there will be less barrels of [ Saudi ] oil purchased . "
Needless to say , the Saudi leadership dismissed this implied threat for the pathetic bathos it was .
The Saudis , indicated Oil Minister Ali al - Naimi , would raise production only " when the market justifies it . "
With that , they made clear what the whole world now knows :
The American bubble has burst -- and it was oil that popped it .
Thus are those with an " oil addiction " ( as President Bush once termed it ) forced to grovel before the select few who can supply the needed fix .

Here ’s a little math problem :
In 2005 , just 45 % of the fifth - graders at Ramona Elementary School in Hollywood scored at grade level on a standardized state test .
In 2006 , that figure rose to 76 % .
What was the difference ?
If you answered 31 percentage points , you are correct .
You could also express it as a 69 % increase .
But there is another , more intriguing answer :
The difference between the two years may have been Singapore math .

At the start of the 2005 - 06 school year , Ramona began using textbooks developed for use in Singapore , a Southeast Asian city - state whose pupils consistently rank No. 1 in international math comparisons .
Ramona ’s math scores soared .
“ It ’s wonderful , ” said Principal Susan Arcaris .
“ Seven out of 10 of the students in our school are proficient or better in math , and that ’s pretty startling when you consider that this is an inner-city , Title 1 school . ”
Ramona easily qualifies for federal Title 1 funds , which are intended to alleviate the effects of poverty .
Nine of every 10 students at the school are eligible for free or reduced - price lunches .
For the most part , these are the children of immigrants , the majority from Central America , some from Armenia .
Nearly six in 10 students speak English as a second language .
Yet here they are , outpacing their counterparts in more affluent schools and succeeding in a math curriculum designed for students who are the very stereotype of Asian dominance in math and science .

How did that happen ?
It ’s a question with potentially big implications , because California recently became the first state to include the Singapore series on its list of state - approved elementary math texts .
Public schools are n’t required to use the books -- there are a number of other , more conventional texts on the state list -- but the state will subsidize the purchase if they do .
And being on the list puts an important imprimatur on the books , because California is by far the largest , most influential textbook buyer in the country .
The decision to approve the books could place California ahead of the national curve .
The National Mathematics Advisory Panel , appointed by President Bush , will issue a report Thursday that is expected to endorse K - 8 math reforms that , in many ways , mirror the Singapore curriculum .
The report could also signal a cease - fire in the state ’s math wars , which raged between traditionalists and reformers throughout the 1990s and shook up math teachers nationwide .
Fundamentalists called for a return to basics ; reformers demanded a curriculum that would emphasize conceptual understanding .

Mathematicians on both sides of the divide say the Singapore curriculum teaches both .
By hammering on the basics , it instills a deep understanding of key concepts , they say .
Kids -- at least the kids at Ramona -- seem to love it .
Ramona , which received a grant to introduce the Singapore curriculum , is one of a sprinkling of schools around the country to do so .
Not all teachers like it , and not all use it .
The Singapore books are n’t easy for teachers to use without training , and some veterans are more comfortable with the curriculum they have always followed .
But you can tell when you walk into a classroom using Singapore math .

“ On your mark . . . get set . . . THINK ! ”
First - grade teacher Arpie Liparian stands in front of her class with a stopwatch .
The only sound is of pencils scratching paper as the students race through the daily “ sprint , ” a 60 - second drill that is a key part of the Singapore system .
The problems at this age are simple : 2+3 , 3+4 , 8+2 .
The idea , once commonplace in math classrooms , is to practice them until they become second nature .
Critics call this “ drill and kill , ” but Ramona ’s math coach , Robin Ramos , calls it “ drill and thrill . ”
The children act as though it ’s a game .
Not everyone finishes all 30 problems in 60 seconds , and only one girl gets all the answers right , but the students are bubbling with excitement .
And Liparian praises every effort .
“ Give yourselves a hand , boys and girls , ” she says when all the drills have been corrected .
“ You did a wonderful job . ”

Reinforcing patterns
What is n’t obvious to a casual observer is that this drill is carefully thought out to reinforce patterns of mathematical thinking that carry through the curriculum .
“ These are ‘ procedures with connections , ’ ” Ramos said , arranged to convey sometimes subtle points .
This thoughtfulness -- some say brilliance -- is the true hallmark of the Singapore books , advocates say .
After 10 years of studying the Singapore curriculum , Yoram Sagher , a math professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago , said he still has “ very pleasant surprises and realizations ” while reading the books .
Sagher , who helped train Ramos and the other teachers at Ramona , said he is constantly amazed by “ the gentle , clever ways that the mathematics is brought to the intuition of the students . ”
The books , with the no-nonsense title “ Primary Mathematics , ” are published for the U.S. market by a small company in Oregon , Marshall Cavendish International .
They are slim volumes , weighing a fraction of a conventional American text .
They have a spare , stripped - down look , and a given page contains no material that is n’t directly related to the lesson at hand .

Standing in an empty classroom one recent morning , Ramos flipped through two sets of texts : the Singapore books and those of a conventional math series published by Harcourt .
She began with the first lesson in the first chapter of first grade .
In Harcourt Math , there was a picture of eight trees .
There were two circles in the sky .
The instructions told the students : “ There are 2 birds in all . ”
There were no birds on the page .
The instructions directed the students to draw little yellow disks in the circles to represent the birds .
Ramos gave a look of exasperation .
Without a visual representation of birds , she said , the math is confusing and overly abstract for a 5 - or 6 - year - old .
“ The math does n’t jump out of the page here , ” she said .
Advertisement
The Singapore first - grade text , by contrast , could hardly have been clearer .
It began with a blank rectangle and the number and word for “ zero . ”
Below that was a rectangle with a single robot in it , and the number and word for “ one . ”
Then a rectangle with two dolls , and the number and word for “ two , ” and so on .
“ This page is very pictorial , but it refers to something very concrete , ” Ramos said .
“ Something they can understand . ”
Next to the pictures were dots .
Beginning with the number six ( represented by six pineapples ) , the dots were arranged in two rows , so that six was presented as one row of five dots and a second row with one dot .
Day one , first grade : the beginnings of set theory .
Advertisement
“ This concept , right at the beginning , is the foundation for very important mathematics , ” Ramos said .
As it progresses , the Singapore math builds on this , often in ways that are invisible to the children .
Word problems in the early grades are always solved the same way : Draw a picture representing the problem and its solution .
Then express it with numbers , and finally write it in words .
“ The whole concept , ” Ramos says , “ is concrete to pictorial to abstract . ”
Another hallmark of the Singapore books is that there is little repetition .
Students are expected to attain mastery of a concept and move on .
Each concept builds upon the next .
As a result , the books cover far fewer topics in a given year than standard American texts .
Skilled at math

Singapore is a prosperous , multicultural , multilingual nation of 4.5 million people whose fourth - and eighth - grade students have never scored lower than No. 1 in a widely accepted comparison of global math skills , the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study .
U.S. students score in the middle of the pack .
When the U.S. Department of Education commissioned a study in 2005 to find out why , it concluded , in part : “ Singapore ’s textbooks build deep understanding of mathematical concepts through multi-step problems and concrete illustrations that demonstrate how abstract mathematical concepts are used to solve problems from different perspectives . ”
By contrast , the study said , “ traditional U.S. textbooks rarely get beyond definitions and formulas , developing only students ’ mechanical ability to apply mathematical concepts . ”
Many eminent mathematicians agree .
In fact , it is difficult to find a mathematician who likes the standard American texts or dislikes Singapore’s .

“ The Singapore texts do n’t make a huge deal about the concepts , but they present them in the correct and economical form , ” said Roger Howe , a professor of mathematics at Yale University .
“ It provides the basis for a very orderly and systematic conceptual understanding of arithmetic and mathematics . ”
The Singapore curriculum is not strikingly different from that used in many countries known for their math prowess , especially in Asia and Eastern Europe , math educators say .
According to James Milgram , a math professor at Stanford who is one of the authors of California ’s math standards , the Singapore system has its roots in math curricula developed in the former Soviet Union , whose success in math and science sent shivers through American policymakers during the Cold War .
The Soviets , Milgram said , brought together mathematicians and developmental psychologists to devise the best way to teach math to children .
They did “ exactly what I would have done had I been given free rein to design the math standards in California .
They cut the thing down to its core . ”
The Soviet curriculum was adopted by China in the mid-1950s , he said , and later made its way to Singapore , where it was rewritten and refined .
The Singapore texts could easily be adapted for use in the United States because children there are taught in English .

“ American textbooks are handicapped by many things , ” said Hung - Hsi Wu , who has taught math at UC Berkeley for 42 years , “ the most important of which is to regard mathematics as a collection of factoids to be memorized . ”
One might think that school districts would be lining up to get their hands on the Singapore texts , but no one expects many to take the plunge this fall .
“ Maybe in seven or eight years , but not yet , ” said Wu .
For now , he said he’d be surprised if the Singapore books claim 10 % of the market .
In part , that may reflect the inherent conservatism of the education establishment , especially in large districts such as Los Angeles Unified , whose math curriculum specialists said in December , a month after the Singapore texts were adopted by the state , that they had n’t even heard of them -- or of the successful experiment taking place in one of their own schools .
Advertisement
But there is also an understandable reluctance to rush into a new curriculum before teachers are trained to use it .
Complicating that , experts said , is that most American elementary school teachers -- reflecting a generally math - phobic society -- lack a strong foundation in the subject to begin with .
The Singapore curriculum “ requires a considerable amount of math background on the part of the teachers who are teaching it , ” said Milgram , “ and in the elementary grades , most of our teachers are n’t capable of teaching it .
. . .
It is n’t that they ca n’t learn it ; it ’s just that they ’ve never seen it . ”
Training is key
Adding to the difficulty is that the Singapore texts are not as teacher - friendly as most American texts .
“ They do n’t come with teachers editions , or two - page fold - outs with comments , or step - by - step instructions about how to give the lessons , ” said Yale ’s Howe .
“ Most U.S. elementary teachers do n’t currently have that kind of understanding , so successful use of the Singapore books would require substantial professional development . ”
Advertisement
Although some U.S. schools have had spectacular results using Singapore texts , others have fared less well .
A study found that success in Montgomery County , Md. , schools using the Singapore books was directly related to teacher training .
At schools where teachers were n’t trained as well , student achievement declined .
Sagher , the Illinois professor , said that he would love to see Ramona Elementary become a training ground for L.A. Unified teachers and that Singapore math could radiate out from its Hollywood beachhead .
Districtwide , only 43 % of fifth - graders last year scored at grade level or above in math , 33 points below Ramona students .
“ If LAUSD is smart enough to do it , it will be a revolution , ” he said .

Introduction
Turning dreams into reality ...
Aperture Labs , eat your pink metal hearts out .
Cornered
When it comes to great new games , one of the first thoughts on anyone 's mind is " POORTTAALL !! "
The utterly tongue - in - cheek humour , the innovative gameplay and entertaining ( sometimes vexing ) level design are enough to make pretty much every gamer find something to love .
Proof in point – Joe liked it , I liked it ... and we 're the first to admit that we have completely different tastes in games .
It 's no wonder , then , that someone would build a tribute to the game .
In fact , the real wonder is that it 's taken so long for someone to really bother !
Fortunately , our resident mod-god Magnus Persson ( aka [ WP@ ] Wolverine on our forums ) took it upon himself to start the trend .
Enter : The Weighted Companion PC – a very tiny ( 20 cm cube ) tribute to one of the best games of 2007 .
" The pink heart melts the frozen soul of the lonely modder , " Wolvie said .
And so , without further ado , I 'll hand it over to Magnus to show you the building of the Weighted Companion PC .
Cake not included ...
Once again , I found myself wandering around bored stiff in my apartment .
I needed something to fight the boredom with , but what to do ?
I looked at the big pile of scrap pieces of acrylic that was left over from my Pentagram HTPC build and thought , " I cant let all this acrylic go to waste ! "
And then it hit me – The Companion Cube !!
Like many others , I am a huge fan of the Portal game – so this would be my tribute to one of the coolest games of 2007 .
So I set off to build a replica of the Companion cube for a VIA Epia EX1500G .
The case itself would be very small — only 20 cm cubed — which I thought would be a nice size for a web surfing and MP3 setup .
To make it a little bit harder , I only had about a week to get this done ... so this is my first real speed mod .
In the end , the whole project went from idea to finished case in just five days .
So , let ’s get this thing started ... After studying pictures of the cube , I figured that I would start with the most difficult part – the corners .
Each corner was made from three pieces of acrylic which were glued together and sanded down .
Once the basic shape was formed , it was time to sand down those corners to create the bevelled edge .
You can see some spots on the underside in the pictures above where some of the glue melted little spots of the acrylic – this is OK , because it will be covered in the final product .
The Kremlin is planning to falsify the results of this Sunday 's presidential election in Russia by compelling millions of public sector workers to vote and by fraudulently boosting the official turnout after polls close , the Guardian has learned .
Governors , regional officials , and even headteachers have been instructed to deliver a landslide majority for Dmitry Medvedev - Russia 's first deputy prime minister , whom President Vladimir Putin has endorsed to be his successor .
Officials have been told they need to secure a 68 % to 70 % turnout in this weekend 's poll - with around 72 % casting votes for Medvedev .
However , independent analysts believe the real turnout will be much lower - with between 25 % and 50 % of the electorate taking part .
The Kremlin is planning to bridge the gap by the use of widespread fraud , diplomats and other independent sources have told the Guardian .
Local election officials are preparing to stuff ballot boxes once the polls have closed with unused ballots , they believe , with regional officials also giving inflated tallies to Russia 's central election commission .
Additionally , public sector workers including teachers , students , and doctors have been told to vote on Sunday or risk losing their jobs or university places .
Parents have even been warned at parents ' meetings that if they fail to turn up their children might suffer at school .
Marina Dashenkova , a spokeswoman for the Golos independent poll - monitoring organisation , said complaints to its hotline were following a similar pattern to those during Russia 's rigged parliamentary poll in December .
Forced use of absentee ballots , pressure on state workers and the banned use of state resources to promote Medvedev were the most common complaints , she said .
Renat Suleymanov , secretary of the Communist Party in the Novosibirsk region , said byudzhetniki ( state workers ) in schools , libraries , kindergartens and doctors ' clinics as well as employees of private companies were " coming under intense pressure from the authorities " to vote in tightly controlled conditions at their place of work using absentee ballots .
Also in Novosibirsk , opposition websites published a letter from mayoral officials to health service chiefs and doctors , describing how they should monitor and report back on the voting of their subordinates .
In Vladivostok , Vladimir Bespalov , a deputy in the local parliament , said he had acquired a document showing bureaucrats were given an order to ensure a 65 % turnout and a vote of more than 65 % for Medvedev .
The document laid out precise figures to be achieved in certain districts , he told reporters , with some expected to deliver 88 % for the Kremlin candidate .
" Clearly , we are talking about instructions to bureaucrats who are expected to deliver a victory for Medvedev that corresponds to pre-planned results , " he said .
" According to my information , if these figures are not reached then the people responsible can expect punishment right up to being sacked . "
In Niznhny Novgorod there were reports of students being forced to vote for Medvedev or face being thrown out of dormitories .
Vladimir Primachyok , a campaign official with presidential candidate Gennady Zyuganov , the chief rival to Dmitry Medvedev , claimed students in Irkutsk were being forced to vote under the supervision of college or university officials .
" Members of the law enforcement structures came to us and said that they had been forced to take absentee ballots and give them in to their heads of departments or the personnel department , " he added .
" All of this is a blatant violation of electoral laws . "
The purpose of the falsification is to boost the legitimacy of 42 - year - old Medvedev - who will take over from Putin in May as Russia 's third post - Soviet leader .
Analysts admit that Medvedev would have won the election anyway without Kremlin interference - but on an embarrassingly small turnout .
While a sizeable chunk of the population is happy with Medvedev because they see him as a joint - architect of Russia 's economic revival , analysts say there is widespread voter apathy because his victory is seen as a foregone conclusion .
Western governments now face the dilemma of whether to congratulate Medvedev on his " victory " .
Last month the Organisation for Security and Co-Operation in Europe announced it was boycotting Sunday 's poll , after the Kremlin refused to give visas in time to its election monitors .
The Kremlin used similar tactics during December 's parliamentary elections , which the OSCE 's parliamentary assembly described as " neither free nor fair " .
Analysts today noted that Russian voters had become increasingly accepting of official vote rigging and no longer regarded it as anything unusual .
" There 's no independent control .
It 's very easy to do .
In some places they will put in extra ballots .
In other places election officials will give data that just does n't exist , " Mikhail Delyagin , an economist and the director of Moscow 's Institute on Globalisation Problems , told the Guardian .
" The only person with a real vote in this country is Vladimir Putin .
He has already made his position known , " he added .
Asked whether he intended to vote himself on Sunday he replied : " Do I look like an idiot ? "
" No - one needs to be instructed any more .
Everybody knows what to do , " said the political scientist Stanislav Belkovsky .
" The technology has been proved over the past four years in Russia .
Once the polls close unused ballot papers are taken , filled in for Medevdev , of course , and thrown into the box .
The boxes are then stamped and re-opened a second later .
Then they start to count .
" The technology is very easy .
You do n't need to make it complicated .
Every election commission member is personally responsible .
The central election commission also knows it can rely on governors .
They are more interested in protecting their business interests than in democracy in this country . "
Asked why the Kremlin elite felt the need to fix the presidential poll , Belkovsky said : " They ca n't be Saddam Hussein or the Chinese leadership .
The idea is to gain legitimacy in the west . "
One western diplomat told the Guardian that the administration was now involved in a complicated " numbers game " - designed to ensure that Medvedev won a clear first round victory in Sunday 's vote , but that his tally did n't exceed the 71 % won by Vladimir Putin 's United Russia party during December 's State Duma elections .
There would be little " systematic overt rigging " during Sunday 's voting , the diplomat said .
Instead the figures would be " massaged " afterwards during the accounting and tabulation process , he suggested - a common practice across the former Soviet Union .
" In a country of this size how do you monitor that ? " he asked .
The Kremlin has shrugged off accusations that it manipulated last December 's poll - despite the fact that in several areas of Russia , including Chechnya and other parts of the North Caucuses , 99 % of the population were said to have voted for Putin 's United Russia party .
The official turnout in Chechnya was 99.6 % .
Earlier this month Putin hailed the result as " perfectly objective " .
This week , however , a leading Soviet dissident wrote an open letter to the outgoing president , eloquently describing elections in contemporary Russia as nothing more than a " tasteless farce being played out by untalented directors on the entire boundless Russian stage . "
Sergei Kovalev , a veteran human rights activist who spent seven years in Soviet labour camps , wrote that - " thanks to Putin 's ' deliberate efforts ' - we once again have no elections - the main criterion for a democracy .
Not even Stalin could have dreamed of the Chechen record . "
He added : " It 's entirely redundant to tediously collect up all the electoral commission protocols rewritten in retrospect , or evidence of shenanigans with ballot papers etc - it 's all clear enough anyway ...
The simulation was not for us but for the west you so dislike . "
Medvedev is competing against three other candidates - the veteran communist leader Gennady Zyuganov , the ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhironovsky and a fake democrat , Andrey Bogdanov .
The Kremlin has prevented Mikhail Kasyanov , the only genuinely democratic challenger , from taking part in the poll , claiming that signatures on his election petition had been falsified .
The communists have repeatedly complained of overwhelming media bias by Russia 's state - run television , which in the run-up to the poll has lavishly covered Medvedev 's daily activities and his recent tour of the country 's far east .
Until this week , Medvedev has refused to campaign , claiming he has been to busy .
In a televised address today , Putin urged Russians to vote .
" The voice of each one of you will be important , " he said , adding that they needed to turn out so that the next president could be " effective and confident " .
Case study : schoolteacher , Novosibirsk
" They got us teachers together in the school a couple of weeks ago and told us to take absentee ballots and vote at work .
They told us election day [ Sunday ] will be a working day .
A few young teachers asked , ' What about freedom of expression ? '
They were told , ' If you want freedom , go and look for work in a different place . '
" I have a colleague who works in a different school in the city and she says the same thing happened to them .
She took an absentee ballot and showed it to her boss and they ticked her off the list .
" It seems to me they want people to vote at work because it will be easier for them to control the process there .
Since the meeting in our school they have constantly been coming to us and asking if we have taken our absentee ballots .
I refused to take one .
I 'm going to vote in the place where I live .
I want to vote the way I want and not how somebody tells me .
" I 've heard that the same thing is going on in kindergartens all across the city .
They 're being told to take absentee ballots and vote in a particular place , all together .
" If they found out I had been talking to you they would sack me . "
WASHINGTON ( AP )  President Bush has marked the fifth anniversary of the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and says it's hard to imagine that the country has reached this milestone without another attack against it .
The president , in a speech at the department , says the danger to the country has not passed and that U.S. officials have been able to disrupt numerous planned attacks .
He said one of them involved flying a plane into the tallest building on the West Coast and another called for blowing up passenger jets over the Atlantic .
Bush says that in the face of this danger , the nation must never let down its guard .

WASHINGTON  The State Department no longer considers China one of the world ’s worst human rights violators , according to its annual human rights report released Tuesday , a decision that immediately earned the ire of human rights groups .
In the annual report on more than 190 countries , the State Department did say that China ’s “ overall human rights record remained poor ” in 2007 .
China , the report said , tightened media and Internet curbs and increased controls on religious freedom in Tibet and the Xinjiang region .
The report said China ’s abuses also included “ extrajudicial killings , torture and coerced confessions of prisoners , and the use of forced labor . ”
But the report dropped China from a list of 10 countries that it deemed the worst offenders : North Korea , Myanmar , Iran , Syria , Zimbabwe , Cuba , Belarus , Uzbekistan , Eritrea and Sudan .
At a news conference , Jonathan D. Farrar , acting assistant secretary of state for democracy , human rights and labor , did not answer questions about why China was dropped from the list .
“ I think the report highlights that generally the human rights record remains poor , ” he said .
A Pentagon office that claims to monitor terrorist threats to U.S. military bases in North America -- and was once reprimanded by the U.S. Congress for spying on antiwar activists -- has just awarded a multi-million dollar contract to a company that employs one of Donald Rumsfeld 's former aides .
That aide , Stephen Cambone , helped create the very office that issued the contract .
On January 7 , QinetiQ ( pronounced " kinetic " ) North America ( QNA ) , a major British - owned defense and intelligence contractor based in McLean , Virginia , announced that its Mission Solutions Group , formerly Analex Corporation , had just signed a five - year , $ 30 million contract to provide a range of unspecified " security services " to the Pentagon 's Counter - Intelligence Field Activity office , known as CIFA .
According to Pentagon briefing documents , CIFA 's Directorate of Field Activities " assists in preserving the most critical defense assets , disrupting adversaries and helping control the intelligence domain . "
Another CIFA directorate , the Counterintelligence and Law Enforcement Center , " identifies and assesses threats " to military personnel , operations and infrastructure from " insider threats , foreign intelligence services , terrorists , and other clandestine or covert entities , " according to the Pentagon .
A third CIFA directorate , Behavioral Sciences , has provided a " team of renowned forensic psychologists [ who ] are engaged in risk assessments of the Guantanamo Bay detainees . "
The new CIFA contract with QinetiQ expands work that Analex has provided CIFA and its various directorates since 2003 .
Under its first contract , according to the QinetiQ website , Analex staffers were sifting through information " from traditional to non-traditional providers , ranging from unclassified through top secret classification using sophisticated information technologies and systems specifically designed by CIFA analysts . "
The CIFA contract was awarded just two months after QinetiQ hired Stephen Cambone , the former undersecretary of defense for intelligence and a longtime Rumsfeld aide , as its vice president for strategy .
Cambone is the most senior of a savvy group of former high - ranking Pentagon and intelligence officials hired by QinetiQ to manage its expansion in the U.S. market .
( See boxes . )
While he was at the Pentagon , Cambone oversaw CIFA and was deeply involved in the Pentagon 's most controversial intelligence programs .
It was Cambone , for example , who reportedly issued orders to Major General Geoffrey Miller to soften up Iraqi prisoners for intelligence interrogators in Abu Ghraib in 2003 .
With Rumsfeld , he also set up a special unit within the Pentagon that alienated the CIA and the State Department by running its own covert actions without seeking input from other agencies .
Duane Andrews
Duane Andrews , QNA 's CEO and Stephen Cambone 's boss , got his baptism in information technology during the first Gulf War in 1991 , when he was assistant secretary of defense for communications , command , control and intelligence under Dick Cheney , then defense secretary .
His job included managing the Pentagon 's Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance operations .
" Too many people -- even today -- think of ( information ) as something IT guys worry about , when really it is something that warfighters and commanders need to worry about , " he told Government Computer News in 2002 .
" If they pick up the phone to give a command to go to war and there 's no dial tone , or they send an ops order and it gets garbled or misread or does n't go to its intended recipients , the war slows down . "
Andrews left the Pentagon in 1993 to become chief operating officer of Science Applications International Corporation ( SAIC ) .
During that time , he was a key figure in developing SAIC 's extensive business -- worth about $ 8 billion in 2006 -- with the intelligence community and the Pentagon .
Under Andrews , SAIC won several major contracts involving the management of huge IT systems .
One of its largest was the NSA 's Trailblazer project , in which SAIC was hired to create the data - mining and link - analysis tools for the NSA to monitor the huge increase in cell phone and email traffic that occurred during the fiber - optic and communications revolution of the late 1990s .
( The project turned out to be a $ 4 billion boondoggle and was scrapped in 2005 , but SAIC was hired again to start building its replacement . )
Another SAIC contract of strategic importance to the U.S. military is its prime contract to run the Joint Intelligence Operations Centers ( JIOCs ) .
These centers were established throughout the U.S. military command system by Cambone in 2004 to manage the sharing of intelligence from agencies like the NSA and the NGA to commanders and warfighters on the ground in Iraq and the Horn of Africa as well as major commands in South Korea and elsewhere .
In 2006 , Andrews quit SAIC to join QinetiQ .
Shortly after Andrews was hired as QNA CEO , former CIA Director George Tenet was elected to QinetiQ 's board of directors .
Tenet was undoubtedly brought on to help QinetiQ broaden its reach beyond the Pentagon and its intelligence units into the area of strategic and national intelligence represented by the CIA and the NSA .
Andrews remains close to Vice President Dick Cheney , his former boss at the Pentagon .
In a 2002 interview with Government Computer News , he listed Cheney as his hero .
The new CIFA contract comes on the heels of a series of QinetiQ deals inked with the Pentagon in the booming new business of " network centric warfare " -- the space - age , technology - driven intelligence and warfighting policies established by Rumsfeld and Cambone during their six - year tenures at the Pentagon .
Other Cambone - pioneered programs that QinetiQ has won ( before he went to work at their Crystal City offices that lie just two miles from the Pentagon ) include military drones and robots , low - flying satellites and jamming technologies .
Cambone 's appointment at QinetiQ reflects the " incestuous " relationships that exist between former officials and private intelligence contractors , said Steven Aftergood , the director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists and a long - time observer of U.S. intelligence .
" It 's unseemly , and what 's worse is that it has become normal , " he told CorpWatch .
Aftergood pointed out the similarities between Cambone and the career trajectory of the current Director of National Intelligence , Michael McConnell .
Following McConnell 's tenure as director of the National Security Agency , " he went on to receive a seven - figure salary at Booz - Allen Hamilton , a major intelligence contractor , " said Aftergood .
" And now he 's back at the helm of the intelligence community ( IC ) .
The problem is not so much a conflict of interest as it is a coincidence of interests -- the IC and the contractors are so tightly intertwined at the leadership level that their interests , practically speaking , are identical . "
QinetiQ Evolution
QinetiQ was created in 2001 when the British Ministry of Defense ( MoD ) split up the Defense Evaluation Research Agency ( DERA ) , its equivalent to the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) .
One part of the company remained inside the MoD , but the other half was sold to the private sector and became QinetiQ .
For its first 18 months , QinetiQ was run by the MoD.
But in February 2003 , control slipped decisively out of government hands when 33 percent of its shares were acquired by the Carlyle Group , the powerful Washington - based private equity fund with close ties to the Bush administration .
Carlyle invested $ 73 million in the company , and the MoD retained the other 66 percent .
In an unusual arrangement , however , Carlyle was granted 51 percent of the voting shares , which meant that the investment fund and its appointed executives had effective control over the company .
Carlyle sold off its remaining shares in February 2007 , making a $ 470 million profit on its original investment .
Its initial expansion into the U.S. market was led by its first CEO , Graham Love .
A ten - year veteran of DERA , where he rose to the position of finance director , Love had left DERA in the late 1990s by taking one of its divisions private .
In 2003 , he was brought back to head up QinetiQ's North American operations .
With assistance from Carlyle 's managers , Love went on the acquisition binge that made QinetiQ what it is today .
In November 2004 , it bought Foster - Miller , which builds what it calls " mobile platforms " for the U.S. military , including the Talon robot , a battery - powered machine loaded with night - vision cameras and sensors that can fire both machine gun bullets and anti-tank weapons .
Talons are also used on reconnaissance missions to detect mines and disarm roadside bombs in Iraq ; more than 600 have been acquired by the Pentagon , according to Fortune magazine .
The Foster - Miller website says Talon robots were initially developed with funds from DARPA and have been used in Special Operations missions in Afghanistan , Bosnia and Iraq .
In January 2007 , QinetiQ acquired Analex Corporation , an information technology and engineering company that earns 70 percent of its revenue from the Pentagon ( after the acquisition , Analex was renamed the QNA Mission Solutions Group ) .
Analex , which has received extensive funding from DARPA for its technologies , also holds contracts with SPAWAR , the U.S. Navy intelligence research center in San Diego , and with the U.S. Army 's First Information Operations Command .
For the latter , according to Analex , it provides " subject matter experts " in psychological warfare , information security , electronic warfare and general tactics in the war on terror .
With $ 1.5 billion in defense revenue in 2006 , QNA is now the 11th largest U.S. intelligence contractor .
The QinetiQ story must be told without speaking to the company , however : QinetiQ officials were not available for comment on Cambone 's appointment or any other matter .
As for the former undersecretary of defense , " Stephen Cambone is not interested in an interview at this time , " Sophie Barrett , QNA 's spokesperson , told CorpWatch on January 10 .
Stephen Cambone
QinetiQ's main reason for hiring Stephen Cambone was the fact that he had held the unprecedented job of commanding the full spectrum of defense intelligence agencies controlled by the Pentagon , under the 2002 legislation that created his position as the nation 's first undersecretary of defense for intelligence .
For example he had direct line control over the three national intelligence collection agencies , the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency ( NGA ) and the National Reconnaissance Office ( NRO ) .
He also oversaw CIFA , which he helped set up in 2003 and transformed into one of the U.S. government 's largest collectors of domestic intelligence .
Despite occasional criticism from the U.S. Congress for spying on ordinary U.S. citizens , it has thrived at the Pentagon during the administrations of both Donald Rumsfeld as well as Robert Gates , the current secretary of defense .
Cambone was the chief architect of Rumsfeld 's so - called " transformation " policies at the Pentagon , which fused data flowing from those agencies into the Pentagon 's high - tech war machine .
The decisions he made greatly reduced the Pentagon 's acquisitions of large weapons systems like aircraft carriers and radically increased its purchases of space - age war technologies such as communications systems , sensors , robots , low - flying satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) .
Other QinetiQ acquisitions
In 2005 , QinetiQ made one of its most strategic acquisitions : Apogen Technologies , a McLean , Virginia , maker of optical sensors that was deeply involved in " black " ( secret ) military operations , including anti-submarine warfare and intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance .
At the time , Apogen 's chairman was Phillip Odeen , a longtime friend of Frank Carlucci , the Carlyle Group 's chairman emeritus .
Odeen was a key figure in U.S. intelligence after serving in senior positions at the Pentagon and the National Security Council , where he led the Defense and Arms Control staff under Henry Kissinger .
Odeen went on to become CEO of TRW and BDM Inc. , two major intelligence contractors that were later acquired by Northrop Grumman .
After QinetiQ bought Apogen , it hired Odeen as CEO of its North American division .
In 2006 , while Cambone was still at the DoD , Apogen won an $ 11.3 million contract with the U.S. Marine Corps to provide engineering and technical support to Marine intelligence and reconnaissance operations .
Other customers include the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Navy .
Other companies in the QinetiQ empire include ITS Corporation , which holds IT and engineering contracts with U.S. military and intelligence agencies , including DARPA , naval intelligence and the NRO ; Planning Systems Inc. , which calls itself a " leading network - centric technology company , " and includes among its product line ground - penetrating radar for the detection of IEDs ; and Westar Aerospace , which specializes in network centric communications and interoperability systems .
It is precisely these technologies that QinetiQ produces .
Its work for CIFA , the company said in the release announcing the deal , reflects QinetiQ 's role " as a pioneer in planning and executing the protection of government personnel , critical infrastructure and sensitive defense programs . "
QinetiQ is the largest suppliers of UAVs and robots to the Pentagon and the U.S. intelligence community .
It developed the Zephyr , the world 's most advanced UAV , a solar - powered drone that can transmit data and pictures continuously for periods up to three months .
QinetiQ also specializes in a jamming technology ( called " interference protection " ) that protects satellite systems from outside activity .
And the company is a major supplier of acoustic microsensors designed to track the movements of " insurgents " or " illegal immigrants . "
For QinetiQ and Cambone , therefore , this is a match made in heaven .
Cambone 's insights into " national security affairs and priorities , " said CEO Duane Andrews , will help shape QinetiQ 's ability " to rapidly deliver solutions to the complex challenges that face our defense and intelligence customers . "
In other words , there was a natural fit between QinetiQ 's products and Cambone 's inside knowledge of the future plans and strategies behind the U.S. " intelligence enterprise . "
Re-Inventing the Pentagon
Cambone 's early career was shaped by his deep involvement with technologies associated with missile defense .
His first job out of school was as a staffer for the director of Los Alamos National Laboratory , the defense and nuclear power research center in New Mexico .
After that , he worked for SRS Technologies , a defense consultancy that worked closely on missile defense .
From 1990 to 1993 , Cambone worked under Duane Andrews , his future boss at QinetiQ , as director for strategic defense policy in the office of Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney .
There , he advocated for building a laser - and satellite - based missile defense system known derisively by its opponents as Star Wars , a cause he also took up during the Clinton administration as a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
During the 1990s , Cambone joined the Project for a New American Century ( PNAC ) , the core advocacy group for the cause of neoconservatism , a radical philosophy that views the U.S. as the political savior of humankind , supposedly through " exporting democracy , " and advocates the use of force to expand U.S. power and influence around the world .
There , he associated with many of the officials he would later serve with in the George W. Bush administration , including Rumsfeld ( another Star Wars fan ) , Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz , who was deputy secretary of defense from 2001 to 2005 .
In 1998 , Rumsfeld hired Cambone as staff director of a commission he chaired to study the foreign ballistic missile threat .
The commission was created by the Republican - led U.S. Congress specifically as a counterpoint to the CIA , which had downplayed the foreign missile threat in a 1997 National Intelligence Estimate .
Among the commission 's members were Wolfowitz and former CIA director R. James Woolsey , a prominent necon with close ties to the defense intelligence industry .
The final report , largely drafted by Cambone , flatly contradicted the CIA by warning of an imminent threat from North Korea and Iran , and became the centerpiece of the Bush administration 's initial defense policies .
After Rumsfeld became defense secretary in 2001 , he selected Cambone as his special assistant .
Cambone quickly became his most trusted trouble - shooter .
And in the initial months of the Bush administration , there was plenty of trouble .
Rumsfeld , with Cheney 's support , set out from the beginning to " transform " the U.S. military into a high - tech , computerized fighting force designed specifically to shoot down missiles from " rogue states " and defeat counterinsurgencies and other " low intensive " threats to U.S. national security , primarily in the Middle East .
None of this sat very well with the uniformed military and the defense industry , both of which were slow to embrace Rumsfeld 's network centric policies and the accompanying cuts imposed on Cold War -era weapons such as aircraft carriers and artillery systems .
But the grumbling stopped after September 11 , which provided the opening for Rumsfeld and his allies in the administration to make intelligence the centerpiece of their new " war on terror . "
In 2002 , the U.S. Congress embraced a proposal backed by Cheney and Rumsfeld to create a new undersecretary slot at the Pentagon specifically for intelligence , and Cambone was given the job .
The position provided enormous powers : under the law , he exercised the Secretary of Defense 's " authority , direction and control " over all DoD intelligence , counterintelligence and security policy , plans and programs .
That included the key national agencies , which Rumsfeld and Cambone tenaciously fought to keep within the Pentagon 's command and control system ( for more on this struggle , see Foreign Policy in Focus http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/4795).
By 2004 , according to a profile in the New York Times , Cambone was presiding biweekly conference calls that included the three - star generals and an admiral who ran the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) , the NGA , the NRO and the NSA .
In theory , they also reported to Rumsfeld and Tenet .
But Cambone , the newspaper noted , " has made himself their most active overseer . "
With their newfound power , Rumsfeld and Cambone set about to give the Pentagon greater authority in the area of human intelligence , traditionally dominated by the CIA .
In 2005 , Rumsfeld created a new clandestine espionage branch called the Strategic Support Branch , run out of the DIA and under Cambone 's control , to end what he called his " near total dependence " on the CIA .
By 2005 , under the command of Cambone 's controversial deputy , Army Lieutenant General William G. " Jerry " Boykin , the support branch was deploying small , covert teams of case officers , interrogators and special operations forces to places like Somalia , Iran and the Philippines , sometimes without contacting the U.S. ambassador or the CIA station chief , to launch covert military operations and prepare for future U.S. action .
Spying on Anti-War Activists
In 2003 , the Pentagon 's CIFA launched an electronic database called Talon to collect and circulate unverified reports about people and organizations that allegedly threatened Pentagon facilities .
These reports were then fed into a database managed by the agency .
The database was first revealed in December 2005 when NBC News discovered that Talon had collected data on anti-military protesters and peaceful demonstrators .
In 2007 , the American Civil Liberties Union released an internal Pentagon report showing that Talon ( which stands for Threat and Local Observation Notices ) had about 13,000 entries , of which 2,821 involved reports on U.S. citizens .
For example a February 5 , 2005 , planned protest against recruiting at New York University by Army Judge Advocate General personnel , was listed by Talon as a " threat . "
Another entry , concerning February 14 , 2005 , involved a demonstration planned outside the gates of the base at Fort Collins , Colorado .
The Talon program was shut down in early 2007 , shortly after Rumsfeld and Cambone left the Pentagon , by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his undersecretary for intelligence , retired Air Force General James Clapper .
CIFA itself , however , remains in business .
Those were heady days for Cambone : in May 2006 , the New York Times would comment that Cambone 's " low public profile masks his status as one of the most powerful intelligence officials in the United States . "
But other publications were n't so kind .
Within days of the Times piece , C4ISR Journal , a military publication , described Cambone as a grim and determined ideologue .
" ' Unpleasant , ' ' deeply unpleasant , ' ' does n't joke much ' and ' Rumsfeld without the personality ' are just some of the ways other reporters and analysts " describe Cambone , the Journal said .
In expanding the power and influence of the Pentagon 's special forces , Cambone pushed for policies and technologies that would later make him so useful to QinetiQ , which by 2003 was beginning its expansion in the defense intelligence market .
Throughout his tenure at the Pentagon , for example , Cambone pushed for increased spending on satellites , lasers and computer networks that would link the national collection agencies with soldiers and commanders on distant battlefields .
In 2004 , one year into the intensifying war in Iraq , Cambone proposed spending $ 30 billion -- one - third of the Pentagon budget for information technology -- on what he called a " transformational satellite system . "
This was a laser - based project run by the Air Force that would allow the national agencies and the military to share intelligence data and speed its delivery to bomber pilots and ground troops .
During this time , Cambone was also deeply involved in Pentagon planning for a multi-billion dollar " Space Radar " project , a constellation of satellites designed to detect moving and stationary objects from the skies in any weather condition and in darkness .
The U.S. Congress only approved a portion of what Cambone wanted for the Air Force and Space Radar projects , however .
In 2006 , Cambone presided over an intelligence community review of major intelligence and reconnaissance programs .
It concluded that the Pentagon should increase its use of UAVs such as the Global Hawk , which operated at altitudes of 60,000 feet and could stay in the air for 24 hours and more .
By this time , the Pentagon was also operating secret " stealth " UAVs as a substitute for satellites .
( By 2008 , the Associated Press reported in January , the military 's reliance on UAVs " that can watch , hunt and sometimes kills insurgents " had soared to more than 500,000 hours in the air , mostly in Iraq .
Between January and October 2007 alone , AP found , the Pentagon had more than doubled its monthly use of drones ) .
Revolving Door
When Cambone 's tenure at the Pentagon drew to a close , shortly after the resignation of Donald Rumsfeld in late 2006 , the future course of defense spending had already been set : the big money was going to UAVs and low - orbit satellites for the transmission and sharing of intelligence data .
( These projects became more crucial in 2007 , when the Space Radar was declared a failure and scrapped by Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell . )
And , in response to the increasingly sophisticated tactics of the Iraqi insurgents , millions of dollars were plowed into robots and other technologies aimed at curbing the deadly effects of homemade roadside bombs , that the military has dubbed improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) .
By joining QinetiQ , less than a year after he resigned from the Pentagon , Cambone has been hired to implement the very policies he helped pioneer at the Pentagon , not as a public servant but as a private businessman benefiting from taxpayer dollars .
And with Cambone in the driver 's seat in northern Virginia , QinetiQ is set to build on its already thriving business to become one of the premier suppliers of technology to the " intelligence enterprise " that Cambone built .

To try to spur interest in its upcoming Office Live Workspace service , Microsoft Corp. plans to announce Tuesday that it is running a sweepstakes with a US $ 100,000 grand prize for U.S. beta testers of the Web - based document storage and collaboration offering .
Microsoft also said that it has added several new features to Office Live Workspace , a free service that is aimed at individual users and small businesses .
The software vendor describes the service as an " online extension " of Office that has been integrated with the XP , 2003 and 2007 versions of the market - leading desktop applications suite .
As part of the sweepstakes , Microsoft plans to give out a total of 30,000 prizes between now and May 11 .
In addition to the grand prize , the booty that will be distributed includes 300 Xbox 360s , 500 Samsung BlackJack II mobile phones , 200 30 GB Zune media players , 400 Expedia travel vouchers worth $ 300 each , and several thousand other Microsoft software and hardware products .
Most of the prizes are more prosaic , though : about 23,000 will consist of soda coupons , while another 1,000 will be $ 10 gift cards to an unidentified " specialty coffee retailer . "
Anyone can now sign up to try Office Live Workspace , which had only been available only to a limited number of early users since December .
But only U.S. residents who are at least 18 years old are eligible for the prizes .
Testers can sign up for both the service and the sweepstakes on Microsoft 's Web site .
Office Live Workspace lets users view documents but not create or edit them .
In order to do the latter tasks , people still need to use Office or other types of software , such as products that can create PDF files or JPEGs .
By contrast , online suites such as Google Docs , Zoho Office and ThinkFree Office offer document creation , editing and sharing capabilities for free or for a relatively low cost .
But those services lack full compatibility and integration with Office , which has about 500 million users worldwide , according to Microsoft .
Guy Gilbert , a senior product manager at Microsoft , said the new features added to the service since then include an activity panel that lets users see at a glance what is happening within workspaces , including changes made to shared documents offline .
Users also now can get updates about changes via e-mail and eventually will be able to be notified as part of their RSS feeds , which would enable to them to track changes in their reader software .
In addition , beta - testers can now create permanent links to shared workspaces , making it easier to invite potential collaborators to view documents , according to Gilbert .
However , he added that for the time being , the links will be lengthy and can't be written in plain English .
Asked how he felt Office Live Workspace compares against Google Inc.'s also - still - in - beta Google Docs service , Gilbert said , " Of course , we rate ourselves very well .
But we 're well aware that customers are asking us to do more .
So the service will continue to progress . "
Microsoft will take Office Live Workspace out of beta when the " quality is ready , " Gilbert said , declining to be more specific .
Both free and paid versions of the service will be available at that time , he said , noting that the latter may offer a larger storage capacity or more advanced collaboration features .
The Office Live Workspace beta also is being offered as part of Microsoft 's free Live@edu program for colleges , universities and K - 12 school systems .
The company claims that more than 600 schools in 40 countries have signed up to use the hosted Live@edu services since the program was initially launched in March 2005 .

The Indian workers claim they have been kept in poor conditions Almost 100 Indians who moved to the US for jobs have marched hundreds of miles to Washington DC in protest at being forced to work " like slaves " .
The Indian ambassador said he would do all he could to protect their rights .
The men say recruiters tricked them into paying up to $ 20,000 each for a new life in the US , where they then had to work in exploitative conditions .
The Mississippi firm that employed them has denied they were mistreated .
It claims the recruiters misled the men .
The employer , Signal International , says the men were paid wages above the local average and given good accommodation .
It accuses recruitment firm Global Resources of deceiving the Indians and has ended its contract .
It has also demanded that the recruiters return the fees the men paid them .
Global Resources has in turn denied any wrongdoing , saying it recruited the workers to the terms of its agreement with Signal International and that the men's treatment since was down to the employer .
' We want freedom '
In 2006 , some 500 men from across India each paid recruiters up to $ 20,000 for what they were told would be a new life .
Sabulal Vijayan wanted to earn money to help his family
They were given temporary visas and jobs at Signal International , a marine construction company on the Mississippi Gulf Coast which needed extra workers because of a shortage of skilled labour following Hurricane Katrina .
But the men say they were then forced to live in primitive conditions with 24 men sharing a dormitory , for which they each paid $ 1,050 a month .
Almost 100 of them made an eight - day journey by foot and bus to Washington in an attempt to highlight what they say is the exploitation of foreign workers under the US temporary guest worker programme .
Chanting " we want freedom , we want justice " , the men carried signs demanding they be treated with dignity and held up pictures of family members left behind in India .
They have described their protest as a Satyagraha , a word used by Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi to describe a non-violent battle against injustice .
' Nothing left ' Former Signal worker Sabulal Vijayan , a father - of - two from the southern Indian state of Kerala , told the BBC he had sold everything he had to come to the US to try to earn a better life for his family but had been left with nothing .
We need to change this system to one that helps the employees who are suffering
Sabulal Vijayan
The 39 - year - old fitter said he was threatened with losing his job when he complained about the men's treatment last year - at which point fear and despair led him to attempt suicide .
" I slit my wrists , tried to commit suicide , because there is nothing left for me to go home to , " he said , adding that he had been treated in hospital for three days afterwards .
Mr Vijayan said the men had been living in " slave - like conditions " with cramped accommodation , nowhere to keep their belongings and inadequate food .
And while the wage of about $ 19 an hour was good , he said , it would have been impossible to earn enough to pay back the fee they were charged initially in the 10 months allowed by their visas .
Ambassador
Sen said protecting human rights was a priority
They were unable to leave and seek other work because that would have invalidated their visa and forced them to return to India worse - off than when they left .
" We need to change this system to one that helps the employees who are suffering , not the employers , " he said .
Saket Soni , director of the New Orleans Workers ' Center for Racial Justice , called on the Indian ambassador to the US to help " almost 100 brave , courageous Indian guest workers " .
He said the men had been held for 18 months " in forced labour in a labour camp " before walking out of their jobs and reporting Signal International to the US Department of Justice ( DoJ ) as a " human trafficker " .
The workers , backed by Mr Soni 's organisation and others including the Southern Poverty Law Center , have also filed a federal anti-racketeering lawsuit against their recruiters .
Ambassador Ronen
Sen urged the workers to report any allegations of mistreatment to him so that the embassy could work to help improve the guest worker system .
Claims denied Signal International issued a statement on Thursday saying it would hire no new temporary workers under the H2B guest worker programme until it was " reformed to better protect foreign workers and US companies that were misled by recruiters " .
Temporary workers had been given the same benefits as other workers , including health insurance , the statement said , and the accommodation charge included food , laundry and other services .
" We think that anyone who uses the word ' slave conditions ' has little respect for the truth or the use of that phrase , " chief executive Richard Marler said .
He claimed the recruiting companies and their lawyers had misled Signal and " deceived the workers in India by demanding highly excessive fees " and making false promises about visas .
Global Resources gave a statement saying Signal had been " totally and completely in charge of the relationship with the Indian workers " , including their visa and living arrangements , since the contract with Global had been terminated in 2006 .
A Global Resources spokesman told the BBC that " there were no misrepresentations to anyone " and that any information given to the workers had been agreed to by Signal .
The DoJ has said it will not be pursuing certain charges of discrimination filed against Signal International .
Lawyers for the workers say that other civil and criminal suits are in progress .

The researchers said sweet foods may prompt the body to get ready to take in a lot of calories , but when sweetness in the form of artificial sweeteners is not followed by a large amount of calories , the body gets confused , which may lead to eating more or expending less energy than normal .
" The data clearly indicate that consuming a food sweetened with no - calorie saccharin can lead to greater body - weight gain and adiposity than would consuming the same food sweetened with high - calorie sugar , " Purdue researchers Susan Swithers and Terry Davidson wrote in the journal Behavioural Neuroscience , published by the American Psychological Association .
" Such an outcome may seem counterintuitive , if not an anathema , to human clinical researchers and health care practitioners who have long recommended the use of low - and no-calorie sweeteners as a means of weight control . "
Other artificial sweeteners such as aspartame that also taste sweet but do not lead to the delivery of calories may have similar effects , the researchers said .
" Animals may use sweet taste to predict the caloric contents of food .
Eating sweet noncaloric substances may degrade this predictive relationship , " the researchers wrote .
" With the growing use of noncaloric sweeteners in the current food environment , millions of people are being exposed to sweet tastes that are not associated with caloric or nutritive consequences , " the researchers added .
The research was the latest to examine the question of whether artificial sweeteners - used in many soft drinks and other foods - help or thwart those trying to lose weight .
Various studies have offered mixed results .
The new research drew criticism from the food industry .
" This study oversimplifies the causes of obesity , " Beth Hubrich , a dietitian with the Calorie Control Council , an industry association representing companies that make low - and reduced - calorie foods and beverages , said in a statement .
" The causes of obesity are multi-factorial .
Although surveys have shown that there has been an increase in the use of ' sugar - free ' foods over the years , portion sizes of foods have also increased , physical activity has decreased and overall calorie intake has increased , " Hubrich added .
The council also said findings in animal studies may not be applicable to people , which the researchers acknowledged .
Davidson said the implication of the council 's statement , " that they , too , are interested in the health of the public , seems insincere " .
" If they were sincere , one might expect that they would be alarmed by findings from animal or human models suggesting that their products might be contributing to the obesity epidemic that continues to expand and do its damage , " Davidson said .

Take heed , ye red - blooded American males .
The police are operating a new sting designed to destroy your life .
The police are planting attractive women half naked in parks .
They entice passing males , engage them in conversation , lay back , spread their legs and rest their feet on the men ’s shoulders .
After being as friendly and suggestive as possible , they ask to see your penis .
Do n’t show it to them .
You are being filmed by police .
If you show your penis , you will be arrested as a pervert .
Only American police , judges , and juries could think that responding to a seductress ’s invitation is proof of perversion .
But , hey , you live in America where Christians believe that killing as many Muslims as possible for Israel is God ’s work .
Do n’t expect a dumb Amerikan jury , or a self - righteous Republican judge , or a mindless law professor to understand entrapment .
No , this is not a joke .
It is actually happening .
Last May in Berliner Park in Columbus , Ohio , Robin Garrison , a 42 - year - old firefighter was lured into arrest by a half naked woman under a tree .
In reporting the story , the idiot — possibly some male - hating feminist — who wrote the headline for ABC News describes the above : " Topless Woman Lured Perverts in Police Sting . "
Get that , red - blooded American males .
You are a pervert if you show your penis to a woman who is seducing you .
The reporter , Marcus Baram , is not indignant about the sting .
Neither is Gabriel Chin , a University of Arizona law professor who says : " It ’s not entrapment to give somebody an opportunity to commit a crime . "
It was Anglo - Saxons who made laws against entrapment .
Thanks to law professors like Chin , gullible reporters and jurors , and corrupt police , prosecutors , and judges , Americans no longer have the protection of law .
In the Orwellian world in which we now live , a male who succumbs to female seduction is a pervert .
The American police have never prevented crimes .
In olden days , the police solved crimes by finding the guilty party .
No more .
In our time , the police create crimes .
And that is why the US prison population is twice the size of China ’s , an authoritarian country with a population four to five times larger than America’s .
And not only in Columbus , Ohio , are crimes created by police .
The corrupt New York Police Department ensnared 300 innocents during 2007 via " Operation Lucky Bag . "
Police place iPods , cell phones , wallets , and shopping bags containing items in New York subway stations .
The items appear to be dropped , lost , or abandoned .
Anyone who picks up one of the planted items is arrested for " subway grand larceny . "
This particular police atrocity is in conflict with New York law , which allows someone who finds property 10 days to turn it in to the police or to find the owner .
The corrupt NYPD says that the property left as bait has not been abandoned , but is the property actively left by an officer who is still in the vicinity .
There you have it .
The American Police — " support your local Gestapo " — spend their time engineering false crimes and not investigating real crimes .
Americans are more at risk from the police than they are from criminals .
On December 29 , I received yet another email from a law - abiding American family harassed by police .
The family refused to sell a $ 75,000 piece of property to a deputy sheriff for $ 4,000 .
Farm operations were obstructed .
The mother was stopped every time she went out in the car .
The son was framed and sent to prison .
Never make the mistake of calling the police , and never get stopped by a traffic cop .
You run the risk that he will drop a bag of drugs into you car and arrest you on a drug offense .
If you encounter a police officer , be sure you have thousands of dollars with which to buy him off from making false charges .
Most police charges are false charges .
Americans need to wake up to this fact or the American prison population will outstrip the rest of the world combined .
The Best of Paul Craig Roberts
The more the Federal Reserve does to avert financial contagion , the clearer it becomes that the Fed alone cannot solve the problems in the financial system .
To many Americans , it ’s now obvious that taxpayers will have to step in .
Less obvious is that if the United States government does n’t stabilize the markets , foreign governments increasingly will , in exchange for an ever larger stake in the American financial system .
Over the weekend , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr. said the government would do “ what it takes ” to keep order in the financial markets .
On Monday , President Bush echoed that point , when he was n’t making inappropriate jokes .
The American people need an explanation of what they may have in mind .
The Fed ’s huge loans and interest rate cuts can buy time for flagging banks .
They can also help prevent specific problems , like last weekend ’s near collapse of Bear Stearns , from causing a chain reaction .
They cannot save defaulting homeowners , transform bad mortgage loans into good ones , or do the same for hundreds of billions of dollars of securities tied to those loans .
As those problems persist , financial institutions are under increasing pressure to write off their losses , cutting ever deeper into their capital .
As capital shrinks , creditors have to clamp down on lending , to good and bad borrowers alike , no matter what the Fed may do .
Mike Huckabee 's campaign is being aided by an independent group run by a former top aide at the NRSC and funded in part by a group of retired Procter & Gamble executives in Ohio .
" Trust Huckabee , " whose website went live last week , was responsible for flooding Iowa with automated calls last night praising the former Arkansas governor and criticizing his GOP opponents .
Patrick Davis , a Colorado - based political consultant who served as political director of the NRSC in 2004 , is running the organization and confirmed in a telephone interview that they were a pro-Huckabee outfit and were responsible for the calls .
Davis stressed that they were " completely independent " of Huckabee 's Arkansas - based campaign , but the formation of the group has caused concern in Little Rock .
Huckabee 's campaign sent out comments the candidate made about the calls this morning on the trail in Iowa .
" Our campaign has nothing to do with the push polling and I wish they would stop , " Huckabee said .
" We do n't want this kind of campaigning because it violates the spirit of our campaign .
I do n't want to become President because I disabled the other candidates , I want to become President because I am the best candidate . "
Huckabee 's campaign manager , Chip Saltsman , also issued a statement describing the calls as " extremely counterproductive . "
" It takes the campaign off message at a time when Governor Huckabee is resonating with voters as never before , " Saltsman said .
" It loses votes rather than gains them .
It 's an underhanded way of doing business that is not welcomed by the campaign and it flies in the face of what Governor Huckabee stands for : integrity and clean politics .
On behalf of Governor Huckabee and his campaign , I ask that these calls be stopped immediately . "
But Davis said not only wo n't they stop , but that the calls last night represent only the start of their effort for Huckabee .
He hinted that they 'll soon do similar voter contacts , what he called " personalized educational artificial intelligence calls , " in other early states and denied that they were negative .
" The people who would be upset learning more about a candidate 's true positions are those that are in that candidate ’s camp already , " he said .
He also reiterated that they would be actively recruiting precinct captains to bring out Iowans to the caucuses , but said that such a separate effort from that of Huckabee ’s campaign would be a help not hindrance .
“ It helps our candidate by driving compatriots that are favorable to Mike Huckabee to the caucuses , ” Davis argued .
“ It ’s capacity - building . ”
Asked if they ’ll move beyond the internet and phone calls and air television or radio ads , Davis said , “ we would like to . ”
He would n’t reveal any donors ’ names , but one active member of the group is Harold “ Zeke ” Swift , a retired executive at Cincinnati - based Procter & Gamble .
Contacted by phone this morning , Swift repeatedly referred me to Davis but did acknowledge his involvement and that he ’s a Huckabee supporter and donor .
Swift and his wife served as co-hosts for a Huckabee fundraiser earlier this month in suburban Cincinnati .
Swift was also involved in the efforts of sister independent groups last year , both called “ Common Sense , ” that sent similar calls into states with competitive Senate races .
The 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) parent group of the Huckabee organization is called “ Common Sense Issues . "
This organization is also playing in contested Senate races in 2008 , and just began airing an ad attacking Rep. Mark Udall ( D ) , who is running in an open seat race in Colorado .
Swift would n’t say if another member of the 2006 effort and current Procter & Gamble executive , Nathan Estruth , was involved in funding “ Trust Huckabee , ” but Davis said the donors “ were similar but not identical ” to last cycle .
Estruth was also a sponsor of Huckabee ’s fundraising reception earlier this month and he and his wife have already given $ 2,300 , the maximum allowed in a primary , to Huckabee ..
Estruth did n’t return messages left at his office or home .
Davis worked with Saltsman at the NRSC in 2002 , but said he had n’t talked to his old colleague or anybody else working for Huckabee about the group .
In an email , Saltsman said he knew nothing about the organization .
Davis emphasized that they were “ above board ” and would report what they had to with the IRS and FEC .

Strida 5 Folding Bicycle
The first thing you need to know about the Strida 5 folding bicycle is written on a small yellow sticker on its buffed aluminum frame : " Caution !!
Using rear brake first when braking . "
Ignore that advice and you may find yourself hurtling forward over the handlebars like Wired.com associate editor Danny Dumas does in the video below .
Thanks to the Strida ’s narrow wheelbase , doing an endo is much more likely than it is with most other bikes .
The Strida 5 is also underpowered , with a single - speed drive that wo n’t let you go much faster than 10 miles per hour without pedaling as furiously as a meth - addicted circus clown .
And climbing steep hills ?
Just forget about it .
Those reservations aside , the Strida is an elegant , if unusual , piece of bicycle engineering .
It won admiring stares from other riders of folding bikes , and amused looks from everyone else .
It ’s fun to ride , nimble and perfectly suited to zipping around pedestrians on broad sidewalks .
Plus , its speedy folding and unfolding are well - suited to public transit — you can zip to the train station , collapse the bike in 10 or 15 seconds , and hop on your train without missing a beat .
To take it on the streets of a busy metropolis like San Francisco , however , you ’ll need nerves of steel and a strong sense of the ridiculous .
Our advice : Keep a broad grin on your face and think of the British royal family ; blue - blooded members have been spotted zipping around London on these trendy triangular bikes .
— Dylan Tweeney
WIRED : Just 19.4 pounds — light for a folding bike .
Easy to fold and unfold quickly .
Belt drive means not worrying about greasy chain marks on your slacks .
Winner of numerous design awards , giving it serious hipster cred .
TIRED : Tricky to steer at speed .
Top - heavy , especially for taller riders .
Slow .
Expensive .
Tiny , flimsy rack holds little more than hope .
Price / maker : $ 775 , areaware.com ( U.S. distributor )
Scroll down for more on the Strida 5 plus hilarious crash test video .
The Strida is n’t meant as a replacement for a normal bike — it ’s aimed at urban commuters who need to travel a mile or two beyond the train station or bus stop .
As such , it works perfectly .
We tested it on the streets of San Francisco and on the local commuter train .
Its light weight makes carrying it on and off the train a cinch , and when folded , it is compact enough to lay on the floor of the train at your feet ( or hold alongside yourself when you ’re standing ) .
Other folding bikes collapse more compactly — for instance , Bromptons tuck into a small pod barely bigger than the bike ’s wheels .
By contrast , the Strida is a longish package , and the middle bar ( the bottom of the triangle ) does n’t always stay put when folded along with the other two bars .
The Strida ’s 16 - inch wheels look small , but they ride comfortably and smoothly .
The belt drive is geared generously , so you get up to speed quickly from a dead stop — but the maximum speed seems rather low .
The disc brakes grab reliably and firmly ( just make sure you do n’t grab too hard on the front brake alone ) .
The Strida ’s seat height can be adjusted by sliding the seat up and down the back strut , using an Allen wrench that conveniently stows right underneath the seat .
If you ’re on the tall side , however , you ’ll need to move the seat quite high , which means two things :
Your center of gravity will be high , and you ’ll feel like you ’re almost sitting on top of the handlebars .
It ’s an unusual combination that makes the Strida somewhat uncomfortable at first , though you ’ll get over the wobbly feeling within half a minute .
Still , it ’s probably best - suited for riders shorter than 5 ′ 10 " .
WEST LAFAYETTE , Ind . - Consumers usually reduce their purchases of goods and services if prices become too high .
Buyers of United States corn , soybeans and wheat seem to be ignoring that economic principle , however , as the nation 's grain stocks reach critically low levels , said Chris Hurt , a Purdue University agricultural economist .
With global demand for grain and oilseeds at record levels and a weak U.S. dollar , foreign buyers are outbidding domestic buyers for American grain .
While the higher commodity prices are good for crop agriculture , there are disconcerting downsides , Hurt said .
" Food consumers worldwide are going to have to pay more , " Hurt said .
" We ended 2007 with our monthly inflation rate on food nearly 5 percent higher .
I think we 'll see times in 2008 where the food inflation rate might be as much as 6 percent .
" I also think we 'll have discussions about food security in 2008 .
We 'll have discussions about whether we should allow the foreign sector to buy our food .
Is food a strategic item that we need to keep in our country ? "
For some U.S. crops , it 's almost too late .
The 2007 U.S. wheat crop is virtually sold out , while domestic soybean stocks soon will fall below a 20 - day supply .
Corn inventories are stronger , but with demand from export markets , the livestock industry and ethanol plants , supplies also could be just as scarce for the 2008 crop .
The condition could become more serious if adverse weather trims U.S. crop yields this summer and fall .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
The situation is reminiscent of another run on U.S. grain one generation ago , Hurt said .
" This is a very rare circumstance , " he said .
" The last time we had this kind of uncertainty on food supplies was the early 1970s when the former Soviet Union became a major buyer of wheat in the United States .
In the fall of 1972 they were such aggressive buyers that they essentially bought the pantry out of our available wheat supplies .
" In 1973 we also virtually ran out of soybeans .
The U.S. Congress and president responded by saying we cannot let the rest of the world have our strategic food supply , so they embargoed all foreign soybean shipments until we could replenish the supply . "
Hurt does n't expect a similar export prohibition this year , but grain prices will have to keep climbing to slow the buying frenzy .
Recent cash prices for wheat , soybeans and corn are up dramatically from two years ago .
Wheat prices have been near $ 10 a bushel , more than $ 6 a bushel higher .
Cash prices for soybeans are about $ 13 a bushel , up more than $ 7 a bushel .
Corn is pricing at near $ 5 a bushel , an increase of greater than $ 3 a bushel .
Despite the higher prices , wheat exports are 32 percent higher than one year ago , 33 percent of the U.S. soybean crop will be shipped out of the country and corn exports this year are on pace to break the 1979 - 80 record of 2.4 billion bushels .
Because of the devalued U.S. dollar , high prices have n't dissuaded foreign buyers from purchasing American grain , Hurt said .
" We 've seen the relationship of the U.S. dollar to foreign currencies change substantially in the last few years , " he said .
" The European euro has increased in value relative to the U.S. dollar by 40 percent .
What that means is that with the same number of euros , the Europeans can buy 40 percent more in the United States than they would have been able to buy three or four years ago .
" As an example , $ 12 soybeans in the Midwest are equivalent to something in the range of $ 9 to the world at this point .
This suggests that the world will not cut back on grain usage as quickly , because as buyers purchase using their own currencies they are not experiencing as high a price as we perceive these prices to be in the United States . "
It might take another month of grain price increases to get users to cut back , Hurt said .
He estimated soybean prices could top $ 15 a bushel before all is said and done .
Farmland values and cash rental rates should continue rising as producers look to expand their crop acreage to meet the grain demand , Hurt said .
He also expects agribusinesses - especially those that offer seed , ag chemicals , fertilizer , machinery and financial capital - to benefit .
The challenge to satisfy the world 's hunger for grain promises to make for an interesting year , Hurt said .
" It turns out food is a security issue for every country of the world , " he said .
" World agriculture has been so productive in the past 60 years that general food shortages have been rare .
With this long period of abundant food supplies , most of the world 's consumers in developed countries have forgotten food 's strategic nature .
Given the world 's appetite for basic crops , the hope for 2008 is for favorable yields throughout the globe that will give consumers and crop producers more time to adjust to this new high - demand era . "
This was Clinton 's version of her Tuzla trip in 1999 :
" You know , I went to Bosnia shortly after the peace accords were signed , when it was safe enough to go to our base in Tuzla , but not very safe to go anywhere else .
I could n't get into Sarajevo .
But I was able to fly out of Tuzla into two base camps -- Camp Alicia and Camp Bedrock -- to visit with the men and women who were there on the front lines of Americas peace - keeping efforts . "

DEFINING ISSUE DEFINING ISSUE
Infidelity ( in - fi - del - i - tee ) n unfaithfulness or disloyalty to another , esp. , sexual unfaithfulness to a husband or wife ; an unfaithful or disloyal act .
-- Webster 's New World Dictionary Enlarge By Richard M. Hackett , for USA TODAY Chris and Tammy Matier with their children Mikaela , 8 , and Ethan , 6 , at their home in Greeley , Colo .
They moved into a trailer as part of their plan to get out of debt after Chris ' " financial infidelity . "
Sex may be the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the word " infidelity , " but there are other types of " unfaithful or disloyal acts , " other ways spouses cheat on each other .
A major one is money .
POLL : Americans rank which money matters can ruin a marriage
In the wake of the revelations regarding former New York governor Eliot Spitzer 's trysts with high - dollar call girls , couples — especially women — were giving their own relationships the once - over .
In online chats and call - in radio programs , the discussions followed a common theme : " What would I do if that happened to me ?
Surely I would have had a clue it was coming .
And anyway , how could he spend serious money on an affair or a prostitute — or on anything else , for that matter — without my knowing ? "
How indeed .
Many couples commit monetary deceit in their marriages .
Someone lies about finances or does n't share the details .
It can be innocuous , such as fudging on the cost of purchases or hiding a spending spree .
Or it could be more significant , such as having a secret credit card or bank account , serious enough to be considered what some relationship experts call " financial infidelity . "
YOUR STORY : Have you ever kept a financial matter secret from your spouse ?
The idea of keeping money secrets from a spouse or partner is n't a new one .
Sitcoms of the past often played off the theme .
I Love Lucy drew laughter when Lucy tried to hide her spending from Ricky .
And certainly it does n't always involve sex , although where there is sexual infidelity , there is most likely financial infidelity as well .
" Everyone in my practice who is committing adultery is committing financial infidelity .
It goes with the territory , " says Bonnie Eaker Weil , a New York relationship therapist and the author of Financial Infidelity , to be published April 17 .
Those who have sex outside their relationship have to be financially sneaky .
Their hanky - panky requires money to entertain a lover or to pay for a prostitute .
Stephany Alexander of Phoenix founded WomanSavers.com , which claims a database to warn women about men who lie , cheat or are abusive .
She says it 's easier for some people to cheat sexually and financially .
" It 's less obvious with people who have a lot of money , like politicians and celebrities , " Alexander says .
" They are on the road and traveling a lot and have high expense budgets and can cover up a lot that the average person might not be able to . "
Most adults — married and single — do n't believe financial infidelity is grounds for divorce , but they agree it is a violation of trust , according to a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll of 1,001 adults .
The most heinous breach is a secret bank account : 62 % of the 557 married respondents say it 's a major violation ; 11 % believe it 's grounds for divorce .
Among the 444 unmarried respondents , 55 % believe a secret account is a major violation ; 13 % would divorce .
Hiding a purchase from a spouse and keeping a secret credit card are also considered major violations — almost 60 % say so .
But those who are currently married may be slightly more forgiving : Only 6 % say both are grounds for divorce , compared with about 10 % of the unmarrieds .
It 's not always about sex Even without a sexual liaison , serious financial secrets can be destructive to a relationship .
Financial planner Ginita Wall of San Diego says she has seen countless incidences of financial infidelity .
" It 's usually fairly minor — people buying things and saying they had them in the closet for ages or someone goes out with a group at lunch and puts it on the credit card , and they reimburse him in cash . "
Wall has seen some extreme cases , including a client in a rocky marriage who for 25 years took cash back at the grocery store every week and ended up with $ 250,000 in a bank account in her sister 's name .
" Her husband thought she was bad at managing household funds .
She was always short .
He was shocked when he found out she had squirreled that money away . "
Divorce lawyer Alton Abramowitz , a vice president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers , also has tales of financial infidelity , which he says happens " very frequently . "
" It could be people going to Las Vegas or Atlantic City and losing money and not telling the spouse , " he says .
" Or they 're not depositing their entire paycheck into the joint account .
Or people are having credit card bills sent to the office instead of the house , and the spouse does n't know they 're running up these credit card bills . "
Middle - school teacher Chris Matier of Greeley , Colo. , says he did just that , running up about $ 20,000 of debt during an 18 - month period on four credit cards that his wife , Tammy , a school administrator , did n't know he had .
" We did n't discuss money at all , " he says .
" She was out of that loop . "
That was eight years ago , following the birth of their first child , when Matier says he was buying " toys , " such as video games , computers , CDs and electronics .
He had already maxed out the couple 's credit card .
" Things started mounting very quickly , and I got caught , " he says .
" A bill collector from the hospital called looking for money , and I was n't home .
I was out shopping , ironically .
There were quite a few bills I had n't paid : credit cards , hospital bills and tuition payments ( for his wife 's master 's degree ) .
" My wife confronted me on it , so I came clean . "
The Matiers , both 34 , will celebrate their 14th wedding anniversary in May .
They plan to buy a house in about 18 months , when both cars will be paid off , they will no longer need day care for their young son , and they 'll own the mobile home where they live .
An online survey by Yahoo Finance and the research firm Decipher , released last month , found that 48 % of the 600 respondents in a serious relationship admitted to some type of financial infidelity .
The survey found 45 % agreed that spending between $ 100 and $ 500 without telling their partner was all right .
Yahoo Finance columnist Laura Rowley says 3 % said spending up to $ 5,000 without consulting a significant other is OK .
A little ' mad money '
What do experts advise couples to do to avoid financial infidelity ?
Former accountant Tina Tessina , a psychotherapist in Long Beach , Calif. , and author of the new book Money , Sex , and Kids , says dual - income couples and stay - at - home parents should have some discretionary money to feel " a little autonomous . "
How much should a person be able to spend without consulting his or her partner ?
Amounts vary with the couple 's economic status , but Tessina says an average couple should discuss spending more than $ 200 .
Estate adviser Bambi Holzer of Beverly Hills , Calif. , agrees .
She also says separate bank accounts can work , especially if the partners can't agree on how to spend .
" If you have a male that wants to spend money on a football game and go to a bar with the guys and the woman wants to buy a purse , rather than get permission , they should have an account for minor purchases , not major ones , " says Holzer , author of Financial Bliss .
Bruce Bickel of Pittsburgh , managing director of PNC Financial Services Group 's wealth management division , advises against separate accounts and urges couples to overcome that tendency toward autonomy and toward a spirit of dependency on each other .
" I try to prevent that ( financial infidelity ) rather than correct it , " says Bickel , who does suggest a buffer fund from the monthly income that either can access after consulting the other .
That kind of open communication is the way Luke and Hannah Wickham of Orlando handle their finances .
Luke , 31 , and Hannah , 29 , were married five years ago .
He had student loans and she did n't .
They agreed to talk about any spending over $ 100 .
" If you do n't have a major discussion regarding debt and money before you got to the altar or live together and make a major investment together , you 're walking down a dangerous path , " he says .
" You can be rich in love , but money is important in paying the bills . "

x264 Benchmark
by graysky
What Is This Test ?
Simply put , this test measures how fast your machine can encode a short , DVD quality MPEG - 2 video clip into a high - quality x264 video clip .
What 's x264 , you ask ?
It 's more or less the next - generation Xvid / DivX codec .
I think it 's ideal for a benchmark because the application ( x264.exe ) reports fairly accurate compression results ( in frames per second ) for each pass of the video encoding process , and it uses multi-core processors very efficiently .
You 'll notice that the whole thing is pretty simple since I have no programming skills to speak of .
The test basically , consists of the needed executables , the video file ( provided by Adrian of Tech ARP ) , the AVISynth script , and the DGIndex project file .
They are all driven by a batch file that 'll kick off the x264 encode , and write the results to text file .
That makes it easy for you to upload the results , together with your machine specifications for comparison .
The video content itself is not important .
It is just a DVD - formatted , progressive MPEG - 2 stream running at 23.976 fps with a resolution of 720x480 .
The important thing is that all those participating in this test use the same clip , the same version of x264 , the same version of Avisynth etc. so that the results are comparable .
Wait , before you download and run this , please consider using the x264 Benchmark HD instead .
It uses a much newer version of x264 and a 720 p HDTV clip !
Benchmark Results to Date
Intel & AMD Processors ( Including Stock & Overclocked Systems )
All the data including both stock and overclocked Intel and AMD machines sorted in ascending order by total encoding time .
All the data including both stock and overclocked Intel and AMD machines sorted in ascending order by chip name .
Stock Settings
Have a look at this table if you 're interested in seeing the non-overclocked ( i.e. factory default ) results for a particular chip .
Both Intel and AMD processors are contained in these data which are a subset of the main two tables .
To keep it lean , I just included a single result for each chip , but things such as operating , memory timings , etc. can affect the data by a small amount .
These data are sorted by chip name for easy reference .
General Data Trends
Contains a subset of the main two tables for both AMD and Intel based systems .
They are sorted and color coded to demonstrate a particular trend in the data .
There are obviously more data points that show the given trend ; I just selected a few representative ones to keep the table a bit leaner .
This table also compares data from different Yorkfield quad core chips to Kentsfield quad core chips as well as Wolfdale duals to Conroe duals and finally , see how the AMD Phenom 9500 compares to several different Intel quads .
Have a look !
Download the Benchmark Here !
Want to see how your machine scores and / or contribute data ?
Download the benchmark by clicking here .
The md5sum for this RAR file is 38754bd8a33219e8 faae661868a3e38e .
Initial Setup
Download and install AviSynth 2.5.7 ( needed to run the benchmark ) .
You can get it from this link or by simply running the benchmark ( it will direct you to download it ) .
That 's it !
Running The Test
Simply double - click the shortcut named " x264 Benchmark " and it will prompt you to name your results file .
I usually just type in my CPU settings .
For example , when I am testing the CPU at factory settings , I 'll use " 9x266 " and when I overclock it , I 'll use the overclocked multiplier and FSB settings , like " 10x333 " for example .
It really does n't matter what you use .
Naming it just helps you remember which text file corresponds to which CPU setting .
After you hit < ENTER > , the benchmark will start .
It will run through a 2 - pass encode of a small 720x480 video clip for a total of five runs .
Then , it will write the results to a text file .
For the most accurate and consistent results possible , please do NOT use your machine while the test runs .
You can test your machine at different CPU settings , but it would be a good idea to also test it at its stock settings as a baseline .
This will allow you to determine just how much performance advantage your CPU overclocking has given you .
Reporting Results
Simply post the contents of the results text file to the x264 benchmark thread along with some hardware details which you can get from CPU - Z :
Your processor model
Your CPU multiplier and FSB settings for the test
Your motherboard chipset
Your memory clock speed and timings ( just the first 4 will do )
Your operating system
Take for example , the screenshot on the right .
You can post your specifications as Core 2 Quad Q6600 , 9x333 , P965 , 4-4-4-10 @ 333 MHz , XP Pro SP2 .
Since the output is merely a text file , we recognize the potential for people to cheat by simply making up their own results , or skewing the real data .
I do n't know of a way to eliminate this .
All I can say is please do n't do it .
No one will think you 're cool just because you have faster numbers !
Finally , I do n't plan on entering everyone 's results into the ' official ' table ; it would make the table of results too massive and difficult to read .
This benchmark really was n't meant to be a diary or scoreboard for people .
I think it can be a cool way to compare your results to a few reference machines .
My hope is to populate the table with results from several processors and new chips ( such as the AMD Phenom and the Intel Penryn when they are released ) .
Enjoy and thanks for participating !

Questions & Comments
Please feel free to post your questions or comments here !
An article published in The Times of India in February questioned how such a law would be enforced : “ In a country crippled by abject poverty , ” it asked , “ how will the government body guarantee that women will not agree to surrogacy just to be able to eat two square meals a day ? ”
Even some of those involved in the business of organizing surrogates want greater regulation .
“ There must be protection for the surrogates , ” Mr. Rupak said .
“ Inevitably , people are going to smell the money , and unscrupulous operators will get into the game .
I do n’t trust the industry to police itself . ”
He said that the few doctors offering the service now were ethical and took good care of the surrogates but that he was concerned this might change as the business expanded .
Mr. Gher and his partner , who asked not to be named to preserve his privacy , have worked through their doubts and are certain they are doing a good thing .
“ People can believe me when I say that if I could bear the baby myself I would , ” he said .
“ But this is a mutually beneficial answer .
The surrogate gets a fair amount of money for being part of the process . ”
They are paying about $ 30,000 , of which the surrogate gets about $ 7,500 .
“ Surrogates do it to give their children a better education , to buy a home , to start up a small business , a shop , ” Dr. Kadam said .
“ This is as much money as they could earn in maybe three years .
I really do n’t think that this is exploiting the women .
I feel it is two people who are helping out each other . ”

Mr. Gher agreed .
“ You cannot ignore the discrepancies between Indian poverty and Western wealth , ” he said .
“ We try our best not to abuse this power .
Part of our choice to come here was the idea that there was an opportunity to help someone in India . ”

A Female Suicider Explodes Bomb in a Crowd of Mostly Women Pilgrims
Guest blogged by Jon Ponder , Pensito Review .
The Worst Vice President Ever goes to Baghdad and says :
“ I was last in Baghdad 10 months ago , and I can sense , as a result of the progress that ’s been made since then , that there have been some phenomenal changes , in terms of the overall situation , both with respect to the security situation , where Iraqi and American forces have done some very good work , as well as with respect to political developments here in Iraq . ”
Meanwhile :
At sunset Monday , however , a female suicide bomber killed at least 40 people * and injured more than 50 when she blew herself up in a crowded pedestrian area near a Shiite Muslim shrine in the southern holy city of Karbala , according to government and hospital officials .
Among the victims were several Iranian pilgrims who ’d come to worship at the Imam Hussein shrine , one of Islam ’s most sacred sites …
The majority of casualties in the Karbala suicide bombing were female pilgrims who ’d gathered at refreshment stands about a half - mile from the shrine , said Saleem Kadhim , a spokesman for the Husseini Hospital , which received 40 dead and 56 injured from the blast .
Medics from nearby towns were called in to help the overflowing hospital , and the government imposed an open - ended citywide curfew on Karbala .
“ I was near the bus station when I saw a woman who was pushing others and then , a few seconds later , I saw a flame in the sky , ” said Jassim Hussein , 32 , who helped carry victims from the scene .
“ I blame the Baathists and members of the old regime .
As you know , Karbala is a target for so many enemies , especially those against the Shiites .
And I also blame the security forces because we do n’t have checkpoints in this area . ”
… In other violence Monday , a car bomb exploded at a busy intersection in the Baghdad neighborhood of Karrada , wounding eight people .
Three separate roadside bombs in the capital also left casualties :
One policeman was killed and one wounded when their patrol was targeted near a teachers ’ training institute in Mansour ; three Iraqi civilians died at a busy intersection near the Shaab Stadium in Zayuna ; and one civilian was injured near the landmark Mr. Milk grocery store in Mansour .
And :
And the U.S. military announced the deaths of two soldiers who were killed Monday when their Humvee struck a roadside bomb north of Baghdad , bringing the number of American troop deaths to at least 3,990 since the war began .
The media meme on Cheney ’s trip is that it was a “ surprise , ” but when word of his trip to the Middle East came out last week , who did n’t think he would detour to Iraq ?
The bombings were probably all planned then .
Maybe he was there to crack the heads of Prime Minister Nouri al Malki and his government , but the trip comes off like one big photo op to give Cheney a platform for spouting administration talking points on the occupation : U.S. forces would “ not quit before the job is done , ” he said , without a trace of irony .
And “ [ it ] would be a mistake now to be so eager to draw down the force that we risk putting the outcome in jeopardy .
And I do n’t think we ’ll do that . ”
* Update : An Iraqi health official says the death toll in Monday ’s bombing in Karbala near the shrine of Imam Hussein has risen to 52 .

All hell brakes loose in the next few minutes , as Alten enters the realms of 9/11 truth , explaining to the stunned Bohanan and and his virgin ( 9/11 truth issue ) audience that there is a mass 9/11 truth movement in America that involves engineers , police , private investigators , and many other experts challenging the official 9/11 story .
Bohannan is a right wing pro-military radio voice , who 's audience has probably NEVER been exposed to 9/11 truth issues .
" The Shell Game " author , Steve Alten , came on after an Oil Executive 's interview , at about 39:50 in the 1.5 hour show .
At about 54:56 it gets REALLY interesting when a caller calls in to discuss 9/11 as a false flag attack .
Which unleashes Alten into a deep discussion of 9/11 truth issues .
All hell brakes loose in the next few minutes , as Alten enters the realms of 9/11 truth , explaining to the stunned Bohanan and and his virgin ( 9/11 truth issue ) audience that there is a mass 9/11 truth movement in America that involves engineers , police , private investigators , and many other experts challenging the official 9/11 story .
Alten gives Bohannan some rope at the beginning , before he yanks it to give Bohannan 's virgin audience some powerful new issues to chew on .
Alten takes on the BIG OIL guest ( and big energy 's lies ) that preceded him on the show , as well as the rational for war in Iraq , BUT spends most of his time TAKING ON THE 9/11 COVER UP , War Games , Evidence Destruction at the WTC , and WTC BUILDING 7's MYSTERIOUS and UNINVESTIGATED COLLAPSE !
When Alten broaches 9/11 truth issues , Bohannan challenges Alten , with the ' you 're telling me that you know facts that no one else in America knows about 9/11 ' line .
Alten responds that " There is a massive 9/11 truth movement of highly competent professionals in America , that involves tens of thousands of activists and researchers . "
Alten explains that false flag terror events often require that simultaneous war games be held to enable such false flag events to happen , and that is what happened on 9/11 .
Alten discovered this disturbing information while researching for his new historical fiction book , he explains to Bohannan .
Alten then talks about multiple war games mysteriously held to draw our Air Force fighters away from New York and DC on 9/11 , that enabled the strikes of that day .
Alten says , " Shocking to me , when I did my research for this book , was that there were 5 separate War Games being conducted in the North Eastern quadrant of our country with NORAD , which sent out jet fighters over parts of Alaska and Iceland and over Canada .
Which pulled them out of the North Eastern section of the country .
Bohannan , bristles , and then challenges , Alten , head on , " Are you suggesting United States complicity in the attacks of 9/11 ? "
Alten , " I 'm just stating what happened .
You can draw your own conclusions from it . "
Bohannan , " Well I , you 'd have to draw something a lot more serious than that .
I mean it would have to show a , a - a - a series of connections , including of course , knowing that the attack was about to occur .
Then you would be getting into , not only the , uh , the spirit of the book , " The Shell Game , " but uh , but uh , serious implications . "
The show goes to break .
Bohannan ( coming back from break ) : " We got interrupted by the break , but before that you were saying something interesting Steve , that there were , uh , war games being held at the time of 9/11 , under uh , questionable timing .
And here you 'll have to go into some of the things you were telling me during the break , because the audience did n't get to hear those , but just tell me what it is that you say you 've unearthed here . "
Alten , " Well if I can read a quick paragraph from the book [ The Shell Game ] , which will explain it , um . . . "
Alten ( quoting from " The Shell Game " ) , " Did they , the US government intelligence community , know of a coming Al Qaeda attack before 9/11 ?
YES , in fact , there were at least 5 intelligence services across that country that warned us .
Did they try to stop them ?
YES , but they were prevented from doing so . "
Bohannan cuts in , exasperated , " On that particular date , we knew there was an attack coming ! ? "
Alten , " Yes . "
Bohannan , " Sure " Alten ( quoting from " The Shell Game " ) , " Did they , the US government intelligence community , know of a coming Al Qaeda attack before 9/11 ?
YES , in fact , there were at least 5 intelligence services across that country that warned us .
Did they try to stop them ?
YES , but they were prevented from doing so . "

An Italian woman is due to give birth in a hospital in Rome this week to a baby girl - before returning three months later to have triplets .
If both deliveries are successful , it is thought that this will be the first such case in history .
I remember asking the doctor to make sure because I just could n't understand how it was possible
She told Italian television : " When I was at the sixth month of my pregnancy and went to see the doctor for the usual tests and scans , he noticed that , apart from Denise , there were another three babies .
" I did n't believe it at first .
I remember asking the doctor to make sure because I just could n't understand how it was possible .
" The difficult thing is not knowing what is going to happen after Denise is born .
After that it is all suppositions and theories . "
Not possible
Professor Ian Craft , director of the London fertility clinic , said it should not be theoretically possible for a woman to be pregnant twice at the same time .
He said : " Normally when you are pregnant you switch off your ovulation , and you do n't then ovulate again and you have no periods until your child is born and you are at least part the way through breastfeeding .
" I have never seen it in my whole professional career . "
Professor Craft said the condition , known technically as superfecundation , does occur rarely in animals .
However , he said it was extraordinary for someone to conceive naturally and then to spontaneously ovulate three eggs again .
The chance of having triplets is only one in 6,000 .
" How often would you expect these two combinations to go together ?
You are more likely to win the lottery . "
Professor Craft said there was a high risk that the triplets would be born prematurely .
He said there were also difficult questions about how the first child should be delivered to minimise risk to the triplets .

Wind tunnel testing has proven the design 's stability
Simulation flight
The European company 's Astrium division , makers of the Ariane rocket , has plans for a commercial vehicle to take ticketed passengers above 100km .
Its market assessment suggests there could be 15,000 people a year prepared to part with substantial sums of money for the ride of a lifetime .
Astrium anticipates it be will be producing about 10 planes a year .
" To satisfy the market you will need more planes than you think , because once there is regular operation , the price will decrease which means there will be more customers , " Robert Laine , chief technical officer ( CTO ) of the pan-European company , told BBC News .
Today , we do n't know how to go to space cheaply
Robert Laine , CTO , EADS Astrium
Fantastic acceleration
" It will develop towards a classical aeronautical business model .
Someone will build the planes ; somebody will operate them ; somebody will sell the tickets ; somebody will provide the accommodation - like any tourism . "
The first tickets will retail in the region of 150,000 - 200,000 euros ( £ 115,000 - 160,000 ) .
Mr Laine was speaking in London at the Institution of Engineering and Technology , where he was delivering the 99th Kelvin Lecture .
Astrium does not intend to run a space tourism marketing operation itself .
Rather , it intends simply to supply vehicles to those who will .
And although production numbers will not be in the same league as , say , Airbus or Boeing , they will be significant nonetheless .
Mr Laine said development of Astrium 's rocket plane was proceeding apace .
Big companies and small are entering a new marketplace
In pictures
Wind tunnel testing has proven the aerodynamic shape ; and the vehicle 's Romeo rocket engine which will take the plane above 100 km has been ignited for burns that have run up to 31 seconds .
The engine will be using the combustion of a liquid oxygen - methane propellant to provide the more than 1 km /s punch needed to break through the top of the Earth 's atmosphere .
About 50 % of the mass of the plane at take - off would be fuel .
The intention is to produce a vehicle that seats five individuals - one pilot and four passengers .
The production model will use normal jet engines to take off and climb to 12km .
From there , the rocket engine will kick the vehicle straight up , taking it beyond 60 km in just 80 seconds .
By the time the rocket shuts down , the craft should have sufficient velocity to carry it above 100 km - into space .
As the plane then begins to fall back to Earth , the pilot will use small thrusters to control its attitude , keeping the plane 's belly flat to the Earth .
" If you enter with the belly flat down then you expose a very large radius to the aerodynamic flux and that contains the temperature to an acceptable limit , " explained Mr Laine .
" We calculate the temperature will be less than 100C on the surface of the wings . "
When the plane slows to subsonic speed in the atmosphere , it will use its jet engines again to return to the airport .
The engine will burn a mixture of liquid oxygen and methane
The total journey time will be about one - and - a - half hours .
Mr Laine said the planes would have about a 10 - year lifetime .
They would be designed for ease of maintenance , with an operational schedule of one flight per week .
Although the rocket planes could take off and land from any airport , Astrium believes it is likely that special spaceports - possibly 10 worldwide - will operate in a few , restricted locations .
Northern Europe probably would not host one of these , Mr Laine speculated , because of the high density of other air traffic and because cloud would too frequently obscure the view of Earth .
" In Europe , I 'd say the most likely location is around the Mediterranean .
Why ?
Because there are blue skies most of the time , and because from 100 km you can see mountains , the sea and the coast . "
Cheaper space
The Astrium CTO acknowledged that Virgin Group boss Sir Richard Branson would be first into the market with rocket planes based on the award - winning and record - breaking SpaceShipOne concept .
But Mr Laine was confident an Astrium - fed business would be second , with a commercial service that began exactly five years after the agreement of a one - billion - euro financing deal .
He even hoped Sir Richard would be an Astrium customer - just as his airline business is a customer of the EADS Airbus division .
The CTO would not say how soon the initial financing would be in place , or reveal details about the identities of parties that were in discussion .
It is accepted that Sir Richard Branson will be first in
Enlarge Image
Long - term , Mr Laine said , space tourism had a major role to play in reducing the overall cost of space access .
He sees rocket planes being used for homeland security purposes as " quick satellites " ; and as forerunners of superfast intercontinental passenger transporters .
" Today we do n't know how to go to space cheaply .
Being able to climb on a regular basis to 100 km will give us the motivation to develop the plane that goes , not just up and down to the same place , but from here to the other side of the Earth .
" When the Ariane 5 takes off , 15 minutes later it is over Europe ; and 45 minutes later it is over the Pacific .
The fastest way is to go outside the atmosphere and that will be the future . "

Boy dies in hospital
According to KOMO - TV , the ABC affiliate in Seattle , Washington , 10 - year - old Codey Porter died at 3:35 p.m PST today .
The boy was hospitalized on Saturday after suffering respiratory failure when he was buried , headfirst , in a sandbox .
He had reportedly asked his playmates to bury him in order to recreate the attacks used by the fictional ninja from the Naruto anime 's fictional Village Hidden in the Sand .
Porter had been resuscitated with CPR and taken to an Everett hospital and later transferred to the Children 's Hospital in Seattle where he died .
A memorial fund has been set up for Porter on the Gold Creek Community Church 's Web site .
Well , what do you know .
What was $ 79 just a few minutes ago is now just $ 49 .
Making room for something new are we Apple ?
Still no change to iPod touch and iPhone pricing but we 'll keep an eye out .
Update : Apple store offline .
Picture of all the discounted shuffles after the break .
Update 2 : Store back online with new 2 GB shuffle for just $ 69 -- available later this month .

Everywhere we look , we see more higher - level , almost cognitive functions being incorporated into low - level products .
Cameras are internalizing much of the craft of photography .
GPS systems are comparing notes with their peers to provide up to the minute routing choices .
Cars tune themselves on the fly , adjusting carburetion and suspension in real time to respond to driving style .
Systems are becoming autonomous , competition is moving from commodity functions to service , and markets are starting to turn around interactions and integration .
Yesterday ’s Wall Street Journal ( see link below ) described FotoNation and the software that it provides for many brands of digital cameras .
I knew about anti-red - eye electronics .
I thought it was a neat trick for the camera to automatically focus on faces in the foreground rather than the between them in the center of the view .
I was amused at the camera that would alert the picture taker that someone blinked .
The camera that delayed the shutter until everyone was smiling was pretty neat .
The ability of a camera to recognize particular faces in the crowd , and make sure that they , if no one else are in focus was different from the rest .
Simply take several pictures of your family and friends , and notify the camera .
Thereafter if six mothers , standing in the same place each snap a picture at the third grade play , the six cameras will make different decisions and each mother will find her own little Billy in perfect focus .
We now have consumer electronics with complex learning behavior that it applies to its canned pattern recognition tricks .
This is customization far beyond the last generation of , say , a car remembering driver preferences for mirror , steering wheel , and seat .
Consumer systems now cover for the amateurish efforts of their operators to produce first class results .
Harried amateur photographers get assistance to achieve professional results .
Drivers can get performance out of their cars that previously would have required long practice .
Trip planning now acquired the knowledge of a local and an instant awareness of traffic conditions .
Building systems face the same issues and are moving in the same direction .
Not only are they often operated by amateurs , but the may be maintained by the insufficiently trained — following their installation by the low bidder .
Traditionally , systems have been oversized and over - built , to cover these predictable problems .
This leaves a lot of energy and operating dollars on the table .
The best systems will move instead to make their systems resilient , as are the camera and the car , and self operating .
This will change the tasks asked of control systems , and how they are integrated .
Self tuning systems do not need to share low - level details with those far away .
Low level protocols will be confined inside autonomous systems , and only higher - level services exposed .
These interfaces will be the basis for next generation integration .
Systems will use these newer interfaces to negotiate service provisioning with each other .
Although each system should work alone , they should be able to discover resources that each other makes available .
Imagine systems advertising their waste heat as a resource , and then the heat source broadcasting when it needs to shut down .
These interfaces will be developed as agents ; they know their missions , they defend their missions , they act independently .
Integration will come to assume autonomy , for the new interactions will rely on each system doing what it says , and meeting its contracts .
Contract - based integration will increase the value of cognitive performance , as they become the only competitive edge in a world of commodity electronics and unpredictable installations .
And systems that expect to be told what to do , rather than simply meeting their contracts ?
Well , as now , no one will want to do business with such agents .
One CNN manager , who asked to remain anonymous , recently learned -- at 48 -- that she has Asperger 's syndrome , a form of autism .
Today she shares an inside view of life with the condition .
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
Recently , at 48 years of age , I was diagnosed with Asperger 's syndrome .
For most of my life , I knew that I was " other , " not quite like everyone else .
I searched for years for answers and found none , until an assignment at work required me to research autism .
During that research , I found in the lives of other people with Asperger 's threads of similarity that led to the diagnosis .
Although having the diagnosis has been cathartic , it does not change the " otherness . "
It only confirms it .
Unraveling the mystery CNN reports on the world impact and latest science concerning the developmental syndrome of autism in a global investigation .
All day Wednesday , April 2 see full schedule »
When I talk to people about this aspect of myself , they always want to know what it means to be an " Aspie , " as opposed to a " Neurotypical " ( NT ) .
Oh , dear , where to start . ...
The one thing people seem to know about Asperger 's , if they know anything at all , is the geek factor .
Bill Gates is rumored to be an Aspie .
We tend to have specialized interests , and we will talk about them , ad infinitum , whether you are interested or not .
Recognizing my tendency to soliloquize , I often choose silence , although perhaps not often enough .
Due to our extensive vocabularies and uninflected manner of speaking , we are called " little professors , " or arrogant .
What is Asperger's ?
Asperger 's syndrome is a developmental disorder that is part of the autism spectrum .
Symptoms include : Engaging in one - sided , long - winded conversations , without noticing if the listener is listening or trying to change the subject
Displaying unusual nonverbal communication , such as lack of eye contact , few facial expressions , or awkward body postures and gestures
Showing an intense obsession with one or two specific , narrow subjects , such as baseball statistics , train schedules , weather or snakes
Appearing not to understand , empathize with , or be sensitive to others ' feelings
Having a hard time " reading " other people or understanding humor
Speaking in a voice that is monotonous , rigid or unusually fast
Moving clumsily , with poor coordination
Having an odd posture or a rigid gait

I do n't quite understand small talk , and early in my adult life , solecisms were frequent .
At meetings , I launch into business without the expected social acknowledgments .
It 's not that I do n't care about people , I am just very focused on task .
Do you have to rehearse greeting people to reinforce that you should do it ?
I do .
I am lucky to have a very dear friend who savors my eccentricities .
She laughs , lovingly , about one particular evening at a restaurant .
Before she could get seated , I asked her what she knew about the golden ratio and began to spew everything I know about it .
I re-emphasize how lucky I am to have her as a friend , because this incident occurred long before I was diagnosed .
A misconception is that Aspies do not have a sense of humor .
It is true that we can be very literal , so we often miss the humor in everyday banter , but we can and do enjoy even subtle humor .
Our literal interpretations , however , can be problematic .
In first grade , whenever someone made a mess in the classroom , the teacher would ask a student to get the janitor .
The student would come back with Mr. Jones ( not really his name ) , who carried a broom and large folding dustpan .
When I was asked to get the janitor , I looked all over the school and reported back to the teacher that I could not find it .
After all , the person was Mr. Jones , so the janitor must be the object , right ?
I lack the ability to see emotion in most facial expressions .
I compensate for this deficiency by listening to the inflections in people 's voices and using logic to determine emotional context .
The words people choose , their movements , or even how quickly they exit a meeting can provide clues to emotion .
I also have intensified senses -- touch , taste , smell , sight , and sound -- so I am attuned to lights , noise , textures , and smells .
In a " busy " environment , I will eventually go into sensory overload and my mind will go blank .
When this happens , I have to " go away " mentally for a brief period to regain focus .
When I " return , " I have to piece together what occurred while I was " away . "
The additional mental processing I must do to function every day is fatiguing , and I do n't handle " ad hoc " very well .
Being asked to respond quickly in the midst of all this other processing is difficult , sometimes impossible .
I am so sensitive to touch that a tickle hurts me .
This is the hardest concept for most people to understand .
How can a tickle hurt ?
All I can tell you is that it does , so I avoid being touched except by those who have learned how to touch me .
Hugs are dispensed infrequently , but if I do hug someone , I resemble Frankenstein 's monster , arms extended to control contact .
When my dad ( who I suspect is an Aspie , too ) and I hug , we both have " the approach . "
We sometimes miss and have to re-approach a couple of times until a brief , awkward hug is achieved .
In school , other children noted my differences , and I was bullied ( and tickled into fits of despair ) for years .
Already needing extended periods of time alone , my response was to become even more of a loner .
Uh oh .
When you are weird , you are a joke .
When you are a loner , you frighten people .
It 's always the quiet ones .
...
I am married ( wow ! ) , and my brilliant husband is an absolute sweetheart .
I do n't know any other man who has the self - confidence to be pushed away ( sometimes sharply ) , both physically and mentally , as often as he has been .
He has been gentle and patient ( and , yes , frequently emotionally depleted ) as we both worked through my need for space , tendency to go so deep into my own world that the real world and everyone in it cease to exist , and sensitivity to touch during the 26 ( soon to be 27 ) years of our marriage .
I live with anxiety , because the world can be overwhelming and people have expectations that I always , sooner or later , fail to meet .
I cannot begin to tell you how many times I have been told that I am rude , inaccessible or cold , yet I have never purposely tried to harm anyone , nor do I mean to be , well , mean .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Autism
I could tell you so much more , but instead let me share one last insight .
Do n't pity me or try to cure or change me .
If you could live in my head for just one day , you might weep at how much beauty I perceive in the world with my exquisite senses .
I would not trade one small bit of that beauty , as overwhelming and powerful as it can be , for " normalcy . "
E-mail to a friend
The tips have been flowing in hot and heavy on this one , so we felt it only fair to pass along the latest rumblings in the world of GP2X to you .
We first got word that a new emulation monster could be coming from the GP2X community back in September , and if late breaking mockups and specification lists are to be believed , that system is indeed Pandora .
Notably , the product seen above is purported to feature a keyboard ( obviously ) , 4.3 - inch 800 x 480 resolution touchscreen and built - in WiFi ( 802.11b/g ) -- all inclusions that were previously mentioned -- along with an ARM Cortex A8 CPU , OpenGL ES 2.0 - compliant 3D hardware , dual SDHC expansion slots , TV output and USB connectivity .
Unfortunately , we know nothing more than that at the moment , as dates / pricing still remain a mystery , but if Pandora does prove to be more than a figment of someone 's imagination , we 're betting it 'll be worth the wait . :
Looks like the price is set at around $ 320 , while the release should happen in March or April .

The Uninsured Patient
Shiban Ganju
My pager beeped while I was standing in line in Starbucks .
I checked the message – it was the telephone number of the ICU .
I ordered my coffee and stepped aside to call .
The nurse informed me , that I was asked to consult on a 33 - year - old patient who had been admitted the night before .
He had uncontrolled diabetes and had vomited blood .
What is the hemoglobin ?
Thirteen .
Not bad .
Is he on any anticoagulants ?
No .
Any history of alcohol ?
No .
Any aspirin or ibuprofen ?
No .
I grabbed my grande and rushed to the hospital .
In my mind , I rearranged my schedule for the day and decided to start with this patient in the ICU .
I figured it will take me a few minutes , but I was not prepared for what I saw .
An oversize man lay sprawled on the bed from one side - rail to the other .
He looked bigger than his stated weight of 367 Lbs .
His gullet rattled behind the oxygen mask , as it croaked with each breath ; beads of sweat glistened on his balding scalp ; his huge flaccid limbs lay motionless .
His pale face announced impending death .
I glanced at the monitor : his heart galloped at 120 beats and his blood oxygen level touched a critically low number .
“ Get me a blood gas and call respiratory . ”
I sensed the danger .
In a few minutes , the blood gas result showed that his oxygen level and pH ( blood acid level ) were incompatible with life .
The respiratory team showed up and we inserted a tube into his trachea and connected him to a ventilator .
We injected sodium bicarbonate to neutralize excess acid in the blood and rushed in more intravenous fluids .
The numbers on the monitor showed improvement .
We sighed relief .
Now we had a small hiatus to recapitulate .
JD was a truck driver on a long haul and had become nauseous and dizzy driving on the highway , six hundred miles away from his home .
On seeing a hospital sign , he had got off the highway and staggered into the emergency room .
JD ’s life was succumbing to diabetic keto - acidosis , also called diabetic coma .
An untreated bronchitis had progressed to pneumonia , which had triggered this disaster .
He was now temporarily stable for me to inspect his stomach for bleeding .
I slipped a fiber - optic endoscope into his esophagus and advanced it into his stomach and duodenum .
Flecks of blackish curdled blood covered the stomach lining .
I searched every corner but could not find any fresh bleeding , which was good news , but it also made me uncomfortable because I did not know why he had bled .
I had expected to see small ulcers , but he had none .
I stopped the procedure and pulled out the ensdoscope .
I called the primary physician and updated her about JD and advised her to request pulmonary , endocrine and infectious disease specialists to see this patient .
We needed more help .
Before leaving , I enquired if JD had is family around .
I walked up to the waiting room .
Two ladies , with fear on their faces , approached me and introduced themselves as the mother and wife .
I explained to them in simple language about his serious condition .
This was the time to know his story .
How long did he have diabetes ?
Two years .
What medicines was he on ?
He was trying to control it by diet .
Is that what his family doctor had recommended ?
No , he had prescribed some pills but he never followed up .
Why not ?
He had no insurance - we have no insurance .
JD was a hard working honest man who was teetering at the edge of life because he could not afford health care insurance .
About eighty percent of all uninsured people belong to such working families .
Even middle class families find health insurance beyond their reach ; about 40 percent of uninsured have a household income of $ 50,00 or more .
His employer had dropped health insurance because he could not afford exorbitant insurance premiums .
I looked at my watch : we had been there for two hours , which meant I would spend rest of the day trying to catch up .
The accusative looks of the patients waiting in my office haunted me especially .
I decided to go to my outpatient office first and postpone my hospital rounds for the evening and I would just apologize for being tardy .
Close to the end of my office hours , I received a call from JD ’s nurse .
JD had again vomited blood and he had produced no urine since the morning ; his hemoglobin had dropped to 8 grams suggesting serious blood loss and his kidneys were failing .
I asked the nurse to transfuse two units of blood , get a kidney specialist to see JD and get ready for a repeat endoscopy .
I hurried my last patients out of the office and rushed back to the ICU .
I reinserted the endoscope into JD ’s stomach .
It looked completely different .
Dark red blood had filled the stomach .
Again , I searched for the bleeding spot and could not find it .
In frustration , I decided to pull the endoscope out , when a slightly brighter shade of red caught my eye ; the blood in the upper part of the stomach looked fresher than the rest of the stomach .
This was my last chance .
I pumped in more air to distend the stomach and we tilted JD to move the blood out of the upper stomach .
And there it was : a miniscule of a nipple , one millimeter of a blood vessel squirting fresh blood with each heart beat .
I had to stop the bleeder or JD would bleed to death .
Give me epinephrine .
I injected epinephrine into the bleeder .
It still squirted .
Give me a clip .
I attempted to staple the bleeder with a metal clip but my clip missed the constantly moving target .
Give me one more clip .
Second try failed .
Give me one more .
Bingo !
I got it !
The clip strangled the nipple in its jaws .
The bleeding halted instantly .
I checked his chart ; all the consultants had seen JD and initiated intensive management .
I talked to the family again and finally went to complete my hospital rounds , about ten hours late .
I would again be apologetic to the waiting patients .
If JD could have afforded it , he would have seen a primary care doctor and controlled his diabetes .
If JD had cared , he would have not grown to a mammoth size ; his callous eating behavior and the inefficient health system had landed him in this intensive expensive care , which could have been avoided by spending much less on prevention .
Between 2000 and 2005 the average annual increase in insurance premiums for small companies was 12 percent compared to 2.5 percent inflation rate .
About 266,000 companies , mostly with less than 25 employees , cancelled their health insurance between 2000 - 2005 .
Even when employers offer insurance , high deductible and co-payments become prohibitive for some employees .
The percentage of employed people with insurance has decreased from 70 percent in 1987to 59.5 percent in 2005 .
JD and unfortunate people like him cost $ 100 billon annually to the health care system , out of which hospitals provide $ 34 billon worth in inpatient care for which they are not compensated .
They shift the costs to paying patients to stay solvent .
Uninsured people spend about $ 26 billion out of pocket and rely on emergency departments .
The uninsured have up to 50 % more chance of being hospitalized and have higher chances of dying early .
Experts have estimated that the number of excess deaths among uninsured between the ages of 25 - 64 is about 18,000 a year .
Unfortunately , the political debate in health care hovers around one question : how do we provide health insurance to all ?
This politically popular question misses the point .
The correct question should be : how can we make health care affordable ?
Unless we ask the right question we will not get the right answer .
As long as health care is expensive , health insurance will be unaffordable .
Various studies tell us that 164,000 to 300,000 people loose employer paid health insurance if the premium increases just by 1 % .
The right reform will have to answer the question of cost or the reform is unlikely to succeed .
Spending more money is not the answer .
Health care expenditure increased from $ 1.4 trillion in 2000 to $ 2.1 trillion dollars in 2007 , yet in the same time about 8 million more people lost their health insurance .
A universal health care coverage without cost control is unlikely to succeed .
Recent failure to provide universal coverage in California proves this point .
We are in a crisis , but we do not want to debate the costs because the answers will be unpopular .
Yet , amidst all its inefficiency the American health system does succeed .
JD recovered almost completely in three weeks and went home - exhausted and a few pounds less .
Studies have shown that among the industrialized nations , the US health care is the most expensive but also most likely to deliver the ‘ right care ’ .
The US health care triumphs , when it delivers .
Epilogue : About six months later I received a card from JD and his wife .
The hand written cursive note in blue ink thanked me for my services .
JD was unable to work for five months but had been rehired a month back .
His wife had picked a second job in housekeeping in an office building .
They had applied for Medicaid but the state had rejected the application ; they were not poor enough .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush , marking five years since the Department of Homeland Security was created , said the United States was not safe from terrorists who were plotting another attack as he spoke .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
Bush , who is battling Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives over eavesdropping legislation , has been accused over the years by critics of using scare tactics for political advantage .
In a speech before Homeland Security Department employees , Bush said it was important that Americans remember “ some serious lessons on September the 11th , ” and that U.S. security agencies must take the words of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden “ very seriously ” when he says operations are in preparation .
“ At this moment , somewhere in the world , a terrorist is planning an attack on us .
I know that ’s inconvenient thought for some , but it is the truth , ” Bush said .
Bush and House Democratic leaders have locked horns over legislation that would grant immunity from lawsuits to private firms that helped the United States monitor communications of terrorism suspects in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks .
The Senate passed legislation including the blanket , retroactive immunity that Bush wants , but House Democratic leaders have not brought that bill for a vote .
House Democrats have sought more information about the activities already undertaken by telephone companies at the request of the Bush administration .
Many Democrats in Congress argue the courts should decide whether companies violated the law , instead of Congress shielding them from potentially billions of dollars in civil damages from lawsuits .
“ We are still working very hard to see if we can come to agreement , ” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , a California Democrat .
“ But we ’re not going to abandon the Constitution of the United States . ”
She said Bush has authorities needed under current laws .
Bush is pressing the House to approve the Senate bill and get it to him by Saturday to sign into law .
He said U.S. spy agencies cannot eavesdrop on terrorism suspects without the help of private companies .
“ To stop new attacks on America we need to know who the terrorists are talking to , what they ’re saying , and what they ’re planning , ” he said .
“ We can not get this vital information without the cooperation of private companies . ”
New Turn in Probe Investigation Casts Doubt on Arson in Deadly German Fire
New evidence emerging in the investigation of last weekend 's deadly fire in Ludwigshafen , Germany , that left 9 people of Turkish origin dead -- all women and children -- and left 60 injured is casting serious doubt on theories that it may have been a xenophobic arson attack .
It is really taking shape .
The future of Virgin Galactic ’s fleet of space tourism rockets is currently forming in a non-descript factory in the Mojave Desert , California .
As if to prove that the Scaled Composite - design is not a pipe dream , pictures of the first commercial spaceflight vehicle have been released .
It looks fairly crude and welded together , but this forms the bare bones of the worlds first viable hi-tech space tourism vehicle .
All it needs now are some windows , seats , wings and an engine and we ’re good to go !
It is as if Scaled Composites wanted to trump their competitor ’s cards with proof that the SpaceShipTwo design is more than just a concept .
It seems that everyone is claiming a portion of the space tourism industry , including economy class .
Nancy covered XCOR ’s press release ( 26th March ) that the company was designing a smaller , cheaper , economy - class space plane , designed to take two people into low - Earth orbit ( note : lower Earth orbit than Virgin Galactic ’s design ) .
Even the rocket builder Astrium has gotten in on the act , claiming that there will be a market for their mass - produced conventional space plane ( 18th March ) , releasing some uber - cool images and simulations of the craft in action .
So the economy - class market has been claimed by XCOR and Astrium has grabbed the “ AirBus - in - space ” mass - production market .
But in the aim to prove that “ the original and the best ” concept is actually growing beyond the design phase and in full production , Scaled Composites are proving that their spaceship is one step closer than all their competitors : they ’re building their spaceship right now .
To rub it in , one photo shows Burt Rutan sitting proudly inside the shell of the SpaceShipTwo cockpit proving they are accelerating production toward a 2009 test - run .
These new images are from the production line in a factory in the Californian Mojave Desert .
SpaceShipTwo will carry six people into the lower limit of space and will experience a few minutes of weightlessness .
The craft will be helped on its way by the WhiteKnightTwo aircraft , giving the rocket a piggyback ride to 50,000 ft .
At this height , SpaceShipTwo will be released and its rockets will blast to life taking the first tourists into space .

The dollar has been hit by fears over the US economy
With any weak figures set to increase expectations of a further cut in US interest rates , the dollar had fallen to 107.75 yen in early trading .
Against the European single currency , one euro was worth $ 1.4876 , up from $ 1.4869 on Monday .
Reports say banking giant Citigroup could report $ 20 bn ( £ 10 bn ) of bad debt .
Recession fears
Citigroup will be the first major US bank to release its results for the last three months of 2007 , and its figures will give another snapshot of the banking sector 's exposure to the crisis in the US sub - prime mortgage sector .
Some reports suggest Citigroup could also announce job cuts of more than 20,000 .
" The numbers for write - downs and job cuts at Citi could heighten worries about banking sector problems and their impact on the economy , if confirmed , " said Kengo Suzuki , a currency strategist at Shinko Securities .
Investment bank Goldman Sachs has already predicted that the US economy will fall into recession in 2008 , and analysts are also nervously awaiting the release of retail sales data for December .
As consumer spending accounts for two - thirds of the US economy , the figure may indicate whether Goldman 's fears are correct .
In December , the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the third time in succession to 4.25 % , as it tried to help steer the world 's largest economy through the continuing housing slump and credit market woes .
Imagine the Book of All Species : a single volume made up of one - page descriptions of every species known to science .
On one page is the blue - footed booby .
On another , the Douglas fir .
Another , the oyster mushroom .
If you owned the Book of All Species , you would need quite a bookshelf to hold it .
Just to cover the 1.8 million known species , the book would have to be more than 300 feet long .
And you ’d have to be ready to expand the bookshelf strikingly , because scientists estimate there are 10 times more species waiting to be discovered .
It sounds surreal , and yet scientists are writing the Book of All Species .
Or to be more precise , they are building a Web site called the Encyclopedia of Life ( www.eol.org).
On Thursday its authors , an international team of scientists , will introduce the first 30,000 pages , and within a decade , they predict , they will have the other 1.77 million .
While many of those pages may be sparse at first , the authors hope that the world ’s scientific community will pool all of its knowledge on the pages .
Unlike a page of paper , a page of the Encyclopedia of Life can hold as much information as scientists can upload .
“ It ’s going to have everything known on it , and everything new is going to be added as we go along , ” said Edward O. Wilson , the Harvard biologist who spearheaded the Encyclopedia of Life and now serves as its honorary chairman .
Other experts not involved in the project hail it as tremendously promising .
“ I certainly think it is a great idea , ” said Jody Hey , a biologist at Rutgers University .
Tiny black holes could offer a richer view of physics than their better known , moremassive relations , as Aurélien Barrau and Julien Grain explain .
Unification is the dream of high - energy physicists .
Attaining this conceptual – and actual – convergence undoubtedly constitutes the fundamental challenge in the search for elementary objects and interactions .
There have been many suCCEesses in this area .
If , however , it sometimes looks as if the main pieces of the puzzle have yet to be put together , it is because the opportunities nature gives us to attain an all encompassing and global view of the most disparate properties – described by the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics – are extremely rare .
Geodesics in Kerr space - time , as predicted by the theory of general relativity .
Small black holes produced , for example at colliders , are expected to be spinning .

The early universe is often considered to be the only instance of a situation in which quantum and gravitational processes are equally important .
However , black holes with small masses could also provide insight into these unusual conditions and would certainly constitute , if they exist , the only objects in today ’s cosmos where such extreme physical processes can oCCEur .
Even if it remains speculative , the search for small black holes is certainly warranted , especially since many models predict their existence in fundamentally different frameworks and contexts .
From the astrophysics point of view , it is thought that only massive black holes – with masses several times that of the Sun – are possible , as they are the only ones able to form in the final stages of stellar evolution .
Although they have many fascinating properties , these large black holes are not as rich as their smaller cousins could be .
The lighter the black hole the greater its surface gravity – and the more interesting the associated physical effects .
This is simply due to the fact that Newton ’s gravitational force is linearly dependent on mass but quadratically dependent on the inverse distance ( which is itself proportional to the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole ) .
In particular , the phenomenon of Hawking evaporation is significant only in the case of small black holes : the tidal effect becomes so great near the surface that the particle pairs produced by quantum vacuum fluctuations may be broken , one particle falling into the black hole and the other being projected outwards .
This process has yet to be observed , precisely because astrophysical black holes are too massive and therefore too cold , but it is certainly one of the most important predictions of quantum field theory in curved space - time .
Contrary to the usual ideas of general relativity , black holes are capable of emitting particles .
They can even be very hot and very bright if their mass is sufficiently small .
Indeed , the principles of thermodynamics apply to black holes , the essential variables being temperature , entropy and internal energy , as opposed to surface gravity , area and mass in the case of general relativity .
Where can we find mini black holes ?
The absence of notable excesses of particles in cosmic radiation – especially in the form of antiprotons or gamma rays – compared with the fluxes expected in a “ standard ” astrophysics context allows strict constraints to be placed on the density of black holes evaporating in today ’s universe .
In particular , it can be deduced that their contribution to the total mass of the universe is today no higher than one ten millionth .
As these small black holes are likely to have been produced in the early cosmos thanks to the fluctuations in density present at that time – and with masses that were arbitrarily low – it is possible to obtain vital information about the universe ’s degree of inhomogeneity shortly after the period of inflation .
This route of investigation is all the more remarkable in that the relevant scales for the black holes of the early universe are completely beyond the usual observables of cosmology , namely the 3 K background radiation and large - scale structure .
There is therefore a genuine complementarity between these approaches .
Many cosmological scenarios – involving phase transitions , the breaking of scale invariance , blue power spectra , positive running of the spectral index of scale fluctuations , phases of double inflation , topological defects , collisions of bubbles of “ real ” vacuum in a background of “ false ” vacuum and softening of the equation of state – may be excluded or severely constrained by the study of small black holes .

In addition to these astrophysical and cosmological aspects , there is another route of investigation that is particularly promising for microscopic black holes , namely at particle accelerators .
In response to the persistent problem of hierarchy – why is the Planck scale 16 orders of magnitude higher than the electroweak scale ?
– a hypothesis put forward a few years ago offers a neat and efficient lead : the existence of large extra dimensions .
The novelty of this idea lies in the fact that it is no longer necessary to assume that these dimensions are of sizes close to the Planck length ( ~10-33 cm ) .
Rather , they can be as large as around a millimetre if we suppose that the fields of matter live in the 3+1 dimensional hypersurface of our 3 - brane and that only gravity can benefit from new dimensions .
The constraints ( ~10 - 16 cm ) usually derived via the interactions of gauge bosons in extra dimensions can therefore be ignored and only experiments involving the direct measurement of Newtonian gravity put limits on the size of extra dimensions to a value of less than a few tenths of a millimetre .
Using such an approach , the traditional Planck energy , E PI ~ 1019GeV , is no more than an effective scale and the real D - dimensional fundamental Planck scale is given by E D = ( E PI 2 / V D - 4 ) 1 / ( D - 2 ) , where V D - 4 is the volume associated with the D - 4 extra dimensions .
For D=10 and radii associated with the extra dimensions of the Fermi scale , we obtain E D ~TeV .
If this model has any meaning , it is effectively a natural choice ( and not an arbitrary one based on phenomenological motivations ) because it essentially resolves the problem of hierarchy .
This approach uses the geometrical properties of space to link completely different energy scales .
A spectacular consequence of such a model is the possibility of being able to produce black holes with the next generation of particle colliders .
If the centre - of - mass energy of two elementary particles is indeed higher than the Planck scale E D , and their impact parameter b is lower than the Schwarzschild radius R H , a black hole must be produced .
If the Planck scale is thus in the TeV range , the 14 TeV centre - of - mass energy of the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) could allow it to become a black - hole factory with a production rate as high as about one per second .
Many studies are underway to make a precise evaluation of the cross-section for the creation of black holes via parton collisions , but it appears that the naive geometric approximation σ~ πR2 H is quite reasonable for setting the orders of magnitude .
The temperature of a black hole as a function of its mass for different numbers of extra dimensions .
The possible presence of extra dimensions would be doubly beneficial for the production of black holes .
The key point is that it allows the Planck scale to be reduced to accessible values , but it also allows the Schwarzschild radius to be significantly increased , thus making the condition b<R H distinctly easier to satisfy .
It is important to note that the resulting mini black holes have radii that are much smaller ( of the order of 10 - 4 fm in the case of those that can be expected from the LHC ) than the size of extra dimensions , and that they can therefore be considered as totally immersed in a D - dimensional space , which has , to a good approximation , a time dimension and D - 1 non-compact space dimensions .
The black hole thus acts like a quasi - selective source of S waves and sees our brane in the same way as the “ bulk ” associated with the extra dimensions .
As the particles residing in the brane greatly outnumber those living in the bulk ( essentially gravitons ) , the black hole evaporates into particles of the Standard Model .
Its lifetime is very short ( of the order of 10 - 26s ) and its temperature ( typically about 100 GeV here ) is much lower than it would be with the same mass in a four - dimensional space .
The black hole nevertheless retains its characteristic spectrum in the form of a quasi - thermal law peaked around its temperature .
From the point of view of detection , it is not too difficult to find a signature for such events : they have a high multiplicity , a large transverse energy , a “ democratic ” coupling to all particles and a rapid increase in the production cross-section with energy .
Particle physics and mini black holes
A simulation of the evaporation of a black hole in the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider .
At first glance the production of black holes in colliders could be bad news .
It could mean the end of particle physics since the presence of a horizon would obscure all the microphysics processes that could occur behind it .
However , it would in fact open up very good opportunities .
First of all the reconstruction of temperature ( determined by the energy spectrum of the particles emitted when the black hole evaporates ) as a function of mass ( determined by the total energy deposited ) allows information to be gained about the dimensionality of space - time .
In the case of Planck scales close to the TeV mark , the number of extra dimensions could thus be revealed quite easily by the characteristics of the emitted particles .
However , one can go further .
In particular , quantum gravity effects could be revealed , as behaviour during evaporation in the Planck region is sensitive to the details of the gravitational theory used .
Approaches of the Gauss - Bonnet type , which include quadratic terms in scalar curvature in the Lagrangian , are good candidates for a description beyond general relativity as they can be supported both by theoretical arguments ( heterotic strings in particular ) and by phenomenological arguments ( Taylor expansion in curvature ) .
In such a case , the coupling constant of the Gauss - Bonnet term , namely the quantum character of the gravitational theory used ( and the link with the underlying string theory ) can also be reconstructed and the LHC would become a very valuable tool for studying speculative gravitation models .
Other promising avenues are also being investigated for new physics .
Firstly , the black holes formed may be excellent intermediate states for highlighting new particles .
When the collision energy is higher than the Planck scale E D , the cross-section for the creation of black holes is quite large ( ~500 pbarn ) and has no suppression factor .
Moreover , when the temperature of the black hole is higher than the mass of a particle , the particle must be emitted during evaporation in proportion to its number of internal degrees of freedom .
There is thus a definite potential for the search for the Higgs or for supersymmetric particles in the evaporation products of black holes , possibly with cross-sections much greater than for the direct processes .
Finally , taking account of a D - dimensional cosmological constant also modifies the evaporation law .
If the constant is sufficiently high – which is possible without contradicting the low value measured in our brane – the temperature and the coupling coefficients with the entities emitted could be the signature of this particular structure of space - time .
It would be quite neat and certainly surprising that a measurement of the cosmological constant in the bulk should come from the LHC !
Microscopic black holes are thus a paradigm for convergence .
At the intersection of astrophysics and particle physics , cosmology and field theory , quantum mechanics and general relativity , they open up new fields of investigation and could constitute an invaluable pathway towards the joint study of gravitation and high - energy physics .
Their possible absence already provides much information about the early universe ; their detection would constitute a major advance .
The potential existence of extra dimensions opens up new avenues for the production of black holes in colliders , which would become , de facto , even more fascinating tools for penetrating the mysteries of the fundamental structure of nature .
Postscript
It should be stated , in conclusion , that these black holes are not dangerous and do not threaten to swallow up our already much - abused planet .
The theoretical arguments and the obvious harmlessness of any black holes that , according to these models , would have to be formed from the interaction of cosmic rays with celestial bodies , mean that we can regard them with perfect equanimity .

An inside look at how Fox News ‘ reports ’ the ‘ news ’
Yesterday afternoon , Fox News , which rarely breaks stories of its own , seemed to have a juicy campaign scoop — James Carville and Paul Begala , architects of Bill Clinton ’s campaign victories , were leaving their jobs at CNN to help turn around Hillary Clinton ’s presidential campaign .
We ’d heard quite a bit lately about a significant staff shake - up , and this would be quite a development .
Except , of course , it was n’t true at all .
Fox News ran the report without even asking Carville and Begala for comment , and both were quick to set the record straight .
Carville told Greg Sargent , for example , “ Fox was , is and will continue to be an asinine and ignorant network . ”
Shortly thereafter , Begala was equally emphatic .
This is n’t one of those gray - area stories where ’s there ’s a kernel of truth that ends up exaggerated .
In other words , let ’s say Carville and Begala hosted an informal strategy chat with Hillary and some of her top aides about how to proceed after New Hampshire .
Fox News heard about a meeting , extrapolated , and then exaggerated .
But that ’s just it — there was no meeting , there were no discussions , Carville and Begala have n’t had any connection to the Clinton campaign at all .
Fox News ’ scoop was bogus .
Today , Begala has a fascinating take on his efforts to correct the record , and Fox News ’ reluctance to embrace the journalistic standards of a junior high - school newspaper .
Fox News never even tried to contact me to verify their story , and when I contacted Fox , I felt like a character in a Kafka novel — or at least Curb Your Enthusiasm .
Fox ’s Major Garrett — a good guy whom I ’ve known for years — broke the story .
My phone started ringing off the hook , and my email box bulged .
There are still , thank goodness , a lot of real journalists out there .
Tim Russert was first .
I assured him it was n’t true , he thanked me for waving him off a false story , and that was that .
Then my own network , CNN , called .
I told them if I were quitting CNN that CNN would know before Fox News .
Soon after , others called or emailed : Jonathan Alter of Newsweek , George Stephanopoulos and Teddy Davis of ABC , Beth Fouhy of AP , Mark Halperin of Time , John Harris of the Politico , Jill Lawrence of USA Today , Peter Baker of the Washington Post , Patrick Healy of the New York Times , David Gregory of NBC and Bill Sammon of the Examiner .
There were probably more .
I list the names only to give credit to journalists who behaved like reporters , not repeaters .
After I told Fox it was n’t true — and this is the surreal part — they kept reporting it anyway .
In fact , Fox ’s Garrett told me he ’d “ take it under advisement . ”
Take it under advisement ?
Generally , professional journalists do n’t take the truth “ under advisement ” ; they take it to their audience .
The good news is , Fox News altered its story after Begala pushed back .
The bad news is , the Republican network made it worse .
I realize I ’m generally seen as just another liberal with an opinion , but this was not a matter of opinion , it was a matter of fact .
Fox now knew their story was flatly , factually wrong , and they took it “ under advisement . ”
Apparently that meant repeating the falsehood with added detail : the “ fact ” that I had been on a conference call the previous day with the Hillary high command .
Again , false .
My worry is that if this is what one of Fox ’s best and most respected reporters is doing , what are the hacks up to ?
Good question .
The answer , I ’m afraid , is that no one who works at Fox News should be “ respected ” as a “ reporter ” at all .
If they care about their credibility , they would n’t work at a propaganda outlet .
Begala posted the entire email exchange with Fox ’s Major Garrett .
Fascinating stuff .
Like it or not , competence could be back
Hillary Clinton is cold .
And I am not talking just ordinary cold like Mike Dukakis , the man who could eat one potato chip , or John Kerry , who once joked that he was going into the hospital to have his " aloof gland " removed .
Advertisement
I am talking real cold .
According to a recent article in The Wall Street Journal , Hillary " has to prove she has normal human warmth . "
As a recent article in Slate stated , " Clinton can be easily portrayed as cold , calculating and ruthless , and that 's not a problem that can be easily fixed . "
In the past , this has been no small matter .
I have written a great deal about the importance of likability in presidential elections and how , from Ronald Reagan on , the more likable candidate has always won .
But like generals fighting the last war , I wonder if we pundits might be overlooking something this time .
Something like two terms of George W. Bush and the limits of likability .
Bush was sold to the American people in large part on the basis of his affability , his warmth and how he would be " a uniter , not a divider . "
He was running against Al Gore , and Al Gore was , as the press wrote endlessly , an unfeeling technocrat who was " not comfortable in his own skin . "
For a book I was doing , I went down to Austin , Texas , in 2000 to interview Bush 's campaign staff .
And likability was very much on their minds .
" People view Bush as real , authentic , funny , " Ari Fleischer , his spokesman , told me .
In private Bush focus groups , the words that people associated with Gore were " alpha male , " " disconnect " and " attack dog . "
The words associated with Bush were " optimistic , " " cheery , " " bold " and " likable . "
There were some problems .
Under Bush , Texas ranked near the bottom of the 50 states in access to health care and cleaning up pollution .
But in a poll asking , " Which candidate would you rather have a beer with , " Bush won hands down .
None of which was shocking .
The only thing that shocked me was when I asked a top Bush aide :
What do the American people think of when they think of Bush 's qualifications for president ?
" Adequacy , " the aide told me .
" Americans want a strong , sensible person with convictions that wo n't change , not a guy who has plans to colonize Mars . "
Another Bush aide told me the entire purpose of the campaign was to show that Bush could clear the minimal " bar of competency , " and after that the voters would be won over by his affability and warmth .
Four years later , with Bush up for reelection , not much had changed .
Andrew Stern , the president of the Service Employees International Union , said : " To become president in this era , you have to go to a bar or a bowling alley or a diner and have people feel you belong there .
The question is , can you hang out with them ? "
America wanted likable , and it got likable .
It also got the Iraq war , the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the scandal at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center .
So maybe likable has its limits .
In a way , Hillary , as her campaign officially refers to her , is helped by bad reviews and low expectations as to her likability .
If you go into the crowds after her speeches , you often find people who say she is far warmer than they expected .
Some people are surprised she does n't stand onstage and bite the heads off chickens .
On her announcement tour in Iowa in January , she told an overflow crowd in Des Moines , " I am here to have a one - on - one conversation -- you , me and several hundred members of the national press . "
Everybody laughed .
In another speech on the same trip , she said , " I grew up outside Chicago .
I come from a family of fanatic Bears fans .
I went off to college and met this guy from Arkansas . "
Everybody went , " Aww . "
True , warmth is not Hillary 's dominant theme .
She has an applause line that can only be described as unique : " It is hard to get an insurance company to pay for a visit to a podiatrist , but they will pay to have your foot amputated ! "
That line always brings down the house .
And not because amputation is a particularly warm or affable topic .
It is because people are furious with the health care system in America , even more furious with the empty promises made by politicians every four years and may be looking for somebody who understands their anger and is willing and able to do something about it .
Voters in a post - Bush election actually may be looking for someone who is competent .
Hillary is not alone in stressing competence .
Barack Obama does not stress warmth and fuzziness in his speeches , but issues and inspiration .
On the Republican side , both Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani stress how they are men of accomplishment .
And when former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich attacks Bush , which he has been doing with increasing frequency lately , he goes to the heart of the competency issue .
" The government is not functioning , " Gingrich said a few weeks ago .
" It 's not getting the job done .
Republicans need to confront this reality . "
So perhaps the election of 2008 will be a post- likability , post - warmth , post - have - a - beer - and - hang - out election .
Then again , maybe not .
Maybe we have n't grown up that much .
The choice is ours .
Because , as Adlai Stevenson once said , " Your public servants serve you right . "

WASHINGTON , Aug. 8 — There are times in the life of George Herbert Walker Bush , the 41st president of the United States and father of the 43rd , that people , perfect strangers , come up to him and say the harshest things — words intended to comfort but words that wind up only causing pain .
“ I love you , sir , but your son ’s way off base here , ” they might say , according to Ron Kaufman , a longtime adviser to Mr. Bush , who has witnessed any number of such encounters — perhaps at a political fund - raiser , or a restaurant dinner , a chance meeting on the streets of Houston or Kennebunkport , Me .
They are , he says , just one way the presidency of the son has taken a toll on the father .
“ It wears on his heart , ” Mr. Kaufman said , “ and his soul . ”
These are distressing days for the Bush family patriarch , only the second former president in American history , after John Adams , to see his son take the White House .
At 83 , he finds it tough to watch his son get criticized from the sidelines ; often , he likens himself to a Little League father whose kid is having a rough game .
And like the proud and angry Little League dad who cannot help but yell at the umpire , sometimes he just cannot help getting involved .
The official line from the White House is that 41 , as he is known in Bush circles , gives advice to 43 only when asked .
But interviews with a broad range of people close to both presidents — including family members like the elder Mr. Bush ’s daughter , Doro Bush Koch , and aides who have worked for both men , like Andrew H. Card Jr. — suggest a far more complicated father - son dynamic , in which the former president is not nearly so distant as the White House would have people believe .
FEBRUARY
14 -- The California man convicted of sending threatening letters containing a white powder to public figures like David Letterman and Jon Stewart has been sentenced to probation and ordered to check into a halfway house , where he will be required to take medications recommended by doctors .
Chad Castagana , 40 , will remain in the Gateways Community Corrections Center for as long as staff at the Los Angeles facility deem appropriate , though his stay there cannot exceed his five - year probationary term , according to the below U.S. District Court order .
Castagana was also ordered not to contact any of the six recipients of his mailed threats .
Castagana , who has described himself as a ' compulsive ' Republican voter , was convicted at trial last year of mailing threatening letters in 2006 to celebrities and politicians he considered too liberal ( other recipients were Rep. Nancy Pelosi , MSNBC host Keith Olbermann , and Viacom boss Sumner Redstone ) .
The powder in the Castagana letters -- some of which you 'll find here -- was either baking soda or detergents , which apparently was meant to mimic anthrax .
Castagana was sentenced after his examination by a court - appointed psychiatrist , Dr. Saul Faerstein , whose report was not included in public court records .

Since its launch in 2001 , the Transportation Security Agency has attracted the ire of the Internet like no other government agency .
I think it 's probably safe to say that everyone who types stuff into a form of some sort and presses a " Post " or " Publish " button — and this covers not just forum posters and bloggers but the whole spectrum of new media — has had something to say about the TSA at some point in their writing career .
I myself indulge frequently ( see this post ) , and as near as I can tell from the feedback I get , the audience for anti-TSA ranting grows by an order of magnitude with each new travel inconvenience that the agency imposes .
But the TSA is no longer going to take the flames lying down .
The agency has decided to take the PR fight to the enemy by launching its own blog called " Evolution of Security . "
The blog 's tag - line is " Terrorists evolve .
Threats evolve .
Security must stay ahead .
You play a part . "
I personally hate the name and the tagline , since I believe that threats , terrorists , and security were all created in their present form about 10,000 years ago ... though I guess it is possible that terrorists can micro-evolve while still remaining terrorists .
The blog 's first post has 131 comments so far , almost all of which fall into one of two categories : TSA employees who got the internal memo about the blog launch and dropped by to post positive things , and citizens who are really mad about the liquids screening policy .
My suspicion is that this post is probably indicative of the kinds of comments that we 'll see on the blog from here on out — " Evolution of Security " will be a place where TSA employees hear from irate travelers about the same three or four issues , over and over and over again , no matter what the original post topic .
It 's also possible that this is exactly the point of the blog ; it could be a kind of Internet safety valve where the TSA 's critics can go to vent .
I suggest that this may be the case because the site 's very short blogroll includes links to a number of sites that are extremely critical of the agency 's policies .
Bruce Schneier , for instance , gets a shoutout , despite the fact that he's the Internet 's number one critic of the TSA 's " security theater " approach to defending the skies .
I suppose it 's possible that this " flypaper strategy " — i.e. , we 'll fight all our critics here on this blog so that we do n't have to fight them elsewhere — makes more sense on the Internet than it does in the war on terror , but I 'm not seeing it .
Or maybe the TSA really does just want to hear what we all have to say about security , so that they can take our feedback into account ... okay , I 'm sorry , I can't suggest that with a straight face .
Never Forget
Let me welcome the TSA to the world of blogging by throwing a question their way and seeing if they reply .
After all , you 're not really a blogger if you 're not mixing it up with other bloggers in the fast - paced game of snark and counter - snark .
So here 's my question :
My experience in airport security line conversations over the years is that everyone who takes a moment to turn three or four neurons ' worth of attention to the much - hated liquids policy comes to exactly the same conclusion : if it takes , say , 20 ounces of bomb juice to blow up an airplane , then you can just send two terrorists with 10 ounces of bomb juice each on board , and they can combine their bomb juice to make a 20 - ounce bomb .
So why the seemingly idiotic limits on the amount of liquids in my carry - on bag ?
And why , if I 'm in the security line with a bottle of water or a cup of coffee , can't I just drink some of it to demonstrate that it is not , in fact , bomb juice ?
In an e-mail back - and - forth ( via Threat Level ) with Bruce Schneier , Kip Hawley , the head of the TSA and one of the agency 's new bloggers , ducked this question again and again with answers that amounted to a long - winded way of saying " Just trust us ; we know things that you do n't about chemical bombs . "
But handwaving about how you can't go into specifics is a copout , because presumably bomb - making terrorist already know the specifics .
So the only folks you 're keeping in the dark are frustrated travelers who just want to why their common - sense take on this scenario is so wrong .
So I would like to put this same question to Mr. Hawley again , this time from one blogger to another .
Precisely what is to prevent multiple bomb juice - packing terrorists from combining their individually packed bomb juices into a single bomb ?
Can you enlighten us ?

They want us to believe that McCain won Texas in a landslide .
A place where I have never heard anyone mention his name , never seen so much as a bumper sticker , and clearly a state that is covered by Ron Paul signs .
Just for the sake of discussion let 's say it 's possible .
What I find seriously hard to believe is this : * Ron Paul got 70 % of the vote in his district for Congress -----37,220 votes . *
In that same district they want us to believe he only got 6,697 votes for president .

That equates to approximately ONLY 1 in 5 people that voted for him for Congress supported him for President .
They can't be serious .

" I had a Gentleman call me when I got Home from the Kent Meeting last night from New York .
He happens to be publishing a book with photos of all of the 2004 Election Fraud Evidence , that was supposed to be published by a company in Kent State ?
He literally has the photographs of burned and otherwise mutilated , destroyed ballots .
He is very familiar with how to follow the fraud , due to his research in the book .
I would call him an investigative Journalist , in Election Fraud .
I do n't know him from Adam .
He called me last night , from New York , upset about huge numbers of precincts in Texas , where there were thousands of registered voters , and ZERO votes at all , with 100 of the Precincts reporting in .
He repeated so I understood .
He is saying there are precincts with over 2000 registered voters , and the official count is saying NO one voted at all in that precinct after the precinct has reported in officially !
He said he has been studying elections now , for years .
He has NEVER seen anything like this .
He said the number of zero precincts , are especially High in the Panhandle of Texas .
He also mentioned what Ron here is saying in this post .
Ron Paul got more votes in his precinct for Congressman , than he did for president in the same precinct ... by huge amounts .
This investigative Journalist is just about to publish the research on the fraud , and now , the company that was going to print with his book , has suddenly pulled out , and refusing to publish .
He was supposed to be doing a book signing at Kent on the anniversary of the shootings , that happens annually there ... I guess .
He now has to self - publish , which , given the situation , and the fact that he is the only one with his " manual " , puts him in a great deal of danger .
Maybe I am a little paranoid for him , because of my past experience with revolution researchers and publishers who have suddenly gone missing , or suddenly ' commit suicide , ' over the past ten years .
But while we were on the phone , we were getting echoes , then , three or four voice cut-outs for ten , then 20 then 30 seconds .
Finally , we were disconnected , and could not get reconnected .
I did ask him to write to me so I could foreword the Texas research he did to all , and let you hear about the Ron Paul Information , since I know all of you would care a lot .
I explained to him how to get a hold of the Ron Paul Texas Meetups , so they could investigate , and move on the situation , if they chose .
I am hoping for an email from him this morning .
I will be trying to call him back all day today .
So , please to the degree you can , keep an eye on this thread .
If I get him on the phone , I will let you know .
He needs some help getting his information out , and wants to investigate the Ron Paul campaign and election fraud , on a larger scale .
Will follow up .... and if he does send an email , I will be sure to post it to you all Linda -- Please Note :

The modern - day , limited - government movement has been co-opted .
The conservatives have failed in their effort to shrink the size of government .
There has not been , nor will there soon be , a conservative revolution in Washington .
Political party control of the federal government has changed , but the inexorable growth in the size and scope of government has continued unabated .
The liberal arguments for limited government in personal affairs and foreign military adventurism were never seriously considered as part of this revolution .
Since the change of the political party in charge has not made a difference , who ’s really in charge ?
If the particular party in power makes little difference , whose policy is it that permits expanded government programs , increased spending , huge deficits , nation building and the pervasive invasion of our privacy , with fewer Fourth Amendment protections than ever before ?
Someone is responsible , and it ’s important that those of us who love liberty , and resent big - brother government , identify the philosophic supporters who have the most to say about the direction our country is going .
If they ’re wrong  and I believe they are  we need to show it , alert the American people , and offer a more positive approach to government .
However , this depends on whether the American people desire to live in a free society and reject the dangerous notion that we need a strong central government to take care of us from the cradle to the grave .
Do the American people really believe it ’s the government ’s responsibility to make us morally better and economically equal ?
Do we have a responsibility to police the world , while imposing our vision of good government on everyone else in the world with some form of utopian nation building ?
If not , and the enemies of liberty are exposed and rejected , then it behooves us to present an alternative philosophy that is morally superior and economically sound and provides a guide to world affairs to enhance peace and commerce .
One thing is certain : conservatives who worked and voted for less government in the Reagan years and welcomed the takeover of the U.S. Congress and the presidency in the 1990s and early 2000s were deceived .
Soon they will realize that the goal of limited government has been dashed and that their views no longer matter .
The so - called conservative revolution of the past two decades has given us massive growth in government size , spending and regulations .
Deficits are exploding and the national debt is now rising at greater than a half - trillion dollars per year .
Taxes do not go down  even if we vote to lower them .
They can’t , as long as spending is increased , since all spending must be paid for one way or another .
Both Presidents Reagan and the elder George Bush raised taxes directly .
With this administration , so far , direct taxes have been reduced  and they certainly should have been  but it means little if spending increases and deficits rise .
When taxes are not raised to accommodate higher spending , the bills must be paid by either borrowing or u201 Cprinting u201D new money .
This is one reason why we conveniently have a generous Federal Reserve chairman who is willing to accommodate the Congress .
With borrowing and inflating , the u201Ctaxu201D is delayed and distributed in a way that makes it difficult for those paying the tax to identify it .
For instance , future generations , or those on fixed incomes who suffer from rising prices , and those who lose jobs  they certainly feel the consequences of economic dislocations that this process causes .
Government spending is always a u201Ctaxu201D burden on the American people and is never equally or fairly distributed .
The poor and low - middle income workers always suffer the most from the deceitful tax of inflation and borrowing .
The Betrayal of the Am ... Murray N. Rothbard , Mu ... Best Price : $ 11.20 Buy New $ 18.50 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
Many present - day conservatives , who generally argue for less government and supported the Reagan / Gingrich / Bush takeover of the federal government , are now justifiably disillusioned .
Although not a monolithic group , they wanted to shrink the size of government .
Early in our history , the advocates of limited , constitutional government recognized two important principles : the rule of law was crucial , and a constitutional government must derive u201 Cjust powers from the consent of the governed .
u201D
It was understood that an explicit transfer of power to government could only occur with power rightfully and naturally endowed to each individual as a God - given right .
Therefore , the powers that could be transferred would be limited to the purpose of protecting liberty .
Unfortunately , in the last 100 years , the defense of liberty has been fragmented and shared by various groups , with some protecting civil liberties , others economic freedom , and a small diverse group arguing for a foreign policy of nonintervention .
The philosophy of freedom has had a tough go of it , and it was hoped that the renewed interest in limited government of the past two decades would revive an interest in reconstituting the freedom philosophy into something more consistent .
Those who worked for the goal of limited government power believed the rhetoric of politicians who promised smaller government .
Sometimes it was just plain sloppy thinking on their part , but at other times , they fell victim to a deliberate distortion of a concise limited - government philosophy by politicians who misled many into believing that we would see a rollback on government intrusiveness .
Yes , there was always a remnant who longed for truly limited government and maintained a belief in the rule of law , combined with a deep conviction that free people and a government bound by a Constitution were the most advantageous form of government .
They recognized it as the only practical way for prosperity to be spread to the maximum number of people while promoting peace and security .
That remnant  imperfect as it may have been  was heard from in the elections of 1980 and 1994 and then achieved major victories in 2000 and 2002 when professed limited - government proponents took over the administration , the Senate and the House .
However , the true believers in limited government are now shunned and laughed at .
At the very least , they are ignored  except when they are used by the new leaders of the right , the new conservatives now in charge of the U.S. government .
The remnant ’s instincts were correct , and the politicians placated them with talk of free markets , limited government , and a humble , non-nation - building foreign policy .
However , little concern for civil liberties was expressed in this recent quest for less government .
Yet , for an ultimate victory of achieving freedom , this must change .
Interest in personal privacy and choices has generally remained outside the concern of many conservatives  especially with the great harm done by their support of the drug war .
Even though some confusion has emerged over our foreign policy since the breakdown of the Soviet empire , it ’s been a net benefit in getting some conservatives back on track with a less militaristic , interventionist foreign policy .
Unfortunately , after 9 - 11 , the cause of liberty suffered a setback .
As a result , millions of Americans voted for the less - than - perfect conservative revolution because they believed in the promises of the politicians .
Now there ’s mounting evidence to indicate exactly what happened to the revolution .
Government is bigger than ever , and future commitments are overwhelming .
Millions will soon become disenchanted with the new status quo delivered to the American people by the advocates of limited government and will find it to be just more of the old status quo .
Victories for limited government have turned out to be hollow indeed .
Since the national debt is increasing at a rate greater than a half - trillion dollars per year , the debt limit was recently increased by an astounding $ 984 billion dollars .
Total U.S. government obligations are $ 43 trillion , while total net worth of U.S. households is just over $ 40 trillion .
The country is broke , but no one in Washington seems to notice or care .
The philosophic and political commitment for both guns and butter  and especially for expanding the American empire  must be challenged .
This is crucial for our survival .
A Foreign Policy of Fr... Paul , Ron Best Price : $ 0.25 Buy New $ 8.85 ( as of 06:20 EST - Details )
In spite of the floundering economy , the Congress and the administration continue to take on new commitments in foreign aid , education , farming , medicine , multiple efforts at nation building , and preemptive wars around the world .
Already we ’re entrenched in Iraq and Afghanistan , with plans to soon add new trophies to our conquest .
War talk abounds as to when Syria , Iran and North Korea will be attacked .
How did all this transpire ?
Why did the government do it ?
Why have n’t the people objected ?
How long will it go on before something is done ?
Does anyone care ?
Will the euphoria of grand military victories  against non-enemies  ever be mellowed ?
Someday , we as a legislative body must face the reality of the dire situation in which we have allowed ourselves to become enmeshed .
Hopefully , it will be soon !
We got here because ideas do have consequences .
Bad ideas have bad consequences , and even the best of intentions have unintended consequences .
We need to know exactly what the philosophic ideas were that drove us to this point ; then , hopefully , reject them and decide on another set of intellectual parameters .
There is abundant evidence exposing those who drive our foreign policy justifying preemptive war .
Those who scheme are proud of the achievements in usurping control over foreign policy .
These are the neoconservatives of recent fame .
Granted , they are talented and achieved a political victory that all policymakers must admire .
But can freedom and the Republic survive this takeover ?
That question should concern us .
Neoconservatives are obviously in positions of influence and are well - placed throughout our government and the media .
An apathetic Congress put up little resistance and abdicated its responsibilities over foreign affairs .
The electorate was easily influenced to join in the patriotic fervor supporting the military adventurism advocated by the neoconservatives .
The numbers of those who still hope for truly limited government diminished and had their concerns ignored these past 22 months , during the aftermath of 9 - 11 .
Members of Congress were easily influenced to publicly support any domestic policy or foreign military adventure that was supposed to help reduce the threat of a terrorist attack .
Believers in limited government were harder to find .
Political money , as usual , played a role in pressing Congress into supporting almost any proposal suggested by the neocons .
This process  where campaign dollars and lobbying efforts affect policy  is hardly the domain of any single political party , and unfortunately , is the way of life in Washington .
Liberty Defined : 50 Es ... Paul , Ron Best Price : $ 1.27 Buy New $ 6.79 ( as of 07:10 EST - Details )
There are many reasons why government continues to grow .
It would be nave for anyone to expect otherwise .
Since 9 - 11 , protection of privacy , whether medical , personal or financial , has vanished .
Free speech and the Fourth Amendment have been under constant attack .
Higher welfare expenditures are endorsed by the leadership of both parties .
Policing the world and nation - building issues are popular campaign targets , yet they are now standard operating procedures .
There ’s no sign that these programs will be slowed or reversed until either we are stopped by force overseas ( which wo n’t be soon ) or we go broke and can no longer afford these grandiose plans for a world empire ( which will probably come sooner than later ) .
None of this happened by accident or coincidence .
Precise philosophic ideas prompted certain individuals to gain influence to implement these plans .
The neoconservatives  a name they gave themselves  diligently worked their way into positions of power and influence .
They documented their goals , strategy and moral justification for all they hoped to accomplish .
Above all else , they were not and are not conservatives dedicated to limited , constitutional government .
Neo -conservatism has been around for decades and , strangely , has connections to past generations as far back as Machiavelli .
Modern - day neo-conservatism was introduced to us in the 1960s .
It entails both a detailed strategy as well as a philosophy of government .
The ideas of Teddy Roosevelt , and certainly Woodrow Wilson , were quite similar to many of the views of present - day neocons .
Neocon spokesman Max Boot brags that what he advocates is u201 Chard Wilsonianism.u201D
In many ways , there ’s nothing u201Cneou201D about their views , and certainly nothing conservative .
Yet they have been able to co-op the conservative movement by advertising themselves as a new or modern form of conservatism .
More recently , the modern - day neocons have come from the far left , a group historically identified as former Trotskyists .
Liberal Christopher
Hitchins has recently officially joined the neocons , and it has been reported that he has already been to the White House as an ad hoc consultant .
Many neocons now in positions of influence in Washington can trace their status back to Professor Leo Strauss of the University of Chicago .
One of Strauss ’ books was Thoughts on Machiavelli .
This book was not a condemnation of Machiavelli ’s philosophy .
Paul Wolfowitz actually got his PhD under Strauss .
Others closely associated with these views are Richard Perle , Eliot Abrams , Robert Kagan and William Kristol .
All are key players in designing our new strategy of preemptive war .
Others include : Michael Ledeen of the American Enterprise Institute ; former CIA Director James Woolsy ; Bill Bennett of Book of Virtues fame ; Frank Gaffney ; Dick Cheney ; and Donald Rumsfeld .
There are just too many to mention who are philosophically or politically connected to the neocon philosophy in some varying degree .
Family of Secrets Russ Baker Best Price : $ 1.93 Buy New $ 8.85 ( as of 05:45 EST - Details )
The godfather of modern - day neo-conservatism is considered to be Irving Kristol , father of Bill Kristol , who set the stage in 1983 with his publication Reflections of a Neoconservative .
In this book , Kristol also defends the traditional liberal position on welfare .
More important than the names of people affiliated with neo-conservatism are the views they adhere to .
Here is a brief summary of the general understanding of what neocons believe :
They agree with Trotsky on permanent revolution , violent as well as intellectual .
They are for redrawing the map of the Middle East and are willing to use force to do so .
They believe in preemptive war to achieve desired ends .
They accept the notion that the ends justify the means  that hard - ball politics is a moral necessity .
They express no opposition to the welfare state .
They are not bashful about an American empire ; instead they strongly endorse it .
They believe lying is necessary for the state to survive .
They believe a powerful federal government is a benefit .
They believe pertinent facts about how a society should be run should be held by the elite and withheld from those who do not have the courage to deal with it .
They believe neutrality in foreign affairs is ill - advised .
They hold Leo Strauss in high esteem .
They believe imperialism , if progressive in nature , is appropriate .
Using American might to force American ideals on others is acceptable .
Force should not be limited to the defense of our country .
9-11 resulted from the lack of foreign entanglements , not from too many .
They dislike and despise libertarians ( therefore , the same applies to all strict constitutionalists ) .
They endorse attacks on civil liberties , such as those found in the Patriot Act , as being necessary .
They unconditionally support Israel and have a close alliance with the Likud Party .
Various organizations and publications over the last 30 years have played a significant role in the rise to power of the neoconservatives .
It took plenty of money and commitment to produce the intellectual arguments needed to convince the many participants in the movement of its respectability .
It is no secret  especially after the rash of research and articles written about the neocons since our invasion of Iraq  how they gained influence and what organizations were used to promote their cause .
Although for decades , they agitated for their beliefs through publications like The National Review , The Weekly Standard , The Public Interest , The Wall Street Journal , Commentary , and the New York Post , their views only gained momentum in the 1990s following the first Persian Gulf War  which still has not ended even with removal of Saddam Hussein .
They became convinced that a much more militant approach to resolving all the conflicts in the Middle East was an absolute necessity , and they were determined to implement that policy .
In addition to publications , multiple think tanks and projects were created to promote their agenda .
A product of the Bradley Foundation , American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) led the neocon charge , but the real push for war came from the Project for a New American Century ( PNAC ) , another organization helped by the Bradley Foundation .
This occurred in 1998 and was chaired by Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol .
Early on , they urged war against Iraq , but were disappointed with the Clinton administration , which never followed through with its periodic bombings .
Obviously , these bombings were motivated more by Clinton ’s personal and political problems than a belief in the neocon agenda .
End the Fed Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.94 Buy New $ 9.00 ( as of 08:40 EST - Details )
The election of 2000 changed all that .
The Defense Policy Board , chaired by Richard Perle played no small role in coordinating the various projects and think tanks , all determined to take us into war against Iraq .
It was n’t too long before the dream of empire was brought closer to reality by the election of 2000 with Paul Wolfowitz , Richard Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld playing key roles in this accomplishment .
The plan to promote an u201CAmerican greatnessu201D imperialistic foreign policy was now a distinct possibility .
Iraq offered a great opportunity to prove their long - held theories .
This opportunity was a consequence of the 9 - 11 disaster .
The money and views of Rupert Murdock also played a key role in promoting the neocon views , as well as rallying support by the general population , through his News Corporation , which owns Fox News Network , the New York Post and Weekly Standard .
This powerful and influential media empire did more to galvanize public support for the Iraqi invasion than one might imagine .
This facilitated the Rumsfeld / Cheney policy as their plans to attack Iraq came to fruition .
It would have been difficult for the neocons to usurp foreign policy from the restraints of Colin Powell ’s State Department without the successful agitation of the Rupert Murdock empire .
Max Boot was satisfied , as he explained : u201CNeoconservatives believe in using American might to promote American ideals abroad .u201D
This attitude is a far cry from the advice of the Founders , who advocated no entangling alliances and neutrality as the proper goal of American foreign policy .
Let there be no doubt , those in the neocon camp had been anxious to go to war against Iraq for a decade .
They justified the use of force to accomplish their goals , even if it required preemptive war .
If anyone doubts this assertion , they need only to read of their strategy in u201CA Clean Break : a New Strategy for Securing the Realm.u201D
Although they felt morally justified in changing the government in Iraq , they knew that public support was important , and justification had to be given to pursue the war .
Of course , a threat to us had to exist before the people and the Congress would go along with war .
The majority of Americans became convinced of this threat , which , in actuality , never really existed .
Now we have the ongoing debate over the location of weapons of mass destruction .
Where was the danger ?
Was all this killing and spending necessary ?
How long will this nation - building and dying go on ?
When will we become more concerned about the needs of our own citizens than the problems we sought in Iraq and Afghanistan ?
Who knows where we ’ll go next  Iran , Syria or North Korea ?
At the end of the Cold War , the neoconservatives realized a rearrangement of the world was occurring and that our superior economic and military power offered them a perfect opportunity to control the process of remaking the Middle East .
It was recognized that a new era was upon us , and the neocons welcomed Frances Fukuyama ’s u201 Cend of history u201D declaration .
To them , the debate was over .
The West won ; the Soviets lost .
Old - fashioned communism was dead .
Long live the new era of neoconservatism .
The struggle may not be over , but the West won the intellectual fight , they reasoned .
The only problem is that the neocons decided to define the philosophy of the victors .
They have been amazingly successful in their efforts to control the debate over what Western values are and by what methods they will be spread throughout the world .
Communism surely lost a lot with the breakup of the Soviet Empire , but this can hardly be declared a victory for American liberty , as the Founders understood it .
Neoconservatism is not the philosophy of free markets and a wise foreign policy .
Instead , it represents big - government welfare at home and a program of using our military might to spread their version of American values throughout the world .
Since neoconservatives dominate the way the U.S. government now operates , it behooves us all to understand their beliefs and goals .
The breakup of the Soviet system may well have been an epic event but to say that the views of the neocons are the unchallenged victors and that all we need do is wait for their implementation is a capitulation to controlling the forces of history that many Americans are not yet ready to concede .
There is surely no need to do so .
There is now a recognized philosophic connection between modern - day neoconservatives and Irving Kristol , Leo Strauss and Machiavelli .
This is important in understanding that today ’s policies and the subsequent problems will be with us for years to come if these policies are not reversed .
Not only did Leo Strauss write favorably of Machiavelli , Michael Ledeen , a current leader of the neoconservative movement , did the same .
In 1999 , Ledeen titled his book , Machiavelli on Modern Leadership , and subtitled : u201CWhy Machiavelli ’s iron rules are as timely and important today as five centuries ago .
u201D
Ledeen is indeed an influential neocon theorist whose views get lots of attention today in Washington .
His book on Machiavelli , interestingly enough , was passed out to Members of Congress attending a political strategy meeting shortly after its publication and at just about the time A Clean Break was issued .
In Ledeen ’s most recent publication , The War Against the Terror Masters , he reiterates his beliefs outlined in this 1999 Machiavelli book .
He specifically praises : u201CCreative destruction … both within our own society and abroad …( foreigners ) seeing America undo traditional societies may fear us , for they do not wish to be undone .
u201D Amazingly , Ledeen concludes : u201CThey must attack us in order to survive , just as we must destroy them to advance our historic mission .
u201D
If those words do n’t scare you , nothing will .
If they are not a clear warning , I do n’t know what could be .
It sounds like both sides of each disagreement in the world will be following the principle of preemptive war .
The world is certainly a less safe place for it .
In Machiavelli on Modern Leadership , Ledeen praises a business leader for correctly understanding Machiavelli : u201CThere are no absolute solutions .
It all depends .
What is right and what is wrong depends on what needs to be done and how.u201D
This is a clear endorsement of situation ethics and is not coming from the traditional left .
It reminds me of : u201CIt depends on what the definition of the word u2018is ’ is.u201D
The Case for Gold Ron Paul , Lewis Lehrman Best Price : $ 3.85 Buy New $ 4.74 ( as of 10:47 EST - Details )
Ledeen quotes Machiavelli approvingly on what makes a great leader .
u201 CA prince must have no other objectives or other thoughts or take anything for his craft , except war .
u201D
To Ledeen , this meant : u201C … the virtue of the warrior are those of great leaders of any successful organization .
u201D
Yet it ’s obvious that war is not coincidental to neocon philosophy , but an integral part .
The intellectuals justify it , and the politicians carry it out .
There ’s a precise reason to argue for war over peace according to Ledeen , for u201C … peace increases our peril by making discipline less urgent , encouraging some of our worst instincts , in depriving us of some of our best leaders .
u201D
Peace , he claims , is a dream and not even a pleasant one , for it would cause indolence and would undermine the power of the state .
Although I concede the history of the world is a history of frequent war , to capitulate and give up even striving for peace  believing peace is not a benefit to mankind  is a frightening thought that condemns the world to perpetual war and justifies it as a benefit and necessity .
These are dangerous ideas , from which no good can come .
The conflict of the ages has been between the state and the individual : central power versus liberty .
The more restrained the state and the more emphasis on individual liberty , the greater has been the advancement of civilization and general prosperity .
Just as man ’s condition was not locked in place by the times and wars of old and improved with liberty and free markets , there ’s no reason to believe a new stage for man might not be achieved by believing and working for conditions of peace .
The inevitability and so - called need for preemptive war should never be intellectually justified as being a benefit .
Such an attitude guarantees the backsliding of civilization .
Neocons , unfortunately , claim that war is in man ’s nature and that we ca n’t do much about it , so let ’s use it to our advantage by promoting our goodness around the world through force of arms .
That view is anathema to the cause of liberty and the preservation of the Constitution .
If it is not loudly refuted , our future will be dire indeed .
Ledeen believes man is basically evil and cannot be left to his own desires .
Therefore , he must have proper and strong leadership , just as Machiavelli argued .
Only then can man achieve good , as Ledeen explains : u201CIn order to achieve the most noble accomplishments , the leader may have to u2018enter into evil . ’
This is the chilling insight that has made Machiavelli so feared , admired and challenging …we are rotten , u201D argues Ledeen .
u201CIt ’s true that we can achieve greatness if , and only if , we are properly led .
u201D
In other words , man is so depraved that individuals are incapable of moral , ethical and spiritual greatness , and achieving excellence and virtue can only come from a powerful authoritarian leader .
What depraved ideas are these to now be influencing our leaders in Washington ?
The question Ledeen does n’t answer is : u201CWhy do the political leaders not suffer from the same shortcomings and where do they obtain their monopoly on wisdom ?
u201D
Once this trust is placed in the hands of a powerful leader , this neocon argues that certain tools are permissible to use .
For instance : u201 Clying is central to the survival of nations and to the success of great enterprises , because if our enemies can count on the reliability of everything you say , your vulnerability is enormously increased .
u201D
What about the effects of lying on one ’s own people ?
Who cares if a leader can fool the enemy ?
Does calling it u201 Cstrategic deceptionu201D make lying morally justifiable ?
Ledeen and Machiavelli argue that it does , as long as the survivability of the state is at stake .
Preserving the state is their goal , even if the personal liberty of all individuals has to be suspended or canceled .
Ledeen makes it clear that war is necessary to establish national boundaries  because that ’s the way it ’s always been done .
Who needs progress of the human race !
He explains : u201CLook at the map of the world : national boundaries have not been drawn by peaceful men leading lives of spiritual contemplation .
National boundaries have been established by war , and national character has been shaped by struggle , most often bloody struggle .
u201D
Yes , but who is to lead the charge and decide which borders we are to fight for ?
What about borders 6,000 miles away unrelated to our own contiguous borders and our own national security ?
Stating a relative truism regarding the frequency of war throughout history should hardly be the moral justification for expanding the concept of war to settle man ’s disputes .
How can one call this progress ?

Machiavelli , Ledeen and the neocons recognized a need to generate a religious zeal for promoting the state .
This , he claims , is especially necessary when force is used to promote an agenda .
It ’s been true throughout history and remains true today , each side of major conflicts invokes God ’s approval .
Our side refers to a u201 Ccrusadeu201D ; theirs to a u201 Choly Jihad.u201D
Too often wars boil down to their god against our God .
It seems this principle is more a cynical effort to gain approval from the masses , especially those most likely to be killed for the sake of the war promoters on both sides who have power , prestige and wealth at stake .
Ledeen explains why God must always be on the side of advocates of war : u201CWithout fear of God , no state can last long , for the dread of eternal damnation keeps men in line , causes them to honor their promises , and inspires them to risk their lives for the common good .
u201D
It seems dying for the common good has gained a higher moral status than eternal salvation of one ’s soul .
Ledeen adds : u201CWithout fear of punishment , men will not obey laws that force them to act contrary to their passions .
Without fear of arms , the state cannot enforce the laws … to this end , Machiavelli wants leaders to make the state spectacular .
u201D
It ’s of interest to note that some large Christian denominations have joined the neoconservatives in promoting preemptive war , while completely ignoring the Christian doctrine of a Just War .
The neocons sought and openly welcomed their support .
I ’d like someone to glean anything from what the Founders said or placed in the Constitution that agrees with this now - professed doctrine of a u201Cspectacularu201D state promoted by those who now have so much influence on our policies here at home and abroad .
Ledeen argues that this religious element , this fear of God , is needed for discipline of those who may be hesitant to sacrifice their lives for the good of the u201Cspectacular state .
u201D
He explains in eerie terms : u201 CDying for one ’s country does n’t come naturally .
Modern armies , raised from the populace , must be inspired , motivated , indoctrinated .
Religion is central to the military enterprise , for men are more likely to risk their lives if they believe they will be rewarded forever after for serving their country .
u201D
This is an admonition that might just as well have been given by Osama bin Laden , in rallying his troops to sacrifice their lives to kill the invading infidels , as by our intellectuals at AEI , who greatly influence our foreign policy .
Neocons  anxious for the U.S. to use force to realign the boundaries and change regimes in the Middle East  clearly understand the benefit of a galvanizing and emotional event to rally the people to their cause .
Without a special event , they realized the difficulty in selling their policy of preemptive war where our own military personnel would be killed .
Whether it was the Lusitania , Pearl Harbor , the Gulf of Tonkin or the Maine , all served their purpose in promoting a war that was sought by our leaders .
Ledeen writes of a fortuitous event ( 1999 ) : u201 C …of course , we can always get lucky .
Stunning events from outside can providentially awaken the enterprise from its growing torpor , and demonstrate the need for reversal , as the devastating Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 so effectively aroused the U.S. from its soothing dreams of permanent neutrality .

Amazingly , Ledeen calls Pearl Harbor a u201 Clucky u201D event .
The Project for a New American Century , as recently as September 2000 , likewise , foresaw the need for u201Ca Pearl Harbor eventu201D that would galvanize the American people to support their ambitious plans to ensure political and economic domination of the world , while strangling any potential u201 Crival .
u201D
Recognizing a u201Cneedu201D for a Pearl Harbor event , and referring to Pearl Harbor as being u201 Clucky u201D are not identical to support and knowledge of such an event , but that this sympathy for a galvanizing event , as 9 - 11 turned out to be , was used to promote an agenda that strict constitutionalists and devotees of the Founders of this nation find appalling , is indeed disturbing .
After 9 - 11 , Rumsfeld and others argued for an immediate attack on Iraq , even though it was not implicated in the attacks .
The fact that neo -conservatives ridicule those who firmly believe that U.S. interests and world peace would best be served by a policy of neutrality and avoiding foreign entanglements should not go unchallenged .
Not to do so is to condone their grandiose plans for an American world hegemony .
The current attention given neocons usually comes in the context of foreign policy .
But there ’s more to what ’s going on today than just the tremendous influence the neocons have on our new policy of preemptive war with a goal of empire .
Our government is now being moved by several ideas that come together in what I call u201 Cneoconism .
u201D
The foreign policy is being openly debated , even if its implications are not fully understood by many who support it .
Washington is now driven by old views brought together in a new package .
We know those who lead us  both in the administration and in Congress  show no appetite to challenge the tax or monetary systems that do so much damage to our economy .
The IRS and the Federal Reserve are off limits for criticism or reform .
There ’s no resistance to spending , either domestic or foreign .
Debt is not seen as a problem .
The supply - siders won on this issue , and now many conservatives readily endorse deficit spending .
There ’s no serious opposition to the expanding welfare state , with rapid growth of the education , agriculture and medical - care bureaucracy .
Support for labor unions and protectionism are not uncommon .
Civil liberties are easily sacrificed in the post 9 - 11 atmosphere prevailing in Washington .
Privacy issues are of little concern , except for a few members of Congress .
Foreign aid and internationalism  in spite of some healthy criticism of the UN and growing concerns for our national sovereignty  are championed on both sides of the aisle .
Lip service is given to the free market and free trade , yet the entire economy is run by special - interest legislation favoring big business , big labor and , especially , big money .
Instead of the u201 Cend of history , u201D we are now experiencing the end of a vocal limited - government movement in our nation ’s capital .
While most conservatives no longer defend balanced budgets and reduced spending , most liberals have grown lazy in defending civil liberties and now are approving wars that we initiate .
The so - called u201 Cthird wayu201D has arrived and , sadly , it has taken the worst of what the conservatives and liberals have to offer .
The people are less well off for it , while liberty languishes as a result .
Neocons enthusiastically embrace the Department of Education and national testing .
Both parties overwhelmingly support the huge commitment to a new prescription drug program .
Their devotion to the new approach called u201 Ccompassionate conservatismu201D has lured many conservatives into supporting programs for expanding the federal role in welfare and in church charities .
The faith - based initiative is a neocon project , yet it only repackages and expands the liberal notion of welfare .
The intellectuals who promoted these initiatives were neocons , but there ’s nothing conservative about expanding the federal government ’s role in welfare .
The supply - siders ’ policy of low marginal tax rates has been incorporated into neoconism , as well as their support for easy money and generous monetary inflation .
Neoconservatives are disinterested in the gold standard and even ignore the supply - siders ’ argument for a phony gold standard .
Is it any wonder that federal government spending is growing at a rate faster than in any time in the past 35 years ?
The Revolution : A Mani ... Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.99 Buy New $ 6.99 ( as of 11:00 EST - Details )
Power , politics and privilege prevail over the rule of law , liberty , justice and peace .
But it does not need to be that way .
Neoconism has brought together many old ideas about how government should rule the people .
It may have modernized its appeal and packaging , but authoritarian rule is authoritarian rule , regardless of the humanitarian overtones .
A solution can only come after the current ideology driving our government policies is replaced with a more positive one .
In a historical context , liberty is a modern idea and must once again regain the high moral ground for civilization to advance .
Restating the old justifications for war , people control and a benevolent state will not suffice .
It can not eliminate the shortcomings that always occur when the state assumes authority over others and when the will of one nation is forced on another  whether or not it is done with good intentions .
I realize that all conservatives are not neoconservatives , and all neocons do n’t necessarily agree on all points  which means that in spite of their tremendous influence , most members of Congress and those in the administration do not necessarily take their marching orders from AEI or Richard Perle .
But to use this as a reason to ignore what neoconservative leaders believe , write about and agitate for  with amazing success I might point out  would be at our own peril .
This country still allows open discourse  though less everyday  and we who disagree should push the discussion and expose those who drive our policies .
It is getting more difficult to get fair and balanced discussion on the issues , because it has become routine for the hegemons to label those who object to preemptive war and domestic surveillance as traitors , unpatriotic and un-American .
The uniformity of support for our current foreign policy by major and cable - news networks should concern every American .
We should all be thankful for C - SPAN and the Internet .
Michael Ledeen and other neoconservatives are already lobbying for war against Iran .
Ledeen is pretty nasty to those who call for a calmer , reasoned approach by calling those who are not ready for war u201 Ccowards and appeasers of tyrants .
u201D
Because some urge a less militaristic approach to dealing with Iran , he claims they are betraying America ’s best u201Ctraditions.u201D
I wonder where he learned early American history !
It ’s obvious that Ledeen does n’t consider the Founders and the Constitution part of our best traditions .
We were hardly encouraged by the American revolutionaries to pursue an American empire .
We were , however , urged to keep the Republic they so painstakingly designed .
If the neoconservatives retain control of the conservative , limited - government movement in Washington , the ideas , once championed by conservatives , of limiting the size and scope of government will be a long - forgotten dream .
The believers in liberty ought not deceive themselves .
Who should be satisfied ?
Certainly not conservatives , for there is no conservative movement left .
How could liberals be satisfied ?
They are pleased with the centralization of education and medical programs in Washington and support many of the administration ’s proposals .
But none should be pleased with the steady attack on the civil liberties of all American citizens and the now - accepted consensus that preemptive war  for almost any reason  is an acceptable policy for dealing with all the conflicts and problems of the world .
In spite of the deteriorating conditions in Washington  with loss of personal liberty , a weak economy , exploding deficits , and perpetual war , followed by nation building  there are still quite a number of us who would relish the opportunity to improve things , in one way or another .
Certainly , a growing number of frustrated Americans , from both the right and the left , are getting anxious to see this Congress do a better job .
But first , Congress must stop doing a bad job .

We ’re at the point where we need a call to arms , both here in Washington and across the country .
I ’m not talking about firearms .
Those of us who care need to raise both arms and face our palms out and begin waving and shouting : Stop !
Enough is enough !
It should include liberals , conservatives and independents .
We ’re all getting a bum rap from politicians who are pushed by polls and controlled by special - interest money .
One thing is certain , no matter how morally justified the programs and policies seem , the ability to finance all the guns and butter being promised is limited , and those limits are becoming more apparent every day .
Spending , borrowing and printing money cannot be the road to prosperity .
It has n’t worked in Japan , and it is n’t working here either .
As a matter of fact , it ’s never worked anytime throughout history .
A point is always reached where government planning , spending and inflation run out of steam .
Instead of these old tools reviving an economy , as they do in the early stages of economic interventionism , they eventually become the problem .
Both sides of the political spectrum must one day realize that limitless government intrusion in the economy , in our personal lives and in the affairs of other nations cannot serve the best interests of America .
This is not a conservative problem , nor is it a liberal problem  it ’s a government intrusion problem that comes from both groups , albeit for different reasons .
The problems emanate from both camps who champion different programs for different reasons .
The solution will come when both groups realize that it ’s not merely a single - party problem , or just a liberal or just a conservative problem .
Once enough of us decide we ’ve had enough of all these so - called good things that the government is always promising  or more likely , when the country is broke and the government is unable to fulfill its promises to the people  we can start a serious discussion on the proper role for government in a free society .
Unfortunately , it will be some time before Congress gets the message that the people are demanding true reform .
This requires that those responsible for today ’s problems are exposed and their philosophy of pervasive government intrusion is rejected .
Let it not be said that no one cared , that no one objected once it ’s realized that our liberties and wealth are in jeopardy .
A few have , and others will continue to do so , but too many  both in and out of government  close their eyes to the issue of personal liberty and ignore the fact that endless borrowing to finance endless demands cannot be sustained .
True prosperity can only come from a healthy economy and sound money .
That can only be achieved in a free society .

A blog about maps of United States and geography and travel .
Reader Jeffrey Mindich , a senior news anchor at International Community Radio in Taipei , writes :
About a year ago in Taiwan , they started installing countdown timers at traffic lights at a number of intersections .
Some counted down the amount of time remaining ’ till a green light turned yellow and then red , while others counted down the amount of time remaining before a red light turned green .
Some intersections had both .
Here ’s a picture :
I just happened to be working on a story about traffic accidents while reading your March 10 post on the subject and I thought you might find my story of interest .
It ’s a fact that a certain number of accidents are caused both by people who jump the gun on the red light , and those who try to make it through the intersection after the light has already turned red .
Ostensibly , the reason for the timers was to give people more precise information about exactly how much time they had remaining before the light changed , in the hope of reducing accidents .
The results are quite interesting .
A research institute within Taiwan ’s Ministry of Transportation released a report showing that at 187 intersections which had the timers installed , those that counted down the remaining time on green lights saw a doubling in the number of reported accidents , with a 33 percent increase in the number of injuries , while those that counted down until a red light turned green saw a halving in both the number of reported accidents and injuries .
Intersection that had both red and green light timers saw a 19 percent increase in reported accidents and a 23 percent increase in injuries .
More ignorance from these wannabe leaders .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Visa Inc V.N burned its name into the record books for U.S. initial public offerings on Tuesday , raising $ 17.9 billion as investors seized on its growth potential and lack of direct exposure to the global credit crisis .

REUTERS / Chip East
San Francisco - based Visa , the world ’s largest credit card network , sold 406 million class A common stock for $ 44 per share , above the forecast range of $ 37 to $ 42 .
Visa will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday .
Anticipation for the IPO was high on hopes it will emulate the success of smaller rival MasterCard Inc MA.N , whose shares have more than quadrupled since its 2006 IPO .
The stock could jump as much as 10 percent in first - day trading on Wednesday , said Francis Gaskins , president of research firm IPOdesktop.com .
Visa ’s pricing and optimism about possible first - day gains were likely helped by Tuesday ’s rally , as U.S. stocks rang in their biggest one - day gains in more than five years .
Only days ago , U.S. stocks plunged on the near - collapse of Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N .
MasterCard has done well despite the market slump , Gaskins pointed out .
The stock rose 4.3 percent , or $ 8.73 , to $ 210.25 on Tuesday , and gained almost 2 percent in aftermarket trading .
Both MasterCard and Visa are seen as good bets to avoid the market turmoil .
Analysts say neither is directly exposed to rising defaults and late payments because it does not issue cards , unlike rivals such as American Express Co AXP.N .
“ Visa is much bigger than MasterCard , ” said David Robertson , publisher of Nilson Report , an industry newsletter .
“ The expectation is that by being freed from the constraints of being a not - for - profit member - owned association , it could become an even more formidable competitor to MasterCard , ” Robertson added .
Visa was priced at around 25 times earnings for the year ended Sept 30 , adjusted for litigation reserves and other items , according to analysts ’ calculations .
MasterCard trades at more than 35 times earnings for that period .
BANK PAYDAY
The Visa offering will give a much - needed boost to bank stakeholders , whose coffers have been raided by higher credit costs and losses from subprime mortgage bets .
Visa is using about $ 10.2 billion of proceeds to redeem shares held by its largest shareholders , including banks JP Morgan & Co JPM.N , Bank of America Corp BAC.N , National City Corp NCC.N and Citigroup Inc C.N .
Another $ 3 billion is being set aside to cover litigation costs , and the balance for general corporate purposes , according to filings .
The offering is the first bright spot for the 2008 U.S. IPO calendar .
Only 44 deals have been priced year to date , a 49 percent slump from the same period last year .
Underwriters , led by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs GS.N , have the option to purchase an additional 40.6 million shares to cover overallotments , according to filings .
Visa has disclosed it expected to pay underwriters fees of about $ 500 million .
By raising $ 17.9 billion , Visa surpasses AT&T's $ 10.6 billion IPO in 2000 , which was the record .
If overallotments are exercised , the IPO could become No. 2 worldwide after Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd 601398.SS , which raised $ 22 billion in 2006 , according to Reuters Data .
“ ( Visa ) shows that the IPO market is not dead , ” IPO desktop ’s Gaskins said .
Mahatma Gandhi on the Martyrdom of Bhagat Singh Freedom fighter Sardar Bhagat Singh was hanged by the British on accusations of anti-government activities on March 23 , 1931 .
Here , Gandhi pays tribute to the patriotism of the young martyr while disagreeing with his revolutionary methods .
Excerpted from Gandhi's article in Young India .
Bhagat Singh and his two associates have been hanged .
The Congress made many attempts to save their lives and the Government entertained many hopes of it , but all has been in a vain .
Bhagat Singh did not wish to live .
He refused to apologize , or even file an appeal .
Bhagat Singh was not a devotee of non-violence , but he did not subscribe to the religion of violence .
He took to violence due to helplessness and to defend his homeland .
In his last letter , Bhagat Singh wrote --" I have been arrested while waging a war .
For me there can be no gallows .
Put me into the mouth of a cannon and blow me off . "
These heroes had conquered the fear of death .
Let us bow to them a thousand times for their heroism .
But we should not imitate their act .
In our land of millions of destitute and crippled people , if we take to the practice of seeking justice through murder , there will be a terrifying situation .
Our poor people will become victims of our atrocities .
By making a dharma of violence , we shall be reaping the fruit of our own actions .
Hence , though we praise the courage of these brave men , we should never countenance their activities .
Our dharma is to swallow our anger , abide by the discipline of non-violence and carry out our duty .

Impacting Unimpaired
New agreements like the SPP and TILMA are aimed directly at unimpeded extraction in the tar sands
by Macdonald Stainsby
The Dominion - http://www.dominionpaper.ca
Police launch tear gas at demonstrators during a Security and Prosperity Partnership ( SPP ) meeting in Ottawa last August .

Demonstrations against the Security and Prosperity Partnership ( SPP ) began in the Summer of 2007 , but several of the issues raised by anti-SPP organizers invoked déjà vu for many observers : informal agreements , secret talks , plans to do away with layers of national sovereignty in favour of corporate rules of engagement set to supersede labour organizing , environmental regulations or human rights .
The laundry list of rule changes sounded a lot like debates of years past -- the FTA , MAI , APEC , FTAA and NAFTA .
However , a deeper look at the driving force behind the new acronyms tells a different story , one of a world with new dynamics like peak oil , tar sands and the extreme measures that North American governments are attempting to use in the tar sands to keep an oil - dependent economy going .
Before the SPP became a larger issue nationally and continentally , the Trade , Investment & Labour Mobility Agreement ( TILMA ) had already been passed in British Columbia and Alberta .
The agreement , having passed as legislation and set to be " phased in " by April 2009 , plays a role complementary to the SPP and continues to be similarly criticized by many organizers for the anti-democratic way it has been implemented .
According to an analysis published by the Canadian Union of Public Employees , TILMA " encompasses provincial and local governments , regional districts , school boards , health and social services .
" Nearly every action by a government , now and in the future , is potentially constrained unless expressly excluded in the agreement .
Measures are defined broadly and include any legislation , regulation , standard , directive , requirement , guideline , program , policy , administrative practice , or other procedure . "
CUPE also describes the SPP as " another attempt of corporate America , in partnership with their political and corporate allies in Canada and Mexico , to reduce the power of government to protect citizens from profit - hungry business .
" Their intention is to scale down government regulations and controls that try to protect our society , culture and environment .
Specifically , the SPP will minimize controls in areas like immigration , food and agriculture , natural resource exploitation , public services and entertainment . "
TILMA is a new set of limitations on government 's ability to regulate and the SPP is the removal of a pre-existing set of regulations .
Both TILMA and the SPP have specific aims that go beyond the usual attempt to enshrine investors ' rights and protect corporations from government regulations .
Both agreements pave the way -- in many cases literally -- for the largest industrial project in history to move forward : a project that calls for the extraction of over 170 billion barrels of recoverable oil from the tar sands of Alberta 's Athabasca , Peace and Cold Lake regions .
The SPP and TILMA have anticipated popular resistance and preemptively removed the ability of governments to control the massive supply of energy , land , water and labour needed in the tar sands .
They similarly preempt governments ' ability to regulate the destruction and pollution that the " gigaproject " will create .
The Communications , Energy and Paperworkers union ( CEP ) is concerned .
" As energy workers , we are compelled first of all to respond to the SPP energy agenda , " the CEP said in a statement .
" Through the SPP and the North American Energy Working Group , the governments of Mexico , United States and Canada have formed an unprecedented collaboration with energy corporations to promote the continental integration of our energy industries and infrastructures . "
The result has surprisingly few benefits for Alberta or Canada .
A massive , ecologically rich region will be reduced to an industrial sacrifice area .
The synthetic crude that it renders will go south to the US .
Royalties for Albertans and Canadians are minimal , and communities living in the vast area that will be strip - mined -- Indigenous and settler alike -- will be dismantled .
The " Oil Sands Experts Working Group , " a part of the 2006 SPP meetings in Houston , calls the tar sands " a significant contributor to energy supply and security for the continent . "
According to the group , it was founded " when the three countries agreed to collaborate through the SPP on the sustainable development of the oil sands resources . "
The working group includes the US , Canadian and Alberta government representatives .
What does " sustainable development of the oil sands resources " consist of ?
The same SPP report says that it requires expanded " integrated long distance pipelines , " plans for which are " already in place " to accommodate " the certain doubling of oil sands production to two million barrels per day by 2010 .
" The five - fold expansion anticipated for oil sands products in a relatively short time span , " the report says , " will represent many challenges for the pipeline industry . "
To accomplish this , the report concludes , " Governments are encouraged to streamline the regulatory approval process and better manage the risk to both pipeline and energy projects .
" Canadian governments have already gone a long way to co-ordinating and streamlining the environmental and regulatory approvals , but more needs to be done . "
TILMA sets up a free trade zone between Alberta and B.C. that " breaks down barriers " for all industries .
April 2007 saw the official beginning of the TILMA agreement , sold as giving Alberta and B.C. a " competitive " way to deal with Ontario 's vast size advantage .
In reality , TILMA turns the provinces into locations where corporations can sue any person or entity that tries to legislate or otherwise invoke regulations that would make investment more " troublesome . "
The agreement bans measures which " impact or impair " investment and allows even an individual investor the right to sue governments to knock down such " impediments " and receive compensation for loss of revenue .
What can be seen as an impediment under TILMA is extensive .
Under NAFTA , corporations can " challenge " legislation that affects their profits .
A third party then rules on the " dispute " at hand .
This has seen Canada paying to maintain some of its legislation around tobacco and environmental regulations , for example .
TILMA , however , starts on the assumption that the investor is correct .
Unlike the resolution process seen in Chapter 11 of NAFTA , the current agreement includes an automatic up - to - $ 5 million penalty for a government body ( at any level other than federal ) that violates the rules of " free access " for capital .
For example , if a city blocks the construction of a building for reasons of heritage , costing a corporation a projected $ 4 million , then the governing body that invokes the regulations " impacting or impairing " owes that corporation $ 4 million .
Article 3 of TILMA reads , in part : " Each Party shall ensure that its measures do not operate to restrict or impair trade between or through the territory of the Parties , or investment or labour mobility between the Parties . "
The agreement has specifically designed protocols for hearings to be held if one or more of the signatories are in breach of the agreement .
These secretive deals and agreements are taking place during the single largest energy policy shift in North America since the peaking of US domestic oil production in the seventies .
Internationally , the US is in a scramble for remaining oil reserves .
Chinese demand for oil continues to grow .
Disasters such as hurricanes and war -- and the fact that only one barrel of oil is discovered for every nine that are used -- have brought oil prices to record highs since the US invasion of Iraq in March 2003 .
With an economic and military structure that needs vast supplies of hydrocarbons everyday , North American energy concerns have found the oil " boom " in Northern Alberta that was expected in the aftermath of a regime change in Iraq .
In response to Chinese interest in the tar sands , US energy expert Irving Mintzer blurted out , " The problem with the Chinese is that they do n't know that the Canadian oil is ours .
And neither do the Canadians . "
In the same breath Mintzer noted , " One provocation for rethinking US energy policy will be when Chinese investment in Canadian tar sands and Venezuelan oil development make it increasingly difficult for us to get access to the resources . "
That hypothetical situation has come about more quickly , since the Iraqi resistance has cut off access to " stable " flows of petroleum and Venezuela has reduced its contribution to US energy markets by one third .
The US has shifted their boom from Baghdad and Kirkuk to Fort McMurray and Grand Prairie .
Many Venezuelans who oppose their country 's socialist government have re-settled in Alberta .
Whether led by Liberals or Conservatives , Canada has been more than willing to help this shift .
Approvals for tar sands operations and newly designed agreements help to take Tar Sands development to unfathomable levels of expansion .
The industry that extracts bitumen and then crude oil from tar sands was once aiming to get to production levels of one million barrels per day ( bpd ) by 2012 .
Last year , the average already surpassed 1.3 million .
The swiftly rising price of oil and the near - impossibility of a long term drop in price has suddenly allowed a major shift towards producing this oil , which is only profitable at a barrel price of at least $ 30 .
The production process of the synthetic oil is unlike anything else : there are huge labour and energy needs currently unavailable to the producers , needs that are being drawn up and planned through TILMA and the SPP .
The US Department of Energy and Natural Resources Canada had another secret meeting , along with US energy corporations , in February 2006 .
Some details of the meeting were leaked earlier this year to the CBC .
The agenda : to reduce labour and environmental rights in order to ramp up production from the Athabasca , Peace and Cold Lake tar sands to five million barrels per day .
The United States has reorganized their long - term plans for petroleum energy by setting a goal to get up to 25 per cent of their daily oil from tar sands based operations ( in addition to Canada 's conventional oil ) .
In 2003 , the US Department of Energy began declaring tar sands reserves part of their calculation of oil imported from Canada .
This will include massive pipeline construction across territories within British Columbia , made nearly impossible to block by TILMA .
The SPP is setting the stage for the creation of a series of " super highways " that may extend from as far as Panama City north to Edmonton and branching off to the three " hot spots " of the Albertan Peace and Athabasca Regions and northeast British Columbia .
Along with the reduction in labour rights across both provinces through TILMA , the SPP will provide much - needed labour through the expansion of the " temporary foreign workers " program .
The growth of Alberta 's economy has already exceeded the available population of workers .
Workers from the Maritimes are paid to fly to Fort McMurray from Moncton , Halifax or St. John 's and work in camps in the tar sands .
The energy needs of production in the tar sands process -- whether the strip - mining operations or the " in-situ " underground " Steam - assisted gravity Drainage " ( Sag - D ) procedure -- are equal to almost a third of what is produced .
( For comparison purposes , the crude in Iraqi reserves produces about 100 times the energy that is needed to pump it out . )
Sag - D consumes more energy and water than strip - mining operations , setting the stage for the requisite equivalent of four to five billion cubic feet of natural gas per day required in tar sands operations if they become fully operational .
This reality is what is leading Energy Alberta to promote nuclear power for the Peace Region , where Sag - D has barely even begun to operate .
The two maps included show the plans for this vast expansion , both in terms of the importation of labour by highway and the construction of needed energy supplies by pipeline to get to the planned five million bpd .
The first one shows the flow of goods and labour .
The aim of TILMA and the SPP is the immediate creation of far more labour inflow from places such as Mexico and China , most of it ultimately destined to work in the tar sands .
Canadian Natural Resources Limited ( CNRL ) began using 500 Chinese labourers on a " guest worker " program at their Horizons Oilsands Project last year .
The SPP is a cost - effective means of importing needed labour and keeping costs down at the same time , through enacting ' labour mobility ' and allowing non-citizen workers to be exploited at rates currently unreported .
The Alberta Federation of Labour points out that 2006 was the first year that the number of people admitted into Alberta who were not even allowed to apply to become landed immigrants ( let alone citizens ) exceeded the number of new immigrants .
With agreements like the SPP in place , this will increase sharply .
With TILMA , every time a labour right is undermined , it becomes the new bottom line .
According to Gil McGowan of the Alberta Federation of Labour , " Employers are using temporary foreign workers as a way to suppress wages and working conditions and to avoid legitimate unions ... we oppose the importation of hundreds of workers just to complete a job and then sending them back home .
That is exploitation . "
The truly daunting reality is that the production level being proposed will have no other option : the only way to keep up with projected production rates is to bring in people from outside .
The guest worker programs keep non-status workers in camps where they are not allowed visitations by any union .
The only means by which such a " guest " will be allowed to stay beyond the term of their contract ( up to 24 months ) is if the employer applies , not the individual .
Figures on pay and to whom it is delivered are not available and have not yet been obtained by organized labour in Alberta - - we simply do not know how much migrant workers in the tar sands are being paid .
The " guest workers " may not end up only in the camps .
The proposed size of tar sands expansion is such that constructing infrastructure for vast new energy " inputs " will take thousands of workers as well .
Two pipelines of various gas are needed " in " to the tar sands for every pipeline going " out . "
NAFTA trade corridors will be used to import labour and move equipment and goods to the tar sands .
The energy needed to go into the tar sands are slated to come from the natural gas in such places as Alaska 's north slope , coal - fired mega plants in Alberta , proposed nuclear reactors in the Peace Region and near Whitecourt , along with the industrialization of the Mackenzie Valley ( and much more ) .
The outward shipping of bitumen - sludge ( later converted to mock oil ) entails corridors across Saskatchewan and Manitoba , the Dakotas , Nebraska , Kansas and more , all the way to Texas and Louisiana .
These schemes , in particular the one known as the Keystone Pipeline headed by TransCanada , is already causing the AFL to warn of dire consequences for job loss and deregulation of currently union - run operations .
The other corridor for sending sludge to refineries is slated to be across British Columbia , over the lands of the Carrier , Gixtsan , Haisla , Tsimshian and other unceded nations to a yet - to - be- constructed port to operate out of Kitimat , where oil could theoretically be shipped to California , Japan and China .
The same port would serve to import " diluent " from Russia , a kerosene - like substance used to make the thick mud of bitumen flow like oil in a pipe .
" Pipeline ruptures happen , they 're inevitable , " says Gerald Amos of the Haisla Nation from Gitamaat Village on the Coast of B.C. , where the construction of a Liquid Natural Gas ( LNG ) port is being planned .
" We just do n't know the location yet ... All of the proponents of the Gateway project and all the other pipelines which would mean more tanker traffic here point out that we 've had tanker traffic here , big ships coming in for about 40 to 50 years now .
I think you are talking about a substantially different ball game when you talk about supertankers . "
This project , the " Enbridge Gateway , " is currently delayed due to lawsuits launched by seven First Nations , Indian Act - mandated governments and the China National Petroleum Company 's withdrawal from the project .
Other pipelines heading southward are the Alberta Clipper Project and the Spearhead Expansion Project , also led by Enbridge , a self - described " leader in energy transportation . "
In June of this year , the first new refinery in the United States in decades was announced .
The map shows only some of the refineries planning to receive tar sands bitumen .
Under the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board , every single project in the Athabasca , Cold Lake and Peace River tar sands region has been approved .
TILMA will streamline the regulations in line with these projects across all of B.C. and Alberta .
It will also mean the elimination of a long - time moratorium on oil and gas offshore tankers on the central coast of B.C .
Kitimat and Gitamaat Village , currently host to major Gray and Humpback whale migration , would see 330 super tankers of oil and gas a year migrating offshore , according to the Dogwood Initiative .
Nations up and down the proposed corridor would see a loss of forest cover in areas where giant grizzlies still roam near ranchlands .
The oil and gas going to and from the tar sands would cross rivers and streams and the tankers will come near 1,000 salmon spawning areas .
Upon completion , the entire 1,200 - plus kilometre pipeline systems would provide 75 full - time jobs .
Enbridge has quietly shifted gears towards building the infrastructure to send the current bump in oil production to Texas , promising to complete this project at a later date .
That later date may well coincide with the B.C. government 's other " Pacific Gateway Strategy , " designed to use TILMA , the SPP , the 2010 Olympics and vast tar sands export growth to make the West Coast of Canada a major hub of de-regulated trade with Asia .
It could soon be illegal and not ' merely ' politically difficult to regulate how these constructions go ahead .
Environmental regulation , revenue for nations who approve the use of their lands , taxation for reclamation purposes , requirements on unionization for the construction -- all of these things are being legislated and signed away .
With TILMA , Alberta and B.C. have united to ensure that the oil dug out of the earth is sent south , at an incomprehensible rate .
The primary legacy of the project will be run-away climate emissions , the second fastest rate of deforestation on earth , the dismantling of previously won workers ' rights , a sacrifice area in Alberta the size of Florida and the removal of meaningful democratic oversight at the community level .
The usual critiques of the SPP and TILMA are not inaccurate .
Placing new developments in a global context , however , changes our understanding of what is driving this latest set of deals .
Instability around the planet , dwindling reserves of oil , a collapsing American dollar and more are exposing imperial economic structures to a level of insecurity unknown in a generation .
By lurching headlong in 2003 towards the Albertan tar sands , the US has made the rising price of oil work to their advantage , rather than its opposite ; when the price of oil goes up , those who invest heavily in expensive , unconventional oil gain a larger foothold in market share .
The SPP and TILMA have been drawn up to increase and integrate this into a decades - long strategy for North American economic stability , a strategy that does not address our dependence on oil .
Understanding the true nature of these plans allows people to make informed decisions about what to do during the rapid changes in energy politics -- changes that will affect the entire population of North America ( and the planet ) for decades to come .
Before the Iowa caucuses , senior aides to Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton fell into a heated argument during a 7:30 a.m. conference call about the basic message their candidate was delivering to voters .
Mark Penn , chief strategist and pollster , liked Clinton ’s emphasis on her “ strength and experience , ” and he defended the idea of her running as a quasi - incumbent best suited for the presidency .
Harold Ickes and other advisors said that message was not working .
A more promising strategy , they argued , would be to focus on the historic prospect of electing the first woman president .
Today , as Clinton tries to revive her campaign after losing 10 straight primary contests to Sen.
Barack Obama , some insiders look back and wish that argument had produced a different outcome .
Penn won the debate , say two people aware of the conversation , and Clinton went on to present herself to voters as a steely figure so familiar with the workings of government that she could lead from Day One .
The Clinton campaign now seems in peril , its precarious situation acknowledged on Wednesday even by former President Bill Clinton , who suggested that his wife could not survive a loss in either of the next two major contests , in Texas and Ohio on March 4 .
“ If she wins Texas and Ohio , I think she will be the nominee , ” the former president told an audience in Beaumont , Texas .
“ If you do n’t deliver for her , I do n’t think she can be . ”
Still , the campaign seems to be doubling its bet on the message that caused so much division among top aides before the first caucuses in Iowa .
Even as results rolled in from Wisconsin on Tuesday night , eventually yielding a 17 - point loss , Clinton said she alone was best prepared to be commander in chief .
And at an evening rally in Brownsville , Texas , on Wednesday , she continued : “ When you begin to talk to your friends , ask them :
Who do they want to be in the White House when the phone rings at 3 in the morning with some problem or some crisis ?
We need a commander in chief who ’s ready from Day One to be in charge of our country . ”
The internal friction over Clinton ’s message was never fully resolved .
A schism persists to this day .
Some people close to the campaign ’s inner circle believe Clinton should make more of an effort to show a warmer , softer side before the March 4 primaries .
Her next opportunity to present herself to a national audience comes today with a debate against Obama in Austin , to be carried by CNN and Univision .
As they look for where the campaign went wrong , some people knowledgeable about it said that Hillary Clinton bore responsibility because she did not heed calls to limit the overarching power Penn wielded within the brain trust as both its pollster and message - maker .
Some campaign staff did not have access to complete polling data from Penn ’s research , meaning it was difficult to challenge the messages he was crafting based on those polls , according to a person familiar with the campaign ’s workings .
Aides went to Clinton repeatedly with these concerns , but she stuck by Penn and kept him in his dual roles , according to people familiar with the campaign .
“ Mark did essentially the same job in 2000 [ as Clinton ran for the Senate ] , which was a difficult race , and we prevailed , ” said one person familiar with Clinton ’s operation .
“ He also worked for Bill Clinton in 1996 and prevailed .
And he worked for Hillary in 2006 " for her reelection to the Senate “ and we prevailed .
So there ’s a lot of faith and trust there on behalf of both Clintons .
That ’s the way it had been done , and I think she had faith that it worked . ”
Penn , in an interview , said that he was playing much the same role he had for the last three decades for a variety of candidates .
He said he had no “ administrative control ” within the Clinton campaign .
What is more , Clinton ’s “ compassion ” is a side of her he ’s never tried to hide , he said .
“ She is both a strong leader and someone who shows compassion for people , and both of those are important parts of who she is , ” Penn said .
Asked about complaints that polling data was treated with secrecy , he said : “ Polling information goes to the people designated to receive it . ”
Still , a faction on Clinton ’s staff believed that she needed to address at a much earlier stage a stubborn and uncomfortable reality : that many people disliked her .
As the campaign unfolded before January ’s caucuses in Iowa , Clinton succeeded in convincing people that she was prepared and tough enough to be president .
But some critics say the campaign failed to make a companion argument : that she is a warmer figure than people might suspect .
“ There is a certain part of the electorate that does not like her , because they do n’t know her , ” one person knowledgeable about the campaign said .
In Iowa , “ everybody knew that she was the most qualified and the most experienced and stronger than Obama .
But they really wanted to like her .
And they had n’t gotten there . ”
Penn ’s talent , the person said , “ is not recognizing the human aspects of a candidate or a campaign -- the soul of it .
He ’s very much by the numbers and by the issues , and what tests well and what does n’t test well . ”
The campaign has at times tried to give voters a more intimate view of Clinton .
For example , in December , it launched an effort called “ The Hillary I Know , ” in which friends , colleagues and people who had met Clinton in the course of her work offered testimonials , many focusing on her warmth and empathy .
But critics within the campaign say these efforts were too late and too sporadic to be effec- tive .
Every message carries a trade - off .
Exit polls of late have showed Clinton losing ground to Obama among white men .
To the extent Clinton plays up a softer side , she may drive off some men who want to see toughness befitting a commander in chief .
With Ohio and Texas looming , the softer approach is not where Clinton is headed .
Going forward , Clinton plans to win the nomination in part by emphasizing her “ experience ” and drawing a sharp contrast with what her staff casts as Obama ’s empty promises .
“ We are laying out the contrast of how she will be as president , related to the question of what they really know about Sen.
Obama -- and will he stand up for them the way she has stood up to so many people in her lifetime , ” Penn told reporters on a conference call Wednesday .
Lately , Clinton has started using a new phrase :
She is in the “ solutions business . ”
The implication is that voters should pick her because she ’ll solve their problems -- not because they necessarily like her .

Things NOT to put in root 's crontab
Sigh .
Here are several things I 've just removed from /etc / crontab on every RedHat Linux system I can get my hands on .
They contain security holes related to the use of ' find ' and ' rm ' to expire old files in /tmp and other places .
It seems that awareness of this type of security problem is rather low , so I 'll explain the class of problem and how to fix it .
From Redhat 's /etc / crontab file : # Remove / var / tmp files not accessed in 10 days 43 02 * * * root find / var / tmp /* - atime +3 - exec rm -f {} \ ; 2 > / dev/null # Remove /tmp files not accessed in 10 days # I commented out this line because I tend to " store " stuff in /tmp # 41 02 * * * root find / tmp /* - atime +10 - exec rm -f {} \ ; 2 > / dev/null # Remove formatted man pages not accessed in 10 days 39 02 * * * root find / var / catman / cat ?/* - atime +10 - exec rm -f {} \ ; 2 > / dev/null # Remove and TeX fonts not used in 10 days 35 02 * * * root find / var / lib / texmf /* - type f - atime +10 - exec rm -f {} \ ; 2 > / dev/null
Folks , do NOT use ' find ' on a public directory with ' - exec rm - f ' as root .
Period .
Ever .
Delete it from your crontab * now * and finish reading the rest of this message later .
* PROBLEM DISCUSSION AND EXPLOITATION
The immediate security problem is that ' rm ' does n't check that components of the directory name are not symlinks .
This means that you can delete any file on the system ; indeed , with a little work you can delete * every * file on the system , provided that you can determine the file names ( though you might be limited to deleting files more than ten days old ) .
First , create the directories and file : /tmp/hacker-fest/some/arbitrary/set/of/path/names/etc/passwd where all but the last component is a directory .
Be ready to replace ' etc ' with a symlink to ' / etc ' , so that : /tmp/hacker-fest/some/arbitrary/set/of/path/names/etc
-> /etc i.e. the path components of the file name will point to a file named ' passwd ' in a different directory .
If the replacement operation occurs between when ' find ' sets {} to " /tmp/hacker...etc / passwd " and when 'rm ' calls unlink on " /tmp/hacker...etc / passwd " , then rm will in fact delete ' / etc / passwd ' , and not a file in / tmp .
Deleting other files is left as an exercise .
The race condition is really easy to win .
Create a directory with 400 path components , like this : /tmp/hacker-fest/a/a/a/a/a/a/a.../a/a/a/etc/passwd ( 1 ) Then arrange for each of the ' a ' components to be a symlink to a directory somewhere near the bottom of a similar tree .
For example , / tmp / hacker - fest / a could be a symlink to / tmp / hacker - fest/b/b/b/b/b/b/b/b/b/.../b/b/b/b/b/b/a
which could be a symlink to / tmp / hacker - fest /
c/c/c/c/c/c/.../c/c/c/c/c/c/c and so on .
In fact , * each * path component can be a symlink up to about 8 levels or so .
Any operation such as stat ( ) , open ( ) , lstat ( ) , etc. on one of these pathnames will cause the kernel to follow each and every symlink .
The difference between lstat ( ) and stat ( ) in this case is that lstat ( ) will not follow the * last * symlink .
This will make lstat ( ) and friends * extremely * slow , on the order of several * minutes * per lstat ( ) operation , because each lstat ( ) is now reading in several thousand inodes and disk blocks .
If you fill each directory with several hundred entries , then create the entry you want , then delete the others , you force the kernel to waste its time reading kilobytes of empty directory blocks -- in fact , you can make one stat ( ) or unlink ( ) operation read almost the entire disk in an order designed to maximize disk head motion if you know what you 're doing .
If you have an NFS , CDROM , or floppy - disk filesystem handy , you can get * weeks * per lstat ( ) .
Of course , ' find ' will normally see the first symlink and stop .
To prevent this , you rename the original directory ( at ( 1 ) above ) and create another directory with the same name and about 5000 empty files , some of which have the same name as files you want to delete .
Note that these 5000 empty files can all be hard links to the same file , to save precious inodes for more of those symlinks .
' find ' will spend considerable time iterating through these 5000 files .
When it does ( you 'll be able to tell because the atime of the directory changes as find reads it ) , put the directory with the millions of symlinks at ( 1 ) back with a couple of rename operations .
Some versions of ' find ' will not be adversely impacted by this , but ' rm ' definitely will .
It is usually sufficient to simply create the 400 - component - long directory , put 5000 files in it , wait for the atime of the directory to change , then do the rename so that ' rm ' follows a symlink .
I used this technique to remove /etc / crontab as a test case .
If you have : /tmp/hacker-fest/a/a/a/a/a/.../a/etc/passwd ( and 5000 + other files ) /tmp/hacker-fest/a/a/a/a/a/.../a/usr where ' usr ' is a symlink to ' / usr ' , you can get some implementations of find to start recursing through / usr as well .
* OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THIS CRONTAB
A user can set the atime of any file they own to an arbitrary value , and that programs like zip , tar , and cpio will do this for you automatically ; this makes ' atime ' an almost useless indicator of when a file was last used ( ' mtime ' has the same problem ) .
Either the file will be deleted too early , because it was extracted from an archive using a program that preserves timestamps , or users can set the atime to well into the future and use / tmp space indefinitely .
The later of ctime ( to detect writes ) and atime ( to detect reads ; must check that atime is not in the future ) is a good indicator of when a file was last used .
Miscellaneous bugs : the use of '*' means that files in a directory named '. foo ' will never be cleaned ( and you can prevent ' find ' from working at all by putting more than 1020 files in / tmp ) .
There are subdirectories of / var / catman that are n't properly handled by the ' find ' command given ( local and X11 ) .
You can't delete a directory with 'rm - f ' .
In other words , not only is RedHat 's /etc / crontab a major security hole , it does n't actually work properly , either . :( * FIXES
The easiest way to fix this is to get rid of the find / rm stuff completely .
If you need a garbage collector , try our LRU garbage collection daemon at the URL given below .
Adding a system call that sets a flag that prevents a process from being able to ever follow a symlink would be non-portable , but efficient and effective .
The next easiest way to fix this is to replace ' rm ' with a program that does not follow symlinks .
It must check that each filename component in turn by doing an lstat ( ) of the directory , chdir ( ) into the directory , and further lstat ( ) s to check that the device / inode number of '. ' is the same as the directory 's device / inode number before chdir ( ) .
The parameter of the ' unlink ' or ' rmdir ' system call must not contain a slash ; if it does , then the directory name before the slash can be replaced by a symlink to a different directory between verification of path components and the actual unlink ( ) call .
Another way to fix this is with a smarter version of find .
A smart find does the chdir ( ) and lstat ( ) checks to make sure that it never crosses a symlink , and calls the program in ' exec ' using a filename with no directory components , relative to the current directory .
Thus , to delete : /tmp/hacker-fest/a/a/a/a/a/.../etc/passwd find first carefully ( checking for attempts to exploit race conditions before and * after* each chdir ( ) ) chdir ( ) s into /tmp/hacker - fest/a/a/a/a/a/.../etc
and will fail if any of the components is a symlink , plugging the hole described above .
After verifying that the ' ... / etc ' is really a subdirectory of / tmp , and not some random point on the filesystem , find exec 's the command : rm -f ./ passwd which is secure as long as '. ' is n't in your PATH .
Note the leading './' to prevent rm from interpreting the filename as a parameter .
Note : this is in * addition * to the checks that find already makes to determine whether a file is a symlink * before * chdir ( ) ing into it .
It must make sure that components of the path that have * already * been tested are not replaced with symlinks or renamed directories * after * find has started processing subdirectories of them .
Note that the ' smart ' find without the post - chdir symlink tests wo n't work .
While smart - find is processing : /tmp/hacker-fest/a/a/a/a/*
you can rename / tmp / hacker - fest/a/a/a/a to /tmp/hacker-fest/a/a/b
( note : one less pathname component ) and eventually smart - find will 'cd ..' , but since the current directory of find has moved , '..' will move as well , and eventually smart - find will be one level too high and can start descending into other subdirectories of '/ '.
To help this along you may need to create : /tmp/hacker-fest/usr /tmp/hacker-fest/var etc. * SAFE LRU GARBAGE COLLECTION
Our LRU / tmp garbage collector daemon is available at < URL : http://www.ultratech.net/~zblaxell/admin_utils/filereaper.txt>.
It is implemented in perl5 .
It depends on a Linux - specific ' statfs ( ) ' system call to monitor available free space , so non-Linux people will need to do a port ( send me patches and I 'll incorporate them ) .
Our garbage collector : handles the above security problems correctly , handles pathnames more than 1024 characters , uses smarter last - access estimates than just atime or ctime , can support " permanent " subdirectories , handles files , symlinks , directories , devices , mount points correctly , can support minimum age of files ( e.g. no files < 1 day old ) , deletes oldest files first , deletes files only when disk space is low , and responds in less than ten seconds to low disk space conditions .
Our garbage collector works on any directory where files can gracefully disappear at arbitrary times , such as / var / catman , / tmp , / var / tmp , TeX font directories , and our HTTP proxy cache .
One directory where the garbage collector does n't work very well is / var / spool / news ; we had to hack things up a bit to fix the article databases when article files disappear .

Kinetic sculptures are simply breathtaking .
Drawing green engineering and art together , they give a glimpse at what great beauty can emerge from an unconstrained mind .
Perhaps the world will overflow with these spectacles in a time of better education and less strife .
Here are five fantastic videos of the very best work .

" The walls between art and engineering exist only in our minds , " says Jensen as the video ends .
In 1977 , as part of its wide - ranging re-examination of capital punishment , the Supreme Court prohibited the death penalty for rape .
While that ruling , Coker v. Georgia , did not specifically discuss the rape of a child  the victim , although only 16 , was a married woman who was raped at knifepoint  the decision has been widely understood as limiting the death penalty to the crime of murder .
In the principal opinion in the Coker case , Justice Byron R. White wrote that “ we have the abiding conviction that the death penalty , which is unique in its severity and irrevocability , is an excessive penalty for the rapist who , as such , does not take human life . ”
But in recent years , a handful of states , responding to public outcries about sex crimes against children , have amended their death penalty statutes to make the rape of a child a capital offense .
Louisiana was the first to do so , amending its death - penalty law in 1995 to apply to the rape of a child under the age of 12 .
The other states with similar provisions are Georgia , Montana , Oklahoma , South Carolina and Texas .
Unlike Louisiana , most limit the death penalty to defendants who were previously convicted of sexual assault against a child .
The Louisiana Supreme Court rejected Mr. Kennedy ’s appeal last year in a 64 - page opinion that concluded that “ rape of a child under the age of 12 years of age is like no other crime ” and that death was not a disproportionate punishment .
Taking note of the recent state laws , the court said there was “ compelling ” evidence of a national trend toward treating the crime as distinct from others .
The United States Supreme Court ’s recent death penalty jurisprudence has paid close attention to evidence of whether contemporary society has reached a consensus on particular applications of capital punishment .
The court relied on such an analysis to rule out the death penalty for mentally retarded defendants in 2002 and for juvenile killers in 2005 .
Louisiana is now invoking the same approach to argue that an application of the death penalty once widely deemed unconstitutional has become permissible .
Pundits and pols who have been tracking President Bush ’s constitutional transgressions can add another to the list : his Dec. 28 “ pocket veto ” of the massive defense spending bill .
Instead of issuing a regular veto , which allows Congress the opportunity to override if it can muster the votes , Bush stated that he needed to pocket veto the bill -- a power the Constitution says may only be used when “ Congress by their Adjournment prevent [ the bill ’s ] Return . ”
Bush argued that he was “ prevented ” from “ returning ” the bill to Congress because the House had adjourned .
But Bush was being disingenuous .
In fact , a pocket veto was neither necessary nor allowed in this case .
In misusing his veto power , Bush was attempting to grab a power for himself and his office that the Constitution ’s framers emphatically and repeatedly denied to the president : a nearly unlimited , absolute veto .
Let me explain .
The Constitution requires the president to sign or veto any bill sent to his desk by Congress .
In most cases , when a bill is vetoed , it is sent back to Congress , which then has the option to override the veto if it can achieve a two - thirds vote in both the House and the Senate .
Under certain limited circumstances , however , the president may issue a pocket veto , a form of rejection in which he does not sign the bill or return it to Congress -- and the bill dies after 10 days .
Congress has no opportunity to override the veto .
Article I , Section 7 of the Constitution stipulates the two conditions necessary for a pocket veto .
The first is congressional adjournment .
The second condition is that bill return is “ prevented . ”
These two linked conditions acknowledge the existence of adjournments when bill return is possible -- and the current situation is just such a case .

Although it ’s true that the House has adjourned until Jan. 15 , it has designated its clerk to receive communications from the White House , including veto messages , meaning that bill return was possible .
This little - known but routine mechanism has been used thousands of times for decades by Congress during long weekends , vacations and breaks ( just as the White House ’s Office of the Executive Clerk receives bills from Congress on behalf of the president when he is absent or indisposed ) .
The Senate , for its part , has not adjourned at all , technically ; a few of its members have been holding brief sessions every two or three days to forestall Bush from making any recess appointments .
Congressional and presidential use of agents to represent their branches has met constitutional muster .
As the Supreme Court said in 1938 , “ The Constitution does not define what shall constitute a return of a bill or deny the use of appropriate agencies in effecting the return . ”
The founders inserted the pocket veto in the Constitution to prevent Congress from passing a bill and adjourning to prevent an anticipated veto .
But they made it conditional so it would not be abused by the president ; they emphatically rejected the idea that the president should have an absolute , monarchical veto that could not be overridden .

In this case , Bush tried to have it both ways .
He pocket vetoed the bill as if Congress were entirely out of session -- but then he did , in fact , return it to Congress by sending it and an outline of his objections to the House clerk .
He did so , according to his veto message , “ to leave no doubt that the bill is being vetoed . ”
Bush ’s dodgy veto gambit mimics similar action by his father , who claimed pocket vetoes of two bills that he also returned to Congress .
In both instances , Congress rejected the president ’s claims and instead treated the bills as “ returned . ”
Neither was overridden .
In 2000 , President Clinton tried the same thing three times , prompting leaders of both parties to object .
All three were treated as return vetoes ; these were n’t overridden either .
If this all sounds like constitutional arcania , consider the outcome if Bush ’s faux pocket veto stands unchallenged : Presidents would have absolute veto power any time Congress is not actually in session , bestowing on the chief executive the very authority the founders sought to deny the office .
And why did Bush use this veto gambit now ?
Maybe because the bill in question passed by veto - proof margins .

Regardless of the motive , the Constitution does not allow presidents to pick the kind of veto they wish to use , and it certainly does not condone a pocket veto just because an override is likely .
The existing regular veto is plenty potent , and Congress cannot be denied its constitutional right to review vetoes as long as bill return is possible .
Congress should do what it did before : treat Bush ’s action as a return veto because the bill was returned .
And presidents should curb the impulse to play fast and loose with constitutional powers .

The worst part of his idea is the first - time offender requirement .
Many drug offenders have prior possession convictions .
That should n't exclude them from the remedial and fairly minor sentence reductions instituted by the Sentencing Commission .
As to crimes of violence , past crimes of violence not associated with the crack offense which is eligible for a reduction should n't enter into it .
Yet , that 's just what Mukasey wants :
The Justice Department estimates that two - thirds of federal inmates serving time for crack cocaine also have violent criminal histories or gun charges in their pasts .
" We think it is imperative for Congress to pass legislation to address the Sentencing Commission 's decision , " Mukasey wrote to the House committee .
Question : If Mukasey gets someone to introduce legislation to block releases along the lines he is suggesting , will Hillary and Obama show up to vote , the way they did for FISA ?
And how will they vote ?
I wo n't be surprised if both ( yes both ) agree with Mukasey .
Obama has frequently couched his support for reducing mandatory minimums and drug sentences in terms of non-violent , first offenders .
Hillary has said she opposes retroactivity in principle , for safety concerns .
As I 've said frequently , there 's very little difference between them on drug sentencing .
When Mukasey 's written testimony becomes available and I have had a chance to read it in full , I 'll update this post .

In - N- out Burger .
6:00 p.m. I say to my girlfriend in line beside me , " I want a burger , but I 'm tired of all that bun . "
A bearded 20 - something walks past and says , " protein style , lady . "
Confused , I look at the menu .
No mention there .
But the cheerful teen behind the counter nods approvingly and asks , " you want it that way , wrapped in lettuce , not a bun ? "
Great idea , I say .
And just like that , I 'm in on the secret .
Menu , that is .
Turns out , that 's just one of the many so - called " secret menu " items at this famed California fast foodery .
( They 're posted on the website , though not in the brick and mortar spot . )
And it 's only part of a bigger feast fad known as " the secret menu . "
Try the McBruschetta at the Golden Arches ( toasted tomatoes , onions , bun ) , the Naked Chicken at Popeye 's ( meat , no breading ) , or the Short Cappucino at Starbucks ( more intense brew served in a kid's cup ) .
This is strictly grass - roots stuff , however .
Most of these items are not official .
( In - N - Out Burger executives deny a secret menu , calling the Web list a customer service . )
They 're the fruit of enterprising , empowered customers taste - testing their way into new territory on their local fast - food turf .
The top combinations rise like cream to become unofficial " secret menu " items that spread through word of mouth and repeated orders .
Big shots in swanky nightspots have always been able to order a sirloin seared to personal taste .
But custom eats for the common man are relatively new .
According to a number of food experts , it 's part of a feasting frenzy fed by Internet chatter and the explosion of foodie reality TV shows – " Top Chef , " " Hell 's Kitchen , " etc. – that makes everybody feel like a gastronomic insider , no matter their budget .
The secret menu appears to be on the upswing , so I decide to taste - test this theory on local terrain .
I press Monitor intern , Alison Tully , into service – she hits Jamba Juice and Starbucks ; I take the rest .
In - N - Out , which used to be the Golden State 's own fast - food secret with its freshly stamped fries and authentic shakes , is known for its helpful servers .
It 's also famous for offering a select , few items on that glowing outdoor board – basic burgers , shakes , sodas , and fries .
I speak my secret desires – in proper lingo gleaned from the website – into the squawk box , " a two by two , animal style , and a neopolitan . "
Translation : a two - patty mustard burger , with everything , including extra sauce and grilled onions , and a three flavor shake ( chocolate , vanilla , strawberry ) .
The box cheerily blasts back , " Pay at the first window , please .
Have a nice day ! "
Say goodbye to the days of " Five Easy Pieces , " when Jack Nicholson could n't get toast at a coffee shop because it was n't on the menu .
Things get stickier for Alison at Starbucks .
" We do n't have a secret menu , " says the barrista , who wo n't give his name .
He points to the overhead menu .
A nicer cohort nearby rolls her eyes and offers Alison " anything she wants , " which is of course , the soul of the secret menu .
Over at Jamba Juice , however , she hits the sweet spot , scoring the distinctly non-health - bar - sounding White Gummi Bear ( a complex smoothie concoction that tastes like the rubbery candy ) , Strawberry Shortcake , and Push Pop smoothies , no questions asked .
Apple - cheeked teen server , Daryl , says " the majority of our customers order secret menu stuff . "
Why is this , I ask a national food expert by phone .
" Cachet , " answers Joyce Weinberg , president of New York Food Tours , a culinary - adventure firm .
" Who does n't like to be in the know ? "
Besides , she adds , this is the " my " generation .
" They 've all grown up thinking they can have the world their way . "
It 's a win-win , says Paul Dholakia , an associate management professor at Rice University in Houston .
It 's pure genius from the restaurant 's point of view , he adds .
" It 's the best way to get around the barriers we 've all put up against commercial messages that I 've seen in a long time .
People actually seek these things out . "
Just like me , and now … Alison .
But suddenly I need to know – how far can this go ?
I try out my new , have - it - my - way persona at a local mall smoothie counter , Surf City .
I peruse the menu , then order what I dub the " Berry Pleaser . "
" Make me a medium with blueberries , strawberries , raspberries , and a hint of mango . "
The server squints , then hauls out three brightly colored jars .
She dumps red , blue , and yellow globs into a blender .
One short burst of whirrr !
later and I give her an approving nod .
All secrets should be so delicious .

The drug improves blood flow , which in adults can boost erectile function but in rare cases such as Oliver 's can open the veins and capillaries to aid circulation .

Still upbeat : Oliver Sherwood , 2 , suffers from pulmonary hypertension which affects his breathing
" We 're just hoping it 'll continue to work as he grows a bit older . "
But Oliver 's future could be in doubt because other drugs he could use as he gets older might no longer be funded by the Health Service .
Pulmonary hypertension causes the blood pressure in the arteries in the lungs to rise , straining the heart and reducing blood oxygen levels , causing breathlessness and exhaustion .
Symptoms include severe coughing and breathing problems as blood fills the lungs , constant nose bleeds , dizziness and chest pains .
The condition , which affects 4,000 in Britain , often leads to heart failure .
It is so rare that only five children a year are diagnosed with it in the UK .
The survival rate is around five years , even with medication such as
Oliver , who cannot walk more than a few steps without getting out of breath , takes one tablet of Sildenafil crushed into four 5 ml doses a day .
Doctors can increase the dose when his condition worsens , but there is no way of telling how much longer the drugs will be effective .

Oliver 's mother has started a petition calling for the Health Service to keep funding the treatments .
Mrs Sherwood , 34 , of Hucclecote , Gloucestershire , said : " The only hope we had was that he would be maintained through medication but if anything - happens in the future that hope may be taken away . "

A spokesman for NICE added : " Our review of the evidence suggests that Sildenafil is both clinically effective and cost - effective in treating pulmonary arterial hypertension . "
Tired of presidents with ' a bad brain , ' doctor demands brain scans Mike Aivaz and Jason Rhyne
Published : Thursday December 6 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Candidates vying for the presidency already face intense scrutiny from voters , the media and political rivals ' crack opposition research operations -- but that 's not enough for one doctor : he demands brain scans .
Dr. Daniel Amen , a neuropsychiatrist and brain - imaging expert , says that scans of the human brain can reveal dysfunction and even predict degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer 's disease .
In an interview with MSNBC's Tucker Carlson , Amen said that the technology could be used to effectively vet future presidents .
" For years , what I have thought about , talked about , is we should be scanning the brains of presidential candidates , " said Amen .
" Because a president with a bad brain can ruin life on earth ... I 'm sort of tired of presidents who 've had a bad brain that are not leading the country in a good direction . "
Asked by Carlson if the current electoral process , including presidential primaries , was its own kind of informal " scan , " Amen insisted that taking an actual look at a candidate 's brain was far more telling .
" That certainly gives good information , " he said of the primary process , " but did you know that brain scans can predict five to ten years before people have symptoms whether or not they 're vulnerable to Alzheimer 's disease ?
And several of our candidates are older ... I would argue that President Reagan , in his second term , had evidence of memory lapses .
And that 's sort of a national crisis . "
Deficiencies in former President Clinton 's thinking -- which Amen believes could have lead to the Monica Lewinsky flap -- could have also been exposed by such a scan , he says .
" President Clinton was known to have issues with judgment and impulse control ... that was a very divisive political scandal that came out of , I would say , bad brain function . "
As for President Bush , a Wednesday editorial from Amen in the Los Angeles Times argues that some of the commander - in - chief 's perceived weaknesses may be traced to brain fitness .
" One could argue that our current president 's struggles with language and emotional rigidity are symptoms of temporal lobe pathology , " writes Amen .
" The temporal lobes , underneath your temples and behind your eyes , are involved with language , mood stability , reading social cues and emotional flexibility . "
Concludes Amen in the Times , " Ensuring that our president has a healthy brain may be more than an interesting topic of conversation .
It can be important information to put into the election equation .
A president with brain problems could wreak havoc on the U.S. and the world at large . "

Story excerpted from National Geographic 's November issue .
I imagine the sight of Death Valley National Park is something akin to scientific pornography for hard - rock geologists .
There are the obvious soaring mountains and abysmal valleys , of course .
But in most other places on Earth , the folding and buckling of rocks , the colliding of crustal plates , the shores of advancing and retreating lakes , the evidence of volcanic activity , the scrape of glaciers across rock , the subtle and not so subtle effects of erosion are covered over in grass or dirt , in snow or ice .
The Earth is a modest mother , but Death Valley is , for the most part , naked .
It is also the only place on Earth where geology itself has made me laugh out loud .
I am thinking specifically of an area in the northwest section of Death Valley called the Racetrack , where , inexplicably , rocks as big as microwave ovens go zipping across the desiccated mud for distances of more than half a mile .
The evidence is all there : deep tracks in the surface , with a rock at the end .
One concludes , reluctantly , that the rocks somehow traveled a couple of hundred yards , leaving a telltale trail behind .
There are over 150 of these roving rocks .
But no one has ever seen them move .
The Racetrack proper , about 3 miles long and a mile wide , is what is called a playa , a dry , smooth lake bed .
The Racetrack is a mere 2 inches higher on the north end than the south .
Flat as a pool table .
The surface is sun-baked mud , hard as rock , and patterned in polygons the size of doughnuts .
It is an otherworldly sight , and there is a sense on the playa of post - apocalyptic silence , broken only by the whisper and wail of the wind .
This impression is compounded by the Grandstand , a 73 - foot - high island of rounded bedrock at the north end that looks like the summit of a mountain buried in a sea of sediment .
One supposes that observers - rock - racing fans - might sit on the Grandstand , as at a horse race , and observe stones zooming toward them from the southern end of the playa .
I had plenty of time to contemplate the Grandstand .
I 'd driven 30 miles from Ubehebe Crater , and the gravel road proved to be less brutal than expected , so I arrived at the Racetrack in the early afternoon .
The best time to see the rock raceways is around dawn or dusk , when the slanting rays of the sun show the tracks to their best advantage .
To pass the time , I climbed to a ridge off nearby Ubehebe Peak for one of the most spectacular views in the park .
On this February day , the temperature stood in the low 70s and made for pleasant climbing .
When I reached the ridge , the slope dropped off like a cliff to the west , where I could see the sands and salt pans of the Saline Valley 4,000 feet below .
And that is one definition of Death Valley :
It is a land of intense vertical relief .
This is true of most of southeastern California , a region torn by earthquakes , once flooded with vast inland seas and eroded by wind and rain .
Nevertheless , it is primarily rising mountains and falling valley floors that create the astonishing counterpoint of land that lies hundreds of feet below sea level guarded by peaks rising two miles above .
Slow tectonic torture corrugates the landscape as two massive crustal plates meet and slide past each other under California : the Pacific and North American plates .
The ridge on Ubehebe Peak was a good place to contemplate this ongoing process .
When I turned around , to the east , I was looking directly down onto the Racetrack and the Grandstand .
In the desolate wind on the exposed ridge , the Grandstand rocks looked like the very tips of buried buildings , like an undiscovered city swallowed up in silt , like alien and interred skyscrapers .
At the far edge of the Racetrack a multigenerational Japanese family walking on the playa looked as if they were skating across an ice rink .
Soon enough , I was walking on the flat , feeling a mild sense of vertigo , a bit of dizziness that suggested I might just fall off .
How ?
Where ?
I do n't know , but try talking sense to your inner ear .
At the south end of the Racetrack , where the playa abuts an 850 - foot - high mountain face , rocks had tumbled from elevation out onto the playa .
Some were the size of softballs , others suitcases .
These rocks did not gather any moss .
They were movers .
Robert Sharp and Allen Glazner , in their book Geology Underfoot in Death Valley and Owens Valley , explain the process .
The playa receives 3 to 4 inches of rain a year during winter storms and summer cloudbursts .
Parts of the Racetrack flood .
Fine , intensely slippery clay settles , and the winds , which may reach 90 miles an hour , must overcome the forces of friction for the rocks to break free .
Once that happens , it takes only about half the wind power to keep the rocks moving .
Some rocks made straight paths , some curved .
Some traveled a hundred yards in one direction , stopped in a muddy muddle , apparently thought better of their direction , and made a 180 - degree turn to ramble off in another direction .
Some trails were wide for a while , narrow , then wide again .
Occasionally , half a dozen rocks took off at once from the base of the mountain and seemed to race straight toward the Grandstand like horses at the derby .
The tracks often crossed one another .
I followed dozens of them , and when I found the rocks at the terminuses of the tracks , they seemed almost sentient .
Why this made me laugh , I can not say .

What is Quark Matter ?
Quarks can only exist in certain combinations of two or three , forming a hadron ( pion , proton , kaon , ... )
A single quark cannot be alone in the vacuum ( it would then have infinite energy ) it is therefore not a " particle " in the usual sense , like the hadrons .
However , the quarks experience one of the fundamental forces ( the strong interaction = gluon exchange between quarks ) .
This gluon exchange represents the elementary form of the strong force , whereas the hadronic interaction is an extremely complicated secondary phenomenon : an effective force that we call nuclear force .
Ordinary matter , from atomic nuclei to neutron stars , owes its existence , stability and structure to this effective force .
The quarks are at the source of this interaction , but they stay confined , in doublets or triplets , to the interior of the hadrons .
A more fundamental state of matter , as structured by the strong interaction would be obtained if one could " melt " the hadron bubbles in ordinary nuclear matter ( composed of protons and neutrons ) , such as to deconfine the quarks from the hadron volume to the extended volume of an entire atomic nucleus .
Such a state , if it exists , would be called Quark Matter .

Serenity : Oh God , Oh God , We 're All Going to Die October 13 , 2007
Martin Lee Anderson was sent to a boot camp for juvenile offenders at the age of 14 .
The first day there , he threw a fit at the exercises , like most 14 year olds faced with what looks to them like pointless indoctrination .
He wanted to stop , he called it bullshit .
Typical 14 year old rebellion .
And , of course , you can't have that in a boot camp .
You have to have fast discipline .
So , the guards jumped the kid and " forced him " to continue the exercises .
They held him down , they put him in take - down , they applied pressure points ... and I gotta say , I 'm not sure how those things are forcing the boy to continue exercising ... sounds pretty much like forcing him to be still , to me .
Finally , they forced him to inhale ammonia .
During this process , the boy went " unresponsive " in official - ese .
The first autopsy declared that the boy had a previously - undiagnosed blood disease which the staff could n't have known .
And that this was the cause of death .
Announced five weeks after the boy 's death .
Video showed the boy being kicked and punched .
And ammonia capsules being shoved up his nose .
The family screamed .
A second autopsy was called for , the dead boy exhumed to be examined again , this time by the coroner of the county as well as several other forensic pathologists and a New York State Police coroner as well .
The results indicated that the boy did have the " trait " of the blood disorder ( meaning it was pretty much a non-issue rather than an active disease ) .
They also noted that despite the bruising , the boy was not beaten to death .
According to the press release by the state attorney , nearly 5 months after the boy 's death :
Martin Anderson 's death was caused by suffocation due to actions of the guards at the boot camp .
The suffocation was caused by manual occlusion of the mouth , in concert with forced inhalation of
ammonia fumes that caused spasm of the vocal cords resulting in internal blockage of the upper airway .
Governor Jeb Bush claimed he was disturbed by the findings and that he would ensure that justice was served .
Was Martin a bad kid who deserved to be beaten the first day at the camp ?
According to the BBC , " The teenager had been sent to the camp for violating probation by trespassing at a school after he and his cousins were charged with stealing their grandmother 's car from a church parking lot . "
So , the eight various employees found themselves embroiled in a criminal suit .
Their defense ?
They used the procedures of the camp , designed to instill discipline .
They claimed the boy was faking illness to get out of the exercises .
The response to Martin 's death has been that all of the state 's bootcamps are now closed .
The head of the department of law enforcement stepped down .
The verdict has now come back after just 90 minutes of deliberation .
Despite the fact that Governor Charlie Crist recommended the state pay $ 5 million to the family , the jury has found the 8 defendants not guilty .
The all - white jury .
Sitting in on the trial in which a 14 year old black boy was killed .
For whatever reason , I do n't normally think of Florida as a part of " The South . "
Georgia is , of course , but for some reason , Florida is just kind of a separate entity , I suppose , in its own way like Texas is and Alaska and Hawaii .
When I look at an all white jury taking just 90 minutes to decide this case dealing with the death of a 14 year old black boy ...
I have to re-think my gut reaction to not consider Florida a part of The South .
And I know better , really .
I know that it does n't matter what state we discuss .
There are still numerous cases of racism around the United States , on a regular basis .
When Martin was killed , there had been ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY complaints of excessive force at the boot camp where he'd been killed .
After Martin 's death , the use of ammonia capsules was banned .
After Martin 's death the use of violent measures such as punching and kicking the inmates of the camps was banned .
Approximately four months after Martin 's death , the boot camps were closed .
Was Martin Lee Anderson killed because he was a black boy ?
Were the employees directly involved in his death acquitted because they were judged by a white jury ?
I do n't know .
I suspect these things are true .
I suspect this because of my own experience .
I fear that this is true and it hurts me .
Recently , a young man on BlogCatalog asked Do You Care About Racism ?
And I had to respond , hell yes I care .
I had to respond that I do think about this every day .
Do I care because of Martin Anderson ?
Yes , it 's true that his story makes me care .
It 's true that the story of the Jena 6 makes me care .
But I also care about the issue of racism because of what I , personally , witness every day .
Not in " The South . " I witness it in northern Indiana .
I watch as people cringe from the dark - skinned black man across the street .
I watch as people make fun of the Orthodox Jews who walk through our neighborhood on their way to shul .
I watch as people treat the latinos in town as less than human .
I watch , and I try to not stay silent .
I try to NOT be the voyeur witnessing the pain of others .
And I get " that look " from my " fellow " whites .
They are not happy with me , and I do n't care .
For whatever reason , as a child , I knew that there was no difference between myself and " them mexicans . "
There was no difference between me and Jon Comb , who happened to be Jewish .
There was no difference between me and Paula , the black girl who befriended me in junior high .
The only difference between " them " and " us " was circumstance .
Colour did not enter into it .
Other people 's perceptions of us coloured who they thought we were .
But it really did n't matter which of us was white , brown or black .
I mostly do not see colour , myself .
I have n't seen colour since I was about seven .
Why can't everyone else ?
Why does it matter to ANYONE if someone is black , brown , yellow or white ?
What does it matter if they are Catholic , Jewish , Protestant , Hindu or Muslim ?
Why must we keep sticking our noses into other peoples ' private lives ?
Do I care about racism ?
I hurt knowing that people cannot celebrate differences but must instead rail about anyone different from themselves .
So , yeah .
I care .
Not about the various colours of the people I know and do n't know .
I care that others are not colour blind .
I care that people even fucking notice the difference between Jamaal and Chaim and John and Juan .
But what really haunts me ?
What really haunts me this month of October ... this month of the dead ...
are the number of dead in the name of " I 'm right and you 're not " ... whether we 're talking race or religion or just good old - fashioned us versus them .
Does this haunt you ?

Yes - on all fronts .............
What a stunning post .
The circumstances around Martin 's death sound like the circumstances around the plot of " A Few Good Men " -- a cover up of a death due to a previously " unseen medical condition . "
Very sad that we live in a world like this .
It is haunting .
Wow .
Another great post , ender .
I am glad that the boot camps are closed , they should never have been allowed to open in the first place .
And the 90 minute not guilty says to me that we are not nearly as far from Selma , in space or in time , as us loony liberals on the Left coast would like to think .
Very well thought out and written post .
I grew up in Florida , South Central Florida in particular and it is very much part of the south .
It 's only the coasts and Orlando that give the illusion of non-Southernness .
In school I was in a gifted program in a very small school district .
Because of the scale , there were only eight of us in the program and that eight included five white kids , two Cuban kids , and one black kid .
As a result of having all our classes together and segregated from the school as a whole , we all became rather colorblind .
We were all competitive among ourselves and ones worth and standing in that small group was based on your brain and had nothing to do with race or color .
Having the opportunity to work in a team like that changed me by creating a different path for me than that taken by the rest of my family .
The one black boy in our program , Michael , came over to my house after school to work on a project for which we were teamed .
After working with me at the dining room table for an hour or so , my stepfather came home and announced that Michael needed to go home .
As soon as Michael was gone I got reamed for " bringing a nigger into my house " .
This was not because of anything Michael or any black individual had ever done .
It was just intellectual laziness and apathy on my stepfather 's part .
He did n't know anyone of another race and did n't care to know any .
He had taken the easy and lazy route by internalizing stereotypes and beliefs that he was exposed to his whole life and it was less work to let them play out than it would have been to learn that those beliefs were wrong .
Sing it , ender !
That 's the best post I 've read on any blog in a long time .
And I 'm right there with you .
Yes ... Yes it haunts me as well ...
Incredible thought process and so eloquently executed my friend !
Myths and legends
Always remember , the compiler is your friend .
Programming is stressful but no matter how many f**ks and b*** ocks you might occasionally feel the need to insert into the comments , the compiler will always strip them out .
It 's great .
Of course , it does n't actually go looking for rude words .
So it would be a mistake to use them haphazardly .
But that 's OK because programmers who work for large , well - established companies would never make that mistake .
Let me take you back to September 1992 , when " collaboration " software was known as productivity software , ISVs wrestled with the decision of whether to support a relatively new thing called Windows from Microsoft , and when Borland Software shipped the mighty Quattro Pro for Windows version 1.0 .
As one of the first Windows - based spreadsheets , Quattro Pro - since sold to Corel and now part of WordPerfect Office - was a fabulous product , way ahead of its time .
Certainly ahead of Microsoft 's then - young Excel and Office .
It featured multiple pages and right - click access to a properties menu , both of which are common features now but were staggeringly innovative then .
It also , predictably , had a button bar but even this had a twist : it was fully customizable and you could create your own .
Each new button bar was stored as a file on disk so if you created a bar called Penguin , for example , a file called PENGUIN .
BAR appeared .
This was in the days of the change over from DOS to Windows , so it was still common to use the DOS prompt as well as the GUI .
One of the commands available in DOS is " Type " , which displays on screen the typeable characters in any file .
Now there was no good reason to " Type " one of the .BAR files but , if you did so , the name of the file appeared - so it must have been embedded into the file header - followed by an assortment of random characters .
Borland supplied several sample button bars with arty names like PICASSO .
BAR and MONET .
BAR and also one called SECOND .
BAR .
The latter name seemed like an odd choice beside its artistic brethren so , in a moment of boredom , I " Typed " it .
Instead of the expected SECOND appearing , the characters " FUCKME " appeared .
I was shocked .
No , that does n't really cover it : I was traumatised .
At the time I was completing a review of the product and had been in daily contact with the UK product manager , the charming and unflappable Frances Reay ( now Fawcett ) .
I rang her immediately to share the trauma .
Mark Whitehorn : Hi , Frances , do you happen to have Quattro Pro installed ?
Frances Reay :
Of course , what else would you expect from the product manager ?
MW : OK , would you do me a favour and pop down to DOS for a moment ?
( Clattering of fingers on keyboard heard down the phone ) .
FR : OK , I 'm there .
MW : Can you swap to the QPW directory ?
( More clattering of fingers ) .
MW : Now " Type " SECOND .BAR .
( Even more clattering of fingers , followed by a long pause ) .
FW : Well now , that 's interesting .
MW : Does your screen say what mine says ?
FR : More than likely .
I suppose I 'd better make some calls .
I may have been the first to report this to Borland , but I certainly was n't alone in discovering it .
Before I could publish the story in a magazine ( the long defunct PC User ) the news was rapidly spreading via email .
Frances passed the news on to Borland US with the result that the production lines in Ireland and the States were shut down and , as I was later told , Borland had to trash all those boxed copies that had n't escaped the warehouses .
Early copies of 1.0 instantly became collector 's items .
Ah , such happy days , but that kind of thing could never happen now , of course .
Oh , wait a minute . ®

Scientists are using a " synchroton " to study the Mary Rose 's timbers
How the " super - scope " lights up the Mary Rose
The research is taking place at the Diamond synchrotron , a beam - generating machine that covers the area of five football pitches .
Scientists are using the facility in a bid to fine - tune the conservation of the historic vessel 's timbers .
The Mary Rose , pride of Henry VIII 's English fleet , sank in 1545 and lay on the sea bed until being raised in 1982 .
The boat 's timbers are sprayed continuously
Researchers aim to find out how stable they are , as these can be converted to sulphuric acid when oxygen is present - threatening preservation efforts .
After sinking in the 16th Century , the Mary Rose lay on the bottom of the Solent for the next 400 years .
Thanks to a protective covering of sea-bed sediment , many of her timbers and artefacts remained intact when she was raised from the salty depths in 1982 .
Since then , scientists have been endeavouring to ensure the preservation of the historic vessel , which is housed at Portsmouth 's Historic Dockyard .
From 1994 , her hull timbers have been continuously sprayed with a water - soluble wax called polyethylene glycol .
The team is looking at sulphur and iron compounds in the timber
Dr Mark Jones , from the Mary Rose Trust , who is leading the research project , said : " It prevents the wood from distorting , shrinking , splitting , cracking or collapsing .
" But , in addition to that you have to remove some of the salts that have occurred over the many centuries - chlorides , which are easy to wash out , and the iron and sulphur compounds , which in the presence of oxygen can be converted into sulphuric acid . "
The biochemist said that over the last 15 years , researchers had successfully neutralised all of the acids in the wood and had removed the vast majority of the troublesome compounds .
Dr Jones told the BBC News website : " What we are now trying to do using Diamond technology is to investigate any remaining compounds that could present a threat in 20 , or 30 , or even 500 years time . "
Silver doughnut
The scientists , from the Mary Rose Trust , the National Museum of Scotland , Daresbury Laboratory and the University of Kent , have been placing thin slivers of the ship 's timber into the " microfocus beamline " at the Oxfordshire - based synchrotron .
The facility - sometimes described as a super - microscope - works by speeding electrons around a huge doughnut - shaped chamber until they are travelling so fast that they begin to emit light .
HOW DIAMOND WORKS
Electrons fired into straight accelerator , or linac Boosted in small synchrotron and injected into storage ring Magnets in large ring bend and focus electrons accelerated to near light - speeds Energy lost emerges down beamlines as highly focused light at X - ray wavelengths
Diamond starts to shine
These intense rays are then channelled off into beamlines and focused on to samples of material , like the Mary Rose timbers , allowing their fine structure to be analysed .
By observing the wood at the cellular level , the team has been able to look at compounds of sulphur and iron buried deep within the timbers .
Dr Jones said : " Over time , sulphur has bonded with the cell walls in the wood , producing a compound that is extremely stable and impossible to remove because it is so deep in the timber .
" With the help of Diamond and university research , we want to make sure that these compounds will remain stable over long , long periods of time under different display conditions . "
He added : " Essentially , what we are trying to do is to fine - tune the conservation process so that it lasts for many , many more centuries . "
Charles Barker , managing director of Mary Rose Archaeological Services , added : " It is all about looking at potential problems that might crop up that we do n't know about now . "
A Simple Haskell Web Server February 14 , 2008
I am always interested in web development as that is the industry I work in .
As I also have an interest in Haskell I decided to try out using Haskell for web development .
There are some innovative web frameworks developed in Haskell , such as HAppS and WASH .
There are also simpler approachs such as CGI and FastCGI libraries .
I decided to develop my own simple web server and framework as I was interested in how Haskell would fare with more conventional and simpler HTML and database backed web sites , but was after more flexibility to experiment than CGI based approaches can provide .
What I ’ve ended up with is not production quality by any means , but it provides a good and simple base to experiment and work from .
Thanks to the HTTP and network libraries it worked out to around 20 lines of code .
Below I present the primitive interface of the web server and its implmentation .
The Interface
The primitive interface for my Simple Haskell Web Framework ( SHWF ) reflects the HTTP protocol .
It defines a RequestHandler as a function that accepts a Request and will return a Response .
The Request and Response
To run a web server with a RequestHandler the runHttpServer method can be called .
type RequestHandler = Request -> IO Response runHttpServer :: RequestHandler -> IO ()
The Example
As an example of how the interface is used and as a basic test I developed a ‘ Hello World ’ application .
helloWorldHandler is a RequestHandler that will return a simple HTML document to every request .
The main function simply runs the server with that RequestHandler
main :: IO ( ) main = runHttpServer helloWorldHandler helloWorldHandler :: RequestHandler helloWorldHandler _ = return $ successReponse $ pretty Html helloWorldDoc successResponse :: String -> Response successResponse = Response ( 2,0,0 ) " " [ ] helloWorldDoc :: Html helloWorldDoc = header << thetitle << " Hello World " +++ body << h1 << " Hello World "
The Implementation
The runHttpServer function creates the socket that will accept connections .
It will then loop forever accepting connections on that socket and handling them .
runHttpServer :: RequestHandler -> IO ( ) runHttpServer r = withSocketsDo $ do sock <- listenOn ( PortNumber 8080 ) forever $ acceptConnection sock $ handleHttpConnection r
acceptConnection is a convenience method for accepting connections on a socket .
It is passed a continuation that will be called with a Handle that can be used to read and write data to and from the socket .
acceptConnection :: Socket -> ( Handle -> IO ( ) ) -> IO ( ) acceptConnection s k = accept s >>= \( h , _ , _ ) -> forkIO $ k h
To integrate with the HTTP library it is necessary to provide and instance of the Stream class for Handle .
The functions are quite straight forward , but it ’s important to note that readLine is expected to return the newline character on the end .
instance Stream Handle where readLine h = hGetLine h >>= \l -> return $ Right $ l ++ "
" readBlock h n = replicateM n ( hGetChar h ) >>= return .
Right writeBlock h s = mapM_ ( hPutChar h ) s >>= return .
Right close = hClose
In implementing the handleHttpConnection I decided to experiment with arrows .
Any function of type a -> m b can be made in to a Kleisli arrow .
This means that RequestHandler can easily be made an arrow of type Kleisli IO Request Response .
Using arrow functions it is possible to transform this to the required type of Kelisli IO Handle ( ) .
I ’m not sure that handleHttpConnectioni has turned out as clean as it could be .
I ’m not sure whether Kleisli arrows are not appropriate here , or whether I can simplify what I have .
handleHttpConnection :: RequestHandler -> Handle -> IO ( ) handleHttpConnection r c = runKleisli ( receiveRequest >>> handleRequest r >>> handleResponse ) c >> close c where receiveRequest = Kleisli receiveHTTP handleRequest r = right ( Kleisli r ) handleResponse = Kleisli ( print ||| respondHTTP c)
Improvments
The minimal interface should also make it easy to improve the server .
Some improvements that I hope will be straight forward include :
Exception handling , especially around the socket operations ,
Logging ,
Configuration , at least to allow a different port .
Conclusion
The server implemented is not production quality , but it does suit my purposes .
It is only around 20 lines , so is simple enough to understand .
I ’m hoping that its small size and ease of understanding makes it easier to experiment with .
Forget Mighty Mouse , it 's Bibleman !
Who 's Bibleman ?
He 's a " human transformed by the Word of God . "
Duh .
Bibleman , his " faithful sidekick Cypher " and Biblegirl are available as action figures and can be seen on DVD in such classics as Tuning Out the Unholy Hero , Breaking the Bonds of Disobedience and Conquering the Wrath of Rage .
Be afraid .
Be very afraid .
Berlin – AFP – Mar 22 , 2007 :
A German woman judge has refused a Moroccan - born woman permission to file for divorce by interpreting the Koran as allowing husbands to beat their wives .
“ Where are we living ?
Woman judge allows beating in marriage … and invokes the Koran , ” said a front - page headline in Germany ’s top- selling Bild newspaper , reflecting the widespread angry reaction on Thursday .
“ This Moroccan woman has the same right to protection from a violent husband as any German woman .
Anything else would be misconceived sensitivity to the benefit of the husband and would amount to racist discrimination against the wife , ” said the Tageszeitung daily .
The Central Council of Muslims in Germany also condemned the decision .
“ The judge should have made a decision based on the German constitution instead of the Koran , ” said spokeswoman Nurhan Soykan , who said that violence and mistreatment , regardless of the gender of the victim , were also grounds for divorce in the Islamic world .
Richard Knerr , co-founder of Wham - O Inc. , which unleashed the granddaddy of American fads , the Hula Hoop , on the world half a century ago along with another enduring leisure icon , the Frisbee , has died .
He was 82 .
Knerr died Monday at Methodist Hospital in Arcadia after suffering a stroke earlier in the day at his Arcadia home , said his wife , Dorothy .
With his boyhood best friend , Arthur “ Spud ” Melin , Knerr started the company in 1948 in Pasadena .
They named the enterprise Wham - O for the sound that their first product , a slingshot , made when it hit its target .
A treasure chest of dozens of toys followed that often bore playful names : Superball , so bouncy it seemed to defy gravity ; Slip ‘N Slide and its giggle - inducing cousin the Water Wiggle ; and Silly String , which was much harder to get out of hair than advertised .
When a friend told Knerr and Melin about a bamboo ring used for exercise in Australia , they devised their own version without seeing the original .
They ran an early test of the product in 1958 at a Pasadena elementary school and enticed their test subjects by telling them they could keep the hoops if they mastered them .
They seeded the market , giving hoops away in neighborhoods to create a buzz and required Wham - O executives to take hoops with them on planes so people would ask about them .
Wham - O soon was producing 20,000 hoops a day at plants in at least seven countries , while other companies made knockoffs .
Within four months , 25 million of the hoops had been sold , according to Wham -O .
In the 1985 book “ American Fads , ” Richard A. Johnson wrote that “ no sensation has ever swept the country like the Hula Hoop . ”
The craze also provided a significant business lesson .
“ In April of 1958 , people were standing around the block at department stores that were waiting to get their shipment , ” Knerr ’s son , Chuck , told The Times .
“ By September , you could n’t give them away .
Once every household had two or three , it was over because they lasted forever . ”
Wham - O toys often had an air of originality that Knerr called the “ wow ” factor .
He defined it as the moment when “ you ’re . . . showing it off and everybody says , ‘ What ’s that ?
What ’s that ? ’ ”
The company founders experienced their own “ wow ” moment when former Air Force pilot Fred Morrison was spotted at the beach playing with his invention , the Pluto Platter .
They bought the rights , modified it and renamed it Frisbee before releasing it in 1958 .
The name may have come from a comic strip called “ Mr. Frisbie ” or from the Frisbie Pie Co. tins that reportedly inspired the disk ’s invention .
Both versions of the story have been attributed to Knerr .
Initially , Frisbees were marketed by word of mouth on college campuses , and more than 100 million were sold in 30 years .
A professional model went on sale in the 1960s , and the team sport known as Ultimate Frisbee soon was played on college campuses .
Frisbee Dog World Championships have been held since 1975 .
“ We did n’t want it used as a toy , ” Melin told the Pasadena Star - News in 1998 .
“ We wanted it to be a sport . ”
Tom Wehrli , who has a canine Frisbee museum in his Chicago basement , called the company ’s story “ pure Americana . ”
“ Wham - O sold about 230 different items .
Our grandparents , guaranteed , touched a Wham - O product , ” Wehrli told The Times .
In 1982 , the founders sold the company for $ 12 million to Kransco Group Cos. Mattel Inc. bought Wham - O in 1994 and resold it to a group of investors in 1997 .
Richard Knerr was born June 30 , 1925 , in San Gabriel .
As a teenager , he met his future business partner , Melin , and the two remained lifelong friends .
They went to USC together , and Knerr earned a bachelor ’s degree in business in the late 1940s .
Neither wanted to work for their fathers -- Knerr ’s sold commercial real estate and Melin ’s was in the lumber business .
The duo started a business training falcons .
To teach the birds to dive at prey , they lobbed meatballs with a homemade slingshot .
“ I do n’t want a bird , one prospective customer said , but I ’d sure like a slingshot like that , ” Knerr said in Fortune Small Business magazine in 2003 .
So they bought a band saw and made slingshots in the Pasadena garage of Knerr ’s parents .
They also sold other novelty hunting tools such as boomerangs and crossbows .
Within a few years , they were making about $ 100,000 a year and moved their company to a building in San Gabriel .
At Wham - O , the duo -- when they were n’t taking bets on who could bounce the Superball into the wastebasket -- remained wildly open to ideas .
“ You ca n’t tell whether the fish will bite if you do n’t drop a line in the water , ” Knerr was fond of saying .
The approach could result in flops , such as the do - it - yourself fallout shelter , marketed at the height of the Cold War for $ 119 , or the kit with plastic great white shark teeth that came out when the movie “ Jaws ” did in 1975 .
“ He and his partner , and everyone they worked with . . . were like the Rat Pack and characters from ‘ MASH , ’ with oversized personalities , ” Chuck Knerr said .
“ If it was n’t about fun , he was n’t interested . ”
Knerr , who was known to linger in toy stores , told The Times in 1994 : “ If Spud and I had to say what we contributed , it was fun .
But I think this country gave us more than we gave it .
It gave us the opportunity to do it . ”
Melin died in 2002 .
In addition to his wife , Dorothy , whom he married in 1979 , Knerr ’s survivors include his three children from a first marriage that ended in divorce , Melody Knerr , Chuck Knerr and Lori Gregory ; two stepchildren , Richard Enright and Jeanne Stokes ; and eight grandchildren .
Services will be private .
Instead of flowers , the family suggests donating to the Braille Institute Auxiliary of Pasadena Tribute Fund , 615 S. Madison Ave. , Pasadena , CA 91106 or to the American Heart Assn. , www.americanheart.org.

Virginia Republicans object to required backing of McCain Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday February 12 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Senator John McCain 's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination has taken on an air of inevitability after the Arizona Republican 's showing on Super Tuesday gave him a commanding lead in delegates over Mike Huckabee and prompted Mitt Romney to exit the campaign .
But in Virginia , where voters will select their preferred nominee for president today , some party leaders recently objected to a requirement that they support the veteran senator .
Members of the Republican Party in Loudoun County , Viriginia met last week , and took up a variety of business , including a requirement that members of the party 's committee support all Republican candidates .
With McCain looking set to march away with the nomination , some party members objected .
" I am really concerned that John McCain is going to become the nominee , " Erika Jacobson of the newspaper Leesburg Today reported committee member Susan Falknor saying .
" He has been against a lot of conservative values . "
News accounts showed Falknor moved to strike the requirement that members support McCain from a resolution passed by the party .
While the Loudoun Easterner reported that she received a second , the motion was ruled out of order .
McCain has a strong lead in polls in Virginia .
But the dispute at the county meeting was a reminder of the deep dissension in Republican ranks over McCain 's ascendancy .
Although pundits have crowned McCain as the party 's candidate in November , McCain lost weekend contests in Kansas and Louisiana to Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , and only narrowly won the vote in Washington state .
The decision of the Washington GOP to call that contest for McCain prior to finishing the vote count prompted an angry reaction from Gov. Huckabee and his campaign .
" All Republicans should unite to demand an honest accounting of the votes , so that Republicans can have full confidence in the results , and full confidence in the eventual Republican nominee , " campaign chairman Ed Rollins said on Feb. 10 .
" As I said , we are prepared to go to court , and we are also prepared to take our case all the way to the Republican National Convention in September . "
Furthermore , a straw poll taken among attendees at the Conservative Political Action Conference crowned Mitt Romney as the preferred Republican nominee after he withdrew his candidacy .
And leading conservatives continue to slam the idea of McCain 's inevitability .
" This is not sitting well with the Republican establishment , folks , " Rush Limbaugh declared on his radio show Tuesday .
" We were supposed to now be unifying around and behind Senator McCain , after his sweep on Super Tuesday .
But with Huckabee continuing to win these primaries , it illustrates that there is no unification going on . "
Later , the Mayor 's aides contended that his policies had helped all the city 's residents , including blacks .
Those policies , they said , have drastically reduced crime in all neighborhoods and have generated thousands of jobs .
They also said that the Mayor had helped Mr. Butts by supporting a plan by the Abyssinian Development Corp. to build a Pathmark supermarket in East Harlem , and had spoken twice at his church .
Rudy Washington , the Deputy Mayor for community relations and business services and the highest ranking black official in City Hall , said that he attributed the minister 's remarks to a single policy decision by the Giuliani administration : to stall the development of the Harlem Center , a proposed retail and entertainment complex that the Empire State Development Corporation hopes to build on 125th Street and Lenox Avenue .
Mr. Butts was appointed to the Empire State Development Corporation by Governor Pataki in 1996 .
In addition , the Abyssinian Development Corporation -- an arm of his church -- is the co-developer for the Harlem Center project .
Mr. Washington said the city had not cooperated with the project because it would require the razing of a city - run parking garage and a few stores that have recently been turning profits .
'' It would have have required putting out of business some businesses that are doing quite well , '' Mr. Washington said .
'' I never even entertained the idea .
It would tear down a whole block . ''
It was unclear last night how the city could block the development of property that is owned by the state .
Caroline Quartararo , a spokeswoman for the Empire State development corporation , would say only that ''if there are any issues that need to be resolved , we will work with the city to resolve them so that the community will benefit . ''
And Mr. Butts denied the assertion from City Hall that his comments had any connection to the Harlem Center project .
'' As far as I know , the Giuliani adminstration was cooperating on the Harlem Center , '' he said .
'' I was not unhappy with the pace of the project or the administration 's response .
If anything has changed , it changed after the press conference . ''
Since Mr. Giuliani took office in 1993 , several prominent blacks have used confrontational language to criticize policies that they asserted were harmful to their community ; both Mr. Sharpton and David N. Dinkins , the former Mayor , said that they have been leveling essentially the same charges against the Giuliani administration for years .

The New York Times today drew attention to a new website hosted by The Center for Public Integrity which clearly lays out the web of deceit and falsehoods foisted upon the American public , Congress and the rest of the world by President Bush and the top seven members of his cabinet in their push to invade oil - rich Iraq :
THE WAR CARD – ORCHESTRATED DECEPTION ON THE PATH TO WAR
False Pretenses
FOLLOWING 9/11 , PRESIDENT BUSH AND SEVEN TOP OFFICIALS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION WAGED A CAREFULLY ORCHESTRATED CAMPAIGN OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT THE THREAT POSED BY SADDAM HUSSEIN ’S IRAQ .
By Charles Lewis and Mark Reading - Smith
President George W. Bush and seven of his administration ’s top officials , including Vice President Dick Cheney , National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice , and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , made at least 935 false statements in the two years following September 11 , 2001 , about the national security threat posed by Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq .
Nearly five years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq , an exhaustive examination of the record shows that the statements were part of an orchestrated campaign that effectively galvanized public opinion and , in the process , led the nation to war under decidedly false pretenses .
On at least 532 separate occasions ( in speeches , briefings , interviews , testimony , and the like ) , Bush and these three key officials , along with Secretary of State Colin Powell , Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz , and White House press secretaries Ari Fleischer and Scott McClellan , stated unequivocally that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction ( or was trying to produce or obtain them ) , links to Al Qaeda , or both .
This concerted effort was the underpinning of the Bush administration ’s case for war .
It is now beyond dispute that Iraq did not possess any weapons of mass destruction or have meaningful ties to Al Qaeda .
This was the conclusion of numerous bipartisan government investigations , including those by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence ( 2004 and 2006 ) , the 9/11 Commission , and the multinational Iraq Survey Group , whose “ Duelfer Report ” established that Saddam Hussein had terminated Iraq ’s nuclear program in 1991 and made little effort to restart it .
In short , the Bush administration led the nation to war on the basis of erroneous information that it methodically propagated and that culminated in military action against Iraq on March 19 , 2003 .
Not surprisingly , the officials with the most opportunities to make speeches , grant media interviews , and otherwise frame the public debate also made the most false statements , according to this first - ever analysis of the entire body of prewar rhetoric .
President Bush , for example , made 232 false statements about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and another 28 false statements about Iraq ’s links to Al Qaeda .
Secretary of State Powell had the second - highest total in the two - year period , with 244 false statements about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and 10 about Iraq ’s links to Al Qaeda .
Rumsfeld and Fleischer each made 109 false statements , followed by Wolfowitz ( with 85 ) , Rice ( with 56 ) , Cheney ( with 48 ) , and McClellan ( with 14 ) .
The massive database at the heart of this project juxtaposes what President Bush and these seven top officials were saying for public consumption against what was known , or should have been known , on a day - to - day basis .
This fully searchable database includes the public statements , drawn from both primary sources ( such as official transcripts ) and secondary sources ( chiefly major news organizations ) over the two years beginning on September 11 , 2001 .
It also interlaces relevant information from more than 25 government reports , books , articles , speeches , and interviews .
Consider , for example , these false public statements made in the run-up to war :
On August 26 , 2002 , in an address to the national convention of the Veteran of Foreign Wars , Cheney flatly declared : “ Simply stated , there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction .
There is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends , against our allies , and against us . ”
In fact , former CIA Director George Tenet later recalled , Cheney ’s assertions went well beyond his agency ’s assessments at the time .
Another CIA official , referring to the same speech , told journalist Ron Suskind , “ Our reaction was , ‘ Where is he getting this stuff from ? ’ ”
In the closing days of September 2002 , with a congressional vote fast approaching on authorizing the use of military force in Iraq , Bush told the nation in his weekly radio address : “ The Iraqi regime possesses biological and chemical weapons , is rebuilding the facilities to make more and , according to the British government , could launch a biological or chemical attack in as little as 45 minutes after the order is given .
. . .
This regime is seeking a nuclear bomb , and with fissile material could build one within a year . ”
A few days later , similar findings were also included in a much - hurried National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq ’s weapons of mass destruction — an analysis that had n’t been done in years , as the intelligence community had deemed it unnecessary and the White House had n’t requested it .
In July 2002 , Rumsfeld had a one - word answer for reporters who asked whether Iraq had relationships with Al Qaeda terrorists : “ Sure . ”
In fact , an assessment issued that same month by the Defense Intelligence Agency ( and confirmed weeks later by CIA Director Tenet ) found an absence of “ compelling evidence demonstrating direct cooperation between the government of Iraq and Al Qaeda . ”
What ’s more , an earlier DIA assessment said that “ the nature of the regime ’s relationship with Al Qaeda is unclear . ”
On May 29 , 2003 , in an interview with Polish TV , President Bush declared : “ We found the weapons of mass destruction .
We found biological laboratories . ”
But as journalist Bob Woodward reported in State of Denial , days earlier a team of civilian experts dispatched to examine the two mobile labs found in Iraq had concluded in a field report that the labs were not for biological weapons .
The team ’s final report , completed the following month , concluded that the labs had probably been used to manufacture hydrogen for weather balloons .
On January 28 , 2003 , in his annual State of the Union address , Bush asserted : “ The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa .
Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high - strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production . ”
Two weeks earlier , an analyst with the State Department ’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research sent an email to colleagues in the intelligence community laying out why he believed the uranium - purchase agreement “ probably is a hoax . ”
On February 5 , 2003 , in an address to the United Nations Security Council , Powell said : “ What we ’re giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence .
I will cite some examples , and these are from human sources . ”
As it turned out , however , two of the main human sources to which Powell referred had provided false information .
One was an Iraqi con artist , code - named “ Curveball , ” whom American intelligence officials were dubious about and in fact had never even spoken to .
The other was an Al Qaeda detainee , Ibn al - Sheikh al - Libi , who had reportedly been sent to Eqypt by the CIA and tortured and who later recanted the information he had provided .
Libi told the CIA in January 2004 that he had “ decided he would fabricate any information interrogators wanted in order to gain better treatment and avoid being handed over to [ a foreign government ] . ”
The false statements dramatically increased in August 2002 , with congressional consideration of a war resolution , then escalated through the mid-term elections and spiked even higher from January 2003 to the eve of the invasion .
It was during those critical weeks in early 2003 that the president delivered his State of the Union address and Powell delivered his memorable U.N. presentation .
For all 935 false statements , including when and where they occurred , go to the search page for this project ; the methodology used for this analysis is explained here .
In addition to their patently false pronouncements , Bush and these seven top officials also made hundreds of other statements in the two years after 9/11 in which they implied that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction or links to Al Qaeda .
Other administration higher - ups , joined by Pentagon officials and Republican leaders in Congress , also routinely sounded false war alarms in the Washington echo chamber .
The cumulative effect of these false statements — amplified by thousands of news stories and broadcasts — was massive , with the media coverage creating an almost impenetrable din for several critical months in the run-up to war .
Some journalists — indeed , even some entire news organizations — have since acknowledged that their coverage during those prewar months was far too deferential and uncritical .
These mea culpas notwithstanding , much of the wall - to - wall media coverage provided additional , “ independent ” validation of the Bush administration ’s false statements about Iraq .
The “ ground truth ” of the Iraq war itself eventually forced the president to backpedal , albeit grudgingly .
In a 2004 appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press , for example , Bush acknowledged that no weapons of mass destruction had been found in Iraq .
And on December 18 , 2005 , with his approval ratings on the decline , Bush told the nation in a Sunday - night address from the Oval Office : “ It is true that Saddam Hussein had a history of pursuing and using weapons of mass destruction .
It is true that he systematically concealed those programs , and blocked the work of U.N. weapons inspectors .
It is true that many nations believed that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction .
But much of the intelligence turned out to be wrong .
As your president , I am responsible for the decision to go into Iraq .
Yet it was right to remove Saddam Hussein from power . ”
Bush stopped short , however , of admitting error or poor judgment ; instead , his administration repeatedly attributed the stark disparity between its prewar public statements and the actual “ ground truth ” regarding the threat posed by Iraq to poor intelligence from a Who ’s Who of domestic agencies .
On the other hand , a growing number of critics , including a parade of former government officials , have publicly — and in some cases vociferously — accused the president and his inner circle of ignoring or distorting the available intelligence .
In the end , these critics say , it was the calculated drumbeat of false information and public pronouncements that ultimately misled the American people and this nation ’s allies on their way to war .
Bush and the top officials of his administration have so far largely avoided the harsh , sustained glare of formal scrutiny about their personal responsibility for the litany of repeated , false statements in the run-up to the war in Iraq .
There has been no congressional investigation , for example , into what exactly was going on inside the Bush White House in that period .
Congressional oversight has focused almost entirely on the quality of the U.S. government ’s pre-war intelligence — not the judgment , public statements , or public accountability of its highest officials .
And , of course , only four of the officials — Powell , Rice , Rumsfeld , and Wolfowitz — have testified before Congress about Iraq .
Short of such review , this project provides a heretofore unavailable framework for examining how the U.S. war in Iraq came to pass .
Clearly , it calls into question the repeated assertions of Bush administration officials that they were the unwitting victims of bad intelligence .
Above all , the 935 false statements painstakingly presented here finally help to answer two all - too - familiar questions as they apply to Bush and his top advisers :
What did they know , and when did they know it ?
( Original Article )
President Bush endorsed Sen. John McCain on Wednesday as winner of the Republican presidential nomination and said he will campaign for the Republican ticket as much as McCain wants .
With the two standing in the sun at the edge of the White House Rose Garden , the Arizona senator said he welcomed Bush 's support .
Reflecting his low standing in polls - only about 30 percent of those surveyed approve of his job performance - Bush and his aides made liberal use of an old political joke : offering Bush 's support , or , if McCain preferred , his opposition .
" Either way , I want him to win , " the president said .
Playing down his role - and potential influence - Bush added : " They 're not going to be voting for me . "
The party leader 's official recognition of McCain 's success in the Republican primary campaign is remindful of the roller - coaster relationship Bush and McCain have had for nearly a decade , after they competed strenuously - and at times bitterly - to become the party 's nominee in the 2000 presidential election .
McCain moved to patch up their differences , campaigning for Bush in the general elections in 2000 and 2004 , moderating some of his stands on social issues to more closely match Bush 's and speaking out in support of the increased troop deployment in Iraq that Bush announced in January 2007 .
After the two had lunch in the president 's private dining room , Bush focused on McCain 's return from the near - death of his campaign last year and said the senator had demonstrated the sort of " strength of character and perseverance " demanded of a president .
McCain said he was humbled by Bush 's support and said several times that he looked forward to Bush 's making time to campaign for him .
Hoping to spoil the GOP party , Democrats wasted no time in tagging McCain 's candidacy as a continuation of the Bush presidency .
" John McCain just does n't get it , " said Howard Dean , the Democratic Party chairman .
" All he offers is four more years of the failed Bush economy , an endless war in Iraq and shameless hypocrisy on ethics reform .
The fact is , the American people want change , not another out - of - touch Bush Republican , and Democrats welcome the opportunity to draw this contrast for voters . "
In a related matter , a Democratic - leaning group financed by a major labor union and wealthy liberal activists is running ads against McCain in Ohio and Pennsylvania .
The ad portrays McCain and Bush as interchangeable on key issues such as Iraq , tax cuts and health care .
Its message echoes a theme Democrats have been developing against McCain - trying to link him as closely to Bush 's policies as they can .
" A trillion dollars in Iraq over the next 10 years , McSame as Bush , " an announcer in the ad says .
" A millionaire who 's for tax cuts for millionaires .
McSame as Bush .
Oil companies ?
They get tax breaks while we pay at the pump .
McSame as Bush .
Absolutely no plan for universal health care .
McSame as Bush .
Tell John McCain we need a new direction .
Not the McSame old thing . "
The ad is the work of the Campaign to Defend America , a nonprofit organization that is among anti-war and left - of - center groups that have pledged a multimillion - dollar campaign to target McCain and congressional Republicans on the consequences of the Iraq war on the U.S. economy .
Also Wednesday , a new Washington Post - ABC
News poll shows McCain trailing both potential Democratic nominees in hypothetical matchups .
Illinois Sen. Barack Obama leads McCain by 12 percentage points among all adults in the poll .
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York has a six - point lead in the poll .
One obstacle for McCain might be his age .
More than a quarter of those polled said they are less inclined to support the 71 - year - old because , if elected , he would be the oldest person ever to become president .
The percentage discouraged by McCain 's age is more than double the numbers who would be less enthusiastic about supporting Obama due to his being an African American or Clinton because she is a woman .
I gotta say , there were a FEW nerds in line at the Apple Store - but I also saw alot of executives .
Attorneys , VP of Engineering for American Electric Power , A cop , me ( a real estate developer ) - I 'd say it was a healthy 50/50 mix of mainline professionals mixed with some nerds .
Either way - Bill Maher needs new hair plugs .
Tens of thousands of people are fleeing their homes in western Kenya following an army operation targeting members of a group linked to clashes over land , a Red Cross official says .
Ochiemo Cheptai , who identified himself as chairman of a local chapter of the Kenya Red Cross , told the Associated Press that on Sunday the army began bombing villages in the Mount Elgon area , where members of the Sabaot Land Defence Force are believed to be hiding .
Cheptai said up to 30,000 people have fled their homes in the past 24 hours .
Red Cross officials in Nairobi and Geneva , however , said Cheptai was n't with the organization and were challenging the 30,000 figure , saying they have not yet assessed the numbers fleeing .
Local legislator Fred Kapondi accused the army of targeting civilians instead of pursuing militants in their hideouts .
He said people are fleeing " aerial bombing and harassment from the army . "
But Mohamud Birik , the local district commissioner , denied the army is targeting villagers .
Army spokesman Bogita Ongeri declined to provide details , saying only that troops were in the area to assist local officials .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
Almost half of vinyl toys in recent testing contained an additive that has been linked to harming reproductive development , according to a new study from a Washington state - based public health group .
Dolls , squeeze toys , animal figurines , and other products for kids were found to contain phthalates , an additive used to make brittle vinyl toys more pliable .
" Kids can be exposed when they suck on the toy or chew on the toy .
They can also absorb phthalates through the skin , " said Erika Schreder , a staff scientist at the Washington Toxics Coalition , which produced the " Not So Squeaky Clean " report .
" Because phthalates are not chemically bound to the plastic , they get out in the environment , and so another exposure is that children are exposed to [ phthalates in ] house dust . "
Phthalates have been banned from most toys in the European Union because of health concerns , and the Washington Toxics Coalition is urging regulation in the U.S. on the state level .
The coalition also said that labeling should reveal whether phthalates are present .
Last year , California passed a law banning phthalates in children 's products , effective January 2009 .
Jack Gerard , president and chief executive of the American Chemistry Council said the law " is the product of the politics of fear " and not based on good science .
Several studies have " explored possible associations " between phthalates and semen quality , shortened pregnancy terms , genital development in young boys and premature breast development in young girls , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which said that more research is needed .
The CDC also reported that phthalates , which are found in a wide variety of consumer products ranging from raincoats to shampoo to intravenous medical tubing , are generally metabolized and excreted quickly , and do not accumulate in the body .
Some toymakers find alternatives
In laboratory testing , phthalates were detected in nine of 20 toys .
The toys were purchased in Washington state and Michigan , at major retailers such as Target Corp.
TGT , +0.30 % and ToysRus Inc .
" We can expect that on a national level you would find about the same proportion , " Schreder said .
" There really was n't anything special about the toys we bought here .
None of the toys were locally produced . "
In six of the toys tested , phthalates comprised 28 % to 47 % of the toy , according to the report .
For example , more than one - third of a rubber ducky was made of phthalates , while almost half of a green ball was made of phthalates .
" What is really most unnerving is the fact that phthalates make up such a high proportion of these toys , " Schreder said .
" Can you think of it as an additive when it makes up so much of the toy ? "
Of five Mattel Inc. MAT , +0.87 % toys tested , none tested positive for phthalates , according to the report .
" While this is no guarantee that all Mattel products are free of phthalates , it does indicate that at least for these popular products , a major manufacturer has found an alternative ... that will allow the sale of its products in Europe as well as the U.S. , " according to the report .
For its part , Mattel says it has voluntarily applied the European Union restriction " on a worldwide basis , " according to a company statement .
" Mattel has taken steps to eliminate the restricted phthalates from toys on a worldwide basis .
In short , all Mattel toys manufactured and shipped from any manufacturing facility around the world [ are ] in compliance with this EU Directive . "
The Washington Toxics Coalition report added that Target aims to eliminate phthalates from its own brand of toys this year , and that its bibs are already free of the vinyl that contains phthalates .
An Ontario judge is at the centre of a misconduct investigation after insisting a witness who is HIV - positive and has Hepatitis C don a mask while testifying in his courtroom .
Three groups have complained to the Ontario Judicial Council about the conduct of Barrie judge Justice Jon-Jo Douglas , who later moved the case to a bigger courtroom in order to create more distance between the witness and the bench .
The judge refused to accept Crown counsel Karen McCleave 's entreaties there was no need for such measures .
" The HIV virus will live in a dried state for year after year after year and only needs moisture to reactivate itself , " Douglas insisted , according to a transcript of the Nov. 23 trial proceedings .
" This is outlandish , " Bluma Brenner , an assistant professor at the McGill AIDS Clinic at McGill University in Montreal , said yesterday .
A drop of human immunodeficiency virus drying on the floor " would be inactivated within 20 minutes , " Brenner said in an interview .
But Douglas , a former Crown attorney appointed to the Ontario Court of Justice 10 years ago , was not prepared to continue the trial until he was satisfied " the safety and integrity of this courtroom " was protected .
" I mean , he speaks within two feet of me with two serious infectious diseases , " Douglas told McCleave .
" Either you mask your witness and / or move us to another courtroom or we do not proceed . "
At one point , court staff returned after a recess wearing rubber gloves and placed documents touched by the witness in plastic bags .
Douglas , who continues to preside in Barrie , declined to speak with the Star yesterday .
In their Jan. 17 letter of complaint , the Canadian HIV / AIDS Legal Network and the HIV and AIDS Legal Clinic ( Ontario ) say Douglas 's response to the witness , a complainant in a sexual assault case , reveals " shockingly discriminatory thinking " and is a " particularly extreme example of unacceptable conduct by a judicial officer . "
The organizations say the case also raises questions about the extent to which judges are informed about HIV / AIDS and related human rights issues .
Their complaints target not only Douglas , but two courts – his own and the Superior Court of Justice , for failing to clearly condemn the behaviour .
The Crown applied to the Superior Court of Justice to have Douglas removed from the case for creating an appearance of bias .
But Justice Margaret Eberhard declined , saying while his approach may have been wrong , Douglas had jurisdiction to take the steps he felt necessary to ensure courtroom safety .
Ontario's Criminal Lawyers Association has also lodged a complaint with the judicial council .
The lawyers ' group contends Douglas did not bring a judicial temperament to trial proceedings and treated a witness differently on the basis of irrelevant personal characteristics .
Contacted yesterday , association president Frank Addario declined to discuss the allegations .
The complaints are being investigated by a judicial council subcommittee , which will determine if a public inquiry into Douglas 's fitness to remain on the bench is warranted .
Meanwhile , Douglas hastily resigned from the board of Stevenson Memorial Hospital in Alliston on Jan. 14 , just over a month after he was appointed .
The controversy surrounding the witness began on Nov. 23 , during the trial of a man charged with sexually assaulting a fellow inmate at the provincial jail in Penetanguishene .
The alleged victim testified he was HIV - positive and had Hepatitis C , but did n't inform his alleged attacker because he was traumatized .
" I could be ... shanked , " said the man , whose identity is shielded by a publication ban .
According to a trial transcript , during the lunch break , Douglas bumped into defence lawyer Angela McLeod and voiced concern the witness had been allowed to testify without the court being informed of his health status .
When court resumed , Douglas raised the issue with McCleave , the Crown attorney as well .
" I am frankly shocked that in this day and age we were not advised , " he said .
McCleave replied she knew of no issues arising from the witness being in the courtroom or touching " a couple of pieces of paper " that were introduced as evidence .
That 's when Douglas offered his view that HIV will live " for year after year after year " in a dried state .
McCleave explained that she was n't prepared to ask the witness to wear a mask in court when he faces no such requirement in the community .
There were also practical problems with the judge 's request , she suggested – the court reporter might not be able to accurately record his testimony .

Douglas refused the Crown 's request to grant a mistrial , declined to recuse himself from the case and refused to consider granting bail to the accused , Lee Wilde , when it became clear the trial would have to be adjourned until the judge 's concerns were addressed .
A new trial will begin Feb. 14 .
An official with the National Judicial Institute in Ottawa , which has developed educational programs for judges , said while the curriculum addresses " emerging social issues , " there 's no course specifically addressing HIV / AIDS – though one is being planned .
It should be up and running within " a couple of years , " she said .
Why I ’m excited about the Google Social Graph API
The Google Social Graph API is a new programming API that allows developers to expose social relationships embedded in web sites .
What does this mean for regular folks like you and me ?
Read on .
Do you ever feel like your personal information is spread across the web in a whole bunch of separate places ?
An account here , a profile there ?
A friends list here and a friends list there ?
All your information , but in all different places all incomplete at the same time ?
The Social Graph API helps solve this “ silos of information ” problem by allowing people to write software that understands who your friends are .
It does this by reading your web site or blog and making connections between the social profiles you have across the web .
For example , imagine you have a blog , which is your home on the web .
You also have an Amazon profile , a Twitter profile , and a Facebook profile .
So you have four profiles spread across the web , seemingly unconnected .
Amazon has no idea who your friends on Facebook or Twitter are , and vice - versa , and this is a good thing from a privacy standpoint .
These sites should n’t be able to find out everything about you with you giving them permission .
But what if you wanted these sites to know a bit about each other ?
What if you want to combine your Amazon book history with your friends lists at Facebook so that you can see what your friends are reading and let Amazon give you recommendations based on your similarity with them ?
Or , perhaps you just joined Twitter and want to know which of your Facebook friends are already there so you do n’t have to go hunting for them ?
( see video )
Here we see real - world examples of how cross-pollinating your personal information between these sites can not only be efficient , but desirable …

( see video )
Here we see real - world examples of how cross-pollinating your personal information between these sites can not only be efficient , but desirable .
( Not everyone will want to do this , however )
This type of scenario is what the Google Social Graph API is going to help solve .
It does this by reading information on your blog that describes your other online profiles .
So you might declare that you have a Twitter profile at http://twitter.com/bokardo or you have a Facebook profile at http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=500576058.
Now , given your permission , Amazon can go out and find your Twitter friends and perhaps make book recommendations to you .
Or , when you join a new social network , you can simply add your friends from existing networks with the click of a button .
So that ’s the big reason why I ’m excited by the Social Graph API : it helps to solve a real tough problem brought on by the proliferation of social networks .
But there are several more reasons , too :
No Dependence on Google ( or anyone else )
While Google is providing the API , nobody is dependent on them for creating or storing our relationships .
This is done by the individual ( as well as the services we sign up for ) .
This means that Google is n’t in control of our relationship content .
This is very much like how Search works .
We own the content that we write on our web site .
Google simply indexes it and provides tools to find , filter , and sort it .
Google is an aggregator , not a creator .
Google will be in competition to have the best aggregator of the graph .
The best way to explain this might be to point out that others can do exactly what Google is doing here .
Since the relationship information is embedded within web sites anybody can index this information .
So competitors can come along and try to provide a better API or better tools than Google .
Not a Walled Garden like Facebook
As Jeff Jarvis says : “ The internet is the social network “ .
Walled gardens are not .
Facebook is a great place to socialize .
But they do n’t own the relationships that happen there .
Unlike Facebook , Google is n’t trying to own our social graph .
This is incredibly important for the openness of the web .
( btw : Jeff does n’t think XFN and FOAF will gain traction … but I think they will because they are easy to implement and because solving this problem is too important .
RSS and trackbacks are two technologies that succeeded in the same way )
This is in contrast to how Facebook runs things , which is by their permission .
They want to own the relationship data .
That ’s why this API by Google is , to me , still a far better alternative .
They are simply providing the best tool and keeping competition open .
A good indicator of this is to take a look at the first words on the Social Graph API : “ Build critical mass on your website ” .
Would these words ever show up on anything by FB ?
NO .
Their words would be “ Build critical mass on our website ” .
Based on Open Standards
The social relationships that the API exposes are encoded in regular old HTML using the XFN and FOAF formats .
These are open standards that anybody can use .
These are very easy to write and understand .
Web developers will be able to learn what they need to in about 5 minutes in order to write these formats .
Go HTML !
It will take a bit longer for blog publishers to write plugins that publish these formats for us , so that non-developers can publish their relationships as well .
But with the amazing number of developers already creating plugins and other extensions , this wo n’t be a problem .
An Ecosystem
The Social Graph API is an ecosystem that anybody can play in .
Since the relationship data is available to anybody , the spoils will go to the best tools that take advantage of them .
Thus we have an ecosystem of open competition that allows anybody to play .
Anybody with some spare time on their hands can jump in and create some cool program that helps people stay in better touch with their friends or somehow leverages those relationships .
This move by Google cements their belief in the web as platform and reinforces their corporate mission to “ help organize the world ’s information ” .
APIs are Great
This move by Google underscores the importance of APIs .
The best thing about APIs is that we simply do n’t know ( and ca n’t imagine ) how useful they can be .
Developers will undoubtedly dream up a myriad of ways to use the API , some of which will become killer applications .
The power of APIs is not what we can see plainly , but what we ca n’t see quite yet .
The User is in Charge
This is the biggest part of why I ’m excited .
My personal relationship information is n’t behind some walled garden .
I ’m in control of my own social graph !
If I want people to know I have a Twitter account , then I can .
If I do n’t want them to be sure then I wo n’t make that relationship explicit on my blog .
The Domain as Identity is Realized
I do n’t write about it often , but you may remember some posts about domain as identity I ’ve written in the past .
The Google Social Graph API is now getting us there by recognizing when we define our own relationships in our own domain .
As more and more services look to our domain for verification , that only puts us more in charge of our online identity .
Combine this with OpenID , and the idea of domain as identity really takes shape .
In the same way that we are in control of our own bodies , we need to be in control of our own domains .
This is how we ’re going to get privacy , if we want it .
If you feel that you ’re not in control of your domain , then you need to take your business elsewhere .
This is why I dislike services that require you to have a subdomain within some other domain … those services that let you use your own domain are far preferable because you can at any point move your domain elsewhere .
Just like you move your residence IRL .
What do I need to do ?
So where does this leave us ?
Well , it leaves us with two very obvious next steps .
Get your own domain !
– if you do n’t have your own domain … go get one !
( and not a subdomain ) Mark up your code – use the XFN and FOAF formats to markup your site , or use a service that does this for you .
I seriously need to do this myself .
( I have a FOAF file , that ’s about it )
It wo n’t be long before developers take advantage of the Social Graph API to really leverage these relationships .
There is already software taking advantage of the API .
Google has provided some tools that allow you to discover your contacts .
Play around with this and you can see the power of this API .
We might actually have some coherence to personal information on the web after all .
Going forward
The truth is that Facebook , Amazon , or even Twitter never had a good glimpse of my true social network anyway .
Therefore , they had an incomplete social graph .
I never gave Facebook my email list , they do n’t know anything about my blog , and I ’m going to keep it that way .
While Facebook and others can create a fun place to hang out , they do n’t own the relationships I create there .
I do .
Also , it should be pointed out that Google released the Social Graph API on the same day that Microsoft announced their intention to take over Yahoo .
The irony of this ca n’t be more complete .
One is a sign of the past .
One is a sign of the future .

A scientist has achieved a world first ... by cloning himself .
In a breakthrough certain to provoke an ethical furore , Samuel Wood created embryo copies of himself by placing his skin cells in a woman 's egg .
The embryos were the first to be made from cells taken from adult humans .
Although they survived for only five days and were smaller than a pinhead , they are seen as a milestone in the quest for treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer 's and Parkinson's .
But critics fear the technology could be exploited by mavericks to clone babies and accused the scientists of reducing the miracle of human life to a factory of spare parts .
Researchers from the Californian stem cell research company Stemagen employed the same technique used to make Dolly the sheep , the world 's first cloned mammal , to create the embryos .
They took eggs donated by young women having IVF and replaced genetic material with DNA from the skin cells of two men .
Scroll down for more ..
The eggs were then zapped with an electric current to induce fertilisation and the creation of embryos .
Some of the skin cells came from Dr Wood , Stemagen 's chief executive officer and a leading fertility specialist , while the others came from another member of staff .
The result was a handful of embryos , at least three of them clones of Dr Wood and the other man .
Although all were destroyed in the process , the technique is seen as a vital step in the creation of cloned embryos rich in stem cells , which are " master cells " capable of becoming any type of body tissue .
Scroll down for more ..
Such stem cells could be invaluable in the study of diseases and the testing of drugs .
They could ultimately be used to replace the damaged tissues behind diseases from Alzheimer 's to diabetes .
Stem cells taken from cloned embryos would be a perfect match to the patient , whose body would not reject them .
Dr Wood , who has degrees in medicine , psychology , biochemistry and molecular biophysics , called the research " a critical milestone " in the development of treatments .
Scroll down for more ..
The unmarried father of two , who is in his forties , is working on extracting stem cells from such embryos - a process that inevitably leads to the death of the embryo .
John Smeaton , of the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children , said : " We have got scientists wandering around in an ethical wilderness , forgetting about matters of justice relating to our fellow human beings .
" We have people creating human beings with the intention of destroying them .
That 's appalling . "
And the Vatican condemned the cloning of human embryos , calling it the " worst type of exploitation of the human being " .
" This ranks among the most morally illicit acts , ethically speaking , " said Monsignor Elio Sgreccia , president of the Pontifical Academy for Life , the Vatican department that helps oversee the Church 's position on bioethics issues .
Stem cell experts gave the U.S. breakthrough , published in the journal Stem Cells , a cautious welcome .
Professor Robin Lovell - Badge , of the Medical Research Council 's National Institute for Medical Research , said : " This is another step along what has turned out to be a tortuous road .
" However , it is still a long way from the goal of achieving embryonic stem cells . "
U.S. researcher Professor Robert Lanza questioned the validity of the research and said the embryos looked " very unhealthy " .
Josephine Quintavalle , of the campaign group Comment On Reproductive Ethics , said : " Human cloning is unethical , unsafe , and completely unnecessary .
" It is time that scientists started to put some brakes on . "
Dr Calum MacKellar , of the Scottish Council on Human Bioethics , said the creation and destruction of human embryos was " extremely offensive to millions in the UK " .
Although Dr Wood 's team is the first to create human embryos from adult cells , human embryos have been cloned before .
Scientists at Newcastle University created cloned human embryos in 2005 using cells from embryos rather than adults , seen as less useful in creating potential treatments .
British law says created embryos must be destroyed in 14 days and cannot be implanted in a woman .
The news came as it was revealed that animal - human hybrid embryos will be created in British laboratories within weeks after the research was allowed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority .
Two teams have been licensed to make cow - human hybrids for research into incurable diseases .
Scientists say they are needed because of a shortage of human eggs for research .
The embryos would be more than 99 per cent human and would have to be destroyed after two weeks .
But Mr Smeaton said : " It is creating a category of beings regarded as sub - human who can be used as raw material to benefit other members of the human family .
" How wrong can something be before a scientist understands you cannot just do it because of the perceived good for human beings . "
Cancer Care
Cancer Care offers some support programs for both survivors and their caretakers .
Among their offered programs are telephone workshops , some financial support , free instructional booklets , a newsletter delivered to your email address and some on - line telephone support .
Their main web page can be seen at www.cancercare.org.
Their programs are not specific to prostate cancer , but much of their information will be helpful to pc survivors .
Of course , none of this support will be as good as participating in a live , face to face support group as offered by Malecare .

SAN FRANCISCO ( AP ) 
Apple is mulling a plan to upend its iTunes business by giving people unlimited free access to the music library if they 're willing to pay more for the iPod and iPhone devices they use for playing and storing the digital media , according to a report published Wednesday .
Some analysts threw cold water on the plan outlined in the Financial Times , however , saying Cupertino - based Apple would risk creating an " accounting nightmare " and alienating some artists if it started giving away songs on its iTunes online store .
' FINANCIAL TIMES ' REPORT : Apple mulls unlimited music bundle Rumors have buzzed through the industry for a couple years that Apple might open iTunes for free downloads .
Meanwhile , Apple 's rivals are experimenting with new ways to distribute music online — including giving it away .
The newspaper cited unnamed music industry sources in reporting that Apple is negotiating with record labels over a deal to offer a monthly music subscription for the iPhone , as well as an unlimited music bundle for both the iPod and iPhone .
The cheapest iPods — the Shuffle model — currently start at $ 49 , and the cheapest iPhones start at $ 399 .
The Financial Times did n't say how much the prices of those devices would jump if the proposal were to go through .
But it said the sticking point in the discussions how much Apple will pay the labels for access to their music libraries , with Apple currently offering to pay just $ 20 per device .
Apple did not respond to requests for comment .
Some analysts said the iTunes store is too valuable to Apple for it to give away the music in it .
" I think it 's a little far - fetched at this stage , " said Tim Bajarin , president of technology consulting firm Creative Strategies in Campbell , Calif .
" The studios still want to be compensated .
And the artists , especially the independent artists , still want to be compensated .
I 'm skeptical that carte blanche , free access to any music may be in the works . "
Only about 10 % of Apple 's revenues come through iTunes — about $ 2.5 billion in 2007 .
But the store has been a critical tool for driving the more - lucrative iPod sales and helping musicians get paid for their work .
Apple sold $ 8.3 billion in iPods last year , an 8 % increase over the year before .
The success of iTunes has helped Apple become one of the world 's biggest music retailers — it 's currently the No. 2 music retailer in the U.S. behind Wal - Mart Stores .
But it 's also exposed Apple to criticism over how the company protects its content and prompted Apple to campaign for new ways to distribute music legally online .
The criticisms center on the inability to play songs bought on iTunes on rival products to the iPod , such as Microsoft 's Zune player .
To free up online music , Apple CEO Steve Jobs says the major record labels should strip protections known as Digital Rights Management , or DRM , technology , which prevents unauthorized copying , from their songs sold online .
Apple , meanwhile , has refused to abandon its own copying protections .
Some of Apple 's rivals are already trying out new approaches .
Nokia Corp. , the world 's largest mobile phone maker , announced a deal with Universal Music Group in December that gives buyers of certain Nokia phones unlimited free downloads of songs from the Universal catalog .
Seattle - based RealNetworks and Redmond , Wash .- based Microsoft both offer music subscriptions that cost $ 14.99 per month that the companies believe will appeal to customers who are more interested in discovering new music than owning old favorites .
Neil Smith , a vice president of marketing for Rhapsody , said its subscribers delve deeper into back catalogs and check out more independent artists than typical in - person music store shoppers .
Subscribers also buy more MP3s than non-subscribers .
" We believe that this kind of approach , where unlimited content can flow seamlessly across different devices and media , is the best thing for the consumer and the industry , " said Microsoft spokesman Jason Reindorp .
" It brings the focus back to where it should be — the music . "

A quote from A. J. Liebling , a writer for the The New Yorker .
Freedom of the press is considered to be one of the cornerstones of a functioning democracy .
Without it , you would n't know what you were voting on , and the process of voting would be worthless .
Silvio Berlusconi is Italy 's wealthiest person .
He also controls more " freedom of the press " than any other person in Italy .
Of course , he also happens to have been elected to the most powerful post in Italy multiple times .
Not too surprising .
Control over the media translates to control over the ideas and issues discussed at election time .
The more that control is concentrated into fewer hands , the less of a real democracy the nation becomes .
Authoritarian regimes use the same method to win their sham elections .
Since they control the media , they control all discussion and critiques of various policies .
Once you control the ideas , you control what people will vote for .
The more control of the media you have , the easier it is to control the vote .
While the electorate may not be " illiterate " in the sense that they can't read or engage in complex feats of engineering , they can still be rendered politically illiterate by surrounding them with media that only pretends to be " fair and balanced " or " pravda " when it is not .
As the gap between the rich and poor widens , it should n't be surprising that many members of the wealthy classes would use their growing power to influence the media .
The more influence they gather , the more they can consolidate their wealth , and further widen the gap .
If left unchecked , the democracy itself would be destroyed .
As Abraham Lincoln wrote in 1864 :
" I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and cause me to tremble for the safety of my country ; corporations have been enthroned , an era of corruption in High Places will follow , and the Money Power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the People , until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands , and the Republic destroyed . "
A ROMANTIC picnic with a long - term boyfriend turned into a six - day , naked ordeal for a 17 - year - old girl at the hands of a balaclava - clad " kidnapper " , a court has heard .
Latrobe Valley Magistrates
Court yesterday heard that the kidnapper was , in fact , the boyfriend , and that he had tried to convince the girl that he , too , had been abducted , as part of an elaborate ruse .
Last Tuesday , the girl and Julian Buchwald , 22 , of Budgeree , arrived at a property near Boolarra .
Police allege Buchwald left the car and that the girl was bound and gagged shortly afterwards by a balaclava - clad man and taken to East Gippsland , five hours ' drive away .
A note covered in satanic symbols was found at the girl 's parents ' house , informing them that their daughter had been kidnapped and that she would be " raped and burned alive " if they contacted police .
Police allege Buchwald eventually removed his disguise , tied his hands and called to the girl for help before " escaping " .
He untied the girl and the pair spent six days fleeing naked in the bush .
“ A restaurant is the only remaining place in the retail economy where the card disappears , where you actually hand it over and the transaction is not processed right in front of you , ” he said .
“ There is an opportunity for it to be copied and skimmed . ”

Those who have used the systems in Europe may wonder why it has taken so long for them to show up here .
Henry Helgeson , the president of Merchant Warehouse in Boston , which sells credit card systems , said restaurant owners are typically cautious .
“ They ’re waiting to see if it works before they make a big leap , ” he said .
A number of midprice restaurant chains are experimenting with them , a process that can take months .
On Long Island , Four Food Studio in Melville has been using the system for about a month .
They have four units for 13 waiters and plan to add more .
“ Our guests say it gives them peace of mind , being able to pay the check without giving up their credit cards so there is no opportunity for fraud and identity theft , ” said Jay Grossman , one of the owners .
“ It speeds thing up , too .
There has been complete acceptance ; after all , we ’re in the world of BlackBerrys and iPods . ”
Roger Berkowitz , the president of Legal Sea Foods , which has more than 30 restaurants along the East Coast , has been using the equipment in some of his restaurants for about a year .
“ It takes training but it does n’t take long for people to be comfortable with it , ” he said .
Mr. Drummond of Ingenico said that pay - at - table represented a “ cultural shift , ” with restaurateurs fearing that using the devices may appear to rush the customer .
Some owners of high - end restaurants in New York seemed wary .
Drew Nieporent , an owner of the Myriad Restaurant Group , said he thought the gadgets were not “ classy . ”
Tired ?
Study Says Americans Need More Sleep
A new CDC study finds 70 percent of adults do n't get enough rest .
Feb. 28 , 2008 -- Caffeine is a staple in office break rooms across the country , pepping up adults who slog through their days feeling drowsy and tired .
Perhaps we all just need a little bit more sleep ?
A new study released by the Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) indicates that adults are not getting enough rest each night .
Of those questioned , 70 percent said they had not gotten enough rest or sleep every day of the past month .
Yawning in America
The study , which surveyed adults in Delaware , Hawaii , New York and Rhode Island , found that a lack of sleep is a particular problem for younger adults .
Of those between 18 and 34 , 13.3 percent lacked enough sleep every day , compared to 7.3 percent of adults over 55 .
The study did not find much difference between races or genders .
The National Sleep Foundation says that most adults need 7 - 9 hours of sleep each night .
Many are not getting that .
Nationwide , adults that averaged six hours or less of sleep a night increased in all age in groups from 1985 to 2006 , according to a National Health Interview Study .
For example , in 1985 , about 20 percent of men and women ages 45 - 64 reported sleeping an average of six hours or less .
By 2006 that number had jumped to 30 percent .
Sleep Disorders Rise
The CDC says an estimated 50 - 70 million people suffer from constant sleep loss or sleep disorders .
People often do not understand that lack of sleep can cause health problems .
But there is some good , if unsurprising , news : Retirement is apparently good for your sleep habits .
The CDC found that those who are no longer working were twice as likely to report that they got a full night 's sleep .
Those who are unable to work at all — perhaps because of medical or mental issues — were the most likely to indicate 30 days of inadequate rest .
Sleep patterns can be influenced by what kinds of jobs people have , and even where they live .
The study found those who lived in Hawaii apparently got more sleep than their counterparts in the other three states studied .
Lifestyle choices , such as late - night television watching , Internet use , or caffeine and other stimulant intake , can also affect sleep patterns .
Seeds to Save a Species
Around the world , scientists are risking their lives to retrieve seeds destined for a massive vault near the North Pole .
Their work just might save mankind
The first few days of any significant overseas trip , I ’m a jerk .
It ’s not just the jetlag that ’s poisoning my attitude ; it ’s the lack of context .
I get twitchy when I do n’t know where my stuff is .
Combine that with the fact that no one is speaking English , there are two toilets in the bathroom , and I have no idea what time it is and you can begin to understand why I ’m in such a foul mood .
Three days in , I ’m sleeping , I know it ’s called a bidet , and I ’m working hard on my Italian R and U sounds .
I ’m having fun , but I ’m still thinking about my lack of context .
I ’m thinking about the familiar place I ’ve built so that I can work .
The Cave
The picture on the About page is my Cave .
It came as part of the new house .
I did n’t paint the walls blood red , they came that way .
Most folks who get the tour walk into The Cave and gasp at the walls .
“ They ’re so dark how can think surrounded by this ominous redness ? ” I nod and grin slightly and shuffle them off to the next room .
See , I love my Cave .
The thick blood red walls wrap me in comfort and that is what a Cave does .
My Cave is my intellectual home .
My kitchen is where I eat , my bed is where I sleep , and my Cave is where I think .
Everyone has some sort of Cave ; just follow them around their house .
It might be a garage full of tools or a kitchen full of cookware , but there is a Cave stashed somewhere in the house .
The nerd Cave has some specific traits :
A computer on a desk with ready access to the Internet .
The fact that a computer without an Internet connection is essentially a very expensive DVD player is a recent development , but the fact is , when I sit down at my MacBook and there is no wireless I think , “ Well , I could play Bejeweled , right ? ”
In The Cave , the Internet is the life blood .
It connects this dark place with the rest of the world .
World - canceling features such as a door or noise - reducing headphones .
These features are a nuisance to significant others interested in communication , but I ’ll get to that in a moment .
A random collection of comforting nerd knick knacks .
This varies wildly from nerd to nerd , but there is always at least one object or talisman of nerd - dom sitting in the Cave .
I have this white carved stone polar bear staring at me right now .
I think I got it for Christmas .
It ’s been staring at me for ten years now and each time I sit down in the Cave , I worry that if the polar bear was n’t there …
I would n’t be able to write .
Something to drink .
This may be my thing , but I can’t really settle into The Cave without something liquid .
Right now , it ’s a cup of homebrew by Peet ’s .
In the afternoon , it ’s a glass of water .
In the evening , it might be wine or a beer .
For me , the drink is a mental pause where I intensely scrutinize the last 30 seconds .
What did I just write ?
What am I trying to say ? [ sip ]
Ok , back to work .
A well - defined layout .
This ties into my NADD , but I have deep knowledge of the layout of my Cave .
Each month , the housecleaners come for a tidying of the house and each month I walk into my office when they are done and spend 30 minutes adjusting my monitors , relocating my pens , and re-piling my papers .
I think it ’s great that someone is coming to clean the house , but I wish they ’d STOP TOUCHING MY STUFF .
A view .
Like the drink , the view is a mental break , an escape to somewhere else that provides a brief alteration to perspective .
This is why everyone in the office wants a window .
It ’s not a status symbol , it ’s an escape .
I ’ve seen nerds without a view go to great lengths to create one .
My manager at UCSC built a working window frame in his subterranean office and put posters from around the world behind it .
When I left UCSC , he had a poster of Audrey Hepburn from Breakfast at Tiffany’s .
It ’s an ominous name : Cave .
It alludes to a dark , damp place where you are likely to be eaten by a grue .
The irony is that the purpose of a Cave is not to insulate , its purpose is to germinate .
I ’ll explain .
The Zone
Each weekend morning , my process is this : I wake up , walk up stairs , sit down at the computer , and figure out what is happening on the planet .
Once I ’m comfortable the sky is not falling , I walk to the kitchen , grind my coffee beans , and begin to boil water .
While the water is heating up , I return to my computer and follow up on whatever tidbits tickled my fancy from my first pass .
This morning , it was some World Cup research followed by looking into options around wireless headphones .
Turns out ,
Sony sucks .
Go figure .
Water ’s boiling !
Back to the kitchen , where I pour hot water into my French press and dig up my favorite ceramic cup .
The coffee needs to sit for three minutes , which means back to the computer !
Ok , so why do Sony headphones suck ?
Poor sound quality ?
Bad design ?
Bit of both , really .
Coffee ’s ready , so one more trip to the kitchen where I pour the steaming brew into my favorite cup and travel , once more , to my Cave .
It looks like a lot of work , but I do it instinctively .
It ’s a routine designed to do one thing — get me into The Zone .
Much has been written elsewhere about the mental state that is The Zone , but I will say this : it is a deeply creative space where inspiration is built .
Anything which you perceive as beautiful , useful , or fun comes from someone stumbling through The Zone .
Once I ’ve successfully traversed my morning routine and have entered The Zone , I am OFF LIMITS .
I mean it .
Intruding into The Cave and disrupting The Zone is no different than standing up in the middle of the first ever showing of The Empire Strikes Back , jumping up and down , and yelling , “ DARTH VADER IS LUKE’S FATHER !
DARTH VADER IS LUKE’S FATHER ! ”
Not only are you ruining the mood , you ’re killing a major creative work .
Think about that the next time you enter The Cave with a useless question about what shoes you should wear .
No , I ’m not going to answer the phone .
In fact , it ’s a sure sign of compromised Cave design if I can even hear the phone ring .
And no , I do n’t hear you when you walk in and ask if we should go to the park tomorrow .
I do n’t hear you the second time , either .
I do n’t mean I ’m ignoring you because that ’d involve using precious brain cycles I need for The Zone … I really CAN ’T hear you .
That ’s how deep I am in The Zone .
No , I have no idea that it ’s been four hours since I closed the door and began furiously typing .
Really , the only things I know are : a ) when my coffee cup is empty , and b ) when I need to head to the bathroom .
Yes .
When you successfully penetrate The Zone , there is a chance I ’ll be an asshole .
In fact , I might snap .
The Snap
This is where I apologize .
No one deserves to be on the receiving end of The Snap .
All you were really doing was coming in to see when I was done because we agreed we ’d go surfing this afternoon .
Still , I got in The Zone and I ’m writing this wicked article and WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT DO YOU WANT ?
The Snap is a glare , a raised voice … something designed to indicate you are PISSING ME OFF with your presence .
It ’s not fair , I realize that , but think of it like this .
If you walk up to me and slap me across the face , I ’m not going to think , “ Why ’d you do that ? ” I ’m not going to take the time to dissect the situation .
My instinct is going to be pure , primal , and immediate .
I ’m going to slap you back .
The reason for this irrational reaction is antiquated brain wiring .
Four million years ago it was to my evolutionary advantage to respond to slaps as quickly as possible because they were often precursors to being eaten .
Rather than piping my slap response through the “ What is a Reasonable Response ? ” portion of my brain , it ’s wired straight into my “ React Immediately or Else ” area .
Somehow , The Snap response has the same wiring .
Invasion of The Zone is akin to some primal activity that required the brain to wire itself for immediate , irrational response .
It ’s not right , it ’s not socially acceptable , and I regret my actions 30 seconds later , but in 20 years of nerdery , the quest has n’t been to kill The Snap , but figure out how to manage it .
The Place
Try as I might , I do n’t always make it to The Zone .
I ’ll go through all my odd little pre-Zone activities of drink and music selection .
I ’ll slightly adjust the five essential objects on my desk and I ’ll begin… playing World of Warcraft .
This is not The Zone… this is The Place .
It is very similar to The Zone in appearance , but , mentally , it ’s a different muscle that I ’m exercising .
If The Zone is akin to playing power forward in a championship hockey game , The Place is the six hours spent in the weight room the day before .
Yes , I ’m using my mental muscles , but I ’m not really building anything .
The rule is this : your significant other can interrupt The Place with impunity .
That ’s the rule .
I might Snap , but if you let me linger in The Place like you should let me work in The Zone , you ’ll never see me .
If you walk into my office to ask me something and see a half - naked night elf dancing on my screen , you are hereby authorized to invade .
Mistakes will happen and you ’ll invade The Zone thinking it ’s The Place , but after I ’ve cooled down , it ’s my responsibility to explain why what looks like The Place is actually The Zone .
Other Places
Nerds are rewarded for structure .
We get big bucks for reliably generating useful technology that works .
Sure , we ’re artists , but it ’s an art of patterns , repetition , structure , and efficiency ( I swear , it ’s sexy ) .
This makes it not surprising that the places we create in our homes and in our minds are designed in the same fashion .
The risk with these places is the same risk with all comfortable places .
In the comfort , we forget that some of the most interesting stuff happens elsewhere .
Faces of paper wasps ( Polistes dominulus ) .
The morespots the wasps have , the more other wasps stay away .
Just as some people look too scary to get into a fight with , so too do the looks on the faces of some wasps keep others away .
Like a karate black belt , paper wasps wear black spots to warn others of their grappling prowess , according to a new study that illustrates a strategy animals can use to avoid fights .
Animals spend a lot of time competing with each other over sex , food , territory or other desirables .
" Competition can be really costly , so you get these signals to reduce competition , " explained researcher Elizabeth Tibbetts , a behavioral ecologist at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor .
Tibbetts spent a lot of time looking at paper wasps ( Polistes dominulus ) .
" I noticed all these different facial patterns and wondered why , " she recalled .
" And then , as I pursued it , I discovered they were getting used as signals . "
The better fed and larger these wasps are , the more black spots they often have on their yellow faces .
Tibbetts reasoned the more spots wasp faces had , the more other wasps might shy away .
The researchers perched dead wasps on top of sugar cubes and painted their faces with specific patterns .
They next saw if other wasps dared approach the cubes for some tasty sugar .
" The dead wasps kind of served like scarecrows for the other wasps , " Tibbetts explained .
At first , the scientists tried tethering live wasps to the sugar cubes .
" That turned out to be very difficult , " Tibbetts told LiveScience .
" They do n't like that . "
The researchers found that wasps preferred challenging guards with fewer spots and veered off from those with more spots .
Tibbetts and her colleague Rebecca Lindsay detailed their findings online March 12 in the journal Biology Letters .
" It 's like karate belts , " Tibbetts said .
" Someone with a black belt is better than someone with a yellow belt .
...
It 's a convention we have to signal fighting ability . "
And as any black belt knows , other people knowing you are one can keep you out of fights .
When it comes to how common the use of visual markings are in the animal kingdom to scare away potential foes , Tibbetts said , " I bet it 's pretty widespread .
Insects are sometimes thought to be relatively simple .
So if insects can do this , chances are many other animals do it too . "

In another example of Hillary ’s resume being a wee bit padded , it seems that Hillary did n’t create the children ’s health insurance bill after all .
In fact , her husband ’s White House was initially against the bill .
But in all fairness to Hillary , I hear Barack Obama is black .
From the Boston Globe :
[ T ]he Clinton White House , while supportive of the idea of expanding children ’s health , fought the first SCHIP effort , spearheaded by Senators Edward M. Kennedy , Democrat of Massachusetts , and Orrin G. Hatch , Republican of Utah , because of fears that it would derail a bigger budget bill .
And several current and former lawmakers and staff said Hillary Clinton had no role in helping to write the congressional legislation , which grew out of a similar program approved in Massachusetts in 1996 … .
privately , some lawmakers and staff members are fuming over what they see as Clinton ’s exaggeration of her role in developing SCHIP , including her campaign ads claiming she “ helped create ” the program .
The irritation has grown since Nov. 1 , when Clinton – along with fellow senators and presidential candidates Barack Obama , Chris Dodd , and John McCain – missed a Senate vote to extend the SCHIP program , which was approved without the votes of those lawmakers .
We 've tried to stay out of the weeds of accusations / counter - accusations between the Democratic candidates , but after a discussion behind the scenes here at C&L , we came to the conclusion that we needed to cover this story .
While C&L has not -- and will not -- endorse either Democratic candidate , Ferraro 's comments were over the line offensive and absurd on the face of it , and the Clinton response unacceptably tepid , especially considering the uproar over Power 's remarks last week .
Download Download
This mash up from Tuesday 's Countdown features Keith Olbermann speaking with Howard Fineman and Rachel Maddow .
Fineman posits that the Clinton 's reluctance to fire Ferraro -- and this was n't the first time she 's made these comments -- Ferraro's refusal to back down and Campaign Manager Maggie Williams ' angry pushback is because this is the kind of fight that Clinton wants .
Rachel Maddow does n't know if this is the best strategy for the Clinton campaign to take :
For anybody to be saying that Barack Obama is only where he is because he is black , that black men are so privileged in America that that 's the only thing that explains his success because he 's otherwise unqualified - which is the implication of her comment , would be absolutely offensive , more than regrettable , from anybody commenting seriously on the campaign .
Honestly , you know it , you know it would be .
But for this to come from somebody whose an official part of the campaign and the campaign did not to disavow that person and distance themselves , is , it 's an incredible decision and therefore does make us question whether they 're doing this on purpose for some reason . "
Pam Spaulding can't figure out what the Clinton campaign is thinking either .
One whisper that has been floated as a possible alibi is that Ferraro 's ongoing cancer treatment meds may be affecting her , but that does n't excuse Clinton 's mild response .
In fact , there 's no excuse whatsoever for this kind of thinking at all .
Can you imagine the uproar if O'Reilly or Limbaugh said this and is that the kind of company Clinton wants to place herself ?

My friend Bernie says he can't believe the American people have n't figured out what it 's all about .
" The whole damn political scene is nothing but a corporate media freak show , " he said .
" There 's no breathing room between elections -- no time nor interest in investigating , or even addressing , issues that are critical to our survival as a nation .
The minute every last dollar is sucked out of the competition , the candidate who bought the most attack ads -- the most face time -- wins , and the election is over .
Then , " Bernie said with disgust , " it 's time to start raising money for the next election , because the media is already out there campaigning . "
" I had n't thought of it that way , " I said .
" But , surely electing a president is more important than the media , or who can raise the most money --"
" It does n't matter what you think , " Bernie said flatly .
The mainstream media , both print and electronic , are as important as the American people allow them to be .
And we 've allowed them total control over our thoughts , our beliefs .
They 're freaks -- actors whose role is to divert national attention , manipulate public opinion , and keep the public in a state of suspended paralysis .
They 're bullhorns for corporate Boss Hogs and administration creeps who are determined to seize power and keep the military industrial complex rolling in dough . "
Bernie 's right .
With each presidential campaign , the list of candidates -- serious candidates -- grows shorter , and the media grow more brazen in either trashing or ostracizing those who pose a threat to the corporate status quo .
The media is determined to choose the president no matter what voters want .
Little by little , the media has inserted itself into the process until elections are no longer about candidates or issues .
They 're about the media and what the media thinks about candidates and issues .
If you doubt that , check out CNN 's 24/7 " Ballot Bowl 08 " with Wolf Blitzer and " the best political team in television , " stumble into America 's Election Headquarters over at the Foxhole 's " Strategy Room , " spend a rollicking evening in MSNBC , " The Place for Politics , " where you can watch Chris Matthews throw his hard balls at Hillary , listen to Keith Olbermann scold all those who disagree with him , or just relax and let M.C. Rove 's dancing partner , David Gregory , decide the winner in his new " Race for the White House " show ...
The One World Order criminals who seized power in the 2000 election coup will not exit peacefully if defeated in November .
They have ruled through brutality and fear and , with the eager help of the media , stoked that fear into seven long years of shameful " patriotic " panic .
Their eyes are on the prize -- total US dominion and control of the world and its resources .
They 're in too deep to back off now , and will not willingly accept defeat .
The person taking over the reins of leadership from Bush must be one of their own , regardless of party .
That is why the media relentlessly ambushed , weeded out , and tossed six of the eight Democratic presidential wannabes unceremoniously aside .
From the outset , the only two Democratic candidates in the media race were Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
The media and their corporate masters knew the hokey soap opera between a white woman and a black man would keep the masses panting for more " American Idol " drama and their attention diverted from more pressing matters , such as a landscape strewn with body parts , a desert stained red with innocent blood , dead and suffering children , grieving , horror - shocked parents on the one side -- and a smirking idiot madman on the other who chants mindlessly about " completing the mission ... spreading freedom throughout the world ... "
In their critical " George Bush : The Unauthorized Biography , " Webster Tarpley and Anton Chaitkin warned that we are immersed in times of moral and cultural degradation wherein " rulers of great evil have inflicted incalculable suffering on humanity . "
The book is less about Bush 41 or the Bush family than it is " an unveiling of the abuse and misuse of power , the shenanigans of egotism running rampant in high places . "
The authors strip aside the " curtain of secrecy , myopic journalism , and the illusion of a ' free ' press , " and stress that we must be " fully aware of the propaganda of the ' spin doctors ' and the manipulations that benefit a few at the expense of the many . "
Tarpley and Chaitkin say we " are not to condone or advance this egoistic behavior , but to stand tall and say no to those who claim power . "
Many more of us than the media will admit are doing just that -- from the courageous " Winter Soldiers " who stood up against the war machine last week , to the masses whose protests and arrests are blacked out by the media , to the growing numbers who speak truth to power on the Internet and on progressive radio .
Fortunately , there are far too many to list , but if you 're just waking up , and it 's sheer , raw truth you 're after , check out Chris Floyd anytime , or listen to Nova M Radio 's Mike Malloy week nights from 9 - midnight ( EST ) .
Nebraska 's Republican Senator Chuck Hagel says in his new book , " America : Our Next Chapter , " that it 's time for independent leadership and , perhaps , even for another political party .
I agree .
Those like Dick Cheney who have a death grip on power , and who will only tighten that grip if they remain in power , do not care what the American people think .
White House press secretary Dana Perino echoed Cheney 's sentiments last week when she told a reporter the American people have a right to speak only once every four years .
After that , they can just shut up and follow the leader ...
The current election is possibly the most important in US history .
Yet , ironically , thanks to the media , few of us in either party have a horse in this race .
We have one last chance to change that .
We must stand together and support a candidate whose love for country overshadows party loyalty and media sound bites -- a candidate who will fight for the freedoms and rights bestowed upon us by the founding fathers -- who will work to restore our infrastructure and our environment .
That candidate is former Vice President Al Gore , the man legally elected President of the United States in 2000 .
It 's time to heal the wound and move on to the Inauguration .
Together , we must ask Al Gore to answer the call one last time .
If it takes a new party , so be it .
Because saving our republic , repairing our Constitution , and returning the power to the people is what it 's all about .

More Opportunity Costs of Foregoing Nuclear Power
We ’ve written quite a few times about the helter - skelter path that nuclear power has taken in this country ; see this Times column , this supporting evidence , and this blog post for a quick summary .
Here , from today ’s Times , is an assessment of nuclear power that has a good deal in common with ours :
“ All careful analysis confirms that the risk of nuclear power is small .
The chance of a large accident is very low , and consequences of such an accident would be substantially less than most people think .
…
In the United States , the near - term risk of doing without nuclear power is the risk attached to using oil or coal instead …
The problems that these cause include acid rain ; enormous balance - of - payment problems in the case of oil ; the risk of war to ensure oil supplies ; carcinogens in the air as oil and coal are burned ; heavy metals such as mercury , lead and uranium emitted to the atmosphere as coal burns ; black lung disease as coal is mined ; vast areas of the country ruined as coal is strip - mined , etc . ”
Like I said , this appeared in today ’s newspaper .
But when do you think these words were first written ?
Try … 1983 .
The article in today ’s paper is an obituary of Herbert J.C. Couts , a nuclear power safety expert who died last week .
The text above is from an appendix to a report by a commission assembled to advise New York Governor Mario Cuomo what to do about the controversial Shoreham nuclear power plant on Long Island .
It should be noted that Kouts ’s advice was ignored : Shoreham was built , but shut down without ever making any electricity .
The obituary is worth reading if you ’re interested in the history of nuclear power .

Digital speed cameras which capture drivers smoking or eating at the wheel are being introduced nationwide in a new move to hammer motorists .
Drivers will also face fines , bans and even jail for infringements such as driving without a seatbelt , using a hand - held mobile phone or overtaking across double white lines .
The hi-tech DVD cameras , which have instant playback , will also be used to provide photographic evidence against those eating sandwiches or rolling - up cigarettes at the wheel .
Scroll down for more ...
These are now considered serious offences under new guidelines drawn up for prosecutors .
The development will massively increase the number of fines and prosecutions against normally law - abiding drivers for relatively minor offences .
As well as being fined £ 60 and given three points on their licences , motorists now face two years in jail if their actions are considered to have been a factor in dangerous driving .
Virtually every police force in England , Wales and Scotland is now equipped with the new digital cameras .
They were given Home Office approval in April but are quietly being rolled out nationwide .
More than 100 have been sold .
The manufacturers have said their order book is full until next April .
The DVD cameras can operate as conventional speed traps .
But thanks to the instant playback , they also double up to photograph motorists flouting laws other than speeding .
Set up by a police officer on sites such as motorway bridges , they constantly scan the cars and can digitally record drivers behind the wheel committing a vast array of minor traffic offences .
Crucially the new technology , called Concept , allows officers to play back the footage to locate , view and capture the offence instantly .
Photographs taken using the device show how effective it is , capturing pictures such as a man apparently steering his Renault with his bare feet and the driver of an Alfa Romeo with a mobile phone clamped to his ear .
Scroll down for more ...
The device is made and sold by Tele - Traffic UK whose chief executive , Jon Bond , is a former police chief superintendent in charge of speed cameras in Warwickshire .
He said : " It is the first camera to record offences other than speeding and give an instant playback .
" If the camera is being used for speed enforcement , but the police officer spots another driving offence being committed - or even thinks he saw something - he can play it back in a second .
The offences are easily and quickly detectable . "
Mr Bond , whose Warwick - based company employs 20 , added : " At present , officers can record an offence such as driving with a mobile phone clamped to their ear or without a seatbelt but would then have to look through perhaps two hours of tape in order to find it again .
" Concept means that those operating the camera can digitally log everything .
They are linked to the team in the back office who can instantly find the offence , see the proof and send out a penalty charge notice to the car 's registeredowner .
" This will cut down massively on the amount of time police officers have to spend on paperwork and so speed up prosecutions .
The days of the police having to chase after people who are infringing the law in these ways are gone .
That will make the roads a safer place . "
The Concept digital DVD technology costs £ 17,750 .
But police forces who already use Tele - Traffic 's existing analogue ( non-digital ) system , can upgrade for a fraction of that price .
Smoking at the wheel was recently included in the Highway Code as something which courts can consider as a factor when police accuse drivers of failing to have proper control of their vehicle .
More than 300,000 drivers a day are still illegally using hand - held phones at the wheel , recent government figures revealed .
The penalties for using a handheld phone while driving , which was outlawed in 2003 , were increased in February this year from a £ 30 fine to £ 60 , plus three penalty points .
Under new sentencing rules , motorists using hand - held mobile phones could be jailed for two years and be disqualified if this was an aggravating factor in dangerous driving .
Those who kill while using a mobile face 14 years behind bars , under a charge of causing death by dangerous driving .
Last October , Mr Bond and his Tele - Traffic team were under fire after admitting to undercover reporters posing as customers that speed cameras were a " scam " and that setting up cameras in new areas was the equivalent of having " a blank chequebook " that would result in " bucketfuls " of cash .
Self - styled Captain Gatso of the campaign group Motorists Against Detection said : " This is yet another example of the Big Brother surveillance society where there 's no escape from the cameras . "

( This essay grew out of something I wrote for myself to figure out what we do .
Even though Y Combinator is now 3 years old , we 're still trying to understand its implications . )
I was annoyed recently to read a description of Y Combinator that said " Y Combinator does seed funding for startups . "
What was especially annoying about it was that I wrote it .
This does n't really convey what we do .
And the reason it 's inaccurate is that , paradoxically , funding very early stage startups is not mainly about funding .
Saying YC does seed funding for startups is a description in terms of earlier models .
It 's like calling a car a horseless carriage .
When you scale animals you can't just keep everything in proportion .
For example , volume grows as the cube of linear dimension , but surface area only as the square .
So as animals get bigger they have trouble radiating heat .
That 's why mice and rabbits are furry and elephants and hippos are n't .
You can't make a mouse by scaling down an elephant .
YC represents a new , smaller kind of animal — so much smaller that all the rules are different .
Before us , most companies in the startup funding business were venture capital funds .
VCs generally fund later stage companies than we do .
And they supply so much money that , even though the other things they do may be very valuable , it 's not that inaccurate to regard VCs as sources of money .
Good VCs are " smart money , " but they 're still money .
All good investors supply a combination of money and help .
But these scale differently , just as volume and surface area do .
Late stage investors supply huge amounts of money and comparatively little help : when a company about to go public gets a mezzanine round of $ 50 million , the deal tends to be almost entirely about money .
As you move earlier in the venture funding process , the ratio of help to money increases , because earlier stage companies have different needs .
Early stage companies need less money because they 're smaller and cheaper to run , but they need more help because life is so precarious for them .
So when VCs do a series A round for , say , $ 2 million , they generally expect to offer a significant amount of help along with the money .
Y Combinator occupies the earliest end of the spectrum .
We 're at least one and generally two steps before VC funding .
( Though some startups go straight from YC to VC , the most common trajectory is to do an angel round first . )
And what happens at Y Combinator is as different from what happens in a series A round as a series A round is from a mezzanine financing .
At our end , money is almost a negligible factor .
The startup usually consists of just the founders .
Their living expenses are the company 's main expense , and since most founders are under 30 , their living expenses are low .
But at this early stage companies need a lot of help .
Practically every question is still unanswered .
Some companies we 've funded have been working on their software for a year or more , but others have n't decided what to work on , or even who the founders should be .
When PR people and journalists recount the histories of startups after they 've become big , they always underestimate how uncertain things were at first .
They 're not being deliberately misleading .
When you look at a company like Google , it 's hard to imagine they could once have been small and helpless .
Sure , at one point they were a just a couple guys in a garage — but even then their greatness was assured , and all they had to do was roll forward along the railroad tracks of destiny .
Far from it .
A lot of startups with just as promising beginnings end up failing .
Google has such momentum now that it would be hard for anyone to stop them .
But all it would have taken in the beginning would have been for two Google employees to focus on the wrong things for six months , and the company could have died .
We know , because we 've been there , just how vulnerable startups are in the earliest phases .
Curiously enough , that 's why founders tend to get so rich from them .
Reward is always proportionate to risk , and very early stage startups are insanely risky .
What we really do at Y Combinator is get startups launched straight .
One of many metaphors you could use for YC is a steam catapult on an aircraft carrier .
We get startups airborne .
Barely airborne , but enough that they can accelerate fast .
When you 're launching planes they have to be set up properly or you 're just launching projectiles .
They have to be pointed straight down the deck ; the wings have to be trimmed properly ; the engines have to be at full power ; the pilot has to be ready .
These are the kind of problems we deal with .
After we fund startups we work closely with them for three months — so closely in fact that we insist they move to where we are .
And what we do in those three months is make sure everything is set up for launch .
If there are tensions between cofounders we help sort them out .
We get all the paperwork set up properly so there are no nasty surprises later .
If the founders are n't sure what to focus on first , we try to figure that out .
If there is some obstacle right in front of them , we either try to remove it , or shift the startup sideways .
The goal is to get every distraction out of the way so the founders can use that time to build ( or finish building ) something impressive .
And then near the end of the three months we push the button on the steam catapult in the form of Demo Day , where the current group of startups present to pretty much every investor in Silicon Valley .
Launching companies is n't identical with launching products .
Though we do spend a lot of time on launch strategies for products , there are some things that take too long to build for a startup to launch them before raising their next round of funding .
Several of the most promising startups we 've funded have n't launched their products yet , but are definitely launched as companies .
In the earliest stage , startups not only have more questions to answer , but they tend to be different kinds of questions .
In later stage startups the questions are about deals , or hiring , or organization .
In the earliest phase they tend to be about technology and design .
What do you make ?
That 's the first problem to solve .
That 's why our motto is " Make something people want . "
This is always a good thing for companies to do , but it 's even more important early on , because it sets the bounds for every other question .
Who you hire , how much money you raise , how you market yourself — they all depend on what you 're making .
Because the early problems are so much about technology and design , you probably need to be hackers to do what we do .
While some VCs have technical backgrounds , I do n't know any who still write code .
Their expertise is mostly in business — as it should be , because that 's the kind of expertise you need in the phase between series A and ( if you 're lucky ) IPO .
We 're so different from VCs that we 're really a different kind of animal .
Can we claim founders are better off as a result of this new type of venture firm ?
I 'm pretty sure the answer is yes , because YC is an improved version of what happened to our startup , and our case was not atypical .
We started Viaweb with $ 10,000 in seed money from our friend Julian .
He was a lawyer and arranged all our paperwork , so we could just code .
We spent three months building a version 1 , which we then presented to investors to raise more money .
Sounds familiar , does n't it ?
But YC improves on that significantly .
Julian knew a lot about law and business , but his advice ended there ; he was not a startup guy .
So we made some basic mistakes early on .
And when we presented to investors , we presented to only 2 , because that was all we knew .
If we'd had our later selves to encourage and advise us , and Demo Day to present at , we would have been in much better shape .
We probably could have raised money at 3 to 5 times the valuation we did .
If we take 7 % of a company we fund , the founders only have to do 7.5 % better in their next round of funding to end up net ahead .
We certainly manage that .
So who is our 7 % coming out of ?
If the founders end up net ahead it 's not coming out of them .
So is it coming out of later stage investors ?
Well , they do end up paying more .
But I think they pay more because the company is actually more valuable .
And later stage investors have no problem with that .
The returns of a VC fund depend on the quality of the companies they invest in , not how cheaply they can buy stock in them .
If what we do is useful , why was n't anyone doing it before ?
There are two answers to that .
One is that people were doing it before , just haphazardly on a smaller scale .
Before us , seed funding came primarily from individual angel investors .
Larry and Sergey , for example , got their seed funding from Andy Bechtolsheim , one of the founders of Sun .
And because he was a startup guy he probably gave them useful advice .
But raising money from angel investors is a hit or miss thing .
It 's a sideline for most of them , so they only do a handful of deals a year and they do n't spend a lot of time on the startups they invest in .
And they 're hard to reach , because they do n't want random startups pestering them with business plans .
The Google guys were lucky because they knew someone who knew Bechtolsheim .
It generally takes a personal introduction with angels .
The other reason no one was doing quite what we do is that till recently it was a lot more expensive to start a startup .
You 'll notice we have n't funded any biotech startups .
That 's still expensive .
But advancing technology has made web startups so cheap that you really can get a company airborne for $ 15,000 .
If you understand how to operate a steam catapult , at least .
So in effect what 's happened is that a new ecological niche has opened up , and Y Combinator is the new kind of animal that has moved into it .
We 're not a replacement for venture capital funds .
We occupy a new , adjacent niche .
And conditions in our niche are really quite different .
It 's not just that the problems we face are different ; the whole structure of the business is different .
VCs are playing a zero-sum game .
They 're all competing for a slice of a fixed amount of " deal flow , " and that explains a lot of their behavior .
Whereas our m.o. is to create new deal flow , by encouraging hackers who would have gotten jobs to start their own startups instead .
We compete more with employers than VCs .
It 's not surprising something like this would happen .
Most fields become more specialized — more articulated — as they develop , and startups are certainly an area in which there has been a lot of development over the past couple decades .
The venture business in its present form is only about forty years old .
It stands to reason it would evolve .
And it 's natural that the new niche would at first be described , even by its inhabitants , in terms of the old one .
But really Y Combinator is not in the startup funding business .
Really we 're more of a small , furry steam catapult .

The Waggoner lawsuit is the latest messy allegation to hit Giuliani ’s private businesses .
Giuliani law firm sued by high profile Texan
A prominent Texas Republican has sued Rudy Giuliani ’s law firm and a close friend and partner of Giuliani’s , Kenneth Caruso , alleging that Caruso , the firm and others “ schemed and conspired to steal $ 10 million . ”
J. Virgil Waggoner , a Houston businessman and philanthropist , filed the previously unreported suit in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan in July .
He alleges that Caruso , his former lawyer , conspired with Waggoner ’s investment adviser to cover up the disappearance of $ 10 million Waggoner invested through a Caribbean bank , the British Trade & Commerce Bank .
Advertisement
Waggoner claims Caruso “ may have also been romantically involved ” with the investment adviser .
The Caribbean bank was shut down after its handling of Waggoner ’s investment came to light , and its president was later jailed for money laundering .
Caruso , Bracewell & Giuliani , and Caruso ’s two former firms — all named as defendants — have filed motions to dismiss the complaint on largely procedural grounds , and Caruso ’s personal defense lawyer , Fred Warder , called it “ meritless . ”
“ It ’s a pretty familiar tale of a deal gone bad and the principal trying to scapegoat his lawyers , ” Warder said .
“ We expect it will go away on motions . ”
The Waggoner lawsuit is the latest messy allegation to hit Giuliani ’s private businesses , which include the law firm and his consulting firm , Giuliani Partners , located five blocks from each other in Midtown Manhattan .
His former police commissioner , Bernard Kerik , left the consulting firm after his nomination to head the Department of Homeland Security collapsed amid questions about his personal ethics .
Kerik was convicted and fined in 2006 for illegally accepting gifts and failing to report a personal loan while running the police department .
Giuliani and his firm have also faced protests for employing a Giuliani childhood friend and Catholic priest , Alan Placa , who was barred from priestly duties after being accused of molesting boys more than two decades ago .
Placa has insisted the charges are false , and Giuliani has stoutly defended him .
Caruso , who joined Bracewell & Giuliani in 2005 , was , like many of the former New York mayor ’s tight inner circle , an assistant U.S. attorney when Giuliani was U.S. attorney for the Southern District in the Reagan administration .
Later , he worked on Giuliani ’s mayoral campaigns .
In Giuliani ’s book , “ Leadership , ” he describes Caruso as “ a close friend ” whose advice he sought when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2000 .
“ I do n’t care if you ’re a senator or a mayor or anything else .
You ca n’t do anything unless you live and are healthy .
You ’re my friend .
Put your health first , ” Giuliani recalled Caruso telling him .
Giuliani writes that he took Caruso ’s advice and dropped out of the race to replace former New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan .
Giuliani ’s personal financial disclosure form , required for presidential candidates , also shows an undated , apparently interest - free personal loan from Giuliani to Caruso valued between $ 250,000 and $ 500,000 .
There could have been interest compounded in a previous year ( or if it ’s below $ 201 , it would not have to be listed ) .
Giuliani ’s spokeswoman , Katie Levinson , declined to comment on the Waggoner lawsuit or the loan , referring comments to Warder .
Melanie Hillis , a spokeswoman for Bracewell & Giuliani , whose main office is in Houston , also referred questions about the case to Warder .
Warder said last week he would seek his client ’s response to a detailed list of questions stemming from the complaint .
Warder said Monday he was “ not at liberty ” to answer any questions except to say that the personal loan is not connected to the case .
Waggoner is an unlikely antagonist for the Republican front - runner .
The founder of the Sterling Chemical Company , Waggoner — now in his late 70s and retired — has long been a major player in Texas Republican circles and gave tens of thousands of dollars to the campaigns for governor of now - President George W. Bush and the current governor , Rick Perry .
In 2000 , he wrote a $ 250,000 check to the Republican National Committee .
But he has n’t contributed to any 2008 presidential campaigns .
The sequence leading to Waggoner ’s lawsuit , according to the complaint , began at a Texas Republican fundraiser in 1996 .
There , the chemical executive met Lisa Duperier , who had been an unsuccessful 1986 GOP candidate for Congress in the Houston area .
The next year , the complaint says , Duperier — who is not named in the suit — convinced him to invest $ 10 million in a “ High Yield Investment Program , ” promising extravagant returns and little risk .
The investment never yielded a penny , and it became a case study in concerns about international banking on Capitol Hill .
In February 2001 , the ranking Democrat on the Senate Investigations Committee , Michigan Sen. Carl Levin , released a report titled “ Correspondent Banking : A Gateway for Money Laundering . ”
The report , which found the British Trade & Commerce Bank ’s handling of Waggoner ’s money “ troubling , ” suggested Waggoner had been “ told by [ the bank ] that the $ 10 million investment would produce $ 50 million or more in profits in less than six months . ”
The report said investigators found “ no clear evidence that the [ Waggoner ] funds were ever invested . ”
Federal Judge Robert Sweet , who presided over an earlier attempt by Waggoner to recover part of his money , remarked that the promises “ sound so preposterous that it is difficult to fathom how any investor could imagine they would be fulfilled , ” according to a motion filed by another defendant in Waggoner ’s suit , Caruso ’s former firm of Chadbourne & Parke .
The Senate report does not mention Duperier .
It says that Caruso , then Waggoner ’s lawyer , refused to cooperate with Senate investigators .
In the summer of 1998 , Waggoner ’s complaint says , Waggoner became concerned about his investment , and Duperier suggested he hire Caruso to investigate the whereabouts of his money and to attempt to recover it .
Waggoner now claims , according to the complaint , that Duperier was involved in the fraud and was living with a vice president of the British Trade & Commerce Bank , Charles Brazie , a fact of which Caruso — also allegedly romantically linked to Duperier , according to the suit — was allegedly aware .
Waggoner also complains that Caruso never told him that investments like his “ were regarded as fraudulent and their promoters were generally considered as con artists . ”
Instead , he says , Caruso actually “ sought and agreed to represent a principal of [ the British Trade & Commerce Bank , Brazie ] in connection with a 2001 U.S. Senate investigation ” without disclosing the alleged conflict to Waggoner .
In the wake of the Senate report , the tiny Commonwealth of Dominica revoked the bank ’s license .
The bank ’s president , Rodolfo Requena , was subsequently convicted in federal court in Miami on money laundering charges and sentenced to 30 months in jail .
Waggoner accuses Duperier of involvement in the alleged fraud and alleges that Caruso worked closely with Duperier — who initially steered Waggoner to the investment .
The complaint cites a 1998 fax in which Duperier offered “ talking points ” to Caruso on how best to talk to Waggoner :
“ As long as you are forceful , it should be OK .
Repeat things and be direct .
Just give him a sense that things are moving and he ’s not being shoved aside . ”
In an e-mail from the same year cited in the complaint , Duperier allegedly wrote of the investment program that there was “ big money here .
Remember , my share of this deal ultimately is $ 10 million . ”
Waggoner now seeks to recover his investment , along with punitive damages .
Duperier , who now lives in Washington and is a neighborhood activist in the Adams Morgan neighborhood , did not respond to messages left on her work and cell phones over nearly a week ’s time .
Waggoner ’s New York lawyer , James Mahon , declined to explain why she is not named in the suit .
Mahon declined to comment on whether he had shared details of the case with federal prosecutors at the Southern District of New York , where Giuliani served as U.S. attorney .
A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney , Yusill Scribner , declined to comment on any aspect of the case , citing office policy not to confirm or deny the existence of ongoing investigations .
As Bender ’s Big Score gets set to air in four installments on Comedy Central later this month , Fox Home Entertainment ahs announced that the next adventure in the series of Futurama DVD movies will be available at retail this summer .
The Fate of human and robot - kind is at stake when Futurama : The Beast With A Billion Backs debuts at retail on June 24 .
In what Fox is calling the most tentacle - packed Futurama epic , space itself rips open , revealing a gateway to another universe .
What lies beyond is a mix of horror and love as the Planet Express crew encounters a repulsive , planet - sized monster with romantic intentions .
The second feature - length Futurama film will be followed by at least two more movies from series creators Matt Groening and David X. Cohen .
The show ’s entire voice cast and most of its main writers have returned to help revive the series , which FOX cancelled in 2003 .
Groening , who also created The Simpsons , has told us that Futurama is the animated show he ’s most proud of .
Those who have n’t picked up Bender ’s Big Score on DVD yet can catch it on Comedy Central on March 23 at 8 p.m .
Jan. 31 , 2008  --
When this hot rod rolls out on the street , traffic stops and people stare .
People are n't quite sure what to make of the bright - white vehicle with gold rims and gold trim that is a cross between an off - road vehicle and someone 's fantasy hot rod .
This vehicle is dubbed the Chariot by the design team at the Johnson Space Center .
This team was given one year to design and build this ultimate concept lunar rover .
Lucien Junkin , a 17 - year veteran of the NASA robotics program , is the chief engineer for the project , and he could hardly wait to get started on designing a new lunar rover .
" We built this vehicle in 12 months .
Our mandate was building a truck that could go to the moon .
When we return to the moon , we will need a utility vehicle , a lunar truck if you will . "
NASA is planning to return to the moon by 2020 and is well along the design process with a new capsule called Orion , which looks remarkably similar to the original Apollo , which carried the first U.S. astronauts to the moon .
The plan is to build a colony on the moon , so clearly the astronauts will need transportation to explore .
Junkin's Chariot does n't bear much resemblance to the first - generation lunar rovers .
" It challenges all the conventional wisdom of astronauts sitting as they drive .
Our crew members will stand up , and we can carry more than two astronauts .
The Chariot can move in a crablike motion from side to side as well as forward and reverse .
It has six wheels instead of four wheels . "
Harrison Schmitt and Gene Cernan were the last two astronauts to visit the moon during Apollo 17 in December 1972 .
Schmitt was the last person to drive a lunar rover .
The new team asked him for advice before it started building the rover .
Schmitt told designers a lower step on the rover would make it much easier for the astronauts to get on board .
" The spacesuits were bulky and not that flexible .
My own weight plus the total weight of the suit and life support system totaled about 370 earth pounds , even though the weight on the moon was only about 61 pounds , " he told ABC News .
But he added , " We were happy with our rover , it performed very well . …
What we used on the moon with Apollo 15 , 16 and 17 was a four - wheel vehicle with independent drive on each wheel , front and rear wheel steering , which you could use independently . "
Range and speed will be improved with the new rove , Schmitt said .
In 1972 , they drove a total of 35 kilometers at a top speed of six knots .
" We set up a mission rule about how far we would be from the lunar module , with a certain amount of consumables in the back pack in case we broke down and had to walk back , but we never did break down , " he said .
That 's something Junkin and his design team kept in mind with their rover .
" With one vehicle , its range is driven by the walk - back distance .
If it breaks down , a suited astronaut has to be able to walk back to the base .
So you can go out for four hours .
To expand that distance you need to have two trucks , so you can off - load the equipment and take the other truck home .
We figure about 25 kilometers exploration distance in one day .
A fully suited astronaut on Earth weighs 500 pounds ; this vehicle will carry 2,000 pounds , " he said .
The Chariot will get a top speed of 15 mph .
Astronaut John
Young set a speed record of 8 mph when he went to the moon .
Any faster than that , says Schmitt , and you would bounce all over the place with the moon 's one - sixth gravity .
The Chariot was also influenced by the design of the sturdy little Mars Rovers , Spirit and Opportunity , which are still going four years later .
" We learned from the Mars rovers that six wheels are better than four .
If one wheel fails you can lift it up still keep going on the other five .
When you are on the moon it 's not going to be as easy to change a spare tire , " Junkin said .
" We will have to do that from time to time but it is nice to have redundancy so you do n't have to pull off to the side of the road and do maintenance . "
During the Apollo 17 mission , Schmitt wrote in his journal from the southeastern edge of Mare Serenitatis in the Valley of Taurus - Littrow .
" For 75 hours , Gene Cernan and I lived and worked in the valley , performing extensive geological studies of the volcanic rocks that partially fill the valley , " he said .
" In our explorations of the valley , we drove the Rover about 35 kilometers , collected and documented over 110 kilograms of moon rocks and soils , and took over 2,400 photographs . "
What extras would Schmitt add to the rover ?
No cup holder but possibly a ski rack .
" In one - sixth gravity you spend some time off the surface .
It was like skiing .
An astronaut using the skiing technique in a good suit could go that fast and keep up with the rover .
Cross -country skiing will be the recreation of choice on the moon . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Sprint Nextel Corp S.N posted a quarterly loss of $ 29.45 billion on Thursday due to a huge goodwill write - off and forecast deepening subscriber losses , pushing its stock down as much as 13 percent to a five - year low .

Sprint Nextel , the No. 3 U.S. mobile service , on Thursday posted a quarterly loss on a steep impairment charge , and forecast a deepening of subscriber losses in the first quarter .
REUTERS / Enny Nuraheni
The No. 3 U.S. mobile service said it would stop paying dividends for the foreseeable future , and Chief Executive Dan Hesse said it would take many quarters to turn the company around and rebuild its brand .
“ To be frank , the issues we face are more difficult than what I expected to find , ” Hesse , who replaced Gary Forsee as CEO in December , told analysts on a conference call .
“ It takes hard work and time to regain a reputation . ”
Sprint has been losing ground to rivals amid network and customer service problems .
Analysts had expected the fourth quarter to be bad , but they were hoping for a clear plan from the company to turn around its business .
Instead , Sprint surprised Wall Street with a forecast for subscriber losses that was “ considerably worse than even the most bearish estimates out there , ” said Stanford Group analyst Michael Nelson .
Sprint forecast that in the current quarter it would lose 1.2 million customers who pay monthly bills , compared with 683,000 such losses in the fourth quarter .
Nelson had expected a first - quarter loss of 400,000 .
Sprint said it does not expect subscriber losses to be any better in the second quarter .
Smaller rival T - Mobile USA , owned by Deutsche Telekom DTEGn.DE , on Thursday reported a gain of 951,000 net new customers in the fourth quarter .
Sprint forecast first - quarter operating income of $ 1.8 billion to $ 1.9 billion before depreciation and amortization .
Stifel Nicolaus analyst Chris King had expected $ 2.3 billion .
“ The bar they ’re setting here better be rock - bottom , ” King said .
He said Sprint could beat its outlook , noting that Hesse had a history of conservative guidance at Embarq Corp EQ.N , the Sprint spin - off that he previously headed .
NO SILVER BULLET
Sprint said that starting Friday it will offer a $ 99.99 - per- month unlimited calls and data plan .
The move goes further than unlimited plans unveiled last week by larger rivals AT&T Inc T.N and Verizon Wireless , which were just for voice .
But the Sprint plan is not as aggressive as some analysts had expected .
There had been speculation that Sprint would spur a price war by announcing unlimited plans for as low as $ 60 a month .
Stifel ’s King said the Sprint plan was unlikely to help the company boost its market share significantly .
Sprint said it was assessing a reorganization of its business model and warned that the new price plan was “ not a silver bullet ” for the company , which needs to stem customer cancellations , improve how it handles customer telephone inquiries , and create a simpler branding message .
Hesse said the company ’s brand was strong but “ lacked relevance and a clear message . ”
He set out plans to keep Sprint as the umbrella brand and to use the Nextel brand only for features such as its push - to - talk service .
Sprint ’s fourth - quarter loss of $ 10.36 a share compared with a profit of 9 cents a share , or $ 261 million , a year earlier .
Revenue fell 6 percent to $ 9.8 billion , missing the average Wall Street forecast of $ 9.91 billion .
Excluding one - time items such as a $ 29.7 billion goodwill write - off from its acquisition of Nextel Communications , Sprint earned 21 cents per share , topping the average Wall Street forecast of 18 cents , according to Reuters Estimates .
Post - paid average revenue per user was $ 58 per month in the fourth quarter , and the company said it expects that figure to fall to a little over $ 56 in the first quarter .
It said it expects a further drop in the second quarter , but not as steep .
The company said it borrowed $ 2.5 billion from a revolving credit facility , and executives sought to reassure analysts that the company was in compliance with its debt covenants despite the weak outlook .
Sprint shares were down 76 cents to $ 8.19 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange after falling as low as $ 7.76 , their weakest level since October 2002 , earlier in the session .
The shares have fallen almost 70 percent since August 2005 , when Sprint bought Nextel .
Stifel ’s King said that if Sprint shows any signs of improving in the coming months , the stock could prove cheap .
“ I think there ’s still too much uncertainty to buy the stock today , ” he said , but added that he would n’t sell the shares either at the current low levels .
SAN FRANCISCO 
The conceit in the 1960s show “ The Outer Limits ” was that outside forces had taken control of your television set .
Next year in California , state regulators are likely to have the emergency power to control individual thermostats , sending temperatures up or down through a radio - controlled device that will be required in new or substantially modified houses and buildings to manage electricity shortages .
The proposed rules are contained in a document circulated by the California Energy Commission , which for more than three decades has set state energy efficiency standards for home appliances , like water heaters , air conditioners and refrigerators .
The changes would allow utilities to adjust customers ’ preset temperatures when the price of electricity is soaring .
Customers could override the utilities ’ suggested temperatures .
But in emergencies , the utilities could override customers ’ wishes .
Final approval is expected next month .
“ You realize there are times  very rarely , once every few years  when you would be subject to a rotating outage and everything would crash including your computer and traffic lights , and you do n’t want to do that , ” said Arthur H. Rosenfeld , a member of the energy commission .
Sebastian Horsley , a British author who has written an eyebrow - raising memoir detailing a life of rampant drug use and voluminous encounters with prostitutes , was turned back at Newark Liberty International Airport on Tuesday as he tried to enter the United States for a book party and New York news media tour .
Mr. Horsley , whose memoir , " Dandy in the Underworld , " was published last week in paperback by Harper Perennial , a unit of HarperCollins , said he was detained by United States customs authorities for eight hours and questioned about his former drug addiction , use of prostitutes and activity as a male escort .
" I ’m absolutely shattered and upset and gutted about not being able to come to America , " Mr. Horsley said in a telephone interview from London , where he had returned on Wednesday .
" I was very much looking forward to meeting everybody . "
Lucille Cirillo , a spokeswoman for the New York office of United States Customs and Border Protection , said she could not comment on specific cases .
But in an e-mail message , she said that under a waiver program that allows British citizens to enter the United States without a visa , " travelers who have been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude ( which includes controlled - substance violations ) or admit to previously having a drug addiction are not admissible . "
An American cannot read these two books without total revulsion at the reaction of his own government to Hitler 's policies against the Jews .
Both authors detail the methods by which American politicians and bureaucrats , while maintaining an appearance of great humanitarianism , used immigration policies to prevent Germany 's Jews from escaping to the United States .
Morse writes :
" In 1938 the Nazis burned every synagogue in the nation , shattered the windows of every Jewish establishment , hauled twenty - five thousand innocent people to concentration camps , and forced the Jews to pay 1,000,000,000 marks for the damage .
" Five days later , at a White House press conference , a reporter asked the President ' Would you recommend a relaxation of our immigration restrictions so that the Jewish refugees could be received in this country ? '
" ' This is not in contemplation , ' replied the President .
' We have the quota system . '
" The United States not only insisted upon its immigration law throughout the Nazi era , but administered it with severity and callousness .
In spite of unprecedented circumstances , the law was constricted so that even its narrow quotas were not met .
The lamp remained lifted beside the golden door , but the flame had been extinguished and the door was padlocked . "
In my earlier related piece , I offered some excerpts from an article by Sheldon Richman .
I 'm certain that many readers were puzzled and possibly very taken aback by this paragraph of Richman 's in particular :
But [ " illegal " immigrants ] came into our country without permission , conservative talker Tucker Carlson and his ilk say incessantly .
Without whose permission ?
The whole population of the United States ?
The federal government ?
Why the assumption that either of those aggregates can have the right to give or withhold permission for someone to relocate here ?
This is a country , not a country club , and rights are natural not national .
If someone wants to come here and can do so without trespassing on private property , that 's his right and his own business .
As my previous essay indicated , this view that " permission " is required for an immigrant to come to the United States is hardly limited to conservatives ; most liberals believe it , too .
Note that this was not the case in nineteenth - century America , as Hornberger discusses .
Americans could travel anywhere without passports " or other evidence of governmental consent , " and foreigners could come to the United States as they chose , for the government was prohibited " from interfering with the right of people everywhere to come to the United States to live and work . "
I also note that the idea that anyone in this country needed to ask " permission " from the government to engage in virtually any activity ( assuming that it did not violate anyone else 's fundamental rights ) is directly antithetical to the original conception of the United States .
( and as I documented in a recent installment of the " Dominion Over the World " series , for much of our history Americans could freely purchase almost every drug whose purchase and use is now criminalized . )
The United States , a Private and Exclusive Country Club
Please be advised that our membership requirements are restrictive in the extreme .
We maintain the most rigorous standards of admittance , and only allow a select number of new members to join each year .
If you think you have cause to wonder whether you are the right kind of person for our club , you are not .
" God bless America , land of the free , but sadly not the land of the depraved , " he said .
He referred to the recent resignation of Eliot Spitzer , the former governor of New York , in the wake of revelations that he had frequented prostitutes .
" I ’m not a politician , I ’m an artist , " Mr. Horsley said .
" Depravity is part of the job description . "
He added that he regarded his memoir as " a very moral book in the same way that Bret Easton Ellis ’s ‘ American Psycho ’ was a moral book . "
He added , " I ’m not a bad person . "
As discussed in more detail below , the following is very far from the worst example of the United States ' inhumane and indefensibly restrictive immigration policies .
But it is still another sickening and reprehensible sign that the moral inversion of America today is all but complete
This is utterly appalling on several levels .
Except for a brief period at the very beginning of our nation 's history , America 's attitudes and laws concerning immigration have been deplorable .
I 've written about this subject in considerable detail , in three essays in particular : " The Triumph of Racism , " " Give Me Your Tired , Your Poor -- But Not Too Many Jews , and Not Too Many Iraqis , " and " A Nation of Lepers , Criminals and Parasites .
" Permit me to remind you of a few especially salient points from history , and of some critical principles involved .
" Give Me Your Tired , Your Poor ... " first dealt with the deadly , viciously hypocritical immigration policies of the U.S. during the 1930s and 1940s .
I quoted from a Jacob Hornberger article that discussed two books on the subject .
In part , Hornberger wrote
The underlying political principles include these : Remember that last point , which is directly relevant to the case of Sebastian Horsley .
Sheldon Richman correctly states that ( my emphasis ) , " This is anot a country club ... "
Of course , Richman is referring to the political principles that only briefly animated the United States in its earliest years , and that are all but obliterated today .
But look at the various groups of people that the United States has targeted with anti-immigration vitriol , seeking to bar them from entrance to our own Holy Land throughout its history : Jews , the Irish , Slavs and as described by Peter Quinn
This list is far from complete -- and I have not even mentioned the unreasoning animus directed at " illegal " immigrants today .
See " The Triumph of Racism " on that subject .
And now you are " not admissible " if you have been convicted of a " crime involving moral turpitude " -- even if you have already suffered whatever penalty might have been imposed and are now free , although you arefree to enter the United States -- or if you " to previously having a drug addiction . "
Obviously , you should lie about it .
In short , if the United States government decides you are not the " right kind " of person , you are not wanted and you will not be admitted .
Following general principles of truth in advertising , I suggest we immediately rename America :
This should properly be followed by a brief warning to prospective applicants for membership , as well as to those requesting only brief visiting rights :
With regard to Mr. Horsley , his " crimes " involved drug use and prostitution .
If we are talking aboutbehavior engaged in and chosen by -- THESE ARE NOT CRIMES .
There is no political theory and no theory of rights that coherently and legitimately makes them crimes .
As deeply shocking as it is to the ruling class and most of the commentariat today , your body actually is As long as you violate no one else 's rights , what you do with it isbusiness and no one else 's .
It is certainly not thebusiness .
( I briefly touched on this point in my discussion of the Eliot Spitzer story .
As detestable as Spitzer 's record is in many respects , and even though he was victimized in some of the identical ways and by the same means that he delighted in inflicting on others , he still should not have been targeted for anything to do with prostitution . )
These are the final paragraphs of the Horsley story : I appreciate Horsley 's irony in the face of injustice .
It should go without saying that in light of the metastasizing American surveillance state and the numerous ways in which individual liberty is destroyed daily in this country , to say nothing of the Horsley story itself , " land of the free " is now the dream that has gone .
And let us set aside judgments about whether Horsley as a person or in his work is " depraved . "
Again , if we are speaking of adult behavior that impinges on the rights of no other person , it is none of the government 's business whether Horsley , you or anyone else is depraved .
If you choose to be depraved in any or every area of your life , that , too , is your inalienable right .
Or rather , it used to be .
You once had ato be " a bad person " on your own time , so long as you did not force your evil on anyone else .
Finally , consider the following .
Sebastian Horsley is a private citizen , who happens to have written a book .
He was detained for eight hours , questioned extensively about personal behavior that is not criminal by any reasonable and valid standard , and then sent packing back to London .
Your kind is not wanted here , he was told .
And the United States government used its considerable power to enforce its judgment .
At the same time , the United States government begins the sixth year of a criminal and illegal occupation of a country that never threatened it , and it has murdered more than one million innocent people .
It appears to me , as I think it would appear to any sane human being , that these arecrimes -- and crimes on a world historical scale , of a scope that is stupefying and almost ungraspable .
Has evenperson been called to account forcrimes ?
No .
And with the deeply corrupt collaboration of the Democrats who have controlled Congress for over a year , no one ever will be For the United States is not justexclusive , highly restricted country club .
It is a country club run by and for a profoundly immoral and corrupt ruling class , led by those who order and direct genocidal murder and those who aid them in their monstrous crimes .
Contemplate the brief trajectory : this is where we are , in just over two hundred years .
How awful , how horrifying , and how deeply tragic .
“ Designing is not everybody ’s cup of tea ” – Not really !
Some of the most creative designs that transformed our lives came not from any great celebrated beings .
However , these designs did transform them into celebrities .
After all , all of us are quite creative …
Well here are a few Designs that are incredible .
These designs compel us to think of ways in which we can express our creativity and innovative ideas to simplify our lives ; and thus make things easier for us .
The Flux is in fact a really compact vehicle that was created to offer a pleasing drive to the occupants of the car .
The design of the car has been inspired by the umpteen number changes that we go through in each day of life both during play and work .
The car also includes a X – Box console and has a dynamic character to it .
The Peugeot car has been designed by Mihai Panaitescu .
The car runs on hydrogen and the body of the car has been made of both plastic and metal – including aluminium .
Writing is something that comes quite easily to most of us , however , little do we think about the complexities that the task involves when it comes to brain and muscle coordination .
The sad part is that some people find it quite difficult to perform this complex thought that we find so easy .
Here is a pen that Oskar Daniel designed for people who find it difficult to write .
This device is shaped like an hour glass and has a rubber grip knob that allows one to hold the pen and thus write .
In this case one would have to use more of the arm rather than the hand ; thus , making things more simple for people who might find it difficult .
This really cool sofa is actually a wall .
No this wall is actually a sofa .
Ok ok , this is a “ Wallfa ! ” The Wallfa has been designed by a Barcelonan designer by the name of Jordi Canudas .
Wallfas is basically a trendy piece of furniture that is double sided .
On both sides , the furniture features a sofa .
In between the two sides is a membrane that is made of some kind of stretchy material .
The design of the Wallfa is fun and also provides for a great deal of aesthetic appeal .
This really cool complex structure in the picture is the design for the New Hamburg Science Center and Aquarium .
The design of the structure has just been reveled by the Office of Metropolitan Art and will be able to see the light of the day very soon .
The design of the building is quite unique in every sense and it would definitely be quite awe inspiring once finished .
The structure will feature 10 blocks that are interconnected .
These blocks will feature a Science center , an aquarium , offices , labs , theater and a commercial space .
The designer with his design is not only encouraging revolutionary designs but also setting an example for the whole world .
After a rainstorm most of us would like to move out of our houses , into the clean air .
This is the time when the mood is just right , however , benches do act spoilt sports .
None of really want to sit on those wet benches or chairs in the park .
Thanks to a group of Korean designers , we do not need to stand through out .
The group of designers includes Yoonha Paick , Jongdeuk Son , Eunbi Cho , Minjung Simn and Sungwoo Park .
All of these innovative designers have designed benches that are equipped with slats that can rotate .
So when the bench is wet , all one would have to do is use the crackling to rotate the slats .
Now one could sit on the drier side .
That ’s a simple solution !
Perhaps not that simple to think about , or we ’d have them installed in all our parks .
Who says we are not sensitive as we used to be towards those who are not as physically as we are ?
Here is another great example of how designers ensure that they make things easier for the disabled .
Here is a lightweight chair that is collapsible .
This chair is basically a commode and shower chair .
The lightweight chair has been so designed , such that it can easily be carried around .
The chair has been designed by Julie Clyde with the aspiration to help as the disabled gain more freedom and independence along with some personal space which is very often compromised upon in their case .
The pins on the chair are simple to remove and insert , thus , it is quite easy to collapse the chair .
The chair also has castor wheels that provide for easy mobility .
The chair also comes with an easy carry frame too .
Here is another incredible design ; rather an incredible invention .
This invention not only protects you from the rain but also prevents a messy house .
This is basically an umbrella that is an inside out umbrella .
The outside of the umbrella is an umbrella and the outside of the umbrella is a small bag .
After one has used the umbrella , all one has to do is follow some easy steps and convert the umbrella into a bag that can hold the dripping umbrella .
This invention has been designed by Seung Hee Son .
Then there is one of the most aesthetically appealing fire places .
This has been designed by Bloch Designs and has been created in a way so as to ensure that everybody in the room enjoys the fire from all the angles .
The fireplace here is enclosed in a glass case and looks quite contemporary yet stylish .
The fireplace is also equipped with a clear smoke glass .
The fireplace is available both is triangular and rectangular shapes .
Stunned ?!
Well this was nothing .
There are so many more designs that are not only innovative and unique but also have the potential to transform our lifestyles in a small way .
As long as there are creative designers , one can be assured of the fact that there will be more and more innovatively designed structures and devices .

Sometimes looking at old photographs makes me think of this exchange between comic - strip hero Calvin and his dad :
Calvin : Dad , how come old photographs are always black and white ?
Did n't they have color film back then ?
Dad :
Sure they did .
In fact , those old photographs are in color .
It 's just the world was black and white then .
Calvin : Really ?
Dad : Yep .
The world did n't turn color until sometime in the 1930s , and it was pretty grainy color for a while , too .
Calvin :
But then why are old PAINTINGS in color ?!
If the world was black and white , would n't artists have painted it that way ?
Dad :
Not necessarily .
A lot of great artists were insane .
As absurd as it sounds , there is a kind of psychological truth to it -- having seen mostly black - and - white pictures of the world pre-1960 or so ( I 'm not counting Technicolor movies ) , I begin to imagine the past unfolding in monochrome .
Every once in a while , though , a really old color photo made with some obscure , early color process will slip through and blow my mind .
But this really takes the cake : the Library of Congress has a Flickr page , on which they 've posted thousands of color slides -- many of them hauntingly beautiful .
The photographers worked for the Farm Security Administration and the Office of War Information , for whom many famous black - and - white pictures were taken around the same time ( the iconic " Migrant Mother , " for instance ) .
But rather than sending you off to pick through thousands of these photos on Flickr -- something of a laborious process -- we 've compiled our favorites here .
These are portraits almost as compelling as " Migrant Mother , " but even more vivid -- almost hyper - real -- for their eye - popping color .
( In fact , they hardly seem like historical photos at all . )

It 's one thing to dangle fuzzy dice from a rear - view mirror , but decorating a trailer hitch with a large pair of rubber testicles might be a bit much in Virginia .
State legislator Lionel Spruill introduced a bill last week to ban displaying replicas of human genitalia on vehicles , calling it a safety issue because it could distract other drivers .
Under his measure , displaying the ornamentation on a motor vehicle would be punishable by a maximum fine of $ 250 .
He said the idea came from a constituent whose young daughter spotted an example of the trail hitch adornment and asked her father to explain it .
" `I did n't know what to tell her , ' " Spruill said the constituent told him before Spruill vowed to stop such displays .
" I said , ` Sir , I 'm going to be a laughingstock , but I 'm going to do it , ' " he said .
The Virginia General Assembly has some experience with offbeat bills .
Three years ago , it drew widespread attention with an unsuccessful effort to outlaw baggy pants worn so low they expose underwear .
Spruill , 61 , said the indignity of the " droopy drawers " debate would n't deter him .
He said he wo n't hesitate to bring a set of $ 24.95 trailer testicles with him for a legislative show - and - tell .
" I 'm going to do it , " Spruill told reporters .
" I 'm going to bring them out here and show them to you till they tell me to stop . ''
Beijing
Woman and boyfriend filmed
killing of her married lover
A 19 - year - old Chinese student recorded the killing and dismembering of her married lover by her boyfriend , local media reported last week .
The second - year student in the southwestern province of Yunnan , her boyfriend and another male accomplice were arrested after the killing last month , the Southern Metropolis Daily said .
The victim , 39 , was a married manager of a local highway and bridge building company , the newspaper said .
The woman , who was from a struggling family in the capital Beijing and met the victim as a nightclub hostess , filmed as he was killed and his body was cut into " hundreds of pieces , " the newspaper said .
" The dismembering was both out of hatred and aimed at making the body unrecognizable , " the report said .

Man shoots co-worker while rescuing him from crocodile
A man rescued his colleague from the jaws of a crocodile in northern Australia but accidentally shot the unlucky co-worker in the process , police said yesterday .
The two farmhands were collecting wild crocodile eggs on a riverbank Tuesday in the Northern Territory when a crocodile snatched one of them , Jason Green , by the arm , the Northern Territory Police said in a statement .
" The male colleague shot at the crocodile , causing it to let go of the victim 's arm , but a further shot hit the victim in the upper right arm , " police said .
The two men had been collecting eggs to boost the crocodile population at their farm in the northern city of Darwin .
Police say Green 's injuries were not life - threatening .
There was no word on the crocodile 's condition .

and calls the police
A Berlin burglar 's break - in took an unexpected turn when he stumbled upon a corpse and felt compelled to call the police .
" He called to say he'd just broken into a flat and found a dead body , " Berlin police said last week .
" He gave the address of the place and then hung up . "
Officers found the 64 - year - old resident of the flat dead in his bedroom .
The man had died about two weeks earlier , and authorities are not treating the death as suspicious .
The burglar has not been heard from since .

Garth Flaherty , 24 , was charged with first - degree theft and burglary for stealing 1,613 pairs of panties , bras and other women 's underwear from laundry rooms .
Under an agreement with prosecutors , he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 45 days in jail .
He may serve 30 days of his term in community service , court officials said .
Flaherty was arrested last March after police received a report of a man hanging out in an apartment complex laundry room .
In his bedroom , police said , they found enough women 's underwear to fill five garbage bags .
Australia
So nobody is watching the airline movie any more ?
Two in three Australian travellers are either members of the notorious Mile High Club or would like to be , a survey has found .
Asked if they would consider a mid-air sexual encounter , almost half of 1,110 people surveyed wanted an adventure , while 12 per cent already claimed to have mile - high membership wings .
" People are obviously looking for more stimulating entertainment than a movie or a CD when travelling by plane , " Totaltravel.com global marketing manager Paul Fisher said .
A flight attendant for Australia 's flag carrier Qantas was fired last year after claiming to have had a tryst with actor Ralph Fiennes in a business class lavatory during a flight from Darwin to Mumbai .

Country ends eccentric leader 's ban on opera and circus
Turkmenistan will end its seven - year ban on opera and the circus introduced by the Caspian nation 's former eccentric leader , state media report .
Saparmurat Niyazov , who developed an elaborate personality cult during his 21 - year rule , died in 2006 .
He banned opera , ballet and the circus , saying they are " alien " to Turkmen culture .
The new leader , Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov , has sought to promote a softer image for the gas - rich nation bordering Iran .
State television has announced his plans to reopen an opera house , resume circus shows and build a cinema in the capital Ashgabat .
From Reuters News Agency and Associated Press
There ’s been a lot written about interviewing programmers , and about good management , but I could n’t find anything about how to interview managers .
So I ’ve been looking into it and thought I ’d write up what I ’ve learned so far .
First of all , some things not to do .
While you might want to lead with a big , open ended question ( “ What ’s your management philosophy ? ” ) , you do n’t want most of your questions to be like that .
That ’s because while some people are reflecitve and think explicitly about what they do , there are others who are “ naturals . ”
The naturals have good instincts about how to handle most situations , but they may never really have thought about what they ’re doing or tried to put it into words .
So instead , you want most of your questions to be scenarios .
Also , there are all kinds of managers and all kinds of companies , and all kinds of groups within a company .
You really need to tailor your interview questions to your situation .
Does the person need to be a technical lead as well as managing people and projects ?
Do they put a lot of emphasis on following standard procedure , or are they happy to short change them if they think it ’s best for the project ?
For example , the company I work for started 10 years ago with a single product , a search engine for airfares .
It was started by a bunch of Ph.D.s from MIT ’s AI lab , and they hired others like themselves : really good programmers , with a good understanding of algorithms , that worked independently .
We ’ve always had good tech leads , but they do n’t like writing reports or dealing with various people ’s personality quirks .
As we get bigger , we ’re looking for someone to help us communicate and coordinate better .
More of a cat herder than a shop forman .
We ’ve got a culture that we like and are really proud of , and anyone we hire needs to understand that they ca n’t just change things by fiat .
And the same thing applies to the details too .
The sorts of personalities that comprise the team , and the dynamics you get .
How to deal with that one guy in another group who is supposed to make tools for you but is too busy to maintain them properly .
So take a break from what you ’re doing , get yourself a cup of tea and think about ongoing situations at work that you really wish a manager could deal with .
Still , it ’s useful to have some examples in mind .
Here are some good ones that should apply almost anywhere .
You can ask them in isolation , but giving a scenario will get you more insights .
1 . What ’s your management philosophy ?
If they do n’t have much to say here , that ’s ok , they may not be reflective .
Just go on to the next question .
If they do have something to say , that ’s great .
Get them talking about it for a little while .
For example , ask them if they ’d recomend any good management books , to pick one and summarize it and say what they liked and did n’t like .
You do n’t want to spend too long on this , though , because this person might have MBA disease .
It ’s really an example of a wider phenomenon : having theoretical experience without practical experience .
Have you ever had the experience in school where you read through the chapter and everything made sense and you thought “ ok , I understand this . ”
And then you looked at the first problem in the problem set and had no idea how to do it ?
People who have done a lot of reading and little doing can go on for hours saying great things about theory , but get confused when real world situations do n’t map nicely onto what they know — which they never do .
The best is if you can get both : people who have good instincts , yet can talk about why .
They ’re more likely to learn from mistakes and adapt to changing times .
But if the person only has one , the practical ability is far more important .
2 . When a developer is working hard but not getting far , how do you notice ?
The tricky thing here is knowing how long something should take .
The manager could expect the technical leads to mention this to them , although that does n’t help if the manager is also going to be a technical lead .
The standard answer these days is , at the start of a project , have the developer create a schedule .
Then you can see if there ’s some task that is taking a lot longer than it should .
3 . Once you notice , what do you do ?
A common example is laying out a Swing GUI in Java .
Most people , on their first attempt , get something that looks great — until you resize it .
You can spend a long time tweaking it and not getting anywhere .
So what do you do when someone eventually admits they do n’t know how layout management works in Swing ?
This gets at the issue of personal safety .
If you somehow punish the developer , they ’ll be less likely to admit problems in the future .
And then you wo n’t find out about them until it ’s waaaaaaaay too late .
Good answers are to get them training , books , or a mentor .
Bad answers are to give the project to someone else .
That makes them feel like they failed .
Bonus points for talking about how to match people to projects in the first place that minimizes the chance of this .
Some other good questions for personal safety are “ What do you do when someone admits they ’ve grossly underestimated how long a project will take , by more than 50 % ? ”
“ What do you do when a developer says they ’ve just recieved a tempting job offer ? ”
4 . How do you get developers to produce more , that is , make them more productive ?
As you might imagine , this is a big question .
There are many things that affect programmer productivity , and the list varries from programmer to programmer .
Surprisingly , people always seem to give a single answer : working on an interesting ( or challenging ) task .
So once they reply , ask them for others .
You can find lots of possibilities in the Mythical Man-Month and Peopleware .
Writing quality code , higher quality than the market demands .
Working with top - notch people .
Offices rather than cubes .
Fast computers with dual monitors .
Free reign to buy whatever technical books they need .
Freedom to play with new languages , tools or “ technologies . ”
Training to learn cool new things and keep their skill set up to date .
Free soda and snacks .
Forty hour work weeks .
Praise them .
Talk to them about what they ’re interested in , what parts of their previous tasks excite them or bore them .
( Believe me , it ’s not the parts you thought . )
Job ads ignore all this stuff too , which is surprising .
In the recruiting I ’ve done , people listen politely when I talk about our clever search engine , but they ’re faces light up when I say :
And our founders really understands what motivates programmers .
They give people offices , not cubes .
We try to match people to projects they ’re interested in , within business constraints .
We have some leeway in what features we implement , so if someone ’s interested in a particular project , we can sometimes have them do that when we would n’t have implemented it at all .
We put a lot of emphasis on hiring and set a high bar , then give people good salaries and benefits .
So you ’ll be working with really good people who will appreciate your clever ideas rather than feel threatened by them .
The company was founded by 3 people with Ph.D. ’s in AI from MIT , and understand that some academic ideas are worth trying even if they do n’t work out .
There are always people who can answer your questions .
We do n’t push people to work crazy hours .
Once a week we have someone talk on some topic of general interest to programmers , either from within the company or from a local university ( and there are a lot of those in Boston . )
After that , the only thing people want to know is where they can sign up .
I do n’t know why jobs ads do n’t mention this stuff .
I occasionally browse job ads when I ’m bored , and some of them even look interesting .
But I have no idea whether my coworkers idea of a difficult problem is reversing a string in place , or whether the boss will think spending $ 700 on a profiler is a waste of money .
The chance that these places will be better than where I am now is so small , it ’s not worth even talking to them on the phone .
Bad ways to ( try to ) increase productivity are are to set “ challenging ” deadlines , telling people they need to do better no matter how well they do , and giving pep talks .
If the candidate says to give them a “ challenging ” task , ask a little more .
What makes it challenging ?
If the technical aspects are near the edge of your ability , that ’s good , that ’s a condition of flow .
But if its simply an “ aggressive ” deadline , that ’s bad .
5 . What ’s your take on giving feedback to your developers ?
On performance reviews ?
If done poorly , they can really demotivate a developer .
What should you do , and what should you avoid ?
I was once worked with a developer would tend to come in a little late and leave a little early .
One day he came out of a meeting with the boss looking angry and frustrated , almost livid .
Before long he started talking to us other developers .
There was an HR representative at the meeting , and the boss spent the whole time scolding him about his hours , including a formal warning .
Later , at lunch , he said he had n’t been able to get any work done since the meeting , that all he ’d been able to do was mull it over in his mind .
The boss had n’t said anything about not getting enough done .
The developer concluded , among other things , that the boss cared more about how many hours he worked than what he got done .
Later that night the boss and I were watching The Matrix , and at the scene where Neo ’s boss chews him out for being late , he turns to me and says “ Oh my God , I ’m the bad guy ! ”
This is a guy who normally does n’t talk during films , but an hour later , as soon as the credits started to roll , he turned to me again and said “ Oh my God , I ’m the bad guy ! ” I tried to calm him down , but I think he realized that he ’d made a big mistake .
Psychologists have studied how people have a higher opinion of their own abilities than others do .
When they do something well , they tend to attribute it to an inherent trait .
“ I figured out how to write this tricky bit of code ; I ’m smart ” .
When they do something wrong , they tend to think it ’s a fleeting condition “ I forgot to check in that file .
Silly me , I ’ll remember next time . ”
Bringing their perception in line with reality will deal them an emotional blow .
This is especially true of those whose self - worth is wrapped up in their programming availity , something ’s that pretty common among those driven to become the best programmers .
Do n’t be surprised if they spend the rest of the afternoon staring at their screen in shock , feeling as if all their hard work and cleverness is unappreciated — even if you spent most of the review pointing it out and praising it .
There are certainly those who think performance reviews should be scrapped .
Perhaps there are ways to do performance reviews appropriately , but what you ’re looking for is awareness of these issues .
Answers focusing on communicating an accurate picture , even diplomatically , are bad .
Follow up questions : “ What ’s the purpose of performance reviews ?
How do they affect morale ?
Have you or someone you know ever had a bad performance review ?
How did it affect your productivity ?
Your motivation ? ”
Well , that ’s enough questions to get started .
Even some of these wo n’t apply to your organization .
And if you can think of any better ones , please let me know !
At Mozilla 's headquarters in Mountain View last week , we talked to Mozilla Labs manager Chris Beard and Mozilla Mobile director Jay Sullivan about their plans to put Firefox in the cloud and in your pocket .
With the guidance of Beard and Sullivan , the open - source browser is extending itself beyond the desktop and taking its first tentative steps into new frontiers .
Mozilla Labs is experimenting with several emerging technologies that fill important niches in the Firefox ecosystem .
Among these are the Prism site - specific browser deployment tool and Weave , a web services integration framework that lets Firefox push local data into the cloud .
Weave is still in early development , but the current version already provides support for automatic web - based synchronization and storage of bookmark and history data .
Gentlemen , start your looms
The Weave initiative exists at three distinct levels : as a vision , a platform , and a product .
The underlying vision is to increase user access to browser data and to bring tighter web service integration to the browser .
Weave also operates as an open - ended platform that web developers and Firefox extension programmers can leverage for mashups or persistent web storage .
As a product , the embodiment of Weave that is most visible to end users is the Weave browser extension ; it provides a client - side implementation of some of Weave 's current storage and synchronization capabilities .
Unlike some prominent web application and social networking providers , Mozilla wo n't snoop around in your data ( it is completely encrypted client - side before being transmitted to the server for storage ) or impose arbitrary constraints on how you move it in and out of the system .
That is one of the ways that Mozilla is adapting its mission of user empowerment and applying it to web infrastructure .
Beard says that Mozilla Labs is actively working on an API for third - party development of Weave - based services .
Some of the first pieces could be pushed out for preliminary testing and experimentation as early as this week while Mozilla is working on finding the best way to handle the full API rollout .
Mozilla has already developed internally a simple PHP library for performing basic operations on Weave data stores .
The Weave server - side architecture is designed in a manner that makes it highly flexible and capable of supporting a wide range of data types .
Data storage and retrieval is all handled with regular WebDAV and the Weave browser extension currently uses JSON as its default data format .
Beard also filled me in on some of the upcoming features that are under development .
One of these is support for sharing content .
The content sharing features are currently in the proof - of - concept stage and have some limitations , but they will very useful once support for configuring more granular sharing permissions is fully implemented .
In blog entries about the Weave initiative and related projects , Beard has talked about how to build a richer Firefox user experience by connecting the user to the space between the browser , the desktop , and the Internet .
Moving the user 's information into the Internet cloud in a manner that is conducive to secure sharing , repurposing , and remote access is an important building block in Mozilla 's efforts to achieve that goal .
Going mobile
Another initiative that shares some common ground with Weave is the Mozilla Mobile project , which broadly aims to bring the Firefox web browser to PDAs , mobile phones , and other handheld devices .
When Mozilla first announced its mobile initiative , we expressed skepticism and noted that competitors like Opera and WebKit appear better suited for environments with constrained system resources .
Significant improvements in memory usage and performance have recently decreased Firefox 's footprint and have made it a serious contender in the mobile space .
So how does the Mozilla Mobile initiative relate to Weave ?
The ability to shift browser metadata and state information onto the web will eventually make it possible for users to transition seamlessly between desktop and mobile Firefox instances .
There is much more to this process than mere synchronization , and a big part of the challenge will be finding ways to bring the user 's personalized Firefox experience to a multitude of form factors and have it translate over in a way that is intuitive for users .
Sullivan tells us that Mozilla is looking at ways to facilitate that level of integration and also offer a real web experience in mobile contexts without having to compromise the user 's privacy or distort and reformat content .
Mozilla also wants to work on user interface innovation to increase the usability of mobile browsing .
The mobile project is still at a very early stage of development and much work remains before it will be ready for widespread use , but preliminary mobile UI prototypes are already available for testing .
Mozilla 's ongoing research and experimentation with new kinds of browser technologies provides some valuable insight into the future of web browsing and the Internet user experience .
Although the implementations are far from complete , Weave and Mozilla Mobile look like ideas with a lot to offer to both users and developers .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Google Inc , the world ’s leading search engine , said on Monday it was concerned about the free flow of information on the Internet if Microsoft Corp were to succeed in acquiring Yahoo Inc .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Last month , Microsoft proposed buying Yahoo in a deal originally worth $ 44.6 billion , but Yahoo ’s board has rejected the offer , saying it was too low .
“ We would be concerned by any kind of acquisition of Yahoo by Microsoft , ” Chief Executive Eric Schmidt told reporters .
“ We would hope that anything they did would be consistent with the openness of the Internet , but I doubt it would be . ”
Schmidt pointed to Microsoft ’s past history and “ the things that it has done that have been so difficult for everyone ” , but he did not elaborate .
Last year , a European court upheld a landmark 2004 decision that Microsoft abused the near - monopoly power of its Windows operating system to damage competitors , along with a 497 million euro ( $ 695 million ) fine .
“ We are concerned that there are things Microsoft could do that would be bad for the Internet , ” said Schmidt .
Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer pledged earlier this month that his company would gain market share against Google in online advertising and Web searching , even if led to his “ last breath ” at the company .
In a Reuters poll of financial analysts , the overwhelming majority said they believed Microsoft would eventually succeed in buying Yahoo , but many said they felt it may not be the best use of its ample cash reserves .

Tag : artenergy publishing Post n°117 pubblicato ilda IlDelfino05 La Francia , secondo quanto scrive il giornale  Economiques Investment , aiuterà il Vietnam a realizzare la sua prima centrale nucleare che sarà costruita nella provincia di Ninh Thuan e dovrebbe essere operativa entro il 2020 .
Sarà il gigante francese Électricité de France ( Edf ) ad aiutare le ambizioni del Vietnam .
Fornirà per la costruzione tutte le attrezzature ed i macchinari necessari e assicurerà le misure di sicurezza e tutela della natura .
Intanto leggo un articolo uscito sul nr. marzo - aprile 2008 della rivista FV fotovoltaici della Artenergy Publishing ( intervento di Sergio Zabot che potete vedere cliccando qui ) :
Ma il nucleare non è a zero emissioni ( pag. 18 ) - Solo le operazioni nel reattore sono a zero emissioni di CO 2 .
Tutte le altre operazioni della filiera del combustibile ( estrazioni dalle miniere , frantumazione e macinazione , fabbricazione del combustibile , arricchimento e gestione delle scorie ) necessitano di molto combustibile fossile e quindi emettono CO 2 .
Mi sembra una bella presa in giro quando si parla di tutela della natura ...
Non trovate ?

Once considered just your average single asteroid , 2001 SN263 has now been revealed as the first near - Earth triple asteroid ever found .
The asteroid -- with three bodies orbiting each other -- was discovered this week by astronomers using the radar telescope at the National Science Foundation 's ( NSF ) Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico .
Cornell and Arecibo astronomer Michael C. Nolan said he and his colleagues made the discovery when they obtained radar images Feb. 11 .
The group subsequently took more images to learn that the three objects -- about 7 million miles from Earth -- are rotating around each other .
The main , central body is spherical with a diameter of roughly 1.5 miles ( 2 kilometers ) , while the larger of the two moons is about half that size .
The smallest object is about 1,000 feet across , or about the size of the Arecibo telescope .
Other triple asteroids exist in the asteroid belt ( between Mars and Jupiter ) and beyond , but this is the first near - Earth system where the actual shapes of objects can be clearly seen .
The Arecibo telescope is operated for the NSF by Cornell 's National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center .
" This discovery has extremely important implications for ideas about the origins of near - Earth asteroids and the processes responsible for their physical properties , " said Nolan .
" Double , or binary , asteroid systems are known to be fairly common : about one in six near - Earth asteroids is a binary , but this is the first near - Earth triple system to be discovered . "
The triple asteroid was first discovered visually Sept. 19 , 2001 , by the Lincoln Near Earth Asteroid Research ( LINEAR ) project , part of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Lincoln Laboratory .
The orbits of binary -- and now triple -- asteroid systems unveil the mass and allow astronomers to assess whether they are stable over millennia or have formed very recently .
Previous radar investigations of binary near - Earth asteroids have disclosed extraordinary physical and dynamical characteristics .
Nolan said this discovery prompts several important questions :
Are the objects orbiting in the same plane ?
How rapidly are the orbits changing with time ?
Did the moons form when this asteroid formed in the main asteroid belt , or after it arrived in near - Earth space ?
Because of the small sizes and irregularly shaped components , 2001 SN263 should offer unique insights relative to the much larger triple systems in the main asteroid belt , said Nolan .
" Examining the orbits of the moons as we continue to observe 2001 SN263 over the next few weeks may allow us to determine the density of the asteroid and type of material from which it is made , " he said .
" We will also be studying its shape , surface features and regolith [ blanketing material ] properties . "
Radar observations by the Arecibo Observatory can image a much larger fraction of the population of near - Earth asteroids than spacecraft .
For example , Arecibo has discovered more than half of the near - Earth binary asteroid systems discovered since 1999 .
Continued observations will undoubtedly lead to the discovery of new classes of objects , such as this triple system .
While the Arecibo telescope is capable of these investigations , the future of the radar program and the entire telescope are in considerable doubt due to NSF budget cuts .
Nolan 's collaborators on the project are Ellen S. Howell , Arecibo Observatory / Cornell University ; Lance A.M. Benner , Steven J. Ostro and Jon D. Giorgini , Jet Propulsion Laboratory / California Institute of Technology ; Michael W. Busch , Caltech ; Lynn M. Carter and Ross F. Anderson , Smithsonian Institution ; Chris Magri , University of Maine at Farmington ; Donald B. Campbell and Jean- Luc Margot , Cornell ; Ronald J. Vervack Jr. , Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory ; and Michael K. Shepard , Bloomsburg University .
HTTP Authentication with HTML Forms
Authentication in Web applications has been highjacked , HTTP defines a standard way of providing authentication but most apps use the evil spawn of Netscape , otherwise known as cookies .
Why is this ?
Cookies are n’t designed for authentication , they ’re a pain to use for it , insecure unless you know what you ’re doing , non-standard , and unRESTful .
Warning :
The solution outlined in this article is experimental and might be a complete lie , be warned that your mileage may / will vary .
The main reason people walk away from using HTTP authentication is that they want control over the look of the login form and most browsers display an awful looking dialog box .
So what we need is a way for HTML forms to pass HTTP auth data when it ’s submitted .
The HTML spec provides HTML forms as a way to create queries and to POST urlencoded data to a URL , but can we subvert it ?
With the power of Javascript we can
We could add an onsubmit event to our login form that pushes the username and password values within our form into the URL in the forms action attribute .
That way our login request would supply the users credentials in the URL and avoid the server returning a 401 response and causing our browser from showing the HTTP auth box .
Great , and pretty easy .
We could even write the HTML form out with Javascript and provide a simple link to non-Javascript enabled browsers .
But there ’s a problem , IE does n’t support usernames and passwords in URLs , they were removed due to a security scare , and anyway , the HTTP spec does n’t say we ’re allowed to have URLs with usernames and passwords in them so we ca n’t guarentee that they work anywhere else either .
So is there an alternative way that does n’t require us to mung the username and password into the URL ?
Yes , our new friend , XMLHTTPRequest , it can submit the correct HTTP auth headers for us .
Rather than adjusting the URL the form submits to , we can use XMLHTTPRequest to do a request before the form submits supplying the entered username and password .
This will set up the browser with the HTTP auth credentials so it ’ll also send them with our actual form submission login request .
An example
Enough talking , here ’s some code .
This is our login function that we bind to our form submission :
function login ( ) { var username = document.getElementById( this.id + " - username " ) .value ; var password = document.getElementById( this.id + " - password " ) .value ; this.http.open(" get " , this.action , false , username , password ) ; this .http.send ( " " ) ; if ( http.status == 200 ) { document.location = this.action ; } else { alert ( " Incorrect username and / or password . " ) ; } return false ; }
It sends our XHR request with the given username and password , and then redirects the client on success or displays a Javascript alert on error .
We need our standard getHTTPObject ( ) function that I introduced here , and then some code to create our login form and set everything up :
window.onload = function ( ) { var http = getHTTPObject ( ) ; if ( http ) { var anchors = document.getElementsByTagName ( " a " ) ; for ( var foo = 0 ; foo < anchors.length ; foo ++ ) { if ( anchors [ foo ] .
className == " httpauth " ) { createForm ( anchors [ foo ] ) ; } } } } function createForm ( jshttpauth ) { var form = document.createElement ( " form " ) ; form.action = jshttpauth.href ; form.method = " get " ; form.onsubmit = login ; form.id = httpauth.id ; var username = document.createElement ( " label " ) ; var usernameInput = document.createElement ( " input " ) ; usernameInput.name = " username " ; usernameInput.type = " text " ; usernameInput.id = httpauth.id + " - username " ; username.appendChild(document.createTextNode( " Username : " ) ) ; username.appendChild(usernameInput ) ; var password = document.createElement ( " label " ) ; var passwordInput = document.createElement ( " input " ) ; passwordInput.name = " password " ; passwordInput.type = " password " ; passwordInput.id = httpauth.id + " - password " ; password.appendChild(document.createTextNode( " Password : " ) ) ; password.appendChild(passwordInput ) ; var submit = document.createElement ( " input " ) ; submit.type = " submit " ; submit.value = " Log in " ; form.appendChild(username ) ; form.appendChild( password) ; form.appendChild(submit ) ; jshttpauth.parentNode.replaceChild(form , jshttpauth ) ; }
This looks for all anchors with the class of httpauth and replaces it with a nice HTML form with the login ( ) function bound to it ’s onsubmit event .
So now if we set up a HTML page like the following , the login link will be replaced with a login form ( if the user has Javascript support ) but authenticate the user using HTTP auth :
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD
HTML 4.01//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd " >
< html lang= " en " > < head > < title > Javascript HTTP Auth Test </ title > < script type= " text/ javascript " src= " jshttpauth.js " ></script > </ head > < body > < a class= " httpauth " id= " private " href= " private.php " > Log in </ a> </ body > </html >
If our private .
php looks like this , then we ’ll see that everything works as we ’d like :
<? php define ( ' USER ' , ' user ' ) ; define ( ' PASSWORD ' , ' password ' ) ; if ( ! isset ( $ _SERVER [ ' PHP_AUTH_USER ' ] ) || !isset ( $_SERVER [ ' PHP_AUTH_PW ' ] ) ) { header ( ' WWW - Authenticate : Basic realm = " My Realm " ' ) ; header ( ' HTTP /1.0 401 Unauthorized ' ) ; echo ' You hit cancel , good on you . ' ; } elseif ( isset ( $_SERVER [ ' PHP_AUTH_USER ' ] ) && $ _SERVER [ ' PHP_AUTH_USER '] == USER && isset($_SERVER [ ' PHP_AUTH_PW ' ] ) && $ _SERVER [ ' PHP_AUTH_PW '] == PASSWORD ) { echo " < p> Hello {$_SERVER [ ' PHP_AUTH_USER ']} . </p > " ; echo " < p > You entered '{$_SERVER [ ' PHP_AUTH_PW ']} ' as your password . </p > " ; } else { header ( ' HTTP / 1.0 400 Bad Request ' ) ; echo " < p > You shall not pass ! </p > " ; } ?>
The thing to notice about this script is the third part of the ‘ if ’ statement .
If the request does n’t have any auth details we send a standard auth response , if it does and the details are correct then we let them in , otherwise we send back a 400 error .
This stops the clients browser from asking the user for details again allowing the Javascript to process the failure .
This also means that if the client does n’t have Javascript and fails to authenticate correctly , it will never be asked for new credentials as long as it keeps sending the bad auth data ( which browsers will do ) .
Problems
It ’s not all good just yet , this technique works in IE6 and Firefox but is known not to work in both Opera and Safari , so if you care about those browsers you may want to think again about using this ( or to spend some time investigating why it fails in those browsers ) .
HTTP Digest Auth
HTTP
Digest is a way of authenticating a client while never sending the clients password over the wire .
To use Digest rather than Basic HTTP Auth , we only need to adjust our PHP script to implement digest :
<?php include ' digest.php ' ; $ HTTPDigest =& new HTTPDigest ( ) ; $users = array ( ' user ' => md5 ( 'user : '.$ HTTPDigest->getRealm ( ).': password ' ) ) ; if (!$ HTTPDigest->getAuthHeader ( ) ) { $ HTTPDigest -\> send ( ) ; echo ' You hit cancel , good on you . ' ; } elseif ( $username = $ HTTPDigest ->authenticate ( $users ) ) { echo " < p > Hello $ username . </p > " ; echo " < p > This resource is protected by HTTP digest . </p > " ; } else { header ( ' HTTP / 1.0 400 Bad Request ' ) ; echo " < p > You shall not pass ! </p > " ; } ?>
Conclusion
So there we have it , there is no need for HTTP authentication to be shunned , even for aesthetic reasons .
HTTP auth offers lots of advantages over using cookies :
It ’s simple to implement and no hassle to use , and clients love it .
It carries no baggage unlike cookies .
It ’s tried and tested , it ’s a standard and it works , your cookie based security model wo n’t be as good .
We can use HTTP Digest which is pretty secure .
It ’s about as RESTful as you can get with authentication .
So we should be using it , there ’s no excuses anymore .
I have put up an example of this code as a demonstration .
Note : I was first introduced to this idea by Christian Jensen and Jan Algermissen on the REST Discuss mailing list , so credit should be sent their way .
Update : Dimitri Glazkov made me revisit using HTTP
Digest with this technique and realise that it does actually work , thanks Dimitri .
Update : Travis Estill and David Kleinschmidt reminded me that 401 responses should n’t be returned without an Auth header and so a 403 is a better response code .
This also helps to make Safari behave too .
