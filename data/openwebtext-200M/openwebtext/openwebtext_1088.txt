UNITED NATIONS ( CNN ) -- U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon agreed on the need for additional humanitarian aid after meeting with Pakistani President Asif Zardari on Tuesday .
Pakistani president Asif Zardari ( left ) met U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon in New York .
" The United Nations is ready and will always stand by to provide the necessary assistance , humanitarian assistance , " Ban told reporters following the session with Zardari .
" I have asked him to facilitate smooth delivery of humanitarian assistance and protection of humanitarian workers , and there are about 1 million displaced persons in that region . "
Pakistan 's military is in the midst of an offensive against the Taliban along its western border with Afghanistan , particularly in the Swat Valley , causing a flood of civilians from the region .
The military has set up headquarters to manage the 1.3 million internally displaced people , Pakistani military spokesman Gen. Athar Abbas said .
That number includes 500,000 Pakistanis who have been uprooted from their homes since August , before the latest military push against militants began , he said .
The U.N. World Food Program has been providing emergency rations and supplies for about 650,000 , including recently displaced people from the Lower Dir , Swat and Buner districts , and has announced plans to double the amount of assistance .
" WFP has mobilized in - country stocks and is prepared to feed the growing population of internally displaced persons for the next two to three months , " said Wolfgang Herbinger , the food program 's country representative in Pakistan .
" We need the international donor community to quickly step forward with donations to avoid any interruptions in food distributions , " he said .

Memcpy ( ) and brethren , your days are numbered .
At least in development shops that aspire to secure coding .
Microsoft plans to formally banish the popular programming function that 's been responsible for an untold number of security vulnerabilities over the years , not just in Windows but in countless other applications based on the C language .
Effective later this year , Microsoft will add memcpy ( ) , CopyMemory ( ) , and RtlCopyMemory ( ) to its list of function calls banned under its secure development lifecycle .
Memcpy has long served as a basic staple of C - based languages , providing a simple way to copy the contents from one chunk of memory to another .
Its drawback comes when the source to be copied contains more bytes than its destination , creating overflows that present attackers with opportunities to remotely execute code in the underlying application .
" That 's definitely one of those notoriously dangerous C commands , " said Johannes Ullrich , CTO of the SANS Institute , who teaches secure coding classes to developers .
He likened memcpy ( ) to other risky functions such as strcpy ( ) and strcat ( ) , which Microsoft has already banned after exacting untold misery over the years .
Developers who want to be SDL compliant will instead have to replace memcpy ( ) functions with memcpy_s , a newer command that takes an additional parameter delineating the size of the destination buffer .
The command is already supported in Microsoft 's Visual C++ , but according to Ullrich , native support does n't yet seem to be available in the GCC compiler .
( This evidently can easily be worked around , according to this discussion .
Readers who know other approaches are encouraged to leave a comment . )
A Microsoft blog entry that heralded the planned change suggests modifying common header files so compilers issue a warning each time the banned function is used .
It also wondered aloud when " Larry , Steve , and Linus " plan to issue similar security edicts in their products .
It 's a question worth asking . ®

The Violent American Century : War and Terror Since World War II World War II marked the apogee of industrialized “ total war . ”
Great powers savaged one another .
Hostilities engulfed the globe .
Mobilization extended to virtually every sector of every nation .
Air war , including the terror bombing of civilians , emerged as a central strategy of the victorious Anglo - American powers .
The devastation was catastrophic almost everywhere , with the notable exception of the United States , which exited the strife unscathed and unmatched in power and influence .
The death toll of fighting forces plus civilians worldwide was staggering .
The Violent American Century addresses the U.S. - led transformations in war conduct and strategizing that followed 1945 — beginning with brutal localized hostilities , proxy wars , and the nuclear terror of the Cold War , and ending with the asymmetrical conflicts of the present day .
The military playbook now meshes brute force with a focus on non-state terrorism , counterinsurgency , clandestine operations , a vast web of overseas American military bases , and — most touted of all — a revolutionary new era of computerized “ precision ” warfare .
In contrast to World War II , postwar death and destruction has been comparatively small .
By any other measure , it has been appalling — and shows no sign of abating .

Nursing Home Injury Lawyer Atlanta
A Georgia nursing home injury can happen to you or a loved one .
Choose what happens next .
Of the more than 27,000 residents who occupy Georgia nursing homes and assisted living facilities , the vast majority of them are in good hands .
However , as the population ages and more and more people rely on the services of nursing homes , we are seeing more cases of nursing home abuse and neglect .
Horrific cases of nursing home abuse and nursing home neglect occur far more often than many people might realize .
If a loved one has fallen victim to nursing home abuse or neglect , count on Gary Martin Hays & Associates for vigorous , legal representation in your nursing home injury case .
Call 1-800-898-HAYS right now .
Our experienced injury attorneys know how to gather all the relevant facts .
We can collect medical records and interview witnesses .
We 're not intimidated by nursing homes - or their insurance companies .
Types of nursing home injuries
While sexual assault in nursing homes generally makes headlines , there are hundreds of other less sensational cases of nursing home injuries involving dehydration , bed sores , falls , or inadequate staffing .
These cases are important to the families and victims - and they matter to us , as well .
Find out more information by clicking on the following links :
If you have any reason to suspect that a loved one in a nursing home has been injured due to the reckless or negligent conduct of another resident or by nursing home staff , we urge you to contact our firm .
Even if you are not sure what is happening , we may be able to help put your mind at rest or direct you to an appropriate authority .
Falls
When a nursing home patient who is shown to be prone to falls is not properly managed , the risk of broken bones and even traumatic brain injury becomes severe .
The Annals of Internal Medicine reports that roughly 1,800 nursing home deaths occur each year in this country due to falls .
Do n't let another day go by wondering if the insurance company will compensate your loved one who had a nursing home fall .
Call Gary Martin Hays & Associates today at 1-800- 898-HAYS to get the wheels of justice turning in your favor .
We wo n't back down from the challenge when defending our clients ' rights .
A fall risk assessment is part of the intake process for every nursing home patient in Georgia .
Failure to follow a patient 's fall prevention protocol constitutes a form of nursing home neglect .
Sometimes , inadequate staffing is a contributing factor .
A resident who calls for assistance moving from one room to another may get no response and attempt to move on his or her own , leading to a fall .

Bed Sores
At Gary Martin Hays & Associates , we understand how to fight insurance companies who try to take advantage of bed sore injury victims .
If you have questions , we 're ready to answer them - and we 're fully ready to take aggressive action on your behalf .
Call 1-800-898-HAYS today .
Nursing home regulations establish clear guidelines for preventing bed sores on patients known to be at risk , such as any patient who is unable to reposition themselves .
If you suspect your loved one may be suffering from bed sores , check their heels , the back of the head , shoulder blades , and buttocks , where bed sores caused by nursing home neglect often first appear .
Bed sores are wounds that occur due to lack of blood flow to certain areas of the body , as may occur with a bedridden or wheelchair bound resident who is not repositioned every two hours as required by law .
Bed sores are a sign of nursing home neglect .
The continued and unrelenting pressure on certain areas of the body decreases circulation , robbing the skin in these areas of oxygen .
Bed sores can easily become infected - a potentially fatal condition .

Malnutrition
Nursing home malnutrition has the potential to directly contribute to a patient 's death .
It is the legal responsibility of the nursing home to determine how able patients are to feed themselves if hungry - simply bringing food to the room is not enough .
Malnutrition is a form of nursing home neglect that can lead to a rapid decline in health or even death .
Signs of malnutrition include :
Clothes become noticeably looser
Appearance of weight loss
Dentures no longer fit
Sudden loss of hair or healthy teeth
Non-dementia related confusion
Sunken eyes
Slow healing of minor cuts / bruises
We have found through experience that malnutrition in nursing homes is often linked to inadequate staffing .
The nursing home may be liable for the mistreatment of patients on a broad scale .
Back to Top
Dehydration
Dehydration is a form of nursing home neglect that can lead to serious health problems for the victim .
Low blood pressure and other conditions resulting from severe dehydration can be life threatening .
For elderly nursing home residents , whose sense of thirst may already be compromised and who may be taking medication that makes them especially susceptible to dehydration , even moderate exposure to the effects of dehydration may cause any of the following adverse side effects :
Low blood pressure
Tachycardia ( racing heart )
Weakness
Dizziness
Fatigue
As the elderly lose mobility , they may avoid drinking in order to minimize trips to the bathroom , or to avoid being embarrassed by incontinence .
In cases of nursing home abuse , staff members may deliberately withhold fluids in order to avoid changing adult diapers and bed sheets , or escorting patients to the bathroom .
If your loved one shows any of the following symptoms , he or she may be suffering from dehydration :
Skin tenting in the forehead
Dark or concentrated urine
Sunken eyes
Dry mouth , skin and nasal passages
Back to Top
Prescription Error
A nursing home prescription error may be difficult to detect , but families can look for signs .
For example , a resident who is always asleep during visits , regardless of the time of day , may be a sign of a prescription error .
In some cases , nursing home prescription errors are the result of some kind of nursing home neglect , such as when one patient is given another 's medicine accidentally .
Some prescription errors may rise to the level of nursing home abuse .
For example , a nursing staff member might deliberately over - medicate a patient to make him or her more compliant .
Nurses who are over - worked due to inadequate staffing may negligently mix up prescriptions and give a resident the wrong medication .
If the patient 's medical history and other prescriptions are not checked appropriately , they may suffer from severe side effects or drug allergy symptoms .
Back to Top
Assault
An assault on a nursing home patient may leave a black eye or other visible signs or cause injuries that the patient complains about or cannot be ignored .
Too often , though , a nursing home assault becomes part of a pattern of other abuse , including psychological abuse .
If your loved one appears to have a severe fear reaction to a certain patient or staff member , you may want to contact an expert in elder .
Some nursing home assault cases involve a staff member .
In some cases , another resident or a visitor to the nursing home may be causing harm .
Regardless of who is committing the assault , the nursing home itself may be responsible for failing to keep the patient safe from harm .
The abuse of the elderly will not stop unless victims stand up for their rights and the public demands justice .
Has your loved one complained of abuse ?
Do you suspect something is wrong , but do n't know how to proceed ?
You can turn to us for help .

Catastrophic Injury
One difference between catastrophic injury sustained in a nursing home and other forms of nursing home injury , such as malnutrition , is that it typically stems from a single event rather than a pattern of conduct .
Strict regulations are in place at both the state and federal level to prevent this type of nursing home neglect , yet it does take place .
Major injury events in nursing homes may involve a burn injury , broken bones , or permanent loss of mobility .
A negligent security matter that leads to wandering or elopement by a resident may result in that person being hit by a car .
Types of catastrophic injury from nursing home abuse
Catastrophic nursing home injuries we have seen include :
Loss of speech
Spinal cord injuries
Loss of use of hands
Permanent confinement to wheelchair

Sex happens : 125 million times each and every day .
So how is it that in the 21st century this precious element of human existence is still taboo ?
We are used to seeing sexualised images , yet the reality of sex and reproduction seems as secret as ever .
In the political and religious skirmish over sex and morality , we often lose sight of the critical contribution that a realistic approach to sexual and reproductive health makes to our lives .
Against this backdrop , we are marking the 15th anniversary of the world 's most comprehensive blueprint for sexual and reproductive health .
The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development ( ICPD ) in Cairo was a defining moment that resulted in a visionary plan that placed individual human rights at the heart of global development .1 , 2 ICPD saw a consensus around population and development among 179 governments along with unprecedented and diverse participation by civil society .
ICPD was groundbreaking , with the potential to be revolutionary if fully implemented .
It upset prevailing orthodoxies and attracted much criticism from religious and political opponents — mainly over reproductive rights .
Nevertheless , ICPD brought about a seismic change in thinking about population and development , moving from demographics to sexual and reproductive health and wellbeing with a new emphasis on individual rights and gender equality .
ICPD recognised that comprehensive sexual and reproductive health , including voluntary family planning , is essential for individual and national development , as well as being one of the most cost - effective routes for alleviating poverty .
More recently , the ICPD goal of “ universal access to reproductive health ” has been incorporated into Millennium Development Goal ( MDG ) 5B and its contribution to all of the MDGs has been belatedly acknowledged .
The Programme of Action that emerged from ICPD offered a roadmap for the next 20 years .
But 15 years on can we honestly say we have followed that roadmap ?
This is the question we will be posing when non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) meet at a Global NGO Forum on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Development on Sept 2 — 4 in Berlin , Germany , hosted by the German Government and the United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) .
Although there has been progress , this has been selective and uneven .
The right to the highest attainable standard of health , particularly sexual and reproductive health , continues to elude millions of people , especially the poor and marginalised .
Statistics speak for themselves .
Over 200 million women currently lack access to modern contraceptives , and demand for contraception is expected to increase by 40 % by 2050.3
There are more than 1·5 billion people aged between 10 and 25 years — the largest generation of young people in history — and they will need sexual and reproductive health services .
4
Globally there are about 33 million people living with HIV,5 with 2·7 million new infections in 2007 , most of which are sexually transmitted infections .
Every year , more than half a million women die in pregnancy or childbirth , including 67 000 women from unsafe abortion .
6
Millions more suffer injury , illness , or disability .
While ICPD offered a visionary plan , political leadership and financial commitment have been lacking ; between 1994 and 2008 , funding for reproductive health as a proportion of health aid dropped from 30 % to 12 %.7
Led by the conservative US administration of George W Bush and the Vatican , political opposition to ICPD resurfaced and programmes for sexual and reproductive health came under sustained attack at the UN and around the world .
8
At the same time a global HIV epidemic devastated communities , and in the response linkages to sexual and reproductive health and rights were not always fully understood or implemented .
Today , these linkages are understood , potentially strengthening the response to both HIV and sexual and reproductive health .
The challenges today are perhaps greater than those faced in 1994 .
The global financial crisis , the impact of climate change , increasing religious fundamentalism , and fragmented health systems are some of the challenges .
That is why this anniversary is so important .
By holding governments to their promises of 15 years ago , NGOs can remind them that sexual and reproductive health is a more important long - term investment than arms — a third of countries spend more on the military than they do on health and nearly half of countries with the highest defence spending rank among the lowest in human development .
9
The Global NGO Forum on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Development will act as a clarion call to reinvigorate the ICPD Programme of Action to make it a reality for all women , men , and young people .
We have clear evidence that sexual and reproductive health saves lives and makes a critical contribution to poverty reduction and development .
Strengthening sexual and reproductive health and rights is a pressing global need , one on which the future of humankind may well depend .
We declare that we have no conflicts of interest .

According to the Michigan Association of Realtors and Detroit Board of Realtors (
data here
) , the average sales price of a Detroit home fell to $ 11,596 in July ( Year - to - Date ) , a - 40 % decline from the $ 19,596 average home price during the same period last year ( see chart above ) .
2009 year - to - date unit sales increased by 17 % to 7,373 homes , compared to 6,315 Detroit homes sold last year over the same period .
From the $ 97,850 peak Detroit home price in 2003 , prices have fallen by an amazing 88 % .
With a 20 % down payment on a $ 11,596 average priced home in Detroit , the monthly payments on a 30 - year fixed - rate mortgage at 5.25 % would be only $ 51.23 .
In 1962 , Michael Harrington ’s The Other America exposed the nation ’s dark underside enough for John Kennedy to ask his Council of Economic Advisor chairman , Walter Heller , to look into the problem and for Lyndon Johnson to say ( on January 8 , 1964 ) that his administration “ today , here and now , declares unconditional war on poverty in America . ”
In fact , it was little more than a skirmish that fell way short of addressing the real problem in the world ’s richest nation .
Today it ’s even greater and increasing exponentially under a president who , unlike Johnson , declared war on the poor and disadvantaged to favor privilege over growing needs and essential social change .
In his book , Harrington wrote :
“ In morality and in justice every citizen should be committed to abolishing the other America , for it is intolerable that the richest nation in human history should allow such needless suffering .
But more than that , if we solve the problem of the other America we will have learned how to solve the problems of all of America . ”
Sadly , we did n’t then nor have we now .
Perhaps more than anything , increasing homelessness and hunger highlight the growing problem as , in the face of deteriorating economic conditions and growing human needs , administration policies are indifferent , counterproductive , uncaring and hostile .
In December 2008 , Reuters reported that “ Homelessness and demand for emergency food are rising in the United States as the economy founders , ” according to a December 2008 US Conference of Mayor ’s Task Force on Hunger and Homelessness survey of 25 American cities .
Chief causes cited were growing poverty , unemployment , and unaffordable housing costs with greater than ever expected challenges in 2009 .
At the time , it was reported that “ Cities continue to develop aggressive strategies to prevent homelessness ” and provide other essential services , but that was then and this is now .
An Epidemic of State Budget Shortfalls
As economic conditions deteriorate , the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities ( CBPP ) ’s July 29 report highlighted the growing problem .
Titled “ New Fiscal Year Brings No Relief from Unprecedented State Budget Problems , ” it cited the following issues :
— at least 48 states “ addressed or still face shortfalls in ( their FY 2010 ) budgets , ” the result of “ the worst decline in tax receipts in decades ; ”
— at issue is a $ 163 billion deficit or 24 % of their budgets , and these numbers keep rising as conditions worsen ;
— at least 33 states “ already anticipate ” 2011 deficits that may exceed 2010 ones ; and
— for FYs 2010 and 2011 , shortfalls of at least $ 350 billion are expected , and FY 2012 may bring little or no relief .
In response , deep social service cuts are being implemented , putting the burden on vulnerable Americans to cope and survive .
The situation is grave and worsening with at least 21 states cutting “ low - income children ’s or families ’ eligibility for health insurance or reduce their access to health care services . ”
Elderly and disabled persons programs are also being reduced or eliminated .
So are services for home and child care , rehabilitation , and other essential needs for the poor and low - income households .
The most vulnerable of all are affected , yet more cuts are expected as new budget pressures arise .
Pre-school , K - 12 , and higher education cuts are being made as well .
Public payrolls and hours worked are being slashed , exacerbating the growing unemployment problem , worse still by cutting pay for the still - employed .
Tax increases may also be considered at the worst possible time .
“ Expenditure cuts and tax increases are problematic policies during an economic downturn because they reduce overall demand and can make the downturn deeper .
When states cut spending , they lay off employees , cancel contracts with vendors , eliminate or lower payments to businesses and nonprofit organizations that provide direct services , and cut benefit payments to individuals . ”
Demand is then reduced because households have less to spend .
As a result , the economic crisis deepens .
CBPP said federal assistance is crucial , yet the Obama administration declined while providing trillions to Wall Street and other corporate favorites .
That ’s the state of governance in America today under Republican and Democrat administrations , each no different from the other .
Hunger in America
On its web site , Feeding America ( formerly America ’s Second Harvest ) said in “ the land of plenty , ” one in eight Americans ( meaning millions ) face growing hunger problems , and not just the poor and unemployed .
They ’re “ often hard - working adults , children and seniors who simply cannot make ends meet ” and have to forego meals at times , even for days .
Hunger and Poverty Facts
— in ( pre-crisis ) 2007 , 37.5 million people were impoverished ; they comprised :
— 12.5 % of the population and 9.8 % of families ;
— 20.3 million or 10.9 % of people aged 18 – 64 ;
— 13.3 million or 18 % of children under age 18 ; and
— 3.7 million or 9.7 % of seniors aged 65 or older who benefit from Social Security and Medicare .
In addition :
— 36.2 million Americans are food insecure , including 12.4 million children ;
— they comprise 13 million or 11.1 % of households ;
— 4.7 million households experience “ very low food security ” meaning hunger is a persistent problem ;
— households with children have double the food insecurity as ones with none ;
— single women - headed households are worst off with 30.2 % of them insecure ; and
— 53.9 % of food - insecure households rely on one or more of the following federal programs – food stamps , the National School Lunch Program , and the Special Supplement Nutrition Program for Women , Infants and Children ( WIC ) ; in addition , Feeding America ( in 2007 ) provided emergency food aid to about 25 million low - income people , 8 % more than in 2001 .
On August 6 , the US Department of Agriculture reported a record 34.4 million Americans ( one in nine ) receiving food stamps in May as unemployment keeps surging .
It was the sixth consecutive monthly record , and every state showed an increase as economic conditions worsen .
On September 10 , the Commerce Department will release 2008 census data expected to show around another 1.5 million people added to the poverty rolls over 2007 figures — a total of nearly 39 million representing 12.7 % of Americans .
According to Rebecca Blank , Economic Affairs Undersecretary , final numbers are n’t yet in and may be worse than expected because of how bad things are for growing numbers in the country .
She believes if ( U - 3 ) unemployment hits 10 % ( up from 9.4 % now ) , poverty could reach 14.8 % this year and rising because of jobs and homes lost , savings exhausted , and the sharpest ever decline in personal wealth between mid-2007 and December 2008 .
Worst of all , conditions for most people are deteriorating as businesses , states , and local governments shed workers and cut budgets at the worst possible time .
It promises harder times ahead and potentially millions more impoverished .
Homelessness Facts
Annually , two - three million Americans , including 1.3 million children , experience homelessness and many more are at risk .
Most vulnerable are those losing jobs , homes , and the millions of low - income workers paying 50 % or more of their income in rent so that a missed paycheck , health emergency , or unexpected financial burden makes them vulnerable to homelessness at a time government aid is being cut .
Criminalizing the Homeless
In the face of a growing burden on society ’s most needy , the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty reported that “ many cities use the criminal justice system to punish people living on the street for doing ” what they must to survive .
Local ordinances prohibit sleeping , camping , eating , sharing food , sitting , loitering , and / or begging in public places with criminal penalties imposed on offenders .
Some cities even punish organizations and individuals for helping , and the idea always is to keep the unwanted out of sight , mind , and preferably out of cities , at least in or near more affluent areas or business districts .
As economic conditions deteriorate , the problem will grow and so will the plight of the homeless as cities crack down harder in violation of constitutional and international human rights laws .
The OECD ’s 2008 Report , “ Growing Unequal ? : Income Distribution and Poverty in OECD Countries
It states that America “ is the country with the highest inequality level and poverty rate ” among the 30 OECD countries , ranking only ahead of Mexico and Turkey .
In addition , since 2000 , inequality grew rapidly , “ continuing a long - term trend ( going ) back to the 1970s ” when inflation - adjusted household incomes began falling .
Other data cited includes :
— the gap between rich and middle and poorer income groups widened ;
— government redistribution of income “ plays a relatively minor role in the United States , ” partly because social service spending is low and falling ; in 2008 America , it was 9 % of household incomes compared to 22 % on average in OECD countries ;
— social mobility in America is low , and children of poor families are less likely to become rich ; and
— “ wealth is distributed much more unequally than income : the top 1 % controls some 25 - 33 % of total net worth and the top 10 % holds 71 % ; ” other estimates place these disparities much higher and widening as social inequalities increase , high - paying jobs disappear , the middle class keeps shrinking , poverty grows , and federal and state governments cut essential services in the face of increasing need among greater numbers of people .
The Working Poor Keep Getting Poorer
The Working Poor Families Project October 2008 study highlighted similar problems from 2002 through 2006 .
Titled “ Still Working Hard , Still Falling Short : New Findings on the Challenges Confronting America ’s Working Families , ” it reported :
— jobs paying poverty - level wages rose by 4.7 million ;
— low - income working families ( earning less than double the Census definition of poverty ) increased by 350,000 ;
— below poverty - level jobs rose to 29.4 million and comprise 22 % of all jobs compared to 19 % in 2002 ;
— most disturbing is that this happened during a period of economic growth , but at the same time wages have n’t kept pace with the cost of living ;
— low income family numbers rose to nearly 9.6 million or 28 % of the population ;
— children in them number 21 million ;
— 72 % of low - income families with working adults in them performed the equivalent of one and one - quarter jobs – a far greater burden than in other OECD countries ; and
— income inequality is highest in New York ; California is fourth , but all states are in a race to the bottom as conditions deteriorate everywhere , so all rankings are disturbing compared to the late 1990s .
The US Labor Department ’s latest productivity report highlights the plight of workers even more .
It rose 6.4 % in Q 2 , the largest gain since 2003 , while workers ’ compensation fell sharply , 2.2 % on an annualized basis .
According to Mark Vitner of Wells Fargo Bank , the productivity increase “ is almost entirely the result of cost - cutting , not improved ways of producing goods and providing services . ”
It also shows how powerless workers are at a time of massive job cuts , so staying employed takes precedence over wages paid and benefits .
The result is profits up , pay down , benefits disappearing , and American workers transitioning to serfs .
More confirmation comes from the latest Internal Revenue Service statistics for 2007 showing that the income disparity between the top 10 % and bottom 90 % reached “ a higher level than any other year since 1917 and even surpasses 1928 , the peak of the stock market bubble in the ‘ roaring ’ 1920s , ” according to data from University of California economist Emmanuel Saez .
He noted that “ 2007 was an incredibly good year for the super rich ” and added :
“ Based on the US historical record , falls in income concentration due to recessions are temporary unless drastic policy changes such as financial regulation or significantly more progressive taxation are implemented and prevent income concentration from coming back . ”
But these are no ordinary times as the US sinks slowly into depression .
The super - rich are exploiting it to their advantage , while millions of working Americans are losing jobs , homes , benefits , savings , futures , and safety net protections .
The 2007 data reflected the peak of the current cycle .
What ’s ahead will be far more grim , disturbing , and reflective of an America that is no more .
The Economic Policy Institute ’s ( EPI ) State of Working America : 2008 -2009
As the economy contracted in 2008 , job losses and unemployment accelerated , but EPI ’s report missed the worst of it from early 2009 to the present .
It cited :
— wages losing ground to inflation ;
— high energy costs ;
— the burst housing bubble ;
— millions of defaults on home loans followed by foreclosures ;
— declining financial markets and frozen credit ;
— less health care coverage and fewer higher - paying jobs with good benefits ; and
— “ for the first time since the mid-1940s , the real incomes of middle - class families are lower at the end of this business cycle than they were when it started ; ” as a result , “ prosperity is eluding working families ” as they fall further behind , now more than ever as depression takes hold .
EPI calls family income “ the core building block of American living standards . ”
Yet during the last business cycle , significant productivity growth was accompanied by stagnant or falling real incomes .
“ That has never happened before . ”
The latest economic recovery bypassed the middle class and created greater income inequality .
The Bush administration ’s tax cuts exacerbated the problem by helping the top 1 % mostly , the middle class marginally , and low - income families not at all .
Clear racial disparities show whites consistently better off than blacks and Hispanics , men doing better than women , huge class distinctions , and mobility up the income ladder bypasses most at lower levels .
One study showed that about 60 % of families starting out in the bottom fifth stratum were still there a decade later .
At the same time , over half the top income ones kept their position .
EPI concludes that “ where you start out in the income scale has a strong influence ( over ) where you end up ( so ) the rate of economic mobility is low ” in the richest country in the world where the select few alone benefit .
All others lose out as their incomes do n’t keep pace with inflation and their living standards erode .
Another study implies that a poor family of four with two children needs nine to 10 generations to reach middle - income status .
It means where you ’re born is where you ’ll stay .
So - called rags - to - riches tales are just folklore , and stagnant or downward mobility today is more serious than ever .
Wages and salaries comprise three - fourths of family income , and for the middle class , it ’s even higher .
Yet since 2002 , they did n’t grow at all despite historically high productivity , meaning business benefitted , not workers who fell further behind .
Women and minorities fare worst plus everyone in lower income categories .
During the 2002 – 07 recovery , no progress was made “ in reducing the share of workers with low earnings ( in ) all race / ethnic groups and for both genders … .
The very highest earners have done considerably better than other workers for at least ( the past ) 30 years , but they ( did ) extraordinarily well over the last 10 years . ”
In addition , eroding “ employer - provided benefits , most notably pensions and health insurance , is an important aspect of the deterioration in job quality ( and economic security ) for many workers . ”
Most harmed are young workers facing bleak prospects , older ones losing jobs and not wanted , and the erosion of unionization since the 1950s , especially since the late 1970s .
Overall , 2002 - 07 growth was a jobless recovery followed by the subsequent wiping out of five years of modest gains .
From 2000 - 2007 , average annual job growth was an anemic 0.6 % , well below the 1990s 1.8 % figure .
In addition , the unemployment rate rose 0.7 % from March 2001 ( the last business cycle ’s peak ) to December 2007 even though average workers age increased and the labor force participation rate shrank — “ both of which should have put downward pressure on the ” unemployment rate .
The great American job creation machine faltered badly in the new millennium and now has collapsed .
Net family wealth also determines household well - being , particularly from income and financial assets , including real estate .
Yet in America , the top 1 % controls more than the bottom 90 % combined and the disparity is growing .
In 1962 , the bottom 80 % ’s share was 19.1 % .
In 2004 , it was 15.3 % , the difference shifting to the top 5 % .
In addition , until the current downturn , average household debt grew much faster than income , fueled by increases in mortgages , home equity loans , and high credit card balances .
Since the housing bubble burst and home prices collapsed , the damage done has been enormous with still more to come .
The result is growing poverty levels as discussed above with numbers increasing as economic conditions weaken .
“ The backsliding against poverty in the 2000s is most notable among the least advantaged , ” especially blacks , Hispanics , mother - only families , and the poor unable to keep pace .
It shows up in inequality in health security in the form of inadequate or no insurance , lower life expectancies for poor and lower income households , and an eroding safety net for the most needy .
Rising health care costs , lost or no benefits , and an economic crisis have increased the plight of millions of the country ’s least advantaged .
EPI ’s report highlights a nation of growing inequality , lower wages , fewer benefits , diminished worker bargaining power , and disempowered unions v. market fundamentalists , complicit government officials , and their “ You ’re - on - Your - Own ” ( YOYO ) ideology against which they ’re powerless .
They believe markets know best so let them , arguing that alternatives “ will create the wrong incentives . ”
Recent decades reveal the folly of this approach on American workers ’ living standards .
Exposing the “ ownership society ” myth , all household security measures , including net worth , have fallen despite a few years of late 1990s progress .
Today , “ The macro- economy is in serious disrepair , beset by the spillovers from the bursting …. housing bubble , high energy prices , and unsustainable levels of household indebtedness ” causing economic collapse and the possibility of a deep , protracted depression .
So far , remedial measures have been patchwork and counterproductive as growing millions face greater uncertainties with no imminent signs of relief and federal and state governments not caring or helping .
In 2009 , the State of Working America is dire and worsening enough for millions of households to face greater than ever challenges on their own with government indifferent to their plight .
Concluding an early 1980s edition of his book , Michael Harrington sensed what “ Other Americans ” were up against in writing :
“ I end this review , then , on an ambivalent note .
There was progress ; there could have been more progress ; the poor need not always be with us .
But it will take political movements much more imaginative and militant than those in existence in 1980 to bring that progress about .
Until that happens , the poor will be with us . ”
And today , in exponentially growing far greater numbers because nothing is being done to reverse them .
If you want to go fast , walk alone .
If you want to go far , go together .
Whilst , like you , I 've read many a tale of imminent ecological collapse , impending disaster , and fervent fear mongering within the pages of some of our more dubious dailies , I could never say I 'd been " shaken to the core " in terms of impact to my everyday life .
Obviously I 'd had a certain appreciation for the gravitas of the climate and resource situation — just enough to become involved in the UK transition town movement , founding Transition Town Wandsworth in SW London , and even persuading our local council to give us " waste " land to turn around into community gardens .
And of course , I 've seen all those documentaries , from Chris Martenson 's excellent Crash Course , through to the ultra bleak End of Suburbia , and onto the more hopeful Power of Community , yet the ingrained inertia of routine remained .
" What 's it going to take to wake you up ? , " you may ask .
Indeed , my — and almost everyone else 's — determined denial of the coming tsunami of change seems to be a very interesting ( but not very helpful ) by - product of our information saturated media existence .
Perhaps the picture is too big for one mind to get a handle on , or maybe we 're overly skeptical , because of a saturation of conflicting data , and wary of misinformation — throwing out the baby of facts with the bathwater of sensationalist dross ?
My personal opinion is that most may only make the necessary maneuvers when their direct interests are perceived to be under threat — sad but true .
Or maybe the situation will just change in time ( although I do n't think we have too much more of that ) as different perspectives dawn .
It certainly did for me .
It was only two more straws that finally broke this particular camel 's back .
Rob Stewart 's excellent Shark Water , a film that pulls no punches documenting the hellish worldwide decline of 90 % of shark species as a result of a needless finning orgy to fill the stomachs of the Eastern rich , directly followed by a reading of a particularly unsettling Friends of the Earth report , Climate Code Red .
I finally internalised the idea that yes , we are actually all screwed .
Now , today , this generation , in our own backyard , your life and the life of everyone you know RIGHT NOW .
There is no room for any more complacency — THIS .
IS .
IT .
Needless to add , for me , all the dots have very much joined .
" Well now , " you might say from behind your hastily Googled climate models , government reports and caseloads of petroleum dollar funded refutations , " there 's no need to worry , as it is a fact that the whole solar system is warming . "
Well friend , " so what ? , " is my response to that particular short cut to thinking .
Even if it 's true that it's all a cunning ruse orchestrated by the PTB to raise revenue or put a clamp on your " way of life , " what about all the other data ?
What about the disappearing rain forests , species extinction , increasing seawater acidification , depleted fish stocks , GM contamination of the biosphere ?
Is it all an exaggeration ?
Are you prepared to bet thousands of carefully balanced eco-systems , the future of our descendents , the future of hundreds of thousands of species and everything that nature has attained so far ( including us ) on your own opinion ?
As the Climate Code Red report states , you probably would n't travel by airline if the risk of crashing was 1 in 1000 , yet we 're prepared to bet EVERYTHING on lesser odds .
A risk only the insane would take ( no offence if you are crazy , you are absolved , but please turn out the lights when you leave the room ) .
Now I 'm not going to deny that little red devils routinely prod at my best intentions or slam the door to my optimism , but these facts even out - do the worst my sometimes - Sunday - night pessimism can conjure up .
In short , it is time for action .
But I 'm not advocating anarchy , stepping out with the sandwich board , or even escaping into some new - age wishful group - think .
We know the risk , so the time for business - as - usual navel gazing has now passed ; we need to take action ; it 's not easy , but you'd be surprised what could be achieved .
For example , I live and work in London , around people who most of the time seem as indifferent to what 's coming as they are to each other .
Yet plunge them into an emergency situation , the Blitz , IRA , or bombs on the tube , and time and again they step up and act together .
So regardless of the drag of the day - to - day chains of obligation typical of the western lifestyle , I think we 're capable of making ready for the fast approaching day when they break irrevocably ; clear the decks on our own terms , as we do n't want to merely react .
But it can only happen if we act together .
Whenever there 's a catastrophe under way , it helps to start by creating a bit of space — not only for the casualty ( the environment ) , but also for those on the scene ( us ) .
It allows a proper evaluation of what needs to be done .
As the repetitive riffs from the media become ever more conflicted and frantic , now 's the time to create just enough space for your own story to grow .
As I 'm sure you 're already aware , fixations on incessant fear mongering , blind chattering from the " celebrity " circus , and the monotonous arm lock of pop culture can play havoc with your ability to actually think for , and be , yourself .
How about you stop absorbing other people 's junk ( even mine ) and make your own with your own ( community / family ) — it 's what you 're here for .
It will also prevent you from panicking .
What I 'm suggesting here is , aside from the somewhat run of the mill act of distancing yourself from all the crazes and cravings of consumerism ( giving all the stuff you do n't need away , giving up on the pre-packed lifestyle ) , is some kind of commitment to the consequences of your lifestyle .
It might sound like an easy deal , until you realise that I am definitely NOT talking about your own desires to take more than you need , follow your personal ambitions and appetites , or ignore the realities of where you live .
Given the way the future is shaping up these things have probably become a liability anyway — they certainly are to the planet .
No , the best thing you can do is to wake up to the precarious situation you 've found yourself in .
When it all goes down , on whom are you going to call ?
Where 's your next meal coming from ?
What are the origins of the resources you depend on and are you capable of emulating them if / when the plug is pulled ?
Did you think we could carry on doing what we 're doing in this way forever ?
( Well , speaking personally , I did actually . )
Finally , do you think that any authority actually gives a damn about you ?
Maybe what we should all be doing is getting out from the shadow of all those screens and becoming well acquainted with the people and possibilities of where we live .
After all , pretty soon we may have to find allies in the former who can help you fully make use of the latter .
If we strengthen our ties to our locality , we 're all the more likely to ride out any big waves of change headed our way .
I 'm talking community gardens , knitting circles , brewing collectives , sports teams , musical associations , recycling and composting committees , swap shops , social events , and children 's herb patches .
Do whatever suits you and your particular neck of the woods , but try and be inclusive of everyone — you do n't just want the " usual suspects " ( white , educated , left leaning folk ) involved .
The best way is to appeal to everyone through their interests , not through your own dogma .
So is binding to your immediate surroundings what you call an effective response to species extinction and ecological collapse ?
Can getting to know your neighbours make a jot of difference now that so many of our bridges are already burned ?
I believe it can .
The authoritarian ideal of keeping us separated and ideologically strangled ( it takes several thousand hours of airtime to keep that up ) , has only served to disempower us into accepting a life we 're not really into anymore .
As you can't break it all by yourself , force of numbers is the finest option .
Besides , I believe that creating space for reflection , space for the story of others , and space for personal creativity ( we 're going to need lots of that ) is actually a better way to live than blind acceptance of the way things are , especially as that way leads to a dead end .
We 're in a time of massive challenges which some predict will really put a squeeze on everything we are used to now .
Even though I find it somewhat surreal to even write these words , it 's impossible to overstate the responsibility that we now have .
Afraid as I was of thinking for myself , so accustomed to the really big choices being out of my hands , and so insulated from the consequences of my actions , I 've found creating space for my community to be my best response so far to a systemic inertia that is keeping us all strapped to this careening car crash .
I want to put the wheel back in my hands and quit just being the passenger .

You read me right .
Seriously , video games may play an important role in health care , both now and in the future .
And the best part of it is , it all looks surprisingly fun .
Several studies have already been conducted to link gaming to fitness and health awareness , and I ’m sure more are on the way .
Take a look at a couple of them !
PharmExec.com published an article claiming that video games can promote awareness and healthy behavior in children and adults alike .
There are custom games like Hope Labs Re-Mission , a game for teens where the player controls a microscopic robot named Roxxi who blasts away at malignant tumors in cancer patients .
In this game , players also work on managing the side effects of the cancer and treatment .
Does that game not sound like a best - seller to you ?
Okay , what about Dance Dance Revolution ?
The Mayo Clinic ran a 24 - week study on overweight children playing DDR and found that not only did most of them not gain weight , but their stamina , blood pressure , and overall fitness improved significantly .
Obviously , games designed to improve health care need to be fun as well as informative .
Hell , there are crappy games all over the place that do n’t provide even a single tidbit of useful information .
But if developers manage to make a video game that can stand up to critics on its own merits , I for one will cheer all the louder if it possesses some redeeming value .
I ’m not expecting games like God of Chores ( well , actually , that ’d be pretty cool… ) , but maybe something a bit more integrative and stimulating than the Reader Rabbit stuff that I grew up with .
Something like a more medical - based version of Bookworm Adventures .
Just a thought .
Hopefully , we ’ll see more of this in the future .
Because our health care system sucks right now as it is .

The loud protests at Congressional town hall meetings are made for the media .
It does n't matter if the protests are astroturfed , or not ; no " serious journalist " can resist showing , or writing about , chaotic right - wing protests .
Thus the actions of a small , frustrated , and angry crowd dominate the debate the media says this country is having .
The lead in today 's AP story about the health care reform debate read :
" His approval ratings slipping , President Barack Obama is retooling his message on health care overhaul , aiming to win over Americans who already have insurance . "
A Wall Street Journal Columnist declared that the White House 's response to the smears the right - wing , with a large assist from the media , is spreading proves that those smears are true :
" These commentaries , packed with allusions to the secret police , the East German Stasi and Orwell , were mostly furious .
Others quite simply hilarious .
Ms. Douglass , who now has , in her public appearances , the air of a person consigned to service in a holy order , was not amused .
Neither has she seemed to entertain any second thoughts about the tenor of a message enlisting the public in a program reeking of a White House effort to set Americans against one another — the good Americans protecting the president ’s health - care program from the bad Americans fighting it and undermining truth and goodness . "
Also today , CQ columnist declared that the President 's poll numbers prove that he 's lost control of the message , while citing a two - week old poll :
" This rhetorical bind has contributed to Obama ’s recent decline in public approval .
A Quinnipiac University poll of 2,409 registered voters from July 27 to Aug. 3 found that 52 percent disapprove of the way the president is handling health care , a 10 percentage point increase from early July .
The survey found that 46 percent of respondents trust Obama to handle health care , compared with 37 percent support on the issue for congressional Republicans . "
Of course , the only thing that all these articles prove is that the President is losing the " all - important " beltway media popular opinion contest .
A story you wo n't find among the Articles of Conventional Wisdom filed by the beltway press today , is a story about how the President 's job approval ratings has climbed since the town hall protests started ; further , according to aggregate Gallup data , the President 's job approval rating is below 50 % in just two states -- Alaska and Wyoming .
If the press put down the quail eggs and caviar of their cocktail parties and went to a McDonald 's for dinner , they 'd quickly find out why the public is reacting negatively to conservative hysteria over the health care reform plan .
The public 's unease with the tenor of the health care reform debate can be found in statements from attendees of the health care town hall meetings .
One attendee of a Maryland town hall with Senator Ben Cardin told the Baltimore Sun :
" I guess we 're going to rally and scream at each other .
It 's ridiculous , but you can't just have one side control the whole discussion . "
Two attendees of a town hall meeting with Rep. Frank Kratovil ( D - MD ) told ABC News that the protesters were rude and embarrassed their community :
Two elderly women said they were embarrassed by their neighbors .
" They were rude !
Oh , they were behaving terribly , " one said , calling it a " disgrace to our community . "
Said another of the anger , which sounded very much to her like what she hears on Fox News and conservative talk radio , " If it 's not manufactured , they 're brainwashed . "
The reason Americans are reacting against the town hall protests is that they probably know someone who is uninsured .
Or they may know a cancer patient who was kicked off insurance rolls by corporate bureaucrats who were chasing after a bonus .
In short , the personal experiences of millions of Americans have convinced the overwhelming majority of citizens that our health care system needs to be reformed .
While the media hews to its pre-canned story line , Republicans are beginning to realize that there is a backlash to the outlandish behavior of town hall protesters .
It 's why three prominent Republican Governors chose not to defend Sarah Palin 's infamous " death panel " comment .
And it's why Palin herself backed off her aggressive tactics -- something she has never done before -- the day after she made that comment .

Advertisement North Korean leader Kim Jong-il has issued a special pardon to two detained US journalists .
Laura Ling and Euna Lee had been found guilty of entering illegally in March .
The news came hours after former US President Bill Clinton made an unannounced visit to Pyongyang on what was described as a private mission .
Mr Clinton has now flown out of North Korea with the two journalists on a plane bound for Los Angeles , his spokesman says .
Mr Clinton is the highest - profile American to visit since ex-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in 2000 .
" Kim Jong - il issued an order ... granting a special pardon to the two American journalists who had been sentenced to hard labour , " the official North Korean News Agency ( KCNA ) said in a statement .
The women 's pardon and release was a sign of North Korea 's " humanitarian and peace - loving policy " , KCNA said .
Families ' overjoyed '
The families of the two journalists said they were " overjoyed " by the news .
In a statement posted on a website , they thanked Mr Clinton and also former Vice - President Al Gore for their efforts to get the women released .
Washington had made no announcement of Mr Clinton 's trip prior to his arrival on Tuesday , but later stressed it was a private visit .
However , media reports in Washington suggest the White House approved the mission and it had been secretly planned for weeks , our correspondent says .

Is Ted Thompson being coy about personnel matters ?
Or is there something here with Michael Vick ?
It ’s like when you ’re high school .
There ’s that girl out there .
You hear she likes you .
But nothing legitimate is coming from her mouth .
All your mutual friends are abuzz with the possibility of a relationship , but between the two of you , neither of you are saying anything .
You ’re saying that you want real concrete proof she ’s into you ; she ’s sending out mixed messages .
You hear she just wants to hook up with you and you are n’t the type she ’d actually date .
Or maybe she just wants a “ summer fling ” with you .
Basically , you have no idea what ’s going on , despite what everyone else is saying .
That ’s how it is now .
Thompson is n’t giving a straight answer on what the Packers want to do .
Are the Packers even interested in Vick in the first place ?
Do the Packers just want Vick as gimmick player ?
Do the Packers want Vick just for this year as a backup for Aaron Rodgers that could be more reliable than Matt Flynn or Brian Brohm ?
Or do the Packers see Vick as a long - term player in their scheme ?
It feels like high school all over again .
Scenario 1 : There is no interest .
The rumors are just the product of those curses called mutual friends .
You come to find that your friends were just throwing names out there as possibilities and liked the sound of this .
In their minds , it ’s a perfect fit .
You two seem picture perfect to each other , but in reality , it would never work .
It ’s your friends making something out of nothing .
The Packers are n’t interested in this scenario .
Thompson is sticking to his reputation of not commenting on personnel issues until there is something concrete .
Thompson just does n’t want to say no to Vick because he wants to leave the door open just in case there ’s that one in a million chance the Packers need Vick .
The Packers GM is just making a statement and is letting the media run with it and assume what they want .
Some of the more anti-Ted Thompson camps should have some pretty interesting things to say about these comments , but they appear to be innocuous .
Not saying anything about personnel has been his game , and he ’s sticking to it .
Scenario 2 : The hook up .
The girl just wants you for your body .
She ’s attracted to you , but she does n’t care about anything else that has to do with you .
It ’s one night or bust .
It ’s just up to you to decide whether or not you want to be pulled into this .
After all , she is a pretty enticing option and there is a bit of chemistry .
There is the slight chance it ’ll go beyond that one night , but it ’s anybody ’s guess how far it can go .
In this option , Vick is the gimmick player .
The Packers feel they need to make a splash .
The Detroit Lions got Matthew Stafford in the draft .
The Chicago Bears acquired Jay Cutler from the Broncos .
The Minnesota Vikings drafted Percy Harvin out of Florida for some use in the Wildcat .
Yes , the Packers drafted B.J. Raji at No. 9 and traded back up into the first round ( an OMG IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING ?!?!?!
moment with Thompson ) for Clay Matthews .
Both of these guys are great for the defense and really signal the turn around that is happening under Dom Capers , but offense sells tickets and makes the highlights .
What did the Packers do on offense ?
Nothing .
I mean , the drafting of Jamon Meredith and T.J. Lang did do something to add competition to the offensive line , but as much as I love the offensive line , it wo n’t be a conversation topic on SportsCenter .
Vick adds this to the offense .
How are they going to use it ?
What crazy formation does Mike McCarthy have thought up for Vick ?
He is the innovator behind the Big 5 that utilizes all of Green Bay ’s wide receiver talent .
What could he do with the Wildcat ?
The possibilities are limitless .
But lying under all of this is the possibility of this being a one - time deal .
Vick could only be in Green Bay for 12 games as an experiment .
After the season he could be cut loose while the Packer pursue a more permanent Wildcat or gimmick player .
It could be strictly to keep pace with Detroit , Chicago , Minnesota , and the changing National Football League .
Scenario 3 : The summer fling .
You and your lady friend get to talking , and you feel that you two have some chemistry and it could go places , but once you get around to school and life in general , you two do n’t really have time for each other .
Summer is great because you can see each other multiple times a week and just spend a lot of “ romantic ” time together talking about how you wish summer could never end , but before you know it , it ’s back to reality and you both part ways , never to really see each other again .
Of course , you meet randomly , check in every once in a while to see how things are going , but you are n’t too involved in each others lives .
You appreciate what happened , but it was best to be contained by that time .
Scenario 3 is similar to Scenario 2 , but at the same time it is different .
The Packers bring Vick in , not as a gimmick player , but as a backup quarterback to Rodgers .
Flynn and Brohm have n’t been too too impressive , so it seems logical to bring Vick in .
Vick ’s played quarterback before , so backing up Rodgers would be a good role for him .
He would n’t be expected to be a star contributor from Day 1 , while he still could make token appearances as a Wildcat or change of pace quarterback .
Also , being a backup quarterback to Rodgers could be a springboard for Vick .
Other teams could see how he is progressing with integrating back into a team and how he is at learning an offense .
The time spent playing in games could be used as an audition period and a team could trade for him at the deadline or after the season , or if the Packers sign him to just a one - year deal he could be free to sign with a team that needs his services .
This could benefit both sides , as it gives Vick an opportunity and it gives Brohm and / or Flynn more time to become adequate NFL backups .
Scenario 4 : The relationship .
You and your girl decide it ’s go time .
You have chemistry , everything is great , you commit to each other .
You ’ve gone over certain things that are important to you , like your allegiances to certain teams becoming more important than the relationship and what kind of music you can tolerate .
Everything is compatible , so you have a girlfriend .
For the long haul .
Vick and the Packers decide that everything looks great .
The situation is great for him .
Green Bay is the smallest media market in the NFL , and although everyone knows how much of a circus it can be ( see : Favre , Brett ; Summer 2008 ) , he wo n’t be under a microscope as much as he would be in a larger market ( although the way ESPN covers things , it ’s hard to tell ) .
This relationship would n’t end with Vick in a starting job obviously , but it would end up with him being a contributing member of the Packers organization as a Wildcat / running back / wide receiver / backup quarterback .
Vick would show up in the stat sheet frequently and mesh well with Rodgers and the whole bunch .
Of course he would cost either Brohm or Flynn a spot on the team , but it would be for the greater good of the team .
Vick could use the relationship as a jumping off point , if the feeling is mutual , for something better , but he was a success in Green Bay .
Scenario 5 : A break up .
So things just did n’t work out .
Turns out she did n’t really like that music she said she did and she wo n’t give you your alone time with your team .
Things just are n’t meant to be , right ?
There ’s other fish in the sea .
So Vick comes in , spends a year filling a utility role , and things just are n’t right .
He could n’t totally mesh , missing training camp and the first few weeks of the season .
He ca n’t get rolling out of the Wildcat , and the team ca n’t pick it up in the short time period they had to learn it so everyone feels clueless .
He ca n’t get it going when he has to come in relieve Rodgers either and the whole just kind of fails and disappears from view .
Scenario 6 : Marriage .
Scenario 4 evolves and you and your girlfriend get hitched in a little shindig .
You all live happily ever after .
There ’s kids and stuff .
Fun stuff you see in movies .
Vick is a career Packer .
All is forgiven for him defeating the Packers at Lambeau back in 2003 and the public finally accepts for his mistakes .
It ’s great stuff .
He gets a ring ( or two ) with the Packers and keeps his nose clean .
He proves Roger Goodell right for reinstating him .
The dream scenario .
Scenario 7 : Divorce .
A messy one at that .
So turns out you and your girlfriend got hitched in Vegas and it ’s just bad .
Fighting .
Crying .
Broken hearts .
It is definitely not meant to be .
Once you two get that annulment or those divorce papers filed , you ’ll never see each other again .
The Vick experiment fails in Green Bay , epically and publicly .
Vick does something off the field that is just embarrassing and gets himself suspended again and banned from the NFL , or McCarthy and Vick do n’t click at all and get in some public disputes .
The players chime ( or Tweet ) in their problems with the experiment and the team morale collapses .
Pretty soon it ’s Top 10 Draft Pick all over again .
People lose their jobs .
Just garbage .
The last thing anyone wants to happen .
I ’m hoping for Scenario 4 or 6 .
They would be the best for the Packers and Vick , who I ’ll have my two cents on up soon .
Any other scenarios you can think of that could happen to Vick and the Packers ?

Below are some measurements on cesium - beam tube 05062-60500 serial 1936A01035 .
This is the physics package from an HP 5062C atomic clock , a 1970s - era model designed for high reliability and serviceability in airborne / maritime applications .
Obtained as usual from an eBay seller , the tube appeared to have experienced a long shelf life , as the 300 uA ion-pump supply immediately went into current limiting when the hot - wire ionizer was powered up .
At the suggestion of Corby Dawson on the time - nuts mailing list , I applied a 5 - mA 3 KV supply to the ion pump to force it to scavenge the contents of the vacuum envelope that were released by the ionizer filament .
It took several alternating activations of the 5 - mA supply and hot - wire ionizer current before the ion-pump current fell below the 300 - uA supply 's limit and remained there with the ionizer filament powered up .
After a few more hours of operation , the ion-pump current reached its 10 - uA specification limit with all supplies active .
Test Setup and Initial Results
Getting the cesium - beam tube up and running took nearly every power supply on hand .
Bertan 605C - 200P and PMT - 50 CN - 1 high - voltage supplies were used to drive the ion pump and electron multiplier at +2600 V and - 1975 V , respectively .
A 1 - volt , 1 - amp supply was applied to the hot - wire ionizer , elevated to 13.9V in accordance with the mass spectrometer specification marked on the tube .
The cesium oven was brought up to temperature slowly with a 0 - 50 V bench supply , beginning with 25 volts at 1 amp and levelling off after 5 - 10 minutes at almost exactly 7.000 volts with a reading of 190 - 200 ohms on the oven thermistor .
Finally , a 5 - volt supply drove the C - field coil through a 220 - ohm resistor .
RF excitation was provided by an HP 8672A signal generator at its maximum output , measured at the tube connector , of +9.7 dBm .
I believe the tube would prefer to have some additional drive power , since the output signal amplitude was still increasing monotonically up to the 8672A 's limit .
The 8672A was set to 9192.632 MHz and driven from an adjustable HP 10811-60168 OCXO , allowing the actual output frequency to be steered toward the tube 's rated frequency of 9,192,631,774.3 Hz .
To accommodate various correction factors , this frequency is 4.3
Hz higher than the cesium hyperfine - transition frequency at 0 Kelvin that literally defines the " second . "
The EFC input of the 10811 -60168 OCXO was modulated with a 0.025
Hz sinewave from an HP 3325B function generator , resulting in a slow , repetitive sweep covering approximately 6 kHz either side of the center frequency .
Pass / Fail ...?
This basic signal / noise measurement suggests that the tube is good , noting that without the beam - current amplifier circuit ( A16U1 from the 5062C , reproduced almost verbatim for this test ) , the cesium resonance envelope amplitude is only about 5 mV pk-pk into a 10 - megohm oscilloscope probe .
This suggests that the peak - to - peak beam current is on the order of 0.5 nA .
A16U1 turns input current into output voltage with a gain of 1E+8 , so the 0.5 nA figure corresponds well to the 45 - mV pk-pk amplitude in the plots above .
The minimum - specification limit given on page 4 - 37 of the HP 5062C manual is Ip >= 5 nA .
This does not appear to refer to the envelope 's peak - to - peak amplitude , though , but rather the peak beam current above ground potential , measured at the beam - current test point at A16U1's output with the electron multiplier at its maximum voltage of - 2.7 kV .
In the noise test plot above , Ip is 155 mV * 1E - 8 = 1.55 nA with the electron multiplier at - 1975 V .
Increasing the EM potential to - 2.7 kV yielded an Ip of 4.5 nA , much closer to specification :
Chances are good that the tube will meet its specs without difficulty once the other variables such as RF drive level are optimized .
Playing with video games can lead to hard time , just ask Matthew Lloyd Crippen .
The Cal State Fullerton student was arrested Monday on federal charges that he illegally modified Xbox , Playstation , Wii and other video game consoles to enable the machines to play pirated video games .
Crippen , 27 , of Anaheim , was taken into custody Monday morning by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents .
The arrest follows his indictment by a federal grand jury on two counts of violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
Specifically , the college student is accused of modifying for personal financial gain technology affecting control or access to a copyrighted work , according to an ICE statement .
Each criminal count carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison .
The charges against Crippen stem from an ICE investigation initiated late last year after the agency received a tip from the Entertainment Software Association .
Last May , ICE agents executed a federal search warrant at Crippen 's home , where they seized more than a dozen Microsoft , Nintendo and Sony video game consoles .
“ Playing with games in this way is not a game -- it is criminal , ” said Robert Schoch , special agent in charge of the ICE investigations office in Los Angeles .
“ Piracy , counterfeiting and other intellectual property rights violations not only cost U.S. businesses jobs and billions of dollars a year in lost revenue , they can also pose significant health and safety risks to consumers , ” he said .
Counterfeiting and piracy have grown in recent years in both magnitude and complexity , according to ICE .
Industry and trade associations estimate that counterfeiting and piracy now cost the U.S. economy as much as $ 250 billion a year and a total of 750,000 American jobs .
Some estimates indicate that 5 percent to 8 percent of all the goods and merchandise sold worldwide are counterfeit .
Crippen was expected to make his initial federal court appearance late Monday in Los Angeles .

Aug. 5 , 2009  --
The star of the show in Derek Lovley 's lab at the University of Massachusetts is a hairy microbe that has been around since the earliest stages of life on earth , but now it has a new task .
Geobacter , as the tiny bug is known , could play a leading role in removing toxic wastes and cleaning up polluted waters around the planet , but that 's only part of the story .
Geobacter , it turns out , likes a hot lunch .
So it produces electricity to help digest iron oxide , and therein lies an astonishing tale .
It does n't make enough power to do much other than dine on sludge and the contaminated waters of the Potomac River , where Lovley and his colleagues discovered it a couple of decades ago .
For years now Lovley , director of environmental biotechnology on the Amherst campus , has tried all sorts of sophisticated tampering , including genetic engineering , in an effort to get the bug to increase its output .
The best he could get was a doubling of the current , better , but not good enough .
But recently Lovley 's team practically blew their socks off when they came up with a new strain of geobacter that produces eight times the electricity of its predecessor .
How did they bring that off ?
They just made life a little more difficult for the bug , and it tried a whole lot harder , thus an enormous improvement in yield .
By introducing a tiny " pushback " current to the microbe 's environment , the bugs adapted to the new challenge , evolving the more productive strain .
The progress , described in the August issue of the journal Biosensors and Bioelectronics , moved microbial fuel cells a significant step closer to mainline electronics .
A number of companies are already involved in the technology , because it could potentially solve a wide range of very different problems .
For example , " you need to put in a lot of electricity to treat waste water , " Lovley said in a telephone interview , and that makes it almost impossible to clean up water resources in many areas of the world , especially Africa .
But stand back while zillions of geobacters get to work , cleaning up the water while producing enough electricity to power a light bulb or recharge a battery .
Two problems , one solution .
The Geobacter 's Possible Applications
The Office of Naval Research is supporting the research and electronic sensors are already being produced that can be placed on the ocean floor and use microbial fuel cells , fed by slime and mud , for power .
But the list of possible applications seems almost endless , and although groundbreaking research like this often leads to blind alleys , Lovley is convinced he will see many of those applications hit the marketplace in his lifetime .
" I have no doubt about that , " he said , " and many other people agree . "
He and his colleagues have recently linked up with researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who are trying to develop self - powering devices that can be placed permanently in human tissue , including the brain , to combat various afflictions .
" There are all types of potential medical implants that would run off of sugar and blood , " he noted .
" This would alleviate the need for changing the battery in a pacemaker every four or five years . "
It 's a lofty new role for a microbe that has remained basically unchanged for billions of years .
Lovley 's early research , published in Nature in 1987 , revealed that geobacter was the force behind the creation of magnetite , an important iron ore that is strongly attracted by a magnet .
It was formed in rocks deposited billions of years ago , so geobacter was in on the ground floor .
" It 's very likely that microbes growing on iron may have been the first form of life on earth , " Lovley said .
All this praise for a bug that is n't much to look at .
Geobacter is covered with tiny hairs , 20,000 times finer than a human hair , called pili .
The hairs are quite strong , and apparently play a key role in the microbe 's ability to produce an electric current .
That fact is well known to hundreds of students who have built their own little microbial generator for a science fair .
Stick an electrode into slime containing a whole bunch of geobacters , and electrons flow to the anode and can be easily measured .
Geobacter has had that ability throughout it 's lifetime , but it 's doubtful that it knew it .
It had never seen an electrode , but apparently iron oxide fulfilled that function .
Unknown Potential
And over the course of billions of years , it probably had never seen a " pushback " current .
Yet it knew what to do - turn up the juice and make Lovley a very happy man .
" Each step along the way has been astonishing , " he said .
" We started out just trying to understand the processes " by which geobacter devoured the sediments in the Potomac River .
" But then we found that geobacter could grow on a variety of radioactive and toxic metals , like uranium . "
That has led to a " technically simple and quite inexpensive strategy for cleaning up a lot of contaminated sites . "
And that would have been enough to mark this research very successful , but then Lovley pushed geobacter a little harder , making it swim upstream , at least electronically .
It came through like a trooper , and this is still just the beginning .

ST . CLAIRSVILLE , Ohio —
Two eastern
Ohio police chiefs accused of breaking into a home to dig for celebrity tabloid material have been arrested .
Police Chiefs Appear Before JudgeA special prosecutor has said he was looking into allegations that last May the chiefs illegally entered the home of a woman carrying twins for actors Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick .
Martins Ferry Police Chief Barry Carpenter and Bridgeport Police Chief Chad Dojack appeared in court on Friday morning .
Carpenter faces six counts that include two counts for burglary , one count of receiving stolen property , one count of theft in office , one count of tempering with evidence and one count of unauthorized use of property .
His trial date is October 20 , 2009 .
The maximum sentence he faces is 21 years in jail and a $ 45,000 fine .
Dojack faces three counts that include two counts of complicity to burglary and one count of complicity to receiving stolen property .
His trial date is November 17 , 2009 .
He faces upto 14 years in jail and a $ 30,000 fine .
Both were booked Wednesday night .
They appeared in court and entered not guilty pleas on Friday morning and were released until their trial dates .
Police arrested a third person in the case , Bruce Callarik , the son of Bridgeport 's mayor .
He is charged with one count of complicity to receiving stolen property and has a December 1 trial date .
He allegedly was the one who tipped off the two police chiefs that the tabloids were interested in property from the house .
The surrogate mother was not at the Martins Ferry home at the time of the alleged break - in .

Since the last Google update , there have been many instances and examples of the Google Nuke Bot !
This is what I call it anyway .
Have you visited a favorite website lately only to realize they ’ve been nuked by Google ?
More and more we are seeing internet marketing / SEO companies getting nuked , by Google completely removing them from their data banks .
I am not going to mention any names because I ’m sure the owners of the once populated websites already know and are embarrassed from this development .
Since the word went out on WebPositionGold getting banned from Google for automatic queries sent to Google , we are noticing other related websites going down for the count as well .
For the info on WebPositionGold , go here :
http://www.socialpatterns.com/search-engine-marketing/webposition-banned/
The things is , we already know about Webpositiongold , what about other sites that are getting hit hard ?
Has your site been nuked ?
It seems as though , some sites that had thousands of links pointing from Google are getting hit the hardest .
It seems like Google is cracking down on “ spam tactics ” , “ submission tactics ” , and anything related to unethical SEO practices .
Is Google Making An Effort To Uphold Their Webmaster Guidelines ?
Will it come to a point where if we do n’t uphold the Google guidelines , we can not be successful online ?
This thought is ridiculous but almost scary to think it could happen !
What about website ’s that still hide text through same background colours ?
Hidden div layers ?
and mirror pages ?
Why has n’t Google attacked those issues first ?
You can almost make the assumption that by Google nuking websites that send automatic ranking & link popularity queries to their data base , this may be a huge effort to relieve the strain on the query servers in order to free up some memory .
How Does Getting Your Website Nuked From Google Affect Your Credibility ?
An event like this could ultimately ruin your reputation online .
People who have come to trust your knowledge and judgment on Google rankings may never look at your company the same ever again .
People might think to themselves “ I do n’t want to get nuked like they did ! ” .
How Can You Tell You ’ve Been Nuked ?
* Your Google Page Rank is now 0 -2/10 and should be at least 5/10
* You have zero backlinks listing in Google anymore
* You have zero internal website listings within Google by doing ( site:www.yoursite.com)
* Google ’s cache of your website is no longer to be found
For newer websites , do n’t be confused between this nuking process and your own evolution online .
Getting and maintaining a high PR level takes a lot of work .
Once Nuked , Does Google Still Come Back ?
The question I have for websites that have been nuked : Can you still see Google in your stat log files for your site ?
If so , I wonder if Google is still keeping an eye on you and watching your every move ?
In Conclusion :
Stay away from programs that generate automatic queries into Google .
Do n’t check your link popularity 3 times a week and especially do n’t check your search engine rankings twice a day .
Just simply promote your website and measure your success through your internal website stats and monthly profits .
Google does n’t appreciate websites that consistently draw their power in order to measure their success , just simply take that out of your daily actions .
Cheers to your online success !
When you think of a hard - core gamer , do you picture a teenage boy battling his friends in World of Warcraft ?
Think again .
The average gamer , far from being a teen , is actually a 35 - year - old man who is overweight , aggressive , introverted — and often depressed , according to a report out this week from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) ( download PDF ) .
The study also shows that when children and teenagers become game players , a trend toward physical inactivity and corresponding health problems extends -- and is exacerbated -- into adulthood .
" Among researchers , there is growing concern and uncertainty about the health consequences of video game playing , " the CDC reported .
" Given the ubiquity of video games -- industry estimates suggest that they are played in 65 % of American households -- these concerns may be justified . "
The study notes that half of gamers are between 18 and 49 years old , while 25 % are 50 and older .
The CDC also pointed out that of online gamers aged 8 to 34 , nearly 12 % showed multiple signs of addiction .
The study , based on a 2006 online survey of 552 people between the ages of 19 and 90 who were living in the Seattle - Tacoma area of Washington state , also shows differences between male and female gamers .
Men reported that gaming gives them a " reason to get together , " while women said they are looking more for a diversion than social interaction .
Despite the fact that men and women offered differing reasons for playing , they experienced several of the same health effects .
Jim McGregor , an analyst at In - Stat , noted that his concern is n't just with gaming but with social networks , as well .
" My issue is that it 's not just gaming .
It 's social networking .
It 's the Web in general , " said McGregor .
" We 've gained so much , but still it puts people in front of a computer screen for hours on end .
It gives Americans just another reason to be fat , dumb and lazy . "
According to the CDC , both male and female gamers were more likely to report that they were overweight and had more poor - mental - health days and were less socially outgoing than non-gamers .
Women were more apt to report that they experienced depression and other general health issues than women who are n't gamers .
Male gamers , for their part , were more likely to report being obese .
" One interpretation of these findings is that , among women , video - game playing may be a form of digital self - medication ....
In short , they can literally take their minds off their worries while playing a video game . " noted the CDC .
" Among men , the association among sedentary behaviors , physical inactivity and overweight status observed in children and young adults may extend into adulthood . "
We 've all heard the rumors :
Apple is going to be releasing some kind of touchscreen tablet computer , either in September or 1st quarter 2010 ( depending upon the source ) .
It could be a fully functioning computer , like a MacBook with a touchscreen , or an extra - large iPod Touch / iPhone .
What I do know is that for a geek like me , another little piece of sci - fi futurism from my youth is about to hit the market , and I could n't be more excited .
The big source of my excitement is due to having been a huge Star Trek : The Next Generation fan .
TNG was a great update to the franchise , but in many ways , the technology presented on the show was not that significantly updated from the original series .
They had warp drive , transporters and phasers .
Maybe they added " Mark IV " to a few things to tell us they were newer , better versions of what we 'd seen on the old series , but all - in - all it was the same stuff .
Except for the computers .
Probably the coolest bit of futurism built into TNG 's set design was the context - based touch - screen control system , called LCARS ( Library Computer Access / Retrieval System ) , created by technical consultant Michael Okuda .
And while watching Data 's fingers dance over the class consoles on the bridge was cool , even better was when they used LCARS on a PADD ( Personal Access Data Device ) .
The PADD , designed by Rick Sternbach , was the logical extension of the LCARS system and the ship 's computer to a portable hand - held device with it 's own touch screen .
In many ways , using an iPhone , or iPod Touch gives one a similar feeling to what we saw characters doing with PADDs – tapping and swiping with our fingers on a glass display , doing calculations and viewing information .
So just imagine that same experience on an iPhone about three times the size .
It will be magic !
Obviously there have been many other touchscreen computers in science fiction , but the PADD is the one that sticks in my mind .
And if Apple does what I 'm hoping they 'll do , I 'm going to be one happy geek .

Mining of gold and copper for personal finance and general wealth at the legendary Osarizawa mine began around 1300 years ago , with the last of the smelting facilities closing down in 1978 .
Now the site is owned by Mitsubishi , who run guided tours around the highlights and a museum for 1,000 yen- a tour we almost got chain - ganged into joining .
One legend of Osarizawa mine involves a gorgon - headed lion with the wings of a phoenix , the legs of a cow and the head of a snake .
Its roar and monstrous appetite for children terrified the nearby villagers , who urged the village ’s wisest old man to go battle it on the mountain top .
The old man had long grey hair , and went to battle the beast in a series of 6 dreams .
In the final one he managed to slit open the beast ’s belly , from which poured gold , copper and lead .
While climbing the hill behind the Osarizawa pools ( the Incan mine temple structure ) we were spotted from the still - active factory nearby .
We did n’t think too much about it , until a mini-bus with two people on board pulled into the roped - off area before the pools , and spent a while kicking about , laughing , and looking up at where me and Mike were hiding on the slopes .
Mike was wearing a bright yellow slicker , me a bright white T - shirt .
We hissed at each other in voices I ’m now sure they could hear :
“ What are they doing now ? ”
“ They ’re looking right at me ! ”
“ Can they see you ? ”
“ I think they can see my leg .
Can they see you ? ”
“ I ’m just sitting here on the slope , I ’m sure they can see me . ”
After 5 minutes of this it started to seem faintly ridiculous .
They clearly knew we were here , and were either waiting for us to come down and face the music , or were themselves tourists .
I figured ‘ what the heck ’ , and strode down to meet them .
I made sure my camera was prominent , affixed a dumb grin to my face , and went right up to the big guy in a blue jumpsuit , behind whom the two younger office - worker types clustered and giggled .
“ Are you the security guard ? ”
“ Yes . ”
“ Are you from that company ? ” ( pointing at the active area )
“ Yes .
You ’re not allowed to come here , you know . ”
“ Ah , I see . ”
All the while the two youngsters , a guy and girl , were muttering and laughing , and most of the time the big blue guy was smiling and chuckling too , so it seemed clear we were not in major trouble .
I smiled back sheepishly , realizing they had indeed been watching us ineffectually hide on the hill - side the whole time .
We talked a little more , and the big blue guy told me we ’d have to get on his bus , ride with him to the Mitsubishi security office nearby ( they own all the mine sites ) , and pay a 1000 yen fine .
Well , I was a little unsure about that , so voiced my concern vaguely .
“ I have to get on the bus ? ”
( Smiling ) “ Yes , on the bus . ”
“ But we have a car .
We can go by car . ”
“ Nope , we have to go in the bus . ”
“ Are you sure ? ”
“ Yes , on the bus . ”
Of course I had no idea where he would take us , or whether we’d be going directly to the nearest police station to get booked .
Happily I had a little time to prevaricate as Mike was still in hiding on the hill - side .
“ Well , wait a minute will you , my friend is still hiding on the hill - side . ”
They all seemed to find this very amusing .
They got on the bus , pulled around , and we all waited for Mike to come out of hiding .
I could hear them laughing through the windows .
I filled Mike in on the situation , and we shared the concern that there was no way we ’d get on a bus with them .
We went back , and the guy showed us a tourist brochure showing a route around the local mine and factory facilities , and it became clearer the 1,000 yen was not a fine , but a fee for the tour .
Still , we were wary to trust ourselves to his bus , so I just said we did n’t have the time , we had to go catch a shinkansen .
He gave a cheery grin , said -
“ Well do n’t come in again , you know .
This place is dangerous ! ”
Then watched us go on our way .
As a final piece of shame , we forgot to close the boot of the car after packing in Mike ’s camera , and we drove off like that .
I bet they had a good laugh .
Only a few miles down the road did we realize .
I called it the ‘ Incan mine ’ because of this vaulted structure .
The pools were very bright - surely filled with toxic run-off .
A tree coated with toxic mush .
FACTFILE
Entry – Easy to view , difficult to climb up to anything though .
Highlights –
The pools , getting caught and kicked out , forgetting to close the boot as we drove off .

GONE ALMOST 14 YEARS BUT NEVER FORGOTTEN
Jerry Garcia would have turned 67 today if he were still with us .
But those that know , well , know Jerry is still with us in ways that defy any normal description .
Few individuals have made a greater impact on culture and music , and his rise to prominence in the hyper - information age has disseminated his “ hippy Santa Claus ” image in ways as pervasive as any single image in the past century .
Iconic does n’t quite cover it .
Garcia , even in absentia , exudes an aura that lingers and seeps into one , the sort of presence one associates with mystics , great social thinkers / activists , brilliant philosophers and other bringers of wisdom and illuminating change .
Jerry was all of these things , to one degree or another ( and perhaps even more accessible to the common man because of his all - too - human flaws and weaknesses ) , but mainly he was a musician of ultimate potency , who even in his stumbling managed to always impart something profound , some sliver of truth or beauty that helps redeem all the wickedness and smallness humanity is capable of .
There is ultimately too much that can be said about the man , so instead of rambling on we ’ll simply dive into a choice selection of his legacy and encourage one and all to pause momentarily today to consider Garcia ’s impact in their own life .
To say we miss the man is a grotesque understatement , but today instead of dwelling on the sad vacuum of his literal absence from the world we choose to celebrate what he gave us , a body of work that continues to infuse and inform our days .
While he ’s obviously best known for being part of the Grateful Dead , for the generation that discovered him in the ’ 80s , the spine of the contemporary jam scene , it is often memories of his joyful playing with the Jerry Garcia Band that surface when we think of him .
We begin our remembrance today with a sterling 1990 run through a Dylan classic that he truly made his own .
Though it often feels like it never will , Garcia and his pals have a way of reminding us this darkness got to end .
This concert footage was shot shortly after the release of Workingman ’s Dead and shows the boys in fine , frisky form .
His voice sometimes carried the feeling of a wound that never quite heals .
It ’s a sound that slices down to a place of deep humanity , as exemplified by this ragged but right tune for this particular day .
There are tunes in his repertoire that carry the same universal unifying vibe as the best Woody Guthrie .
This one always seems to scoop up anyone in hearing range and plop them down in a better place .
There ’s a great many versions of this staple but this one is especially jaunty , redolent with the Django - isms that frequently surfaced in Garcia ’s playing .
This JGB concert took place on September 1 , 1990 at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View , CA .
The Grateful Dead had been scheduled to play but Brent Mydland ’s death the previous June had caused the band to cancel , which infused the show with a special poignancy for those in attendance .
Let ’s jump back about a year at the same venue for a saucy “ Prophet ” with both Jerry and Brent laying it down proper .
For the full effect , here ’s part two of this performance .
One gets the feeling that Elmore James would have LOVED this take on his amazing blues number .
Do n’t tell me this town ai n’t got no heart !
This wonderful vintage clip shows off the sort of big , beautiful , chaotic group grope that Garcia helped spawn .
There ’s a number of song pairings that became sacred to fans over the years , and none more so than this one - two punch taken from New Jersey in the late ’ 70s .
The eloquence of Garcia ’s playing on this late period classic is something to behold .
One of the things Jerry often commented on was the moment that would occur during their shows where a door to something quite profound would open .
This is the spot where the more broken , tender numbers would surface .
Here ’s a pair of such unfolding , tenderizing moments .
Here ’s the boys getting down to the heart of rock ‘ n ’ roll with a lil ’ assist from one Pete Townshend !
Can you believe they let these guys into the Playboy Mansion ?
Nice poncho , Jer !
Outside of the Dead , Garcia had a few significant partnerships , notably with bassist John Kahn and mandolin whiz David Grisman .
Here ’s one offering from each .
We travel back to the legendary Europe ’ 72 tour for our closer .
While this one became WAY more lived in over time , it ’s worth noting that Garcia never flinched at Death ’s shadow even in his earliest days .
Like the bluesman he surely was , he stared down The Reaper ’s scythe with steely intensity in a way that helps all of us accept and comprehend this dark truth .
We are so lucky that you were born , sir , and we wish you the happiest of birthdays wherever you may be .
And do n’t forget , you can eyeball video sweetness 24/7 with JamBase TV .

Manufacturing Consent : The Political Economy of the Mass Media is a book by Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky , first published in 1988 .
' Manufacturing Consent ' is a revolution in democracy .
It allows a ruling class to establish control over a larger populace , all the while allowing them to think their ' democracy ' works in the opposite way in which it 's really operating .
Presenting an analysis its authors call the " propaganda model " , the book argues that since mass media news outlets are now run by large corporations , they are under the same competitive pressures as other corporations .
According to the book , the pressure to create a stable , profitable business invariably distorts the kinds of news items reported , as well as the manner and emphasis in which they are reported .
This occurs not as a result of conscious design but simply as a consequence of market selection : those businesses who happen to favor profits over news quality survive , while those that present a more accurate picture of the world tend to become marginalized .
The book further points out issues with the dependency of mass media news outlets upon major sources of news , particularly the government .
If a particular outlet is in disfavor with a government , it can be subtly ' shut out ' , and other outlets given preferential treatment .
Since this results in a loss in news leadership , it can also result in a loss of readership / viewership .
That can itself result in a loss of advertising revenue , which is the primary income for most of the mass media ( newspapers , magazines , television ) .
To minimize the possibilities of lost revenue , therefore , outlets will tend to report news in a tone more favorable to the government and giving unfavorable news about the government less emphasis .
The title makes use of the catch phrase coined by Walter Lippmann in Public Opinion .
The documentary film Manufacturing Consent : Noam Chomsky and the Media , directed by Mark Achbar and Peter Wintonick was based in part on Chomsky and Herman 's work ; the remainder of the film serves as a biography of Chomsky .
Here 's is the video version of the book , " Manufacturing Consent " :

As the famous singer once said , I believe the children are our future ; and while we at GreenBiz.com spend most of our time covering the actions of business and the grown - ups who run them , we are always keeping our eyes out for signs of sustainability from the up - and - comers .
There is plenty of promising news coming out of universities , as we found at the beginning of this year with our State of Green Business report .
But a recent survey of young adults in Britain gives us pause .
The study , commissioned by IBM , found that young adults in Generation Y -- the folks currently aged 18 - 24 -- had both the highest levels of awareness of environmental issues , and were the biggest wasters of energy and water in the country .
" The good news is that Generation Y is showing clear concern for environmental issues , " said Jon Z Bentley , a partner in energy and environment at IBM Global Business Services .
" The not - so - good news is that far too few are taking even simple , small steps to control their own wasteful use of resources . "
Among the findings : 72 percent of Gen - Y members surveyed admitted that they wasted water on a regular basis .
Fifty - six percent said they leave the tap water running while brushing their teeth , and 40 percent allow the shower to run for " a few minutes " before getting in .
IBM estimates that leaving water running for two minutes during toothbrushing alone wastes about 12 liters of water , which the company extrapolates to equal over 236 million liters ( more than 62 million gallons ) wasted per week .
In terms of awareness of energy use , 55 percent of young adults could n't correctly guess whether a clothes dryer or an incandescent lightbulb used more energy .
Of course , this lack of awareness is n't limited just to young people ; sure , 55 percent could n't tell you which of four appliances used the most electricity , but of the whole population surveyed , 43 percent could n't answer the same question , and 25 percent overall said an electric kettle used more water than a clothes dryer .
These survey results are n't -- or should n't be -- surprising .
One of the challenges in working in the field we cover is that it's all too easy to get lost inside the bubble of green business ( or green consumer ) practices .
There is no doubt that there are many dozens of highly innovative green businesses that are far out in front in terms of addressing environmental impacts .
That is also true for individuals -- the " no impact " men and women of the world .
However , there is just as little doubt that those businesses ( and those individuals ) are in the tiniest sliver of the minority , and that there is still plenty of low - hanging fruit to be gathered -- for instance , turning off the tap when you brush your teeth .
Depending on the day , I oscillate between optimism and despair about this lack of action on the part of the most mainstream of businesses and individuals .
The despair side is obvious ; but when I feel optimistic , I like to believe that the profound upswing in green business practices , in green energy , in green behaviors that we 've been covering on GreenBiz.com for the last 10 years is going to snowball , picking up enough pace to help us avoid the worst effects of climate change .
I 'd be curious to know your thoughts : are you optimistic or pessimistic , and what will it take to get more businesses and individuals on board with even the smallest environmental actions ?
However , in the article detailing Wikipedia ’s history , the organisation does highlight that older articles “ tend to be more comprehensive and balanced , while newer articles more frequently contain significant misinformation , unenyclopedia content or vandalism ” .
Users are warned to be aware of this in order to obtain valid information and avoid misinformation .
Harry and Louise may have switched sides , but that ’s no excuse , in our book , for the health insurance industry to resort to misrepresenting polls as it argues against inclusion of a public plan in health care overhaul proposals on Capitol Hill .
Karen Ignani , the head of industry trade group America ’s Health Insurance Plans ( AHIP ) , told lawmakers that “ 77 percent of Americans are satisfied with their existing health insurance coverage , ” according to today ’s Washington Post .
That ’s a statistic plucked from a June survey by CBS News and the New York Times .
But , as the Post also points out , a look at the responses to other questions in the poll does more to undermine the industry ’s argument than support it .
For instance , when asked whether they favored creation of a government - administered health plan to compete with the private insurance industry , 72 percent of respondents said yes , while only 20 percent said no .
Furthermore , the Post notes that data crunched for the newspaper from a Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll last year showed that people who used their health insurance the least – in other words , those who were the healthiest – liked it the best .
Individuals who had more experience with the system of filing claims and trying to get medical care had lower regard for their insurance plans .
Any meaningful javascript application is going to make use of some kind of application API that lives off on a server somewhere .
Generally , some user interface triggers some event which , in turn , will send a request to a remote API .
These requests are generally asynchronous .
That is , the request happens in the background while the user interface is still responding to events .
The number of API connections and requests can add up rather quickly .
Even if the data sent over the network for each request and corresponding response are relatively small , there is still the overhead involved with assembling the request .
Using a transactional javascript API access pattern can help cut down on network bandwidth .
This is done by minimizing the work done by the API on a given request .
Additionally , we also cut down the response size for a given request .
The bandwidth consumption will grow to a much larger size if each API response is sent to the javascript application in a single HTTP response .
It would be nice if a single HTTP response could contain multiple API responses .
One potential solution is to only return a transaction id for each transaction request .
The javascript can then store this transaction id .
At the core of the javascript application would be an interval that would check the API for completed transactions and their corresponding responses .
This approach is illustrated below .
In the ongoing red state / blue state , small state / big state public opinion tussle , the small states have been on the losing end lately , with small state Senators having huge influence on two major pieces of legislation , influence that is either significantly weakening , and even threatening to kill , those bills .
That leaves plenty of people wondering how it is that a handful of senators who represent a tiny fraction of the nation 's population get to decide for all of us .
But I think the real question needs to be whether that tiny fraction of the nation 's population is really being represented , and if not , what are they going to do about it .
Wyoming 's Senators are starting to talk tough on killing cap - and - trade legislation recently passed in the House of Representatives .
That 'll mean Mike Enzi will have to take some time out of his schedule killing healthcare reform , which he has been pursuing mightily for months , along with colleagues from North Dakota , New Mexico , Iowa , Maine , and of course Max Baucus from Montana .
A handful of Senators , representing less than three percent of the nation 's total population , have the ability to obstruct must - pass legislation that the rest of the nation is clamoring for .
That is , unless another small state Senator , Harry Reid , decides to bypass them .
The nation 's founders intended the Senate to be the deliberative body , the careful body that would provide the check on the unruly mob that the House would likely become on the one hand , and the potential tyrant the executive might become on the other .
What we ended up with is the least democratic body in our republic .
It means that , as Nate Silver points out , " A voter in Wyoming -- population 533,000 -- has about 70 times more ability to influence the Senate 's direction than one in California -- population 36.8 million . "
That means that cap - and - trade legislation that could achieve a 17 percent carbon reduction for a cost of about $ 7 per household per month , $ 83 per year , could end up totally eviscerated in the Senate , keeping the United States on track as an unrepentant world polluter , using the convenient excuse of , " yeah , well , China is worse . "
" There 's nothing good about it , " said U.S. Sen .
John Barrasso , R - Wyo .
" I 'm going to do everything to make sure it does n't pass . "
U.S. Sen . Mike Enzi , R - Wyo. , said the bill is " the biggest hidden tax in America . "
" It 's a Ponzi scheme because we 're just going to print certificates for CO2 and not take care of any CO2 , " Enzi said .
" It 's just another way to make money . "
Note that these remarks were made before the industry trade group , the Petroleum Association of Wyoming .
Note also that Mike Enzi is the number one recipient of PAC money in terms of percentage in the Senate since 2003 .
Interestingly , the bill is extremely friendly to coal , making one wonder what Senators Enzi and Barrasso would say if they were speaking before a coal mining association .
It 's a deeply flawed bill that can be opposed on many levels — because it does n't go far enough fast enough , and because it favors certain industries , like coal , where lawmakers from coal producing states again had undue influence in the committee process .
Which brings us back to the small state conundrum .
There is something fundamentally wrong about senators who represent less than three percent of the nation 's population deciding the fate of the other 97 percent .
And there 's a problem with a senator from a state with an experience that is so completely unlike the experience of the rest of the nation .
That 's demonstrated most clearly in this debate by Kent Conrad 's fixation on regional co-ops .
In his experience , a co-op brought electrification to his parents or grandparents .
It helps the dairy farmers secure fair prices for their product .
But even in North Dakota , are a plucky bunch of folks going to organize their doctors and hospitals to strike out in a new organization , breaking the stranglehold Blue Cross / Blue Shield has on the state , which holds 91 % of the market ?
Letting Max Baucus Kent Conrad limit the health care choices for the entire nation based on their experience in North Dakota and Montana is as irrational as it would be to have Chuck Schumer set all of the gun control policy for the entire nation , based on his experiences in New York .
That 's on the merits of debate alone .
When you factor in the money part of the equation , it gets more disturbing .
As many Congress watchers have pointed out , most recently Peter Drier in a column reprinted at New West , " Health - related companies and their employees gave Baucus ’s political committees nearly $ 1.5 million in 2007 and 2008 , when he began holding hearings and making preparations for this year ’s reform debate . "
These small state Senators pull in inordinate amounts of money from corporate donors and PACs , in part because they have a small individual donor base in their home states -- fewer people , fewer individual donations .
More corporate donations , higher likelihood of making policy in the interest of the corporation ?
It 's just common sense .
That 's where the major problem for all Americans , particularly small state residents , comes in to play .
For all of the outsized clout these Senators might have , is it in these states long - term interest to have their Senators working on the behest of corporations in the short term .
Consider Wyoming , and Enzi's and Barrasso's work to represent the petroleum and natural gas folks .
Yes , Wyoming is booming now because of those extractive industries , with the high paying jobs and the royalties they bring in .
What has it also brought , though ?
Take Sublette county , ground zero for industry .
The levels of ozone in the air in the county have measured higher than Los Angeles 's , with all the subsequent health problems that entails .
The influx of transient oil and gas workers has created some serious social upheaval in towns like Pinedale .
The groundwater has been poisoned , killing off or forcing out the area 's famed pronghorn antelope herds , and causing losses for livestock owners .
Wyoming has had plenty of booms and busts in its past , in large part because of the hold extractive industries have on the state 's economy , and the hold extractive industries have on the reelection prospects of the state 's federal elected officials .
Think about what energy legislation could mean for Wyoming in the long term , if its federal policy - makers were thinking in those terms .
Wyoming potentially has it all in alternative energy resources -- wind , solar , and geothermal all readily available and exploitable .
Wyoming could become a key player in building a more sustainable path to economic growth not only for itself , but for the nation in creating sustainable , smart , energy production .
Which the Petroleum Association of Wyoming is going to fight tooth and nail , with Enzi and Barrasso carrying their banner , and taking their PAC donations .
The same dynamic is playing out in the healthcare reform debate , where Senators from Montana , Iowa , and North Dakota , are determining the fate of us all .
It 's not that residents of those state do n't deserve representation .
Residents of small states are as equal as Americans as Californians or Floridians or New Yorkers .
There 's a tendency among pundits when pointing out this small state problem to be dismissive of the states themselves , the fly - over country , the states who are a tax - drain on the rest of the country .
It can smack of coastal elitism .
And it ignores how much we are all in this together .
But in setting up that dynamic , the lack of representation small state residents receive is rarely considered by the critics .
More unfortunately , it does n't seem to be considered by the Senators in question , either .
Let 's look at the state of healthcare access in some of these states .
In North Dakota , 11 percent of the population is uninsured ; in Montana 16 percent ; in Iowa , it 's 10 percent .
Add to that , look at the monopolies the insurance companies -- majority donors to these same Senators , have in their states .
Blue Cross / Blue Shield covers 75 percent of insured Montanans , and 70 percent of insured residents of Wyoming .
Wellmark covers 71 percent of insured Iowans .
Hardly a good example of free - market enterprise and competition , something these conservative Senators are quick to say they 're trying to uphold .
The percentages of uninsured in the small states is on par with the big ones .
We 're all suffering .
In New York , it 's 14 percent ; in Florida , a whopping 21 percent .
These are crises in which we all share , unfortunately , including the three percent of the population being represented by the Senators who are trying to decide for all of us .
The climate crisis is n't as immediate as the healthcare crisis , or at least not as pressing on individual daily lives .
But it 's just as critical to the fate of the nation in the long term .
And just as likely to be decided by corporations , many of the multi-nationals , like Halliburton which has a big chunk of the contracts in Wyoming .
The short - term boom and bust mentality that maximizes corporate profits -- where in oil and gas or in health insurance -- is at work again in these current votes .
It 's at work again in influencing Max Baucus and Mike Enzi and Chuck Grassley and Kent Conrad and John Barrasso .
They 're helping out their friends in industry , forgetting that while their campaign coffers might have been filled by those lobbyists , they owe their votes to the actual people who sent them to DC .
This is n't a partisan thing , and it is n't a regional thing .
But the small state residents who sent these folks back to Washington to represent their best interests are getting the short end of the stick , yet again .

We already know that increasing food production causes population growth .
Volume of food production is like a piston .
Habitat is the cylinder it slides into .
The gas or fluid inside is the size of population .
The piston goes up and population expands .
Shove it down ( or provide us expensive affluence ) and our numbers contract .
We also know that clearing land for agriculture to Feed The World reduces our biosphere ’s carbon absorption .
Since unabsorbed carbon becomes a climate changing greenhouse gas , humanitarian activity later causes at least some humanitarian disasters .
If it feels good now , we ’ll pay with interest later .
Unpopularity ruins our ability to fix the problems we created by our own popular quick fixes .
Elected leadership dependent on public image is forced to circumvent any damage their own constituents have caused .
All effort is then diverted to various
Act of God extraneous side effects to keep up the appearances of doing something even as the core problem grows .
Climate change is expected to summon an historic humanitarian disaster into our times .
The scale is as yet unknown , but now world military leaders are beginning to pay attention .
Military power is less inhibited by the popularity of its actions .
Crises such as drought , violent storms , mass migration and pandemics could topple governments , feed terrorist movements or destabilize entire regions .
The Times reported that for the first time , intelligence agencies and the Pentagon are taking a hard look at the possible security implications resulting from climate change .
foxnews
Should our leadership find itself confronted with a refugee crisis of unmanageable proportions , national interests will necessarily shift from aid to protectionist .
Internal security policy will in turn find its interests divided between ongoing immigration protests of the right and resurgent humanitarian demonstrations of the left .
Liberal democracy and multiculturalism , having fragmented consensus , shows its untenable cost .
Leaving no continent untouched , climate change and the resulting refugee influx combined would further strain natural resources and a failing distributive infrastructure .
Following increased infrastucture failure , the economy , local and federal budgets , already impacted by humanitarian relief , whither toward bankruptcy .
A shrunken budget in turn reduces the ability to provide internal security to non-essentials like an angry civil population that has bloated in size to unmanageable numbers .
What about international security in the midst of global climate change and world population bound for nine billion ?
“ Another reality is that while worries about climate - related instability are rising , near - term concerns about energy insecurity are already a top - tier issue both here and in China , the two dominant contributors to the planetâ€™s greenhouse - gas blanket .
China has made it clear lately that energy security there trumps climate concerns . ” nytimes
While America and Europe retain the costly luxury of playing humanity ’s saviour , the other nations pragmatically look to their own interests and the survival of their founding people .
“ Meanwhile , New Delhi has previously said that if the Chinese were to dam certain Himalayan rivers that provide water to Northeast India it would constitute an act of war . ” fastertimes
Past decades saving lives abroad during times of plenty will have been for nothing and worse , disastrous for the future .
This is the same oblivious thinking that accepts credit cards for trinkets , maxes them out and later finds itself unable to pay .
Like a creditor coming to collect his bill , nature remains bound to prevail against mankind ’s growing numbers and quixotic impulses .

Nine States at or Near Historic Highs on Unemployment
Nine states are at or near their historic highs for unemployment , according to June numbers out from the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
As a guide , remember the official U.S. unemployment figure is 9.5 percent .
The states are :
-- California , at 11.6 percent .
-- Delaware , at 8.4 percent .
-- Florida , at 10.6 percent .
-- Georgia , at 10.1 percent .
-- Nevada , at 12 percent .
-- North Carolina , at 11 percent .
( Historic high is 11.1 percent . )
-- Oregon , at 12.2 percent .
-- Rhode Island , at 12.4 percent .
-- South Carolina , at 12.1 percent .
Some analysis :
-- California 's employment figure is heavily influenced by seasonal employment ( agriculture ) .
Also , the state is among the leaders in foreclosures and faces a massive budget crisis .
-- Florida is another foreclosure state , as is Nevada .
-- Oregon 's high unemployment rate remains a puzzle even to Oregonians , as we blogged about here .
It appears to be a unique combination of a number of factors , is the best guess .
-- Georgia is getting hammered by job losses in the manufacturing sector .
Unemployment in Atlanta stands at 10.7 percent .
-- The Carolinas , like much of the South , overbuilt during the housing bubble and are now paying the price .
-- Casino layoffs and dog - track woes are killing Rhode Island .
No kidding .
-- In Delaware , the construction crash is fueling unemployment .
As bad is it is in some states , joblessness is nowhere near its historic highs .
For instance :
-- Unemployment in auto - industry - dependent Michigan leads the nation at 15.2 percent .
But that 's still not the state 's all - time high of 16.9 percent , attained in November 1982 , as the recession , the gas crisis and the cheaper , better foreign imports really took their toll on Detroit .
-- Unemployment in The Ticker 's home state of West Virginia stands at 9.2 percent .
That hurts , because it was as recent as January 2008 that the state hit its historic unemployment low of 4.1 percent .
But consider this :
The Mountain State holds the national record ( yay ! ) for all - time highest state unemployment since 1976 .
It came in March of 1983 , when joblessness in West Virginia hit a staggering 18.2 percent .
That 's almost Great Depression level .
What happened ?
In March 1983 , the national unemployment rate was 10.3 percent , as the U.S. began pulling out of 1970s stagflation and an early - '80s recession .
But West Virginia was a one - industry state .
And when the recession reduced demand for coal , it put a lot of Mountaineers out of work .
And in Wyoming , unemployment stands at a recession - defying 5.9 percent .
But that looks like a raging depression compared to the state 's all - time low unemployment rate , achieved in February 1979 : 1.9 percent .
In a state with so few people , I 'm surprised the BLS report did n't name all the unemployed in that month .

Cultural disorders ( culture - bound syndromes ) are mental disorders or quirks which seem to affect a single cultural group and are , therefore , often unknown outside of their own regions .
We have covered some cultural disorders in the past but this is the first list to deal with them exclusively .
It is also the first time that we have included syndromes affecting westerners .
The first two entries have appeared on previous lists in the past , but they are such perfect examples of this phenomenon that they deserve a place here too .
10 Koro
Koro is a psychological disorder characterized by delusions of penis shrinkage and retraction into the body , accompanied by panic and fear of dying .
This delusion is rooted in Chinese metaphysics and cultural practices .
The disorder is associated with the belief that unhealthy or abnormal sexual acts ( such as sex with prostitutes , masturbation , or even nocturnal emissions ) disturb the yin / yang equilibrium which allegedly exists when a husband has sex with his wife , i.e. , during “ normal intercourse . ”
Koro is also thought to be transmitted through food .
In 1967 , there was a koro epidemic in Singapore after newspapers reported cases of koro due to eating pork which came from a pig that had been inoculated against swine fever .
Not only did pork sales go down , but hundreds of koro cases followed .

9 Windigo
Wendigo Psychosis is a mental disorder in which a person intensely craves human flesh and thinks they are turning into a cannibal ( despite an abundance of healthy food available ) .
The most common response amongst the aboriginal communities in which wendigo psychosis was most prevalent , was curing attempts by traditional native healers or Western doctors .
In the unusual cases when these attempts failed , and the Wendigo sufferer began either to threaten those around them or to act violently or anti-socially , they were then generally executed .
While some have denied the existence of this disorder , there are a number of credible eyewitness accounts , both by aboriginal communities and by Westerners , that prove that Wendigo psychosis is a factual historical phenomenon .
8 Gururumba
Gururumba is a “ wild man ” episode in which the suffer ( typically a married male ) begins by burglarizing neighboring homes – taking objects that he thinks are valuable but which seldom are .
He then runs to the forrest for a number of days returning without the objects and with a case of amnesia .
The sufferer appears hyperactive and clumsy with slurred speech .
This disorder is specific to New Guinea .
7 Saora Disorder
Among the Saora tribe of Orissa State in India , young men and women sometimes exhibit abnormal behavior patterns that western trained mental health specialists would likely define as a mental disorder .
They cry and laugh at inappropriate times , have memory loss , pass out , and claim to experience the sensation of being repeatedly bitten by ants when no ants are present .
These individuals are usually teenagers or young adults who are not attracted to the ordinary life of a subsistence farmer .
They are under considerable psychological stress from social pressure placed on them by their relatives and friends .
The Saora explain the odd behavior of these people as being due to the actions of supernatural beings who want to marry them .

6 Berserkers
This fury affecting the Norsemen , which was called berserkergang , occurred not only in the heat of battle , but also during laborious work .
Men who were thus seized performed things which otherwise seemed impossible for human power .
This condition is said to have begun with shivering , chattering of the teeth , and chill in the body , and then the face swelled and changed its color .
With this was connected a great hot - headedness , which at last gave over into a great rage , under which they howled as wild animals , bit the edge of their shields , and cut down everything they met without discriminating between friend or foe .
When this condition ceased , a great dulling of the mind and feebleness followed , which could last for one or several days .

5 Shenkui
A sufferer of shenkui ( a Chinese culture - bound syndrome ) shows marked anxiety or panic symptoms with accompanying somatic complaints for which no physical cause can be demonstrated .
Symptoms include dizziness , backache , fatiguability , general weakness , insomnia , frequent dreams , and complaints of sexual dysfunction ( such as premature ejaculation and impotence ) .
Symptoms are attributed to excessive semen loss from frequent intercourse , masturbation , nocturnal emission , or passing of “ white turbid urine ” believed to contain semen .
Excessive semen loss is feared because it represents the loss of one ’s vital essence and can thereby be life threatening .
4 Ghost Sickness
Ghost sickness is a culture - bound syndrome which some Native American tribes believe to be caused by association with the dead or dying .
It is sometimes associated with witchcraft .
It is considered to be a psychotic disorder of Navajo origin .
Its symptoms include general weakness , loss of appetite , a feeling of suffocation , recurring nightmares , and a pervasive feeling of terror .
A symptom of “ ghost sickness ” is suffocation .
This may be associated with a coffin .
If you were buried alive with a loved one or friend below ground , you may feel as if you were suffocating .
The sickness is attributed to ghosts ( chindi ) or , occasionally , to witches .
3 Grisi siknis
Grisi siknis ( “ crazy sickness ” ) is a contagious , culture - bound syndrome that occurs predominantly among the Miskito People of eastern Central America and affects mainly young women .
Most of the victims are young girls from 15 to 18 years old .
The attacks are prefaced by headaches , dizziness , anxiety , nausea , irrational anger and / or fear .
During the attack , the “ victim loses consciousness ” and falls to the ground , subsequently running away .
The victim may view other people as devils , feel no pain for bodily injuries and have absolute amnesia regarding their physical circumstances .
Some grab machetes or broken bottles to wave off unseen assailants .
Other victims are reported to have performed superhuman feats , vomited strange objects such as spiders , hair and coins and spoken in tongues .
In some cases the semi-conscious victim will speak the names of the next to be infected , although it is not always accurate .
Grisi siknis is highly contagious .
2 Couvade Syndrome
Couvade syndrome is a medical / mental condition which “ involves a father experiencing some of the behavior of his wife at near the time of childbirth , including her birth pains , postpartum seclusion , food restrictions , and sex taboos ” .
The term originally referred to the medieval Basque custom in which the father , during or immediately after the birth of a child , took to bed , complained of having labour pains , and was accorded the treatment usually shown women during pregnancy or after childbirth .
In some extreme cases , fathers can grow a belly similar to a 7 - month pregnant woman and gain approximately 25 to 30 pounds ( “ phantom pregnancy ” ) .
Other symptoms include and are not limited to developed cravings , suffered nausea , breast augmentation , and insomnia .
1 Homosexual Panic
Homosexual panic is a term , first coined by psychiatrist Edward J. Kempf in 1920 , describing an acute , brief reactive psychosis involving delusions and hallucinations accusing a person of various homosexual activities .
The condition most often occurs in people who suffer schizoid personality disorders who have insulated themselves from physical intimacy .
Breakdowns often occur in situations that involve enforced intimacy with the same sex , such as dormitories or military barracks .
It was most common during the mass mobilization of World War II when barracks typically provided little privacy with communal showers and often without doors or even cubicles around toilets .
Treatment usually involves hospitalization , firstly to remove the person from the situation and also because the condition may lead to suicidal or homicidal acts .
Usually members of the opposite sex are selected to treat those suffering from the disorder , and invasive procedures such as injections with needles or suppositories are avoided .

Ever wondered how they get the stripes on the toothpaste ?
Some people even avoid buying those stripy toothpastes just so they do n't have to even think about this .
But it 's easier than it seems .
And no , there are not two separate compartments ( cf the drawing below ) .
The tube is filled with the carrier material , the actual toothpaste , which is usually white , to a certain level .
Above that level , the tube is filled with the ' stripe ' stuff , which is usually red , blue or green .
Both materials are viscous enough so that they do n't mix .
Now the trick is to let these two substances out separate ways but at the same time .
The toothpaste nozzle is not just a hole at the top of the tube .
Instead , it is a longish pipe that reaches down the tube just ending at the filling level of the carrier material .
The pipe has small holes in it further up closer to the nozzle .
Pressing the tube will cause the carrier material to enter the outlet pipe and press the stripe stuff .
The stripe material will enter the outlet pipe through the small holes , which is where the stripes are generated .
Assorted Trivia
Some clinical trials of swine flu vaccine are underway
The first swine flu vaccines are likely to be licensed for use in the general population in September , the World Health Organization has announced .
Several manufacturers have produced initial batches of a H1N1 vaccine and some clinical trials are already underway .
WHO director of vaccine research Dr Marie - Paule Kieny also sought to calm fears about safety of new vaccines .
She said the vaccines were based on " old and proven technology " .
Figures show continuing rises in cases in the southern hemisphere in the past seven days .
Argentina has particularly seen a large increase and deaths now stand at 337 .
And there has been a rise in cases of 25 % in Australia .
INCREASE IN PAST WEEK China ( Hong Kong ) 46 % China ( mainland ) 16 % Malaysia 20 % Thailand 31 % Argentina 60 % Brazil 25 % Australia 25 % Peru 45 %
Although it has not yet been clarified who would be first in line for a vaccine , it is likely to be those who are most vulnerable , such as pregnant women and young children .
Some experts have raised concerns about the lack of safety data on flu vaccines in these groups .
In particular , a very rare neurological condition called Guillain Barre syndrome affected 500 people during a US vaccine programme against swine flu in 1976 .
Dr Kieny said much was known about flu vaccines in these groups from seasonal vaccines given every winter and added that regulatory agencies would be monitoring for any signs of adverse reaction .
" The quality controls on today 's vaccine are much better than they were 30 years ago , " she added .
Fast track Regulators in the US and Europe have special plans in place to fast - track swine flu vaccines , some of which are based on conventional seasonal flu vaccines and some which use newer technology .
Clinical trials are already underway in China , Australia , USA , UK , and Germany .
It comes as drug company , Baxter , has announced the production of the first commercial batches of its swine flu vaccine Celvapan .
The quality controls on today 's vaccine are much better than they were 30 years ago
Dr Marie - Paule Kieny , WHO
The vaccine has been grown using cell culture , a much faster method than the traditional way of growing it in eggs .
Baxter is one of two companies contracted to provide pandemic flu vaccine to the UK , the other being GlaxoSmithKline , and both plan to start clinical trials this month .
One key part of the trials is to work out whether people need one or two doses of the vaccine .
Ministers have repeatedly said they expect to have enough doses for half the UK population by the end of the year .

Children Endangered By Lack of Guns In Parks
I recently read some editorials concerning banning guns in Tennessee parks and thought it would be fun to take those articles and rewrite them from a pro gun point of view .
Let us know what you think .
Fredy Riehl – AmmoLand.com
Clarksville , Tennessee – I have to ask , have those in the county government lost their minds ?
Is passing laws to prevent the carrying guns around small children at play really necessary ?
People are afraid to bring their 4 - year - olds to parks because they will have no way to defend their children or their families if they were to come face to face with someone who means them harm .
Or is it the rampant and overwhelming crime in our parks that have people scared ?
Because I seriously want to know what benefit there is in people NOT carrying a gun in a public park .
Self - defense is the only reason I 've heard .
Every crime prevention or safety
Web site you go to will tell you to never approach someone committing a crime and to not fight back .
You should be happy being the victim .
You should call the police and let then handle it because when seconds count the police are just minutes away .
That 's one reason we pay taxes , to make sure we have police officers available when needed .
I understand that you must have a carry permit in order to be able to have a gun in bars and parks now .
But a carry permit is not the same thing as knowing how to use a gun safely .
Yes , they 're screened , but who 's to say the person with the gun in their possession is really a safe gun owner because CCW licensed permit owners have only been finger printed , subjected to mental health and criminal background checks ?
I believe the Second Amendment has it uses , but the right to restrict that right and endanger my children should n't be one of them .
I , for one , will not be taking my children to a county run park to play if it is a gun free zone .
I will do everything in my power to get guns allowed in our county parks and bars .
I can't imagine two more dangerous situations than someone with a gun around a bunch of drunks or innocent children and no way to defend myself or family .
I hope the county government gets on board with the city and does the right thing , and that would be removing all gun free zones and allowing guns in all places .

Every kid has a creative stash for secret stuff , but that useful enthusiasm does n't have to die off just because we 've traded treehouses for desks .

10 . Draw useful information on book edges
Click to viewEmbedding a subway map on the edge of a Moleskine saves on packing space and could potentially help you avoid the stigma of looking like a tourist ( and being exposed to all the encounters that can encourage ) , but B.light Design 's drawing hack should be more of a springboard for your own semi-secret information embedding .
Terrible with names ?
Ca n't remember the lunch specials at your favorite take - out spot ?
These kinds of reminders , the kind you do n't necessarily want everyone to know you use , are perfect for the edge of a Moleskine , a paperback , or , if appearances are n't that important , your tourist guidebook .

9 . Keep cat litter inconspicuous
Those with huge , cavernous houses can probably find an out - of - the - way spot to place their cats ' commode and keep it accessible to them .
Apartment dwellers , though , and especially those on higher floors , often have to sacrifice closets or rooms to a box that might not smell great all the time .
Two different projects from clever IKEA fans show how to turn an entryway storage unit and a storage bin that fits under a sink into litter boxes that use discrete space and wo n't necessarily make those rooms less pleasant .
They might be solutions best tailored to a single cat , but they keep their owner 's main responsibility both hidden and accessible .
8 . Make a cable - free workspace

Unless tangled knots and inaccessible plugs are a weirdly popular and undocumented fetish , most of us can stand to do with fewer exposed cables around our workspace .
It 's not a matter of handing over a week 's paycheck to pick up every cordless / Bluetooth device out there , but rather doing a little creative stashing of those cables and cords .
Adam 's cordless workspace and Gina 's redux are good starting points , but our readers have contributed their own techniques , like this elegant desk layout , and tips on using crown molding and rain gutters as cable hiders .

7 . Hide webapp features you do n't need
Advertisement
The only reason you 'd want to hide YouTube comments , Gmail sidebars , or Google SearchWiki buttons is because you do n't really care about them — but when you visit those sites many , many times each week ( or day ) , that 's a good enough reason to take action .
Greasemonkey , the custom JavaScript - tweaking add - on for Firefox , gives you the power to hide SearchWiki buttons , kill Gmail sidebar clutter and footer text , and , compiled into our Better YouTube , Better GReader , Better Gmail , and other Better extensions , they take only a single settings click to turn on or off .

6. Keep certain files out of Windows ' Recent Documents
Advertisement
Whether you 're trying to keep your " Recent Documents " list clear of files you do n't really need access to , or you 're just trying to keep certain files from ever showing up there , NirSoft Utilities ' FileTypesMan is a powerful tool to get the job done .
As reader Paul suggested and we explained , selecting the .avi file type and then checking off " Do n't add this file type to Recent Documents " keeps any videos you 've played from being interspersed with actual text documents , spreadsheets , or emails you need access to .

5 . Stash your money safely
Advertisement
Having emergency cash on hand is a pretty smart idea , but you do n't want home invaders , ethically flexible visitors , or your worst spending impulses to find it too quickly .
A fake wall outlet safe or hollowed - out book are the traditional ( and fun ) ways to stash your small stuff , but there are others that do n't require weekend time with the tool box .
The Frugal Dad blog has money - hiding suggestions that include making your money look like ancient leftovers , while SavingAdvice 's tips from a former burglar suggest leaving just a bit of cash in more obvious " hiding " spots around the house , so anyone engaged in evil deeds wo n't tear your place apart looking for your real stash .
4. Hide the Mac Dock and menu bar

Hiding the taskbar in Windows is a fairly straight - forward affair involving a right - click and a few settings tweaks .
Hiding the Mac's Dock and top - of - screen menu bar is a bit more convoluted , at least on an app - by - app basis .
Still , those who want to maximize their screen real estate for Photoshop or keep their desktop looking clean and minimalist can do so with these step - by - step editing instructions .

3 . Stash your workspace when you are n't using it
Advertisement
If you work from home , there 's a good chance you do n't want your home office space to always remind you of work when you pass it by — and if it's in a communal space , others might want the piles of paper and computer gear kept to a minimum .
A few crafty workers have shown Lifehacker how they keep their workspaces neat by hiding their gear in the off hours .
A simple collapsing desk can do the job , but a fold - away desk grants more usable space when work is done .
For those looking to get a bit craftier , a trap door workspace , or any of the finalists in our 2007 battle of the organizers , should provide ample inspiration on how to make work something you only see during working hours .

2 . Hide sensitive files
Advertisement
Everybody has certain things they do n't want the boss , the spouse , young types , or computer borrowers to see — and , hey , we could be talking about a resume or birthday plans here , right ?
Do n't rely on pocket thumb drives or craftily - named , deeply - hidden files .
Download and use the best free methods of protecting private files , like TrueCrypt , 7 - Zip , and other methods of password - protecting , encrypting , or archiving those files meant for your eyes only .

1 . Hide sensitive data inside files
Advertisement
If everyone you knew had public / private encryption keys and used them regularly , you 'd scoff at everyone else for their privacy and security concerns .
But that 's not reality , and , instead , we occasionally need clever ways to hide data .
One of those ways , steganography , uses both raw mathematic power and clever social disguising to hide data inside harmless - looking files , like digital pictures , generically titled Word documents , and other items not destined to be picked through .
You might have to explain to another party how to use the same tools you used to extract the data , or , if you 're just stashing items for yourself , remember how to pull it out later .
Either way , it 's probably safer than keeping your financial passwords in a file named BANK PASSWORDS .

Issue # 118 • July / August , 2009
The most remarkable thing about civil unrest is that there has n’t been more of it .
Politicians are making a hash of this country and much of the rest of the civilized world .
We know it .
They know it .
They know we know it .
But we do n’t feel we can do anything much to stop them .
That right there is the pre-condition for civil unrest when people are frustrated and politicians are nervous .
Worse , that was how things stood before last fall ’s crash .
Before pols on both left and right launched the biggest mass transfer of wealth in history transferring our wealth ( what we had left of it ! ) to their friends on Wall Street and in the banking industry .
In other words , that ’s how things were before things got bad !
Now everybody ’s talking about the ongoing catastrophe ( even if we are in a momentarily sunny mood ) .
But almost nobody is talking about the logical maybe even inevitable consequences of cynical or desperate politicians abusing an already fed - up populace : civil unrest .
I mean people taking to the streets .
Or mass resistance .
Or crackdowns because the government fears we might do something to upset its apple cart .
It ’s going to happen .
Somewhere .
At some time .
It ’s going to .
One of the few VIPs to mention the matter openly was Zbigniew Brzezinski , former National Security Advisor and the ultimate insider ’s insider .
He commented on the millions of unemployed or soon - to - be- unemployed and the “ … public awareness of this extraordinary wealth that was transferred to a few individuals at levels without historical precedent in America . ”
He told “ Morning Joe ” Scarborough , “ Hell , there could be even riots . ”
I ’d say that ’s an understatement .
Although few in power are talking about it , rumors abound that governments at many levels are planning for civil unrest .
One rumor is about a document supposedly being circulated right now among top federal officials .
It ’s called the “ C&R Document ” with C&R standing for “ conflict & revolution . ”
The much - storied paper is said to be a plan for controlling the American people when we get out of hand .
True ?
Who knows .
But the very rumor tells us a lot about these times .
Other things are not mere rumor .
When the federal government established a North American Army command in 2002 , its purpose was n’t to repel foreign invaders .
It was domestic operations something long and rightly forbidden by the Posse Comitatus Act .
In February of 2009 , when military commanders in Canada and the U.S. signed a pact allowing their armies to operate inside each other ’s country they did n’t even bother to get authorization from Congressan illegal and unprecedented move .
And once again , the purpose was handling “ domestic civil emergencies . ”
For several years , the Centers for Disease Control tried to get states to adopt something called the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act ( MEHPA ) .
This act would allow state governments to become police - state dictatorships in event of any ill - defined health emergency vaccinating people by force , destroying or seizing property without compensation , and rationing medical supplies , food , and fuel .
To their credit , most state governments rejected the act .
A few adopted portions of it before a fervent opposition campaign caused the CDC to back off .
However , the concept of a health dictatorship has n’t gone away .
Not hardly .
Within days of the news that a new strain of swine flu had arisen in Mexico in April 2009 , states were again considering legislation to give themselves martial - law powers in event of an epidemic .
And what of the dozens and dozens of federal agencies that now have SWAT teams ?
Seriously , what justifies the Bureau of Land Management or the Department of Housing and Urban Development having paramilitary units ?
Now maybe you like the idea of an Army that watches over its own citizens .
Maybe it makes sense to have a government seize total dictatorial power in event of a health emergency .
Maybe you believe SWAT teams will never be used except against bad guys .
But do you really trust these people ?
After all , these are the same folks , and this is the same mentality , that not only spent $ 325,000 to produce a souvenir photo of a presidential 747 zooming low over the Statue of Liberty , but ordered the New York Police Department , the FBI , the Secret Service , and the New York mayor ’s office not to tell the public .
Never mind that they realized full well that passenger jets and military planes plunging low over Manhattan would evoke panic .
Still , peace reigns .
Mostly .
At least here in North America .
But not everywhere .
Not long ago , France was brought to its knees by night after night of rioting .
In that country it ’s become almost common for workers to hold their bosses hostage in hopes of winning economic concessions .
Greece , too , saw its normal life and business shut down by days of rioting .
So did Iceland a country that ’s normally the picture of civility .
Can the U.S. be forever immune ?
It might not take much and it could be something out of the blue , something impossible to anticipate to set us against each other and against the “ Trust us ; we ’ll fix it ” political crowd .
In a way , this national silence on a matter so many people are afraid of is similar to the silence about general preparedness issues before 9 - 11 or Hurricane Katrina .
Only Mormons and us wingnuts spoke of preparedness way back when .
Since then , of course , advice on preparedness is mainstream and common .
In another sense , this silence is different .
Because when unrest finally erupts , it ’s not going to be us merely taking care of ourselves .
It ’s going to be “ us against them . ”
It might be workers against bosses .
Or the poor against bankers .
Or blacks against Hispanics .
Or little folk against Big Men in public office .
Or farmers against the USDA .
Or xenophobes against xenophiles .
But however it happens , the implications are n’t as Boy - Scoutish as just taking care of ourselves in an emergency .
Defining civil unrest
Look up “ preparations for civil unrest ” on Google and … What ’s that echo I hear ?
you ’ll find nothing that ’s going to help you .
In fact , you wo n’t even easily turn up a good definition of what civil unrest is .
Like “ indecency , ” the definition seems to be in the eye of the beholder .
I would n’t consider a peaceful anti-war march to be civil unrest , for instance , but a police chief might .
Similarly , I would n’t consider acts of localized non-violent lawbreaking ( like environmental activists chaining themselves to a tree ) to be civil unrest ; but a timber company official probably believes otherwise .
Civil unrest occurs when anger , frustration , or fear turn disruptive on a mass scale .
Or when government officials crack down because they anticipate such disruptions .
Crackdowns can lead to further frustration , leading to further crackdowns and so onespecially when the crackdowns look unwarranted and tyrannical .
In other words , civil unrest can arise from the anger of people or the folly of government or both together .
Anger over an unpopular policy , a new war , a collapse of the currency , panic over a pandemic , a food shortage , a bank runanything like that could cause civil unrest , especially in a population that ’s already on edge and no longer trusts its authority figures .
Another thing you wo n’t find via Google is how various types or levels of unrest are likely to affect us and how we should respond , if we ’re affected .
Again , although the men and women at the top are quite concerned for their own sakes , they ( and their media mouthpieces ) would rather not talk about what we should do in event of civil panic .
But that ’s not good enough for we independent - minded people , is it ?
Here are my definitions of levels of civil unrest and a little bit about how they might affect us :
LEVEL ONE :
The lowest level of civil unrest is when people turn on their own neighborhoods as happened during the race riots of the 1960s and the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles .
Level
One civil unrest can be deadly and destructive , but primarily to people who live , work , or must travel in the immediate area .
Level
One unrest is spontaneous , Dionysian , is confined to a narrow geographical zone where the protestors live .
Police response may be harsh , but it ’s localized .
Unless you ’re in the middle of it , you ’re unaffected .
LEVEL TWO : Level
Two civil unrest may also be focused on a single area .
But in this case , rioters or protesters have deliberately targeted a business district , a facility , a transportation system , or an organization to impose maximum disruption .
One example : the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle in 1999 ; young people with violence in mind and rage in their hearts attacked an entire downtown , affecting hundreds of businesses and tens of thousands of workers who hardly knew what hit them .
Another example :
This spring , protesters in Thailand shut down the Bangkok airport , affecting who knows how many individuals and businesses .
Level
Two unrest is usually planned or semi-planned .
The target is chosen deliberately .
Although still focused in one area , Level Two can disrupt normal life and business in a whole region or country .
LEVEL THREE : Level
Three comes when mass unrest or authoritarian crackdown causes disruption at state or regional level .
Then , no matter what the original cause or location of the trouble , everyone in the region is affected .
Effects might include travel restrictions , random ID checks , mass arrests , food and fuel rationing , controls on money and banking , roadblocks , and other harsh “ emergency ” restrictions .
LEVEL FOUR : Level Four is Level Three but on a national or even international scale .
It ’s martial law .
If things ever get this bad , it ’s likely that the government itself will be a far bigger threat to everyone ’s well being than whatever the original cause of the clampdown was .
And of course , any level of civil unrest can lead to laws , regulations , and harsher police policies that end up affecting everybody in the long run .
Yes , it can involve us
We make a mistake if we think civil unrest is strictly an urban phenomena .
It can happen anywhere .
When 400 government agents and soldiers descended on one isolated family in the Idaho mountains , the roadblocks , helicopters , Humvees , media presence , and furious protestors surrounded the Randy Weaver family and brought the normal life of Boundary County , Idaho , to a halt .
The siege against the Branch Davidian church in Waco , Texas , was n’t conducted in the inner-city , either .
Yet both of these were large scale catastrophes with all the hallmarks of civil unrestindividuals or groups resisting , government insisting .
I can easily envision strictly rural - based unrest that urban dwellers will never even hear about ( except perhaps in highly distorted reports ) .
What happens , for instance , if farmers , 4H families , owners of saddle horses , and holders of small chicken flocks decide to resist en masse the National Animal Identification System ( NAIS ) ?
It ’s easy to imagine , in these crazy days , USDA SWAT teams descending on the countryside to make arrests , forcibly register or destroy non-compliant animals , and burn down non-registered facilities .
The future could see rural resistance to invasive census - taking , forced vaccination programs , land takings , water - rights policies , or the destruction of herds for real or bogus health reasons .
As country people increasingly see governments as foreign organizations driven by the interests of city dwellers , pharmaceutical companies , and mega - agri - business , it would n’t surprise me .
If we ever have serious food shortages , expect rural areas to be besieged .
Even when civil unrest confines itself to the cities , airports , or highways it can affect us in crazy ways .
Here ’s a funny example of unpredictable ( in this case mild ) consequences .
A friend was due to have her first book published in Canada .
She was very excited then disappointed when weeks dragged by and the book did n’t appear .
Turns out that a band of Indians was blocking a highway bridge the printer ’s truck had to cross .
The union truckers , in solidarity , refused to route around the protest .
Just one small consequence .
But you can see the unpredictability .
The simple truth is that we do n’t know what kinds of unrest to anticipate .
We do n’t know when , or if , we ’ll see civil unrest .
But thinking about the problem and preparing ourselves mentally and physically to deal with it should be just another aspect of our personal preparedness .
What we can do
1. Keep standard emergency preps up to date .
First thing to do is make sure all our typical household preparedness supplies and plans are current .
As BHM readers know , backup food , water , and other supplies are our mainstay for everything from bad storms to long - term unemployment , from power outages to social breakdowns .
During civil unrest , especially at Level Three or Four , we might not be able to get out to buy things we need or we might consider it more prudent to stay at home .
On the other hand , if we ourselves are part of the unrest , we may need those supplies to sit out a siege .
2 . Do n’t fall into foolish complacency .
We who live in the country tend to have an “ it ca n’t happen here ” attitude toward political violence or social upheaval .
We see those things as urban pheonomena .
And mostly , they are .
But there ’s no ironclad rule that says they have to be .
If anything disrupts the supply chain , for instance , rural areas could be the first to be cut off from food , medicines , fuel , or other necessities .
If government breaks down to the point where it ca n’t deliver food stamps , housing vouchers , social security , or bureaucrats ’ pay , the rural poor and unemployed could become just as restive as their urban counterparts .
3 . Watch your health .
As I write this , the airwaves are shrilling about swine flu .
This outbreak may fizzle ; after all , perfectly normal flu kills many every year without causing panic , martial law , or incessant media coverage .
On the other hand , it ’s certain that one day some illness will rampage across the globe .
Few things inspire public panic more quickly than contagious disease , and once again rural areas are not immune .
Take all the standard recommended precautions like frequent handwashing .
Make sure your preparedness kit includes surgical masks and disposable gloves as well as a selection of frequently updated medications .
And be ready to lay low at home for a long time in the event a serious plague gets loose .
4 . Make common cause with your neighbors .
I ’ve said it before , but establishing a strong bond with people in your community right now is vital to every sort of emergency preparedness .
In event of a Level One or Two emergency , these are the folks who could come to your house to make sure you ’re okay .
They might give you a ride out or a place to sleep if you accidentally end up in a “ hot zone ” of riot or protest .
In a deeper or more long - term emergency , they could pool resources with you to make supply runs .
They can advise you if they ’ve spotted a roadblock .
They might let you cross their land to avoid a route that has become dangerous .
5 . If you grow crops or raise food animals and the unrest is due to a food shortage ( or something has driven city people out into the countryside ) , prepare to protect your resources day and night .
Here again neighbors can do each other valuable services , like taking shifts guarding fields , barns , private roads , and gardens .
Yes , this is an apocalyptic scenario .
Not a likely one .
But if it happens , it ’s a Level Three or Level Four emergency delivered to your own front yard .
6 . Get advance word on local conditions when traveling .
We ’re used to hopping into our vehicles or onto airplanes and going wherever we want to go .
But as the worldwide economy deteriorates , it ’s wise to keep an eye on our destination .
Right now , this warning pertains more to overseas travel than jaunts within the U.S.
If you plan to go abroad , visit online sites like Travelfish.org .
They ’ll have bulletins about adverse conditions in areas you plan to visit ; you may even be able to receive alerts via email that will warn you about anything from political protests to disease outbreaks in places you plan to go .
7 . Watch for signs of trouble when in an unfamiliar area .
Sometimes the only advance notice you get is the notice your own senses give you .
When walking , driving , biking , or otherwise traveling in unfamiliar places , stay in what gunfolk call “ condition yellow . ”
This is different than the meaningless colored threat levels the Department of Homeland Security puts out .
It just means “ be alert ! ” Never simply allow yourself to slouch along obliviously .
Always be aware of who ’s nearby and what ’s going on around you .
If you spot trouble developing , turn .
Avoid it if at all possible .
8 . If you stumble into a “ hot zone ” of unrest , be prepared to think on your feet .
Not many people are qualified to give you advice about how to behave if you unavoidably find yourself in the midst of trouble a riot , a mass protest that suddenly engulfs your familiar downtown , a spot where police are bashing heads or hurling tear gas seemingly at random .
That ’s because not many people have ever been there and every catastrophe is different .
If street - level chaos surrounds you , do your best to keep a cool head , move away from the worst of it if you get the chance , and get inside if possible .
9 . If you ’re swept up in mass arrests during a riot or demonstration , the officers probably are n’t going to be listening to your protestations of being an innocent bystander .
You ’ll only tick them off and possibly get a charge of resisting arrest .
The best advice I ’ve received from my friends who ’ve been busted during out - of - hand protests :
Go along as best you can .
Usually , all charges in such cases are either dropped or reduced once calm is restored .
Only if we ’ve reached the extreme point where police are rounding people up and throwing them into detention camps or “ disappearing ” them is fighting cops on the street likely to be worth it ; then … fight like a demon .
10 .
Have a good lawyer and carry his or her card with you .
Once again , in the heat of chaos it may not do you much good .
But that card will come in handy later .
Besides , if you and a police officer have an encounter in calmer circumstances , a lawyer ’s card , along with your calm assertion of your legal rights , will help you to be taken seriously .
Police officers are like anybody else ; they ’re more likely to go after easy targets than ones who are obviously knowledgeable and prepared .
My lawyer has a helpful little list on the back of his card of the things you should do and not do when accosted by a police officer .
1
I ’d trust that more than my own nerves in a tight situation .
11 . Be careful of roadblocks .
This is a hard one .
If we reach Level Three or Four of unrest , we may not only see the obnoxious police “ checkpoints ” we ’re burdened with today .
We might also see two other things .
One would be expanded police roadblocks , with warrantless searches , harsh questioning , and possibly mass arrests .
Another could be “ freelance ” roadblocks roadblocks set up by anybody from political protesters to highwaymen .
( Just as gangs of home invaders now masquerade as SWAT teams , highwaymen might masquerade as government officials to rob the unwary . )
If it ’s humanly possible , avoid roadblocks .
It ’s not illegal to turn away from them , as long as you do n’t disobey any traffic laws .
Police do consider it suspicious behavior and may come after you , even if you ’ve done nothing wrong ; but in a time of civil unrest , avoiding a roadblock could save your skin .
Of course , both police and freelancers will set up their blockades to make them as hard as possible to avoidall the more reason to be alert , know where roadblocks are likely to be , and have a mental map of alternate routes .
If , in a time and place of unrest , you ’re in a line approaching a roadblock , watch what happens to the people ahead of you .
If you see any sign that the motorists ahead are being abused , get out of there .
So far , we ’ve talked mostly as if civil unrest is something apart from us something we might have to be wary of , something we might stumble accidentally into .
But the fact is that as our country becomes less free , we might of course be the civil unrest .
We might resist having our premises tagged for NAIS or having our herds slaughtered for real or bogus health reasons .
We might end up fighting evictions ( as farmers and many rural dwellers have for centuries during hard times ) .
We might be the ones who say , “ Hell no , we wo n’t go ! ” when the mobile vaccination van comes to town , or the ones who try to keep our neighbors from being rounded up and sent to camps .
Times are uncertain .
We simply do n’t know .
But in every case , preparedness , foreknowledge , and a cool head will come in handy .
Some of us already have lines in the sand that would inspire us to resist abuses of authority .
And that , right there , is something our would - be masters fearour disobedience .
What will happen ?
And when ?
Nobody has a crystal ball .
But the combination of public frustration and governmental apprehension is an explosive one .
Someday , somebody will light the match .
1 Here ’s the copy on the lawyer ’s card ( capitalization his ) :
IF YOU ARE ARRESTED OR CONFRONTED BY THE POLICE : 1 . FIRST , ask to call your lawyer .
2 . Be courteous ; do not resist .
3 . Do not consent to search or entry .
4 . Do not talk about anything ; do not admit OR DENY anything .
5 . Ask if you are free to go .
If you are , GO .
I ’ve had several different lawyer ’s cards over the years that say similar , but slightly different things .
Another great source of information on how to handle yourself when confronted by police is the DVD Busted : The Citizen ’s Guide to Surviving Police Encounters .
It ’s great because it shows very realistic scenarios and coaches you vividly on how to navigate them .

New York 's attorney general says that Tagged.com stole the identities of more than 60 million internet users worldwide - by sending emails that raided their private accounts .
Andrew Cuomo said he plans to sue the social networking website for deceptive marketing and invasion of privacy .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" This company stole the address books and identities of millions of people , " Cuomo said in a statement .
" Consumers had their privacy invaded and were forced into the embarrassing position of having to apologise to all their email contacts for Tagged 's unethical - and illegal - behaviour . "
Started in 2004 by Harvard math students Greg Tseng and Johann Schleier - Smith , Tagged calls itself a " premier social - networking destination . "
The California - based company claims to be the third - largest social networking site after Facebook and MySpace , with 80 million registered users .
Cuomo said Tagged acquired most of them fraudulently , sending unsuspecting recipients emails that urged them to view private photos posted by friends .
The message read : " ( name of friend ) sent you photos on Tagged . "
When recipients tried to access the photos , Cuomo said they would in effect become new members of the site - without ever seeing any photos .
Recipients ' email address books would then be lifted , the attorney general said .
Tagged temporarily suspended its online campaign last month , in response to user complaints .
Email and telephone messages to the company were not immediately returned .
" This very virulent form of spam is the online equivalent of breaking into a home , stealing address books , and sending phony mail to all of an individual 's personal contacts , " Cuomo said .
The system was set up so that a user was asked whether the sender of the photos was a friend , then suggesting that if the recipient did n't respond , the friend " may think you said no " ( accompanied by a sad face icon ) .
Any click resulted in the same thing , Cuomo said : Every person on a user 's contact list received an email that again read , " ( name of user ) sent you photos on Tagged . "
The site then released a flood of offers for everything from sweepstakes to other services .
By the time a recipient realised there were no photos , it was too late .
Yesterday , a box on the site 's home page still read : " NOW HIRING ... click here . "
The attorney general said a lawsuit would seek to stop Tagged from engaging in " fraudulent practices " and to seek fines .
The Haiku alpha release has always been a bit elusive .
The project has been near the alpha release for a while now , but a number of difficult data - destructive bugs kept it at bay .
After an informal coding sprint , the alpha is now just a decision away .
Several key Haiku developers came together last week for an unofficial coding sprint .
During this sprint , they made major headway in a vast array of aspects of the Haiku operating system , such as improving the HID driver , file system problems , and many other things .
They also discussed the almost mythical first alpha release of the project , and concluded that nothing is really stopping this release from materialising .
This is what they had to say about it :
We have talked about it a lot and I am happy to report that we do n’t consider any remaining issue serious enough to hold it back any longer .
We just do n’t know what to do with the IDE versus ATA stack .
On the one hand , the ATA stack does n’t have some problems of the older IDE stack , but Michael himself said that the new ATA stack is actually slower .
And then it has some new problems of its own .
Tough call , but as soon as we have made up our mind , I think we are good to go !
Exciting times !
This means that the alpha release is now tantalizingly close .
These are indeed exciting times for the Haiku project , which has been underway for a very long time now , never doing any form of an official release .
The project is quite careful with giving users the wrong impression , and they do n’t want to give people the wrong idea about the project ’s current state .
As soon as an alpha release has indeed made its way onto the web , I can guarantee you I ’ll be doing a little celebration dance .
Here ’s to hoping they get the IDE vs. ATA issue worked out quickly !
A small snippet in today ’s NZZ newspaper made me aware of this incident :
Eight Papuan men have been arrested over a deadly ambush on a security convoy near the giant Freeport gold and copper mine in Indonesia ’s Papua province , police said Tuesday .
I really did n’t know one bit about West Papua , except for a few pictures I had in mind from anthropological documentaries about the region .
So I decided to read up on the story and found another saddening example of how corporate greed and recklessness work to destroy the environment of the most valuable landscapes and the lives of the people living there along with it .
It all started when West Papua – a former colony of the Netherlands – was handed to the UN under The New York Agreement in 1962 and then to Sukarno ’s Indonesia following a referendum , the Act of Free Choice , now known as one that was stacked , and railroaded by Indonesian interests .
( more about this here )
Once the Act of Free Choice had taken place , the extraction of oil once again got going and the copper already discovered in the Carsztens mountains before the war could be exploited under the more stable conditions of the Soeharto administration by the American mining company Freeport .
This constituted a rich source of income for the Indonesian treasury and for the elite in Jakarta , insofar as the latter was involved in the management and central administration of the company .
The positive effects on the local economy remained negligible , however ; the disadvantages , in the form of pollution and land loss , were therefore all the greater .
The Papuan population is one of the poorest groups in Indonesia .

This is where the July 2009 attacks have their roots .
First of all Mining in rainforests has a devastating effect on the environment of the region and thus on its people .
Secondly there is a huge amount of money to be made and there is no way to reconcile the two .
Freeport mines 78,000 tonnes of ore / day , plus additional overburden .
Virtually all of this is dumped as mine waste and tailings into the rivers surrounding Freeport , making the water toxic and thick with silt , smothering and killing all plant life along the previously fertile river banks .
( Other mines like Bougainville and Ok Tedi in PNG have had similar effects ) .
The Komoro people in the Koperapoke area have been ordered to stop consuming sago , their staple food .
Freeport has distributed 78 drums to families to catch rainwater for drinking since the water has been contaminated .
Plans to expand Freeport ’s operations within a recently granted additional 2.6 million hectare concession causes great concern for other communities and their environment .
( read more )
Freeport is aware of the rising concerns about the devastating environmental and social effects of its operations .
Even some of Freeport ’s investors are worrying , but the company will not answer to requests of information .
In a hair - raising story in 2005 the New York Times outlines the practices of Freeport in their endeavour to exploit the riches of West Papua including spying , bribery and setting up ineffective fig leave funds for the Papuan people .
The closest most people will ever get to remote Papua , or the operations of Freeport - McMoRan , is a computer tour using Google Earth to swoop down over the rain forests and glacier - capped mountains where the American company mines the world ’s largest gold reserve .
With a few taps on a keyboard , satellite images quickly reveal the deepening spiral that Freeport has bored out of its Grasberg mine as it pursues a virtually bottomless store of gold hidden inside .
They also show a spreading soot - colored bruise of almost a billion tons of mine waste that the New Orleans - based company has dumped directly into a jungle river of what had been one of the world ’s last untouched landscapes .
What is far harder to discern is the intricate web of political and military ties that have helped shield Freeport from the rising pressures that other gold miners have faced to clean up their practices .
Only lightly touched by a scant regulatory regime , and cloaked in the protection of the military , Freeport has managed to maintain a nearly impenetrable redoubt on the easternmost Indonesian province as it taps one of the country ’s richest assets .

Just because the NYT ’s story is five years old , does n’t mean things have changed for the better since then .
Just take a look at Freeport ’s website .
Freeport - McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. ’s Second - Quarter and Six -Month 2009
Results do n’t show any departure from the practices mentioned in the NYT story .
The Indonesian mining , namely the Grasberg mine , is still a growing project .
No word on environmental measures .
The fact , that in the above mentioned incident Freeport employees were victims of the attack along with Indonesian police suggests that nothing much has changed in the “ special relationship ” between the company and the Indonesian security forces as well .
Trust the Indonesian government , however , to make the best of the attacks mentioned above .
Concerned that West Papua might go the way of East Timor and gain sovereignty over its own riches , they deployed anti-terror troops to the region .

Years ago , as the Cold War was coming to an end , I said to my fellow leaders around the globe : the world is on the cusp of great events , and in the face of new challenges all of us will have to change , you as well as we .
For the most part , the reaction was polite but sceptical silence .
In recent years , I have often told listeners that I feel Americans need their own change - a perestroika , not like the one in my country , but an American perestroika - and the reaction has been markedly different .
Halls filled with thousands of people have responded with applause .
Some have reacted with understanding .
Others have objected , sometimes sarcastically , suggesting that I want the United States to experience upheaval , just like the former Soviet Union .
In my country , particularly caustic reactions have come from the opponents of perestroika , people with short memories and a deficit of conscience .
Our perestroika signalled the need for change in the Soviet Union , but it was not meant to suggest a capitulation to the US model .
Today , the need for a more far - reaching perestroika - one for America and the world - has become clearer than ever .
The need for change in the Soviet Union in the mid-1980s was urgent .
The country was stifled by a lack of freedom , and the people - particularly the educated class - wanted to break the stranglehold of a system that had been built under Stalin .
Archaeologists from the University of Toronto prepare a tablet for removal from a 2,700 - year old temple in southeastern Turkey .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Excavations led by a University of Toronto archaeologist at the site of a recently discovered temple in southeastern Turkey have uncovered a cache of cuneiform tablets dating back to the Iron Age period between 1200 and 600 BCE .
Found in the temple 's cella , or ' holy of holies ' , the tablets are part of a possible archive that may provide insights into Assyrian imperial aspirations .
" The assemblage appears to represent a Neo - Assyrian renovation of an older Neo- Hittite temple complex , providing a rare glimpse into the religious dimension of Assyrian imperial ideology , " says Timothy Harrison , professor of near eastern archaeology in the Department of Near & Middle Eastern Civilizations and director of U of T's Tayinat Archaeological Project ( TAP ) .
" The tablets , and the information they contain , may possibly highlight the imperial ambitions of one of the great powers of the ancient world , and its lasting influence on the political culture of the Middle East . "
The cella also contained gold , bronze and iron implements , libation vessels and ornately decorated ritual objects .
Partially uncovered in 2008 at Tell Tayinat , capital of the Neo-Hittite Kingdom of Palastin , the structure of the building where the tablets were found preserves the classic plan of a Neo - Hittite temple .
It formed part of a sacred precinct that once included monumental stelae carved in Luwian ( an extinct Anatolian language once spoken in Turkey ) hieroglyphic script , but which were found by the expedition smashed into tiny shard - like fragments .
" Tayinat was destroyed by the Assyrian king Tiglath - pileser III in 738 BCE , and then transformed into an Assyrian provincial capital , equipped with its own governor and imperial administration , " says Harrison .
" Scholars have long speculated that the reference to Calneh in Isaiah 's oracle against Assyria alludes to Tiglath - pileser 's devastation of Kunulua - ie , Tayinat .
The destruction of the Luwian monuments and conversion of the sacred precinct into an Assyrian religious complex may represent the physical manifestation of this historic event . "
The temple was later burned in an intense fire and found filled with heavily charred brick and wood which , ironically , contributed to the preservation of the finds recovered from its inner chambers .
" While those responsible for this later destruction are not yet known , the remarkable discoveries preserved in the Tayinat temple clearly record a pivotal moment in its history , " says Harrison .
" They promise a richly textured view of the cultural and ethnic contest that has long characterized the turbulent history of this region . "
TAP is an international project , involving researchers from a dozen countries , and more than 20 universities and research institutes .
It operates in close collaboration with the Ministry of Culture of Turkey , and provides research opportunities and training for both graduate and undergraduate students .
The project is funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and the Institute for Aegean Prehistory ( INSTAP ) , and receives support from the University of Toronto

The renowned Shelby Daytona CSX2000 series Coupe won the World Manufacturers Championship back in 1965 and has since risen to legend status .
In today ’s market , these rare cars fetch millions of dollars at auction .
However , most people do n’t make enough money over the course of a lifetime to afford one of these classics , not to mention the fact that there are so few original vehicles in circulation .
Because there is such a strong interest in this iconic car , Shelby Distribution USA is providing an updated , modern interpretation known as the Shelby Cobra Daytona Coupe MKII at a more affordable price ( for some . )
This second generation model , designated the CSX 9000 series , will be listed in the Shelby World Registry , which will immediately make it a collectible .
Signature Shelby door handles , seat covers and Shelby brakes all help keep the dream alive .
This new edition features more modern comfort and conveniences than its historical counterpart including more leg and head room , external door handles , electric windows and an added quarter vent style window .
The climate controls are operated via servo units and now have no cables .
Performance tweaks come in the form of better engine and oil cooling capabilities , a new front and rear independent suspension , updated front and rear anti-roll bars , a stiffer chassis and new fuel tank with internal baffles .
The side - mounted muffler pipes are fatter and have a lower rumble .
In addition , the wheel wells are now deeper to fit 18 inch Shelby Cobra style wheels .
Production of the new Shelby Cobra Daytona Coupe MKII will be limited to just two units per month .
The car will be available with either a fiber glass body for $ 89,900 or an aluminum body offered at $ 195,900 .
However , you will still need to ante up for whatever engine and transmission you choose , as the price of the CSX 9000 does not includes the power train .

One hundred and fifty years ago on Aug. 27 , Colonel Edwin L. Drake sunk the very first commercial well that produced flowing petroleum .
The discovery that large amounts of oil could be found underground marked the beginning of a time during which this convenient fossil fuel became America 's dominant energy source .
But what began 150 years ago wo n't last another 150 years — or even another 50 .
The era of cheap oil is ending , and with another energy transition upon us , we 've got to scavenge all the lessons we can from its remarkable history .
" I would see this as less of an anniversary to note for celebration and more of an anniversary to note how far we 've come and the serious moment that we 're at right now , " said Brian Black , an energy historian at Pennsylvania State University and and author of the book Petrolia .
" Energy transitions happen and I argue that we 're in one right now and that we need to aggressively look to the future to what 's going to happen after petroleum . "
When Drake and others sunk their wells , there were no cars , no plastics , no chemical industry .
Water power was the dominant industrial energy source .
Steam engines burning coal were on the rise , but the nation 's energy system — unlike Great Britain's — still used fossil fuels sparingly .
The original role for oil was as an illuminant , not a motor fuel , which would come decades later .
Before the 1860s , petroleum was a well - known curiosity .
People collected it with blankets or skimmed it off naturally occurring oil seeps .
Occasionally they drank some of it as a medicine or rubbed it on aching joints .
Some people had the bright idea of distilling it to make fuel for lamps , but it was easier to get lamp fuel from pig fat or whale oil or converted coal .
Without a steady supply , there was no point in developing a whole system and infrastructure dedicated to petroleum .
Nonetheless , some Yankee capitalists from Connecticut were convinced that oil could be found in the ground and exploited .
They recruited " Colonel " Edwin Drake , who was not a Colonel at all , mostly because he was charming and unemployed .
He , in turn , found someone skilled in the art of drilling , or what passed for it in those days .
Drake and his sidekick " Uncle Billy " Smith started looking underground for oil in the spring of ' 59 .
They used a heavy metal tip attached to a rope , sending it plummeting down the borehole like a ram to break up the rock .
It was slow going .
On Aug. 27 , 1859 , at 69 feet of depth , Drake and Smith hit oil .
It was a big deal , but the Civil War stalled the immediate development of the rock oil industry .
" When the discovery happened , the few people who were there and not involved in the war , went around and bought all the property they could and had outside investors come in , " Black said .
" But the real heyday of the development happened from 1864 - 1870 .
It 's that 11 - year period when the little river valley was the world 's leading supplier of oil . "
The " little river valley " in western Pennsylvania earned the nickname Petrolia .
Centered in the Oil Creek valley about one hundred miles north of Pittsburgh , the wells of Pithole , Titusville and Oil City pumped 56 million barrels of oil out of the ground from 1859 to 1873 .
Suddenly , rock oil was everywhere .
And cheap .
Whale oil had always been a bit precious .
A three to five year voyage would only yield a few thousand gallons of the stuff .
In 1866 , after the end of the Civil War , 3.6 million barrels poured out of the region .
Daniel Yergin notes in his history of oil , The Prize , that as more people poured into the oil regions " supply outran demand " and soon the whiskey barrels that held the oil " cost almost twice as much as the oil inside them . "
Still , fortunes were being made and lost .
Not just money , but energy , was flowing from underground .
Some have estimated that for every unit of energy you invested sinking a well , you got back " more than 100 times as much usable energy .
Oil , people soon found , was uniquely convenient .
To equal get the amount of energy in a tank of gasoline , you need 200 pounds of wood .
Pair that energy density with stability under most conditions ( meaning it did n't randomly explode ) , and that , as a liquid , it was easy to transport , and you have the killer app for the infrastructure age .
In a world that only had a tiny fraction of the amount of heat , light , and power available that we do now , people came up with all kinds of ideas for what to do with oil 's energy : cars , tractors , airplanes , chemicals , fertilizer , and plastic .
Perhaps it 's not a surprising consequence of this innovation that at current consumption levels , Americans would blow through all the oil ever produced in Petrolia in less than three days .
The scale of the oil industry is astounding , but it 's becoming clear the world 's oil supply will peak soon , or perhaps has peaked already .
People quibble about the details , but no one argues that oil will play a much different role in our energy system in 50 years than it did in 1959 .
The search for alternatives is on .
If that search goes poorly — as some Peak Oil analysts predict — human civilization will fall off an energy cliff .
The amount of energy we get back from drilling oil wells in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico continues to drop , and alternative sources do n't provide usable energy for humans on the generous terms that oil long has .
But humans with an economic incentive to be optimistic become optimists , and the harder we look , the more possible alternatives we find .
The big question now is whether the cure for our oil addiction will come with a heavy carbon side effect .
" Peak oil and peak gas and coal could really go either way for the climate , " Pushker Kharecha , a scientist with NASA 's Global Institute for Space Studies , said at least year 's American Geophysical Union meeting .
" It all depends on choices for subsequent energy sources . "
Over the next 20 years , synthetic fuels made from coal or shale oil could conceivably become the fuels of the future .
On the other hand , so could advanced biofuels from cellulosic ethanol or algae .
Or the era of fuel could end and electric vehicles could be deployed in mass , at least in rich countries .
With the massive injection of stimulus and venture capital money into alternative energy that 's occurred over the past few years , the solutions for replacing oil could already be circulating among the labs and office parks of the country .
To paraphrase technology pundit Clay Shirky talking about the media , nothing will work to replace oil , but everything might .
If history tells us anything , it 's that energy sources can change , never tomorrow , but always some day .
" What is required is to operate without fear and to take energy transitions on as a developmental opportunity , " Black said .

After my post about people ’s fondness for other people ’s partners , ( “ Do Single Women Seek Attached Men ? ” ) , more than 300 Lab readers weighed in with their anecdotes and theories .
Now here ’s some more guidance from the expert who coined the term for this practice : mate poaching .
David Buss , a professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin , is the author of many books , including the “ Evolution of Desire , ” the 1994 book that introduced the term “ mate poaching , ” and the forthcoming “ Why Women Have Sex , ” co-written with Cindy Meston .
His paper with Dr. Meston about the 237 reasons for having sex inspired a most lively discussion here at the Lab last year .
Dr. Buss told me that he tried to come up with a less pejorative term than “ mate poaching ” but was n’t able to find one .
Here ’s his reaction to the debate that ’s been going on at the Lab , along with some findings about men who poach :
John Tierney ’s piece on mate poaching clearly struck a powerful chord , evoking an amazing array of excellent insights and personal experiences .
As someone who has published on the topic in articles and in books , I thought I ’d add my two cents to the discussion .
A couple important distinctions are worth introducing .
The first is the distinction between poaching for short - term sexual encounters versus poaching for more committed mateships .
The first scientific study of mate poaching ( Schmitt & Buss , 2001 ) found that substantially more men ( 60 % ) than women ( 38 % ) admitted to having attempted to poach an already mated person for a sexual encounter .
The sex difference was smaller for long - term mate poaching , but still present — 60 % of the men and 53 % of the women .
Similar sex differences have been discovered in the most massive cross-cultural study of mate poaching ever conducted [ by my colleague David Schmitt ] , which involved 16,954 participants from 53 different countries .
So although the study reported by Tierney highlighted the interesting finding for single women , available evidence suggests that men are more likely than women to mate poach , or more likely to admit to it , a sex difference especially pronounced for sexual liaisons .
Abhorrent though it may be judged , mate poaching is clearly one strategy in the arsenal of human mating strategies .
And given the reputational damage a mate poacher can incur , its prevalence is undoubtedly underreported .
Many do n’t interpret their actions as “ mate poaching . ”
Some just think “ we fell in love with each other ” or “ we were just acting on our mutual sexual attraction ” or “ he wanted to leave her anyway . ”
The nature of the human mating system matters .
Although we have a presumptively monogamous mating system , it ’s not “ effectively ” monogamous .
Rarely do modern humans mate with one and only one person for their entire lifespan .
Premarital mateships , mate switching , and divorce are all common , as are affairs .
Nor was total monogamy characteristic of most human cultures across the globe .
The cross-cultural record reveals that 83 % of cultures practiced some form of polygyny ( one male with two or more wives ) .
In these cultures , single women are often attracted to mated men , and it ’s often not considered mate poaching .
Single women in these cultures typically find mated men with high status , resources , and a wife or two more attractive than single men who lack the status or desirability to attract a mate .
Women ’s sexual psychology evolved in the context of a mating system with some polygyny .
Modern women have inherited the sexual psychology of their successful ancestral mothers .
They carry with them an attraction for men who have demonstrated an ability to attract other women .
Mate poachers use an array of tactics to implement their strategy , ranging from derogating the partner ( e.g. , “ She ’s not good enough for you ; you deserve someone who treats you better . . . like me ” ) to showcasing desirable qualities that the current mate lacks .
Some mate poachers just want sex .
Some want commitment .
And some use a “ bait - and - switch ” tactic of seeming to offer costless sex , and then becoming more emotionally enmeshed until the man wakes up one day and realizes that he can’t live without her .
We may not like the tactics , but sometimes they work and sometimes they end up in successful unions .
Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt seem to have a pretty good relationship .
I welcome your reactions to Dr. Buss ’s observations .
Angelina and Brad are both invited to comment either about the theory of mate poaching or about their own experiences — including the perpetual ( and so far baseless ) rumors that their relationship is on the rocks .
( One note about the male - female differences in mate poaching .
In my previous post , I cited a study at Oklahoma State University that found single women showed special interest in men who were already romantically involved with someone else .
Those findings do n’t necessarily contradict the results cited by Dr. Buss .
( Like Dr. Buss , the Oklahoma State researchers found that men were more likely than women to be interested in pursuing someone who was already attached .
But the men in the Oklahoma State study were also more likely than the women to be interested in pursuing someone who was n’t attached .
The guys were more interested than the women in pursuing any partners .
It did n’t make a significant difference to the men in the study , or to the women in the study who were already in relationships , whether a potential partner was already attached to someone else .
But the potential partner ’s romantic status did make a significant difference to the single women in the study , because they were more likely to be interested in a man if he was attached than if he was n’t . )
water fluoridation .
The decision effectively bans all processed food products from countries such as the USA , Australia and New Zealand , unless they can be positively proven to have been prepared using only water that was not fluoridated .
What does this mean for water undertakers who fluoridate their product ?
Before British water undertakers allow Strategic Health Authorities to order them to start fluoridating their water they need to be fully aware of the implications to them and their shareholders should they agree to do so .
Not only are medical damages compensation claims likely to be far higher , with charges of negligently supplying an unlawful product forming the basis of class actions , food processors who lose their markets will certainly hold their water undertaker accountable in law for their losses .
This ruling means that Courts in other member states of the EC must support demands from competing food processors that an embargo be placed on British and Irish products unless they can be proven to have been manufactured using only non-fluoridated water .
I have previously warned that this illegal product substitution cannot be permitted to continue , and that members of the public are entirely entitled to demand to be supplied with water that complies with , and is regulated under , the drinking water quality standards that are enforceable under both EC and UK ( and Irish ) law .
Since the ruling must be enforced in all EC member states , water companies will now have to come off the fence and accept that fluoridated water is not an acceptable alternative drinking water .
The only way out - repeal all fluoridation laws and ban the product .
This decision completely supports the challenge that I have issued repeatedly to the UK Regulator , the MHRA - identify the case law that justifies your perverse claim that this product is not a medicine .
Ironically , it was the MHRA itself that finally gave the game away , in a formal response to another Regulator , the Advertising Standards Authority ( ASA ) .
In what I can only assume was a deliberate attempt to mislead the ASA , the MHRA actually cited this case in support of its continued perverse refusal to implement the medicines legislation that it is obliged to enforce !
The beginning of the end - fluoridation must now be banned , worldwide .
This ECJ ruling effectively puts the final nail in the coffin of water fluoridation , not only within the EC but worldwide .
It establishes a very substantial but entirely justified obstacle to trade in food products that are prepared without proper regard to the protection of the public that is enshrined in law .
The ruling must be recognised and enforced not only in every member state , but also in any external state that wishes to trade with the EC in processed foods .
So just what can be done to resolve the present unacceptable situation ?
One solution would be to grant a medicinal licence to fluoridated water .
But the Court ruled that any evaluation of a functional drink may only be done under the rigorous procedures required to scrutinise any pharmaceutical product .
In the present state of scientific concern over the evidence of its lack of efficacy and safety it is impossible to imagine that such a licence could ever be granted .
If it were , it would immediately result in a world - wide denunciation from the scientific community that is fully aware of the improper commercial influence that is at the heart of the international promotion of fluoridated products .
The only acceptable response is to call a halt to this controversial practice now .
The experience of the past half century has shown that it is completely unjustified - indeed , it is responsible for what may reasonably be described as a pandemic of avoidable chronic fluoride poisoning .
In ruling that this type of product must be regulated under medicinal law , the Court has taken the final step towards bringing this disreputable practice to a long - delayed end .
Let us hope that national Governments all over the world will heed this decision - the economic consequences will be dire for those who continue to attempt to continue this discredited and illegal practice .

A wolf hunt is set to begin in Idaho on Tuesday if a federal judge does not stop it .
It would be the first time in decades that hunters have been allowed to pursue the gray wolf , an animal that has come to symbolize tensions over how people interact with wilderness in the West .
On Monday , the judge , Donald W. Molloy of Federal District Court , will hold a hearing to determine whether to issue an injunction sought by wildlife advocates against the hunt and reopen the question of returning the wolf to the endangered list .
Gray wolves were taken off the list five months ago , after being protected under federal law for more than 30 years .
More than 6,000 hunters in Idaho have bought licenses for the chance to participate in the hunt , in which wildlife officials will allow 220 wolves to be killed .
In 2008 , the population stood at about 850 .
Montana will allow 75 animals to be killed , starting Sept. 15 .
The states ’ hunts will be over when the limit is reached or when the season ends , which is Dec. 31 in most areas .
On the border between Thailand and Cambodia , a mighty battle is taking place – and the outcome will determine whether millions of people live or die .
If the right side falters and fails , the long list of the dead will consist overwhelmingly of children and pregnant women .
But this fight is passing virtually unnoticed in the outside world .
Why ?
Because the lives at stake are – initially , at least – " only " " those of Asians and black Africans .
The war is against a tiny parasite that is suddenly – and rapidly – stripping away our ability to treat one of the deadliest diseases known to man .
If the war fails , we will be left defenceless before it .

Malaria is already the biggest killer in the world after Aids and tuberculosis .
It infects 250 million people a year – the vast majority in Africa – and kills 1.5 million of them .
In the Central African Republic last year , I met a woman the same age as me , 30 , who was stalking her village , howling and ripping at her hair .
She stopped long enough to tell me she had given birth to four children , and three had died spasming and shrieking of malaria .
Now her youngest baby had all the symptoms , and she could n't bear it .
" Why is this happening ?
Why ? " she kept yelling , to herself , to the sky , to no one .
It is caused by a parasite carried in the saliva of female mosquitoes .
Once they inject it into your blood with a bite , the parasite heads for your liver and slows your blood flow .
Within a few days , your organs fail .
This happens to an equivalent of seven jumbo jets full of children every day .
The great Polish war correspondent Ryszard Kapuscinski described what it feels like .
" The first signal of an imminent malaria attack is a feeling of anxiety , which comes on suddenly and for no clear reason .
Something has happened to you , something bad , " he wrote .
Then comes " the dullness , the weakness , the heaviness ...
Everything is irritating .
First and foremost the light ; you hate the light .
But you do n't have a lot of time for these loathings .
For the attack arrives quickly .
It is a sudden , violent onset of cold .
Someone has taken you naked and thrown you into the icy highlands of Greenland . "
At this point , " You begin to tremble , quake , thrash about .
You immediately recognise , however , this is not a trembling you are familiar with ; these tremors and convulsions tossing you around are of a kind that at any moment now will tear you to shreds . "
He said it is like being imprisoned " inside a mountain of ice " and slowly crushed .
Up until this year , the world was making remarkable progress in whittling down this disease .
Since the year 2000 , seven of the worst afflicted countries in sub-Saharan Africa have slashed malaria deaths by 50 per cent .
It has a great knock - on effect too : for every £ 1 spent on malaria prevention , Africa gains £ 12 in economic growth , because people can work instead of lying sick and dying .
It was a sign that aid , matched by good African government , can produce inspirational results .
But then something began to change – at first imperceptibly – in the forgotten forests of Western Cambodia , where the Khmer Rouge held their last stand - off .
The drug that is most effective at treating malaria is called artemisinin : it shocks the parasite out of your system and saves your life .
But in south - east Asia , horrified doctors have discovered that the malaria parasite is becoming resistant to it .
In a Darwinian arms race , it has begun to evolve a way to beat the treatment .
It is taking twice as long to work – and soon it will have defeated the medicine altogether .
We have been here before .
In exactly the same place in the 1960s , the malaria parasite outraced the best available treatment of its day , choloroquine , and rendered it useless .
The new super - parasite then spread rapidly to Africa .
Across the map of the world , the ability to treat malaria was blacked out , region by region .
Nick Day , Professor of Tropical Medicine at the Mahidol Oxford Clinical Research Unit , working on the ground , says : " It caused millions of deaths .
If we let it happen again , we will face a major public health catastrophe . "
It took 20 years for another medicine as effective as choloroquine to be developed .
Millions of Africans died waiting .
If we lose artemisinin , we will face another deadly interlude – and given that pharmaceutical companies are doing virtually no work on diseases that afflict poor countries because there is no profit in it , it could last indefinitely .
Professor Day says : " There are no new malaria drugs coming down the pipeline .
There is nothing to replace them for the foreseeable future . "
The broken mother I saw in Central Africa would then be one of many , many more .
Nobody knows why Cambodia 's malaria parasites are such buffed - up hyper - Darwinian winners – the Mr Universe of the parasite world .
They have in the past rendered other treatments like SP and DDT far less effective by evolving resistance to them too .
Some scientists think it is because the treatments have been used there longer than anywhere else , giving their parasites a head - start .
But it is not inevitable that this super - malaria will spread to Africa and cull millions .
The scientists on the ground say we can contain them in Cambodia and prevent a disaster – if we act fast .
The scientists ' plan is simple .
It is to first of all massively suppress the spread of malaria in this area by a vast distribution of insecticide - treated mosquito nets , which have been shown to cut transmission by 80 per cent .
Then it is to ease the " drug pressure " on the parasite .
At the moment , heavy doses of artemisinin are pushing the malaria parasite to evolve fast .
So the scientists are drastically cutting the doses of artemisinin in the area , and complementing it with a cocktail of weaker malaria drugs that in combination can have some compensatory effect .
They calculate that this will reduce the evolutionary pressure on the parasite and make it revert back to type .
But Cambodia is a desperately poor country recovering from a genocide .
It is impossible for them to do it alone .
The World Health Organisation has stepped in with funding – but scientists are warning this project will require large and sustained funds .
The cost of not acting will be catastrophic for Africa – and , in time , we would all live to regret it .
One of the most frequently anticipated effects of global warming is a spreading of the parts of the world vulnerable to malaria .
The World Health Organisation has advised European governments and the Southern states of the US to take " urgent action " to prepare for " the spread of malaria " to its territory as warming accelerates .
If we are going to make the planet tropical , we had better start paying attention to tropical diseases .
But this is a moment for excitement as much as despair .
This is a chance to save the most precious medicine humanity has from destruction .
This is a chance to save millions of people from dying " in a mountain of ice " .
This is a chance to do something heroic – for Africa , and for our own future .
If we make this happen , we can be energised to keep on eradicating malaria , step - by - step , from the human condition : Dr Robert Koch has shown that for just $ 10 bn over five years , we could reduce deaths from the disease to a few thousand a year .
So will we seize the opportunity – or will we stand by , limp and passive , and wait for the advance of a super - charged killer ?
It is not true .
There is no ban .
African governments can still use DDT as much as they like .
Many use it in moderation for indoor spraying .
But they do not see it as a magic bullet , because it is less effective than other options , like insecticide - treated bednets , because mosquitoes have developed a significant degree of resistance to it , and because it can have dangerous side - effects , like contributing to premature births and killing off local fish populations .

His parents can recite the days from memory .
What parent could n't , for such watershed trauma in the life of a boy and his family .

On September 4 , 2008 , they found out he had a tumor in his brain .
He was in the intensive care unit , often screaming in pain , until September 13 , when he was transferred up to Unit 35 .
That stay lasted until September 18 .
He had the PICC line , a catheter he carries inside of him , inserted then .
Every time he comes back here , they plug it into something .
Sometimes it's an IV on a wheeled stand , dripping saline .
Other times , it 's feeding him chemicals - poison , fundamentally .
His dad , wearing jeans and a weather - beaten NBA Live 2003 t- shirt , pushes this rack , hand on his 7 - year - old son 's shoulder .
They are here , in Portland , Oregon , at The Children 's Hospital at Legacy Emanuel , to begin another battery of chemotherapy .
This time will be the " B " treatment in the cycle ; it makes the hair fall out .
And worse .
The pair enter a cheerfully painted room and sit down at a long counter .

They pick up Xbox controllers .
Lego Star
Wars fills the room with its cartoon explosions , jingling studs , babbling minifigs .
It 's 2:20 p.m. , August 4 , 2009 , and Joe Evans is , in this moment and for however long it lasts , having a normal childhood .
" We just hear the happiness , " Joe 's mom , Susan , 47 , says as Joe and his 10 - year - old brother , Will , tear through Lego Star Wars and Mario Kart on the GameCube .
" It 's a chance to have peace of mind , and for the little guy , it takes away , maybe , that knowledge of the poison going through him . "
More Than A Gift Of Games
Joe , his family , and the hospital are themselves one amongst the community served by Child 's Play which , in its three year existence , has emerged as something of the gamers ' charity .
Despite living a lifestyle often associated , by non-gamers , with basement - cloistered self - absorption , gamers have pitched in to the more than $ 1.4 $ 3 million donated since Child 's Play 's establishment in 2003 .
More than $ 18,000 worth of video games , consoles and peripherals have come to Emanuel Children 's Hospital since 2006 .
Advertisement
But the story does n't stop with the numbers , even though so often it does , typically during a routine mention of a fund drive , often during the holidays .
The games serve a therapeutic need that professional staff describe as increasingly critical .
The charity is a pipeline of donations that keep games free from the critical - needs scrum of a hospital foundation 's funding process .
The experience is more than entertainment or diversion for the patient - it provides a family activity , a way for children to support and be with siblings in circumstances frightening to them as well .
Advertisement
And though Joe Evans is just one gamer , and Emanuel Children 's is just one hospital , in many respects their story is representative of the more than 60 hospitals in the Child 's Play network , and of the thousands of patients who have received donations of video games and consoles over the past decade whatever their source .
The contribution may be a single $ 50 title , but the gift is actually something else .
" It gives them a time to just be a kid , which is really hard to do , sometimes , " said Jen Usinger , a child life specialist in Emanuel 's Child Life Program .
" An awful lot of their time here , they 're being poked and prodded , they go through surgery , or they 're sick and feeling horrible , and to get a moment and play video games , and just be a kid , is huge . "
Game Crazy Wednesdays And A Special Wii
Advertisement
In a sadly ironic way , perhaps nothing certifies video games as a childhood more than the Star Lounge of Emanuel Children 's Hospital , where the lives children lead during their stays are far from normal .
Here they enjoy " Game Crazy " every Wednesday night , playing Mario Kart or Super Smash Bros .
Brawl on the big screen TV .
That said , their gaming experience here is , likewise , not anything they 'd typically find at home .
In a room looking high over the Columbia River and downtown Portland , kids can come here if they want , whenever they want , as late as 10 pm .
The relaxed decoration and furniture arrangements , chill - out color schemes and a mini - theater with rolling easy - chair seating , do their best to wash that realization away .
Because outside , the reminders of what they can't do are plentiful .
" The boredom of being in here , and tied to that IV , with the PICC line in , is something not a lot of people can understand , " said Joe 's father , Pat , 47 .
The family is from nearby in Portland .
" Especially in the summer .
There 's no swimming , there 's no camping , none of the things the family usually does .
You can't have a lot of people around because of the fact his white - blood cell count [ which affects his immune system ] is low . "
Advertisement
With the purchase of a Wii for Christmas 2008 ( " I just could n't say no , " Pat said ) video games are now a significant part of the family 's life away from the hospital , moreso when Joe 's in it .
The Evanses have eight children ( two adult ) and four systems - Wii , Xbox , PlayStation and GameCube - and Christmas 2007 delivered three more Nintendo DSes , one of which Joe brings to the hospital .
And during that first stay in September 2008 , games became a talisman of life before the diagnosis .
" In the ICU , they had this roll - around cart with systems , and you could pick games to play from it , " Pat Evans said .
" Even though there could only be two people in his room at once with him , I 'd leave and bring one of the boys in , and they 'd play .
Advertisement
" When we came into the regular ward , here , it was just him and his brothers , and first thing , they wheeled him down here ( to the games lounge ) , with his IV in , " Pat says of his son , a typically shy youngster around others , but boisterous in the company of his family .
" Maybe it only lasted half an hour , but it was a big deal . "
Video games represent such normalcy for kids that , Usinger says , when they do n't want to play them while at the hospital , parents get concerned .
But more typically , Usinger said , a parent 's instinct is to believe that a sick or injured child should be bedridden and spending all of that time recuperating , not playing .
Helping Kids Cope

" Sometimes kids need to be kids , so that their body can heal and function as normal , " Usinger said .
" If we did n't have video games here , we'd be at a huge loss , especially with kids who are older or of middle school age .
It 's important that we meet them where they are in life . "

Usinger , who has been with Emanuel 's Child Life program for all of her career going back to 2001 , and is both a psychologist and trained specialist in her field , puts her job in the big picture .
" I help kids cope with being in the hospital , " she says , " and it 's a pretty big umbrella . "
Never in her studies at Eastern Oregon University did video games come up .
Mostly it was the psychology of a child being examined , injected or treated for the long term , and how to help him or her cope with it - a difficult enough preparation for an adult patient , let alone someone younger than 10 .
But Usinger recognizes the usefulness of familiarity , whatever it is .
Advertisement
" This is what kids do .
This is what teenagers do with their sedentary time , " Usinger said .
" They watch TV .
They play video games . "
Rare is the patient who does not play video games , she says - and in that case , the games the hospital does provide become a novelty , almost a bonus , in a long - term stay .
" In the beginning , we had about five Game Boys that patients could check out , and we had a couple Nintendo 64s for in - room use , " she said .
" Over time , from 2001 to now , there 's been a huge change in the use of video games , across the board .
It 's essential to have them now .
It 's a rarity that I 'd have a teen who wants to play a board game . "

The Star Lounge itself demonstrates the lengths the hospital goes to indulge its patients ' interests and hobbies , on their level .
This is where console gaming happens , where DVD parties take place , where group play on the Wii is organized .
Wednesday from 6:30 to 8 p.m. , the Wii is hooked to the lounge 's 60 - inch HD television set .
It 's , of course , an extremely popular console , so its usage is normally during group occasions .
There are only 14 Miis on the console , eight boys and six girls .
Putting a Mii on the console is unusual ; it 's only put in a child 's room if they 've spent a prolonged amount of time there or otherwise can't play in the Star Lounge .
Or sometimes , they may have it for special occasions - such as an end - of - chemo party .
Help For The Hospital

Emanuel Children 's Hospital got its
Wii in 2006 , shortly after its launch , and shortly after the hospital joined the Child 's Play network , in time for the holiday surge in donations .
Child 's Play , among benefactors , is perhaps uniquely attuned to its beneficiaries ' needs .
Both Usinger and Lynn Hallbacka , the Development Officer for the Emanuel Children 's Hospital Foundation , praise the fund for delivering titles that are n't merely functional and age - appropriate , they 're current , and ones their patients want to play .
It 's not to say that the hospital 's foundation would n't have the money to make such purchases for itself .
But having such things placed in the care of a third party — donors who know what they 're doing and give every year — frees the hospital to focus its attention on larger goals .
Advertisement
" Because our fund - raising department is not terribly large , if we did not have this relationship , I do n't think we'd be making a specific effort to solicit games , " said Hallbacka , who specified the Children 's Hospital foundation 's two major fundraising pitches as " hard dollars , and stuffed animals . "
Furthermore , the influx of Child 's Play donations keeps video games and entertainment outside of Emanuel Children 's Hospital 's budgetary process .
Like many hospitals , Emanuel Children 's is part of a larger system , and every year , all constituents submit grant proposals , which are prioritized and turned in for approval to an overall controlling board .
This year , Legacy Emanuel is in the process of building a new , $ 250 million children 's hospital building , the top priority across the entire system .
It 's hardly the time to be writing proposals for video games , which , no matter how small the dollar amount , could be trivialized or lost in the shuffle of the grant process .
Advertisement
" Given all of these other priorities , maybe these games would not be at the top of the list , " Hallbacka said .
The price tag and priority of normalcy is hard to quantify , much less put up for board review .
These games might provide bursts of it , everyday experiences in an otherwise traumatic chapter of life for child , mother and father .
Advertisement
But as grateful as she is for them , in the end Susan Evans hopes Joe 's time here becomes as nondescript and memoryless as the times we 've all had playing games growing up .
Because , really , among us who can remember exactly what we were playing when Mom or Dad told us to put down the controller and called us in for dinner , or to scrub up , set the table , or stop tormenting our brothers or sisters .
Or before the doctor came back into the room .
Or the nurse fixed up the tubes .
Or the poison flowed and brought on the sickness .
In a mind so young , maybe these , too , can someday be taken as just interruptions of life that might have cut short , but were n't the context for , the time spent being a kid .

" Hopefully , " Susan Evans says , " this will all be faded memories when he 's older . "

Nach dem Familiendrama in Schwalmtal : Der Mainstream - Täter
Ein 71 - jähriger Rentner erschießt in der nordrhein - westfälischen Kleinstadt drei Menschen .
Warum ?
Die gängigsten Erklärungsversuche scheitern bei dieser Tat .
BERLIN taz | Ein Mann hat im niederrheinischen Schwalmtal am Dienstag drei Menschen erschossen und einen schwer verletzt .
Der 71 - Jährige sah offenbar die Familienehre beschmutzt .
Grund : Seine Tochter sollte nicht mehr in ihrem
Haus wohnen dürfen , weil der Schwiegersohn das Eigenheim nach der Trennung zwangsversteigern lassen wollte … nein , so nicht .
Noch mal .
Ein Mann aus der niederrheinischen Kleinstadt Schwalmtal hat am Dienstag drei Menschen erschossen und einen schwer verletzt .
Als die Polizei das Haus des Amokläufers durchsuchte , fand sie mehrere Kopien des Computerspiels " Postal 2 " , eines Ego - Shooters , in dem der Spieler einen extrem gewalttätigen Amokläufer verkörpern kann … Nein , so war es auch nicht .
Russlandeutscher und deshalb laut Statistik besonders gewalttätig ?
Nein .
Paintballspieler und deswegen geübt im Umgang mit Waffen ?
Auch nein .
Seit der Bluttat in Nordrhein - Westfalen sind mehr als 24 Stunden vergangen .
Kein Experte oder Journalist hat bisher versucht , die Menschen mit einer der gängigen Großerklärungen zu beglücken , warum jemand drei Menschen erschossen hat .
" Es gibt nur Fragezeichen , es versteht einfach keiner , was hier passiert ist " , sagte ein Anwohner der Deutschen Presse - Agentur .
So wie ihm geht es vielen .
Dabei wollen Medienmacher , Medienkonsumenten und Politiker nach solchen Morden möglichst genaue Antworten auf die Frage nach dem Grund .
So soll das Entsetzliche fassbar werden , denn nichts ist schlimmer als die Ungewissheit und das innerliche Fragen , welches das eigene Bild von sich und der
Welt wanken lässt : Kann es auch mir passieren ?
Kann ich die Wut des Täters nachempfinden ?
Gibt es vielleicht Umstände , für die auch ich verantwortlich bin ?
Am einfachsten lässt sich das ausschließen , indem die Verantwortung eingegrenzt und ausgelagert wird - an das Fremde : wahlweise an Andersgläubige , als primitiv empfundene Menschen mit nichtdeutscher Herkunft , Ostdeutsche - man denke nur an Jörg Schönbohms Babymorderklärung - oder die Jugend und ihre seltsamen Zeitvertreibe .
In der Mehrheitsgesellschaft kommen vor allem zwei Dinge an : Bei denen musste es ja mal so weit kommen .
Und : Das hat mit uns nichts zu tun .
Nur diesmal funktioniert das nicht .
Westdeutsch , weiß , Rentner - mehr Mainstream geht kaum .
Damit fällt die Lieblingsbeschäftigung der Mediengesellschaft - das Antwortgeben - wohl erst einmal aus .
Stattdessen muss die Öffentlichkeit hier das hinnehmen , was sie sonst nicht hinnehmen mag : offene Fragen .
Recht naheliegend wäre : Macht das Zusammenbrechen des Gewohnten auch deutsche Rentner so wütend , dass sie mit Gewalt antworten ?
Wem das zu philosophisch ist : Warum kommt man in diesem Land so leicht an Waffen und könnten wir nicht auch ohne Schützenvereine und Schießsport leben ?
Oder linker : Liegt es eventuell am kapitalistischen System , welches nach einer Scheidung zu unbarmherziger Eigentumsteilung zwingt und alte Menschen als Ausschuss abqualifiziert ?
Vielleicht gehen diese Fragen den meisten aber auch zu sehr an die Substanz , so dass sie spinnert erscheinen .
Dann heißt es vielleicht : Das war eine Einzeltat , so was passiert unter Menschen nun einmal und nicht alles lässt sich so einfach erklären .
Mag sein .
Aber dann sollte zumindest ein wenig von diesem Zögern auch bei all jenen Taten da sein , für die sonst immer so schnell Erklärungen gefunden werden .
I am not against all forms of taxation .
I am not an anarchist .
I understand that a government must exist to protect the rights of its citizens .
I understand that we need a military , a police force , and a well funded and objective court system .
It is not the taxation in and of itself that bothers me ; it is the mode of taxation .
Even if you believe that the government should be in the business of building highways and providing social programs , a tax on income is immoral and is the wrong way for the government to collect funds .
A broad based consumption tax would be less intrusive than an income tax and would be able to provide the government with all necessary funds .
A tax on consumption is less intrusive than an income tax , does not discourage production , and does not reduce the laborers of this nation to involuntary servants–as does a tax on income .
For years , income taxes have been accepted by most people as a necessary evil .
Recently , however , a growing number of us have realized that while they are an evil , they are not necessary .
Many people do not realize that the income tax in this country is less than 100 years old .
Thats right .
The 16th Amendment was ratified in 1913 , meaning that we had survived as a Nation for 137 years without an income tax .
A tax is an inducement to change behavior .
If you want to decrease smoking , you levy a tax on cigarettes .
If you want to discourage consumption of fatty foods , you levy a tax on those food items , as the city of New York is doing .
If you want to discourage speeding , you levy a tax on speeding ( through a speed limit and fines ) .
If you want to discourage driving , you levy a tax on gasoline .
If you want to discourage pollution , you levy a tax on carbon emissions , as President Obama has proposed .
And yet , the same people who openly admit that the above facts are true fail to admit that a tax on income can discourage wealth accumulation .
Taxes on income create disincentives to save , disincentives to invest , and disincentives to engage is risky entrepreneurial activities including starting new businesses or investing in new technologies or potential inventions .
But , besides economic issues , there are moral issues that need to be considered .

Even worse , the government uses the money that it expropriates from my mind to “ serve the common good . ”
They use it to fund social programs for others , without my consent or approval .
The same is of course true for any job .
Anyone who works is forced to pay income taxes .
The fact that everyone is forced to do pay them does not make it any less wrong .
Anyone who refuses to pay their income taxes risks being thrown in jail , hence the above usage of the word “ force . ”
On top of this , the government takes these taxes levied on the labor of men and uses them to fund social programs .
These programs provide money , health care , or other services to selected groups of people .
Think about this .
The government taxes your labor through force and gives it to others for their benefit .
In other words , you are being forced to work for benefit of others .
A person who serves others against their will is called a slave .
By using forced labor to fund social programs , the government has turned all workers into slaves .
The 13th Amendment bans both slavery and involuntary servitude .
Any tax which has the result of forcing one to work for the benefit of others is a blatant violation of the 13th Amendment .
In the Soviet Union , workers were forced to labor in order to build roads , highways , other public works , and provide for the welfare of their fellow citizens .
Here in the United States , the fruits of the labor of hard working Americans is expropriated in order to build roads , highways , other public works , and provide for the welfare of our fellow citizens .
The Soviets were threatened with being sent to Siberian prisons if they refused to obey .
Here in America , we are threatened with prison if we refuse to obey .
The end result is the same : obey or lose your freedom .
No matter how much you feel that we “ need ” these social programs , you cannot deny the fact that the government is using forced labor ( taxes taken by force and derived from the labor of men ) to fund these programs .
As I said above , this is a blatant violation of the 13th Amendment .
Besides embodying a form of forced labor , our tax system is intrusive and does not respect the privacy of Americans .
The Supreme Court cited the right to privacy when it declared abortion to be legal .
Intrusive income taxes are a violation of privacy rights in the most basic form of the right .
The government expropriation of private citizens income for the purpose of protection is no more moral than the mafia doing the same to businesses in its sphere of control .
The only difference between the two scenarios is that the governments ’ actions carry the force of law , while the mafia ’s actions are outside the law .
However , the fact that there is a law behind an action does not make the action moral .
There were laws supporting discrimination against Jews in Nuremberg and against African - Americans in the American South , yet the force of law behind an action does not make it correct .
In the above example , both the government and the mafia collect the money through extortion .
They will both cause you harm if you refuse to pay , and they both justify their monetary expropriations on the grounds of protection .
And the sad thing about the above example is that if you were to pay both the government and the mafia for protection and you needed a favor , there could be little doubt that the mafia would be the one who would deliver the favor .

Most students are going mobile with laptops , so why would anyone want to build a desktop to bring back to school ?
Despite what you lose in portability , desktops have plenty to offer .
A desktop will get you much more bang for your buck than an equally equipped laptop , and building your own will help you save even more .
Not to mention that it's a cool project to end the summer with .
And do not worry if you have never built a computer before ; I 'll walk you through the process .
The Parts
Processor : ( $ 119 )
Hard Drive : ( $ 69.99 )
Graphics Card : ( $ 124.99 )
Motherboard : ( $ 84.99 )
RAM : ( $ 98 )
Power Supply : ( $ 164 )
DVD Drive : ( $ 31.35 )
Case : ( $ 93.99 )
To build a desktop to take back to school , you 'll need components that not only work well now , but will continue to work through senior year .
And of course , the price needs to stay low .
My goal was to build a beefy computer for under $ 800 .
I also wanted to make sure the computer was very upgradeable , so I could easily add parts down the road .
For the processor , I went with the ( $ 119 ) .
It is a 3 - core CPU that operates at 2.8 GHz , has an L3 cache of 6MB , and supports 64 - bit .
Normally , I prefer Intel processors , since they tend to pack a little more punch , but AMD often offers a better bargain .
An important consideration when building a back - to - school desktop is storage .
The typical college student needs to have enough room to fit a few years ' worth of essays , term papers , and projects , along with their entire digital music and movie collections .
The ( $ 69.99 ) has a nice balance of storage and performance , which is important if you want it to last a few years .
The motherboard is always the hardest component to pick out .
The upgradeability of a computer all depends on what the motherboard supports .
That 's why I selected the ( $ 84.99 ) .
It supports the AMD Phenom II X3 and X4 processors , in case you want to upgrade the CPU to an X4 processor down the line .
It also supports up to 16GB of memory , and has six SATA II hard drive ports , to allow for future expansion of memory and storage .
It features onboard eight channel audio for surround sound which can be output through traditional 1/8 - inch audio cables or a digital audio optical cable , which makes this perfect for audio enthusiasts .
This board has eight USB 2.0 ports , so there are plenty of connectors for the myriad devices that exist today .
( You can never have too many USB ports ; I , myself , am always one short . )
Last , but not least , it has a PCI Express 2.0 16X slot which will support the latest and greatest graphics cards , perfect for future upgrades .
Choosing the graphics card was tough .
I decided to go with the ( $ 124.99 ) .
This graphics card has 128 processing cores , clocks in at 1836 MHz , has 512MB of video memory , and supports DirectX 10 and OpenGL 3.0 .
It should n't have any problem running the latest games .
Granted , the frame rate may not be great on the highest settings but if you are okay with throttling the graphics back a bit , you will be able to enjoy the games at a playable frame rate .
To me , the average computer should have at least 2GB of RAM .
For the sake of future - proofing the system , I decided to go one better and stick 4GB of RAM in the system .
The memory kit ( $ 98.00 ) comes with two 2GB chips that run at 1333 MHz .
And , like all of Kingston 's RAM , it comes with a lifetime warranty .
With physical media on its deathbed , some may think an optical drive is not needed in a desktop anymore , but I think it 's still worth having one .
The drive I used is the ( $ 31.35 ) , a SATA optical drive .
I used ( $ 164 ) for the power supply .
It can output up to 650 watts , which is powerful enough to handle most higher - end graphics cards if you choose to upgrade down the road .
Also , this power supply is modular , which means that instead of having a mess of cables coming out of the unit , you only connect the ones you need .
To house all these components , I went with the ( $ 93.99 ) , a mid-sized case that has a screw - less configuration for the 5.25 - inch expansion bays .
It is made of aluminum , comes with two fans , and is a fairly nice , well - built case .
A Note on Windows
At this time , I suggest using Windows Vista for now , and then getting the Windows 7 upgrade in October when it launches .
Unfortunately , the free Windows 7 release candidate is no longer available for download , so you 're stuck with Vista until then .
No matter which version of Windows you use , I suggest backing up your system 's data and doing a fresh install of Windows 7 when it comes out , since doing so means fewer potential problems .
( For more on upgrading , check out our complete . )
Also , I highly suggest installing the 64 - bit version of Windows Vista , or Windows 7 , to make the most of all 4GB of RAM .
Final Thoughts
Though this back - to - school desktop is not the absolute cheapest you could build , it 's still fairly inexpensive , coming in at $ 800 for all the parts .
Moreover , the desktop is beefy enough to last a few years , and very upgradeable in case you need any more power in the years to come .
The computer scores 5.9 out of 7.9 on the Windows Experience Index in Windows 7 and scored 5.8 out of 5.9 in Vista , which is extremely good , especially for a computer under $ 800 .
Our DIY back - to - school PC totally blew other back - to - school desktops from the major vendors out of the water .
It scored 6,736 on the 3D mark Vantage tests , easily beating the budget , which only scored 4,194 .
Our system also did well on the PCMark vantage tests , scoring a 4,713 .
This score crushed another back to school favorite , the , our Editors '
Choice in low - priced all - in- ones , which only managed 2,940 .
Building
Step 1 : Prep the case
Unscrew , and take off , both sides of the case before laying it down .
Screw in the motherboard raisers that came with your case .
Make sure the raisers will line up with the mounting holes in the motherboard .
Step 2 : Start with the motherboard
If you look at the back of the case you will notice a metal stencil that outlines computer ports on a motherboard .
Pop it out of the case by pushing firmly from the outside .
Locate the metal stencil that came with the motherboard and snap it into the case .
Next , line the motherboard up with the port stencil and the raisers that you screwed in .
Once it is sitting correctly screw in the motherboard , plug in the case wires that control the power switch , reset switch , case LED 's , etc .
Step 3 : Install the processor
First , lift up the small lever on the side of the CPU socket .
Then look at the bottom of the processor and line up the pattern of the pins with the holes on the CPU socket .
It will only fit in one way , so do not force it down .
If it is not sitting correctly rotate the processor until it fits .
Now push the lever back down to lock it into place .
Step 4 : Set up the processor 's heat sync
The processor comes with a heat sync that disperses the heat generated by during operation .
It also comes with thermal paste , which helps transfer heat from the CPU to the heat sync .
There is a chance the heat sync will already have the thermal paste applied to it , if that is the case than ignore the next two sentences .
When applying the thermal paste , remember that less is more .
Put a drop of thermal paste on the center of the processor .
Take the heat sync with the fan facing up and push the contact down onto the processor .
The thermal paste will spread itself out as you apply a little pressure .
Latch the heat sync down and check the bottom of it to make sure that no thermal paste leaked out , if it has than use a paper towel to wipe it away .
Finally , connect the heat sync's fan to the CPU fan power plug on the motherboard labeled CPU_FAN .
Step 5 : Adding the RAM
Fit the RAM chips into their slots , which are right next to the processor on the motherboard .
Make sure you put them into the correct RAM slots ; on this motherboard they are the two white slots .
The blue ones are used if you want to expand your system 's memory later on .
But with 4GB of RAM , you should not need to .
Step 6 : Install the hard drive
Installing the hard drive in this case was a little confusing at first , but it turned out to be easier than other cases I have worked with .
Take four of the thick rubber washers and four of the hard drive screws that come with the case .
Put one washer on each screw and then proceed to screw them into the hard drive .
Now stand the case up .
Take the hard drive and carefully slide it into the case until the back washers get wedged into slots in the back of the bay .
Then push downward on the drive and the front two washers will get wedged into the front .
Now , take the orange SATA wire that came with your motherboard and clip the angled plug into the drive .
Feed the other end of the wire through the case .
Lay the case back down carefully .
Plug the SATA wire into the orange SATA port labeled SATA2_0 .
Step 7 : Inserting the graphics card
Before you install the graphics card you have to make sure you peel off the protective film that is on the face to the left of the fan .
Take the graphics card and push it into the PCI Express 2.0 slot ( it is the topmost slot on this motherboard ) .
The card will snap down and lock in place .
Next , screw the port tab into the case .
Step 8 : Adding the DVD drive
To install the DVD drive , first you need to open up a bay on the case .
Pull on the front of the case a little and it will come right off .
Now select a bay on the front of the case to remove ( I normally install the DVD drive in the topmost bay ) .
Squeeze the sides of the panel you would like to remove and then pull it out .
Snap the front of the case back on .
Slide the DVD drive into the bay you just opened up and it will simply snap in place , no screws needed .
Take the other SATA wire that came with your motherboard , and connect it to the optical drive .
Feed it out the middle hole and back in through the bottom hole in the case .
Connect it to the SATA2_1 port on the motherboard .
If you are using an IDE drive , take the wide flat cable that came with the motherboard and plug the green end into the green IDE port on the motherboard .
Then connect the other end to the optical drive .
Step 9 : Setting up the power supply
Insert the power supply into the top section of the case .
If it is in correctly , the mounting holes will line up with the four holes in the case .
Screw it in .
Now it is time to hook power up to all the components .
I will walk you though cable management as we hook up the power supply .
If you know how to connect the power supply and do not care for cable management then skip ahead to step 14 .
Step 10 : Connect the power supply to the motherboard
Stand the case back up and feed the only four wires that are currently coming out the back of the power supply through the hole that is right next to the unit .
Feed the thickest cable though the next hole down and connect it to the main power port on the motherboard .
Next locate the thinner cable that has the widest plug on the end .
Feed this one though the same hole as the thicker cable and connect it to its port on the motherboard .
Those two connections will power the motherboard , processor , RAM , and all the expansion card slots .
Step 11 : Connect the power supply to the hard drive
Find the wires that came with the power supply .
Take one of the SATA power cables and plug it into the bottom power port on the power supply .
Then feed the wire through the hole right behind the unit and stand the case up .
This will be a good time to take note of the cable management latches .
Open them up , run the SATA power cable down the case and then close them again to keep the cable in place .
Feel free to use them for any cables we run along this side of the case from here on out .
Now run the power cable over to the hard drive and plug it in , tucking any extra cable wire under the hard drive in the empty bays .
Step 12 : Connect the power supply to the graphics card
Take the 6 - pin power connector ( it is one of the non-modular wires ) and feed it through the middle hole in the case .
Plug it into the top of the graphics card .
Step 13 : Power to optical drive
Take another SATA power wire that came with the power supply .
Connect it to the unit and feed it out the top hole and then back in through the middle hole .
I suggest that you use the wire management clips and loop the wire down then back up the case to take up the slack .
Connect the wire to the optical drive .
Step 14 : Case Fans
There are two case fans to hook up .
Connect the wire of the fan that cools the hard drive bays to the fan pins on the motherboard labeled SYS_FAN1 .
There are two plugs on the rear case fan 's wire .
Connect the smaller one to the fan pins on the motherboard labeled SYS_FAN2 .
If you did not use an IDE optical drive and have not wired a Molex power cable into the case yet , then do so now using the above instructions .
Connect a Molex plug to the rear case fan wire .
Step 15 : Connect input ports on top of case to motherboard
There are gray wires near the top of the case .
Feed them through the hole that all the power supply wires went though .
Find the two wires labeled USB and feed them through the bottom hole .
Connect them to the yellow ports that are labeled USB on the motherboard .
Find the wire labeled 1394 ( otherwise known as FireWire ) .
Feed it through the middle hole in the case .
This will connect to a white plug on bottom of the motherboard .
The last connection , labeled HD AUDIO , is for the headphone and mic jacks .
Feed this through the middle hole and connect it to the pins labeled F_AUDIO on the motherboard .
Step 16 : Finish up
Congratulations , you just built a computer to take back to school with you .
The last thing you need to do before you boot up , is put both side panels back on the case and screw them in .
Now you are ready to install Windows , or your Linux distro of choice .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama took a dose of reality to Michigan on Tuesday , saying that thousands of jobs lost to the auto industry ’s downturn are not coming back and it is time to prepare for new industries .
U.S. President Barack Obama speaks with the use of one teleprompter after the other fell and broke at the Urban and Metropolitan Policy Roundtable at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House complex in Washington , July 13 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Larry Downing
Traveling to Michigan , a state hit hard by job losses as Detroit ’s Big Three automakers have reeled from the U.S. recession , Obama planned to promote a $ 12 billion initiative to boost community colleges and increase the graduation rate .
“ ( The ) hard truth is that some of the jobs that have been lost in the auto industry and elsewhere wo n’t be coming back , ” Obama was to say , according to prepared remarks released by the White House .
“ They are casualties of a changing economy .
And that only underscores the importance of generating new businesses and industries to replace the ones we ’ve lost , and of preparing our workers to fill the jobs they create , ” Obama will say .
He was to make the remarks during a visit to Macomb County Community College in Warren , Michigan .
Macomb County gave rise to so - called “ Reagan Democrats ” 30 years ago who crossed party lines and helped elect Republican Ronald Reagan .
Obama , a Democrat , is attempting to restore economic growth to the United States at a time when his $ 787 billion economic stimulus plan is under fire from Republicans because it has failed to stop the jobless rate from rising to 9.5 percent .
A new CBS News poll said Obama ’s job approval rating was a strong 57 percent , although that was down six points from last month .
The poll said his approval rating on handling the economy is now 48 percent , while 44 percent disapprove .
Last month , Americans approved of his handling of this issue by a margin of 22 points , CBS said .
JOBLESS RATE TO RISE
Talking to reporters in the Oval Office before leaving for Michigan , Obama said the United States is trying to rebound from the most severe recession since the Great Depression , and that the jobless rate probably will get worse before it gets better .
“ My expectation is , is that we will probably continue to see unemployment tick up for several months , ” he said .
He said he was pleased that General Motors and Chrysler have emerged from bankruptcy and said if the government had not bailed them out with billions of dollars , “ the situation in Michigan , I think it ’s fair to say , would be far worse . ”
Obama ’s 10 - year program to boost community college includes a new goal of graduating an additional 5 million students from these schools over the next decade , double the current number of expected graduates .
Education is the often - forgotten third pillar of Obama ’s economic plan and has received far less attention than the other two -- healthcare reform and renewable energy .
Obama ’s Council of Economic Advisers issued a report on the future of the U.S. job market on Monday that was aimed at bolstering the case for more higher education .
“ Well - trained and highly skilled workers will be best positioned to secure high - wage jobs , thereby fueling American prosperity , ” the report said .
“ Occupations requiring higher educational attainment are projected to grow much faster than those with lower education requirements , with the fastest growth among occupations that require an associate ’s degree or a post - secondary vocational award , ” it said .
There are more than 1,000 community colleges in the United States with more than 6 million students enrolled .
Nearly half a million students graduate from community colleges annually .
Alternate Versions
DVD includes 14 deleted scenes : they consist mostly of alternate takes of existing scenes ( for example Ronna and Simon discussing outside the store ) and longer versions of scenes featured in the theatrical release ( such as the first conversation between Todd Gaines and Claire ) .
Also included , however , is an alternate ending for the Vegas storyline , where Simon and Marcus find out they left Todd 's credit card in Vegas and realize that the goons are on their tracks .
They barricade themselves in Simon 's apartment .
Meanwhile Victor and his son are at Todd 's apartment and are waiting for Simon .
Claire finds
Todd 's gun and points it at Victor unaware that the gun is n't loaded .
After a fight , Todd manages to wrestle the gun out of Victor 's hands .
Todd goes to Simon 's apartment and , after Simon lets him in , punches him in the face .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , said Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission plans to ban so - called " flash trading , " where high - frequency traders can get information just before it becomes public .
" We salute the SEC for moving forward with this ban that will restore integrity to the markets .
The agency is absolutely making the right call by stepping up and ending this unfair practice , " Schumer said .
Flash orders are trades that flash in milliseconds to only a select group of market participants which can disadvantage other investors .
Traders with access to the information because of super - fast computers can act on it quickly to trade ahead of other traders , influencing the pricing of stocks .
SEC Chairwoman Mary Schapiro indicated in a statement that the agency is considering a measure that would ban flash trading , however such a move would need to be approved by the agency 's five - person commission .
Schapiro said that earlier this year she asked the SEC staff to conduct a review of flash orders by exchanges and electronic trading systems .
" Since that review was undertaken , I have asked the staff for an approach that can be quickly implemented to eliminate the inequity that results from flash orders , " Schapiro said .
" Under the rule - making process , such a proposal to eliminate the ability to flash orders would need to be approved by the commission and be open to public comment . "
She added that the agency is also examining private electronic markets operated by brokerages that do n't publicly post quotes .
Schumer said Schapiro assured him of the imminent ban .
The senator cited an industry estimate that high frequency trades accounted for $ 21 billion in profits in 2008 .
" Flash orders allow sophisticated high - frequency traders to gain access to trading information before it is sent out widely to other traders , " Schumer said .
" For a fee , the exchange will ' flash ' information about buy and sell orders for just a few fractions of a second before the information is made publicly available . "
Joe Saluzzi , co-head of equity trading for Themis Trading in New Jersey , said he is happy the SEC appears to be taking steps to ban flash trading .
" We 're very happy to hear that the public 's concerns about flash orders have been addressed , " Saluzzi said .
He added that high frequency traders represent 70 % of the volume of trading on most days , which exchanges rely on heavily for their fee generation .
Saluzzi argues that high frequency traders typically threaten to leave one exchange for another if they do not get special advantages for their volume of transactions .
" Once this is approved , high frequency traders will likely start screaming to the exchanges that ' you better find me something new ' or they will leave again , " Saluzzi said .
" But flash trades are just one of their tools . "
Jamie Selway , managing director at White Cap Trading in New York , said flash trades are unfair because they create a private market for some transactions , however he did not believe banning them would have any major impact on the volume of trades in the markets .
" There is a private set of prices that are better than those available in the public markets , " Selway said .
" However banning it wo n't have a big impact . "
Location Location Location
Saluzzi added that he hopes the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission take steps to limit the practice of co-location , where large volume high - frequency traders are permitted to place their servers in an exchange 's data center .
CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler discussed issues around co-location at a recent agency hearing on speculation in the energy markets .
" Physical proximity is everything , " said Saluzzi .
" If the wire is shorter , it means everything . "
However , Saluzzi said he believes regulators are worried that if high frequency traders have many of their special advantages removed the result could be a major reduction in the volume of trades .
" They can disappear tomorrow , " Saluzzi said .
" If you take away too many of their tools , the volume of trades may dry up . "
Selway added that eliminating co-location would significantly reduce the volume of trades in the markets .
" These people live or die by a millisecond , " Selway said .
" If you get rid of co-location you get rid of the volume in the markets , which would hurt liquidity . "
Just tip of the iceburg
Sen .
Ted Kaufman , D - De. , said he was pleased about the flash trading step but said it was only one of a number of things the SEC could do to limit unfair practices that could have a negative impact on the markets .
" We seem to be learning more every day about certain order types , high - speed trading , collocation of servers at exchanges , dark pools and other indications that we have a two - tier market : one for privileged insiders with high - speed computers and another for the average investor who must follow the rules , " Kaufman said .
" We need the SEC to move with urgency to restore investor protections and thereby strengthen the credibility and integrity of America 's financial markets . "
HAL , which weighs 23kg , is comprised of robotic ' limbs ' , and a backpack containing the suit 's battery and computer system .
It is strapped to the body and controlled by thought .
When a person attempts to move , nerve signals are sent from the brain to the muscles , and very weak traces of these signals can be detected on the surface of the skin .
The HAL suit identifies these signals using a sensor attached the skin of the wearer , and a signal is sent to the suit 's power unit telling the suit to move in unison with the wearer 's own limbs .
Spock and Uhura
So I was walking home from the new Star Trek movie , which I have previously indicated I found to be awesome .
I was pretty surprised by this , as the Star Trek TV shows had not caught my fancy , and expressed this surprise to my friend , who was a fan of the TV show .
SARAH : But now I see I was TERRIBLY WRONG .
GASTON : Great !
SARAH : I 'll watch the series now !
GASTON : Cool , we 'll have a Star Trek weekend .
PASSERSBY : SARAH : Sounds good !
And I will watch the greatest love story of all time unfold over many episodes .
GASTON : What ?
Which love story do you mean ?
SARAH : The love story of ( highlight to see a spoiler from the movie ) , of course !
GASTON : Weeeell ... about that ... it did n't so much actually happen as ... not happen ... SARAH : That 's it , Star Trek weekend is off !
PASSERSBY : Feeling betrayed that I had been robbed of the awesomeness I was imagining , I decided to go in search of awesomeness on the internet .
Surely , I would find much love there !
I did not see much love for Uhura , who I thought was a clearly brilliant and fabulous character .
Even in the comments to my parody , people seemed against or indifferent to her .
Of course , I searched and did find love for her , and indeed here is a really great collection of Uhura thoughts , with a spotlight on race and feminism
But my search made me think some more about fictional ladies , and an audience 's approach to them .
Now , I have already gone over my thoughts on how girls in fiction are starting out from a tricky place , given that the traditional way women were written is problematic , and you can also go too far in the opposite direction .
But there 's another question , and that 's the audience : I do think all of us tend to be harder on women , even if the women in question are awesome .
This is totally natural - the society we live in has plenty of issues about the ladies , and sometimes we do n't even know we 're being influenced .
So without further ado , and with Wuthering Heights , Jane Eyre , Little Women , Harry Potter , my own book because responses to it made me think about these issues , A Great and Terrible Beauty , Dickens , Ilona Andrews and doubtless others mentioned , plus mangled song lyrics because ... I may be crazy .
I certainly have seen girl characters who were too perfect : who were beloved by all , beautiful ( though they always thought their mouth was too wide or possibly their bosom too generous ) , and eventually elected queen of the universe .
( Sometimes literally . )
Let us think of the Question of Harry Potter .
I do not mean to bag on the character of Harry Potter : I am very fond of him .
But I think people would be less fond of him if he was Harriet Potter .
If he was a girl , and she'd had a sad childhood but risen above it , and she 'd found fast friends , and been naturally talented at her school 's only important sport , and saved the day at least seven times .
If she 'd had most of the boys in the series fancy her , and mention made of boys following her around admiring her .
If the only talent she did n't have was dismissed by her guy friend who did have it .
If she was often told by people of her numerous awesome qualities , and was in fact Chosen by Fate to be awesome .
Well , then she'd be just like Harry Potter , but a girl .
But I do n't think people would like her as much .
Thinking it over , there are a lot of male characters who are super popular , who fulfill a good few of these criteria .
And yet , thinking about it as Male Character being a girl , you feel differently about it .
I think Petra Pan would get more flak for being mean and selfish than Peter Pan ever did .
Heathcliff is generally better liked than Cathy , even though Cathy has no history of animal cruelty .
Edwina Rochester would be Loathed By All .
The older , not terribly attractive , super rich woman who almost lures the dude into a false marriage ?
Run , Jim Eyre , people would cry !
Never dream of looking back !
If Laurie fromwere Lori who lived next door to a house full of brothers , and who gave up her interest in the dark , bookish , less attractive brother and decided she 'd always loved the much hotter brother with less personality really ?
I know a lot of people do n't much fancy Laurie and Amy 's romance , but I have n't seen a lot of people dislike Laurie : I do think Lori would attract more hatred .
And some of that is of course because the character would be intrinsically different if they were a girl .
But some of it's because we 're more prone to judge girl characters harshly : we 're suspicious of them when they 're awesome .
We 're suspicious of girls when they 're wanted .
Uh , if I may , I 'll segue briefly into an example from my own book , it is n't necessary to have read it : I have two characters .
Let 's call them Character A and Character B. ( Those are not their names .
Those would be terrible names . )
They 're both important characters : they 're both attractive and confident about their attractiveness .
For most of the book both of them are too busy for romance , but occasionally both of them forget that .
There are four main characters in the book : Characters A and B among them .
In the case of both Character A and Character B , each of these has two of the three other main characters attracted to them .
( The character who remains in each case is related to the character in question , and thus not that likely to be attracted to them . )
In the case of Character A , various minor characters are also attracted .
A puts A's attractions to use more frequently than any other character : such uses include making out with people to get stuff , and being half - naked and expecting to get stuff .
The reasons for this are simple .
Character B is cute and knows how to work it .
Character
A is the bombshell head - turner of the group , and knows how to workCharacter B is the one who gets called out for having too many people fancy B , who 's seen as responsible for other people 's attraction to B , who 's seen as using people 's feelings and provoking their feelings .
Nobody ever tells me Character A is too attractive .
Character B's a girl .
Character A's a boy .
I can't help but feel there 's an unconscious bias going on there .
Of course , we 've all seen fiction where every man within range is slain by a single glance from the lady 's eyes , and sometimes it totally is excessive .
But there are also a lot of guys ladies go nuts for in fiction : see Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince , subtitle ' Harry Potter , A Lot of Ladies Would Like To Hit That , ' Edward Dazzle Me Harder Cullen , and The Name 's Bond James Bond .
But it 's the boys wanting the girls that seems to cause the most ire ... directed towards the girls .
And why 's that ?
So lots of books have romances in them .
As well they might : romances are interesting !
I wo n't lie , I always assume evil will be defeated and am pretty engaged with who will get with who .
And there often exists a romantic rival lady in a romance , or even other ladies around who might be seen as the romantic rival , and they 're often hated inside and outside the text as vile and unworthy and unattractive .
' Right , Little Miss Picky ' you might say unto me at this point .
What do you want from a romance , then ?
Well , I will tell you .
Through the medium of SONG .
A song calledby Josh Ritter begins ' All the other girls here are stars ... you are the Northern Lights .
' And that is what I like .
That 's more romantic .
If the hero is n't presented with a scheming evil diva from hell with no redeeming qualities and a taste for puppy blood in her Cheerios and you , if there are a lot of awesome girls around , if they 're smart and funny and great , and the heropicks the heroine , if he thinks she shines the brightest , is the awesomest of the awesome ...
Well I think that 's pretty romantic .
After all , if a girl 's torn between two or more guys in fiction , often those two or more guys will be fairly awesome .
Why should the other ladies be any less awesome ?
There 's also dislike for the heroine , often because she does n't reciprocate a preferred guy 's feelings .
We 've all wanted people to get together who never did get together ( Jo and Laurie , for me , for one ) but girls are seen as culpable for not liking a guy , sometimes , in a way that guys just are n't blamed for in the same way .
Which I think is down to a perception of ladies ' hands as being given away by someone else , as naughty women being temptresses and good girls being meant to go for the right guy .
And a little bit down to girl readers putting themselves in the heroine 's place .
Women are not prizes .
And it 's really easy to see them that way : when I was sixteen and reading LJ Smith 's books ( and loving the hell out of them , I might add ) which are heavily focused on boy / girl / boy love triangles , I always passionately wanted the girl to get with the boyliked best .
But no : nobody 's owed a lady 's love .
Ladies , not awarded to the most deserving .
Ladies are to be judged independent of guys : again , let 's play flipping genders .
Guys ' romantic choices are held against them way less often - Dickens ' shas a hero who marries demonstrably the wrong girl for him when the right girl was there all along , but I 've never heard anyone hold it against him .
So , there 's this thing called the Bechdel Test .
I have handily looked up a definition of it for you !
Test is in three parts .
1 . It has to have at least two women in it2 .
Who talk to each other3 .
About something besides a manHere is an awesome link about both the complexities of the Bechdel Test and also giving a ton of examples of awesome fiction with ladies ' friendships in it .
It is COOL and you should read it .
This essay will be here chillin ' and waiting for you when you 're done .
However if you do n't read it , or if you do n't read all the comments , part of mine is a recommendation for Ilona Andrews and her series , which takes apart a feature of a lot of books : the kickass woman who 's surrounded by guys .
The books ( which start with ) start with the heroine Kate being like that and then shows us she 's like that because she 's been raised in a terribly , legitimately messed up way , and as the series goes on it slowly ceases to be true .
Awesome minor female characters are around being awesome , and Kate acquires a best friend called Andrea , who 's very into guns and romance novels , and an adopted niece .
That is awesome , and I trust I do not need to tell you why .
Andrea and Julie make me love Kate and the books so much more .
I do n't mind some things not passing the Bechdel Test : there 's reasons for some things not passing it .
But a LOT of fiction does n't pass it .
I 've recently been really dismayed by reading a bunch of books where the heroine apparently has no friends , or seems to actively dislike her friends ( tons of mental bagging on them ) or is at least totally prepared to dismiss her friends the instant Mr Right comes along and then friends can either talk solely about Mr Right with her or hop it .
Which does n't endear me to the heroine , who then seems like a pretty sucky friend .
And which certainly does not help her be the Northern Lights .
There should be other ladies around being stars !
These books make me think , this one lady being validated by the approval of the dudes , being different from the ( ew ) other ladies .
What 's wrong with the other ladies ?
Why does she need to be so drastically different ?
I do n't like seeing fiction where it seems like all girls except for the Chosen One has cooties .
I 've had to wash the taste out of my mouth by reading Eloisa James 's romance novels : many of her serieseses ... eses are based on the bonds between ladies , notably the Desperate Duchesses and the Essex sisters books .
As they 're straight romances and historical , marriages and menfolk are on these ladies ' minds .
But I always get the sense they legimitimately care about each other , that they have things to talk about besides dudes , that they 're interested in each other - and seeing a heroine be interested in someone who 's not her love interest makes her a lot more interesting to me .
I get a lot of people assuming I likewhen I have n't watched it in years , and never more than a few episodes off and on .
I assume this is because there are demons and brothers in the book what I wrote , and the show also .
But no , not a Supernatural fan , ever since I realised there was never going to be a female character who was awesome and stuck around for a while .
Which is not to say people are wrong for liking - everyone 's hot button is different .
I like , while some of my friends can't deal with the race issues .
I like Anthony Trollope .
ANTHONY : Feminists are ladies who has gone CRAZY .
SARAH : OH ANTHONY WHY .
ANTHONY : No , no , wait , I 'm not done .
Do you know why they went crazy ?
SARAH : Anthony , why are you hurting me .
Anthony , I ONLY WANT TO LOVE YOU .
ANTHONY : Because nobody has MARRIED them .
LOL !SARAH : * weeps *ANTHONY :
Oh little lady you know what you need .
SARAH : THE VOTE .
ANTHONY : Wrong answer .
Right answer ?
A MAN.I totally still love Anthony Trollope .
There is no judgement here .
Nor does it mean I will be sad if people relate my book to Supernatural .
People relate stuff to other stuff : it is the nature of fiction .
I do it myself all the time .
SARAH : So you should read Libba Bray ' sbecause it is likePATIENT FRIEND :
There is a lady in a corset on the front .
SARAH : Um yes .
Well likeif Harry Potter , Draco Malfoy , Blaise Zabini and Neville Longbottom were all girls living in the 1800s and wearing corsets and having illicit midnight swims and trysts with gypsies and going to school .
PATIENT FRIEND : ... Magic school ?
SARAH : No . PATIENT FRIEND : This does not sound like Harry Potter AT ALL .
SARAH :
Well , there IS magic in it .
I believe I have strayed from my point , though I like how I 've strayed since it brought upwhich features lots of awesome girls , and awesome female friendships , and never any fighting over a guy .
My point is , I 'd like to watch a show with two attractive brothers and a focus on horror movie examples of the week mixed in with a road trip through America .
Who would n't ?
But I can't enjoy something without ladies in it .
It makes me feel icky : it makes me think the people who made the show do n't like ladies , or the people who enjoy the show do n't like them .
And I do n't think either of those things are true : probably people do n't want to get girls wrong , because it 's easy to get girls wrong , or they just kind of overlooked it , because it 's easy to do that .
And I do n't mean to pick onespecially here : it is just an example .
There are a lot of shows , and movies , and books like it , and I mostly do n't enjoy them .
I 've kind of given up on detective noir because I 've seen women float through it , be evil or killed or both , and never stick .
Women being evil or killed or both is why I did n't much like the movie , which lots of my friends like : which is a very good movie .
My point is , people will enjoy books and movies and shows more if ladies are in them being awesome .
( I know I will . )
And people will enjoy them more if they maybe take a step back , examine their prejudices , and relax into accepting that they 're awesome .
Even if some girl characters are missteps , even if some of them you just will never personally like because tastes are subjective , it 's worth doing to have them , and it 's worth trying to love them .
The femme fatales , the ninja ladies , the shy girls , the chatterboxes , the ones several guys wanted , the ones none of the guys wanted , the heroines , the sassy sidekicks , the girl the hero fell in love with in one episode we never saw again , the girl who wanted a guy she did n't get , the girl who was with a ton of different guys , the girl who was devoted to her job , the girl who was into other ladies , the murder victim , the tomboy , the feisty redhead , the dumb blonde .
There was never anything wrong with any of them .
It 's worth it to recognise that we 're all okay .
We were always okay .

Sarah Palin :
The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama 's " death panel " so his bureaucrats can decide , based on a subjective judgment of their " level of productivity in society , " whether they are worthy of health care .
Such a system is downright evil .
It 's goes without saying that this statement is an outright demonstrable lie .
And it 's coming from a former candidate for Vice President of the United States .
But that said , Palin is sort of right on one point -- there are people who weigh whether children like Trig are worthy of insurance .
They 're called insurance companies , and they have decided that these children are not in fact worthy of coverage .
That 's because Down Syndrome is a " pre-existing condition . "
Christian Science Monitor , 10/21/08 ( Lexis ) :
Margaret Demko of Albany , Ohio , agrees everyone should be responsible for themselves .
But she also believes the free market has failed the healthcare system miserably .
That 's left too many people , like her family and every other family that lives on her rural road in Appalachia , without healthcare coverage .
. . .
Ensuring that everyone has access to care has become a full - time cause for Ms. Demko .
She and her family have been without insurance since her daughter was born four years ago with what doctors say is Down syndrome .
Her husband is a self - employed contractor so the family had relied on her job as a substance abuse counselor for their health insurance .
But Demko said she could n't keep working full time with an infant with special needs .
When she quit , she did n't realize that would result in her family 's being unable to get health insurance .
Ohio does not require insurance companies to cover children with disabilities considered to be preexisting conditions .
Georgetown Univ. , Center for Children and Families :
Margaret Demko , the mother of three - year - old Emily , testified before the Ohio Finance Committee on February 27 , 2008 , on how waiting for health care coverage has impacted Emily and her future .
Emily was born with Down Syndrome .
After receiving Emily 's diagnosis , the family decided that it was important for Margaret to stay home in order to best meet the needs of their child .
They explored numerous options after losing their employer - sponsored coverage , but due to Emily 's pre-existing condition , the Demkos were denied private coverage .
Luckily , they qualified for Medicaid .
However , by their 6 - month reauthorization meeting , the monthly family income was $ 135 over the allowable limits .
The medical bills , in excess of $ 3,500 a month , were devastating , forcing the family to make difficult decisions regarding therapy .
Emily 's medical condition requires orthotic shoe inserts , physical therapy , and corrective eye treatments , as well as hearing and blood tests .
The Demkos cannot afford to incur all the expenses at once .
Harold Pollack also wrote a good piece on these issues during the election .
That 's the dog - whistle behind " If I die , I die . "
It 's a quote from the Biblical figure , Queen Esther , who rose from being a Beauty Queen to being the champion of the Jewish people in their battle for survival .
Now imagine if McCain had won , had to resign because of illness , and we were facing an international crisis with Iran .
Now take a Xanax .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Federal Reserve , facing growing pressure as it tries to heal the ailing economy , dodged a bullet on Monday when the U.S. Senate cast aside a new effort to increase scrutiny of the central bank .
The U.S. Federal Reserve is reflected in a car as a security officer patrols the front of the building in Washington , June 24 , 2009 .

On procedural grounds , the Senate blocked a bid to permit the U.S. comptroller general , who heads the investigative arm of Congress known as the Government Accountability Office , to audit the Federal Reserve system and issue a report .
Republican Senator Jim DeMint , who has been pushing for greater transparency at the Fed , failed to get the provision attached to the must - pass annual spending bill that includes funding for the GAO for the upcoming 2010 fiscal year .
The audit would have included details about the Fed ’s discount window operations , funding facilities , open market operations and agreements with foreign central banks and governments , DeMint said on the Senate floor .
“ The Federal Reserve will create and disburse trillions of dollars in response to our current financial crisis , ” DeMint said .
“ Americans across the nation , regardless of their opinion on the bailout , want to know where the money has gone .
“ Allowing the Fed to operate our nation ’s monetary system in almost complete secrecy leads to abuse , inflation and a lower quality of life , ” he said .
Democrats who control the Senate blocked the South Carolina Republican ’s amendment on the grounds that it violated rules prohibiting legislation attached to spending bills .
Fed officials were not immediately available to comment .
The move comes as some lawmakers have increasingly become wary of the Fed ’s actions , particularly for its handling of the real estate market and the meltdown of major financial institutions like investment bank Bear Stearns and insurance giant American International Group .
A non-binding provision in the fiscal 2010 budget blueprint Congress approved in April called on the Fed to provide more information about collateral posted against Bear Stearns and AIG loans .
That measure also sought a study evaluating the appropriate number and costs of the regional Fed banks .
The U.S. central bank has a seven - member board in Washington whose members are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate .
It also has 12 regional banks whose presidents are appointed by banks and other businesses in their local districts , with the consent of the Washington board .
Results of three months of testing with captchas on across fifty sites .
Nearly a year ago , we told you captchas had seemed to become a necessary evil for websites .
Between the spam and the abuse , web forms just are n't secure , and it felt like the only way to combat it was with those nasty captchas .
Captchas have always felt like a cop-out .
As a business , you 're passing your own business problem onto users .
Moreover , the way in which the problem is passed onto users is half - assed and can cause loads of confusion .
Fundamentally , ** that 's just wrong .**
###About the Study I hate to say I told you so — wait , no I do n't — but , according to a recent study by SEOmoz , ** captchas could be costing you conversions .**
Here 's how their case study broke down : 1 . It was performed across 50 websites , each ranging from one to five years old .
2 . The study was done over six months , splitting it evenly with captchas on for three and off for the other three .
3 . Each form was used to collect common contact information ( name , address , etc ) .
4 . Every successful , failed , and spam form submission was recorded and tallied for the numbers you see in the study .
###The Results Are In
The results , shown in the graph below , were n't that shocking to us considering we 've all been in the same position with captchas before and had at least one failed attempt in our lifetimes .
** See for yourself .** In the graph , blue shows successful conversions , green indicates a failed submission , and red shows spam submissions .
At first glance , the results are striking , but note the scale and the y - axis — we start at 600 .
Still , ** we 're looking at 7.3 % lost opportunity ** because of a single element on your page .
And while some spam got through without the captcha , we can't help but wonder if a powerful spam filter like Akismet could help decrease those occurrences .
We use it on our own blog here and have had wild success with it .
It 's worth noting that in a similar situation , a single change to a web form button brought in an additional $ 300,000,000 .
What 's this mean for us and captchas ?
Well , in other words , that 7.3 % of ** failed conversions could be costing you thousands of lost conversions and who knows how much lost revenue .**
###So , What Now ?
We had plenty of feedback in the comments of our last post .
The consensus has been that we have captchas , and they keep out the spam , but they are really a pain for users and not the best solution — but what else do we have ?
The best solutions so far has been using what 's called a " honeypot , " a form field hidden to users like you and I , but visible to the typical spam bot .
They 're called honeypots because , like bees to honey , spam bots flock to any form field .
There are numerous variations out there , and the premise seems quite sound .
But can we count on this holding up in the future ?
Not likely .
We 're sad to say that ** spam is inevitably here to stay **.
However , designers , developers , and businesses can make huge differences by solving this problem in better ways that do n't create bad experiences for users .
The business reasons alone should make such solutions even more appealling .
Our suggestion ?
Take notice , do n't ( mis ) place problems on your visitors , and do n't forget to **use design to creatively and effectively solve your business problems .**
Anyone who 's plugged into the electro scene surely knows who Little Boots is .
Officially , Victoria Hesketh ( born 1984 ) , known professionally as Little Boots , is a British electronica musician .
She sings , loads up her Yamaha Tenori - on for youtube videos and should be considered more then pretty girl with a nice pair .
Victoria was the former lead singer / synth player in Dead Disco , a short lived electro act that did make a dent in my rotation a couple of years ago .
Now , with the release of the Illuminations EP ( released earlier this month ) , her voice and catchy synth hooks have gotten the remix treatment ( which will follow after a few kind words on the EP )
Illuminations EP - Released July 9th , 2009
Tracklisting
1 New In Town ( from HANDS album ) 2 Stuck On Repeat ( from HANDS album ) 3 Not Now ( US exclusive release ) 4 Magical ( B side , rare track , only released on a limited UK 7 " previously ) 5 Love Kills ( Freddie Mercury cover , rare track )
As you can see from the above tracklisting , none of these tracks are anything new , and although I had n't listened to a few of these tracks other then " in the mix " , It seems all pretty obvious .
Little Boots is n't quite the electro champion that we were led to believe .
Victoria proves with this EP that she is a crossover artist - Look out Lady Ga Ga , all our girl needs is half of the high end endorsements you get from half of the high end " artists " your label seems to wrangle for you .

The events of recent decades have been ominous .
The events of recent weeks more so .
It 's not so much , I guess , the visage of obese , over - fifty , white men angrily wrecking even the tattered remnants of the democratic process in this country that is most disturbing .
We 've seen that before .
I think it 's the willful ignorance translated into incoherent , and in fact ironically self - defeating , rage that I find most discouraging .
Can we really live in a country populated by so many fools , people who can so readily , proudly and belligerently be made into tools of their own destruction ?
Can the greatest political , economic , cultural and military power on the world 's stage possibly be so incredibly backward at its core ?
Consider this passage : " The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama 's ' death panel ' so his bureaucrats can decide , based on a subjective judgment of their ' level of productivity in society , ' whether they are worthy of health care .
Such a system is downright evil . "
These words were written by a person who might well now be vice - president of the United States , had the economic crash of our time come a few months later .
And who , had that in fact transpired , and had one old man named McCain sometime later then met his actuarially not - improbable death , could have become the American president and leader of the free world .
So , okay , maybe that horror scenario is not so novel .
After all , Nixon was in the White House for six years .
And what was George W. Bush , really , other than Sarah Palin in trousers ?
But what seems to me new about this moment is the political road rage , the thuggishness of masses of Americans who not only are venting about insane nonsense , not only are undermining their own interests acting as marionettes of laughing corporate predators , and not only are taking down democracy around themselves in order to do so , but are in fact also destroying the entire Enlightenment project of rationality - based management of public affairs as well .
The single most frightening characteristic of this movement , to my mind , is that fact that no amount of evidence or logic could persuade these folks to abandon the lies they 've attached themselves to , like a pit bull clamped to the leg of some poor SOB 's pants .
What does it take to get someone to the point that they believe that the US Congress is passing a healthcare reform bill that will allow the government to exterminate seniors ?
What does it take for them to impute that motive to a president from the feeble Democratic Party ?
And , at that , one of the most Milquetoastian creatures to hit Washington since Hubert Humphrey ran for president acting like he was a guy named Hubert Humphrey ?
From Minnesota , no less .
What do you have to do to humans to get them so stupefied that they believe Obama 's Hawaiian birth was some sort of conspiracy , replete with fake 1961 newspaper announcements ?
What sort of powerful drugs does one have to be on to make the argument that this rather considerably conservative president is a socialist ?
And then to call him a fascist in your next breath , blissfully unaware that the chasm separating the two ideologies not only makes them wholly different , but , indeed , oppositional .
( You know , like in World War II .
Maybe they 've even heard of that . )
In fact , this is not a matter of stupidity , though there 's loads of that to go around .
But I bet that when it comes to finding arcane deductions to insert into their tax forms , these folks are actually quite clever .
I bet a lot of them could reel off sports statistics or bible verses that would put your head in a fog .
No , it 's not stupidity .
Something else is going on here .
It 's certainly not a matter of factuality , either .
It 's astonishing to imagine that anyone might perceive the hopelessly flimsy Obama administration – even if it was n't directly following the folks who brought you the Dick Cheney vision of executive power – as some sort of dictatorial Bonapartist project .
Are we even talking about the same human being here ?
Do they really mean the Obama who keeps trying to be bipartisan while Republicans trash him viciously at every juncture ( including even members of Congress questioning the legitimacy of his American birth ) ?
Do they really mean the guy who continually defers to Congress to shape the major legislative initiatives he claims to be in favor of ?
Are talking about the dude who lets a handful of Blue Dog Democrats roll him at every turn ?
This , even after eight years of Bush , we 're supposed to believe is some sort of totalitarian imperial president hell - bent on bringing fascism to America ???
No , this is n't about lack of intellect or the remotest correspondence to reality .
It seems pretty clear to me that this is almost entirely about fear .
This is the empire crashing , and the former master class within it crashing as well .
Both are falling to ordinariness and worse .
They always were ordinary , of course , and always tools for exploitation by economic predators , but at least back in the day it was n't such a struggle to be middle class .
And , most importantly , they could always feel good by telling each other that at least they were better than the hated bitches , darkies and fags .
Oh , and Arabs .
Beating them up , literally and figuratively , was ( and remains ) a good way to remind yourself of that superiority .
But now even that small bit of compensation is gone .
Your country can't win a war against a bunch of third world ragheads .
Your boss is cutting your salary again .
The womenfolk have their own source of income now , and no longer have to put up with your blundering sexual advances to keep a roof over their heads .
Perverts are marrying each other left and right .
And now – WTF ?
– there 's some Harvard - educated spade in the White House , along with , even worse , his uppity - looking Harvard - educated all - superior - like even spadier woman .
Of course , this has been going on since the 1970s , as America 's post - war hegemony began to erode internationally , and within the country white males were being challenged for their domestic dominance as well .
These " Reagan Democrats " – i.e. , consummately selfish pricks who were happy to take government largesse when it was helping to bring them into the middle class , but then immediately pulled the ladder up behind themselves afterwards , demanding tax cuts – began to lash out politically , responding to any line of crap that would harmonize with their embarrassing victimization trope by promising a feel - good response offering the muscular bludgeoning of women and dark people , both at home and abroad .
In reality , of course , they were voting for a political movement that was talking tough - guy nationalism and scapegoating gays and other out - groups , but purely as a mask for further savaging the prosperity of these very idiot voters supporting their own undoing .
In exchange for some cheap rhetoric and the occasional third - world war , they lost their unions , they lost their good jobs to cheap overseas ( and , of course , violently non-organized ) labor , they lost government benefits like inexpensive higher education , and they lost a society where the gap between the middle class and economic elites was n't on the order of a standard - issue banana republic .

So what 's different today ?
I think there are big differences – at least of degree – on six fronts .
First , there is a marriage of convenience today between the economic oligarchy and regressive politicians which makes the era of Dwight Eisenhower look like Sweden by comparison .
I would say the single most fundamental fact of American politics in our time is that economic elites have walked away from the long - standing grand bargain of the 1930s through the 1970s .
They are , simply put , no longer satisfied to be ridiculously wealthy , and now demand to be obscenely so .
Instead of looking at the middle class as a source of national pride , it is for them an irritant to see even that small pittance of money in other people 's hands .
And , thus , they are trying ( and succeeding ) at reversing the basic deal that brought so much prosperity to so many American families in the mid-twentieth century , seeking a return to the good old days of Herbert Hoover and Calvin Coolidge .
Today 's Republican Party has become simply an instrument of that process – all the rest is window - dressing for marketing purposes .
Perhaps the best exemplar of this imperative was the ( so far ) unsuccessful play at privatizing Social Security .
Wall Street looks at that sitting mountain range of money – within view , but just beyond reach – in sheer ball - busting frustration .
It is one of the few government activities ( as opposed to healthcare , military hardware , prisons , etc. etc. ) that the overclass has n't yet been able to profitize .
Why should seniors have that money , they growl over brandy and cigars , when billionaires could instead ?
In short , the whole purpose of the political right has shifted dramatically in the past three decades .
Now , it 's entirely about the money .
Second , the level of deceit has grown exponentially .
Americans are now being told lies of astonishing proportions , as both the ‘ birther ' and ‘ deather ' movements of recent weeks make plain .
Before those it was Obama the socialist , Obama the fascist , Obama the sell - out apologist for America , Obama the secret Muslim , Obama the underminer of national security , Obama the pal of terrorists , and so on , and so on .
It 's to the point now that I feel sorry for satirists ( including me ) .
What can you possibly make up to top these amazing idiocies ?
Obama the Martian imposter of a homo sapien ?
Obama the JFK assassin ?
Obama the twentieth 9/11 hijacker ?
( Who secretly parachuted out at the last moment , and was picked up in the Hudson by a nuclear - powered speedboat driven by Saddam , and then transferred onto a black helicopter that landed minutes later on the roof of the UN ! )
Third , the sophistication of presentation has grown dramatically .
The right has really learned how to market its nonsense in a barrage that only enhances credibility from repetition .
You get it on the radio , on TV , from politicians , at church , on your computer and cell phone , in your mailbox and at the school board meeting .
This is a full - court press by clever people who know how to market soap flakes and the human kind as well .
There are many examples of this , but one of the most clever has been the defining of wholly corporate center - right political figures like Bill Clinton or Barack Obama as extreme leftists , and the defining of the mainstream media as hopelessly biased toward liberalism .
Perhaps as much as any other factors , these moves have employed framing and intimidation to effectively eliminate any real progressive ideas from the national political discourse .
Bravo , boys .
If it all was n't so sickeningly pernicious , I 'd have to give them a standing ovation for cleverness and , sadly , success .
Fourth , the level of credulity is breathtaking .
In the past , you could understand why a few crackers in ‘ Bama , third - grade education and all , could be seduced into blamin ' the niggrahs for their lousy low - rent lives and joining up with the KKK .
But look at the audiences today for Limbaugh , Beck , Hannity and the rest of the scary monsters all over television and radio .
These are giant crowds of tens of millions , especially collectively counted , and I do n't think these people are watching and listening just to laugh at the bozos on the air .
Speaking of whom , what in the world are these freaks doing on the air ?
What in the world happened to this country such that , fifth , all this massive deceit has gone mainstream in the media and the Republi- con Party ?
It 's astonishing today , from the perspective of prior decades , what comes out of the mouths even of leadership figures in one of America 's two major political parties , and what goes unchallenged as conventional wisdom .
There have always been regressive predators about in American politics , to be sure .
But in years past they would have been identified as such and marginalized accordingly .
Today , they are more likely to become president or Speaker of the House , and a slavishly obedient media dares not correct even the most obscene lies having the most dangerous consequences ( can you say " Iraq " ? ) .
Finally , unlike prior decades , the progressive counter - narrative has all but vanished from the mainstream .
The Democratic Party is nothing more than the sorta not -Republican Party , and stands for nothing other than a quieter and more slowly - unfolding version of the GOP 's crimes .
Nobody ever votes Democratic anymore .
They vote against the Republicans when they rise to their very most noxious worst behavior .
We have a president who is supposed to be a radical leftist , and says almost nothing to combat the fascist tide of thuggery now threatening the country .
Instead , he continues to seek approval from Republicans who never give it to him , game him at every turn , and repay his conciliatory efforts by asking for investigations into his birth certificate .
Senator Chris Dodd responded to last week 's Reichstag - burning events with this helpful bromide : " It 's a challenge , no question about it , and you 've got to get out there and make the case .
This is not the time for the faint - hearted . "
After which he continued to lead the very faintest - of - heart in their deafening silence .
Even supposedly liberal activist groups do n't demand very much anymore , other than the protection of the status quo .
For example , there is pretty much no serious player in or out of government right now talking about a single - payer system at this once - per-century occasion of momentous potential change in the American healthcare system .
The upshot of all this is a predatory - when - not - defunct political system going so far off the rails that it is now migrating from insanity to violent insanity .
Just ask your ( former ? ) local abortion provider .
Just ask your congressional representative , if you can penetrate the police escort now necessary to keep these people from becoming the victims of mob rule .
This should not be taken lightly .
There is huge anger out there , being stoked incessantly by those who profit from it , in one way or another .
Most frightening of all , it is , as far as I can see , completely impervious to rational discourse .
Suppose you could put a mountain of indisputable evidence in front of the eyes of those who believe Obama is seeking to murder seniors .
Does anyone think any of these folks could actually be persuaded to abandon that shockingly absurd fallacy ?
And this is , at the end of the day , the scariest aspect of all concerning the current political moment .
America now possesses a massive cohort of people who have simply transcended rational discourse – the sine qua non of democracy , and the real deity worshiped by Enlightenment figures like those who founded the country .
Two - and - a - half centuries later , and we 're moving rapidly backwards , toward the seventeenth century , and away from democracy , rule of law and the marketplace of ideas , debated and thoughtfully considered .
Everybody talks about fascism nowadays , not least those on the right who remarkably manage to call Barack Obama a fascist in the same breath as they label him a socialist .
The term has been beaten into near meaninglessness from ubiquitousness of application .
( Could this be another extremely clever semantics ploy of the right - wing marketing machine , taking the term out of use now that it is legitimately applicable , by over - and ab - using it ?
Damn , these guys are good . )
Still , I 've seen the video clips from the congressional constituent meetings last week .
I saw the ones from the Sarah Palin rallies in 2008 .
I remember the 2000 Brooks Brothers riot , one of the most despicable acts in American history , which resulted – because of one of the most cowardly acts in American history – in shutting down vote - counting in Miami .
I saw at least two purple - hearted American war heros turned into national security threats by a team of cowards who avoided war when it was their turn .
None of the rabble on the right could make the Grand Canyon size leap to see that for what it plainly was .
Today I see the incoherent rage , the senseless foaming at the mouth that not only does n't fit reality , but in fact runs completely contrary to it .
I see the current attempts to intimidate the government and to shut down the discussion of issues .
And I have to ask , do those people not resemble Brown Shirts more than anything else one can bring to mind ?
And is our current political moment not beginning to stink of Berlin , 1933 ?
If you arent a smoker , you might not have heard about the huge increase in cigarette taxes which took effect on April 1st .
On the first of this month , Federal excise taxes on cigarettes went up from 39 cents a pack to $ 1.01 per pack–an increase of 62 cents a pack .
This is an increase in the tax by about 159 % .
It is not fair to target one group of people–a group who are disproportionately from the lower class and who are addicted to a a product–and tax them for the benefit of others .
From the article I linked to above :
“ The rate of adult smoking in the United States is , in fact , directly related to household income , dropping in linear fashion as income rises .
Overall , 21 % of American adults smoke …
A different way to look at this smoking - by - income data is that slightly more than half of today ’s smokers ( 53 % ) earn less than $ 36,000 per year — making cigarette taxes highly regressive . ”
Here is a chart from the CBO on what percentage of taxes are paid by what range of wage earners .
I found this about a year ago when I was looking for evidence that President Bush ’s tax cuts benefited the rich way more than the poor .
It turns out that I was wrong about that , but more on that in another post .
I want you to look closely at this chart .
It will make the next couple of paragraphs make a lot more sense .
The lowest 20 % of wage earners pays .8 % of all federal taxes , the second 20 % pays 4.1 % of all taxes , the third 20 % pays 9.3 % of all federal taxes , the fourth 20 % pays 16.9 % of all federal taxes , and the top 20 % pays 68.7 % of all federal taxes .
This includes all income taxes , social insurance taxes , and excise taxes .
I like this chart because it allows you to look at excise taxes by themselves .
Scroll down to the bottom of the chart and they have the numbers for who pays the excise taxes in this country .
In this case , the bottom 20 % pays 11.1 % of excise taxes , the second 20 % pays 14.4 % of excise taxes , the third 20 % pays 18.1 % of excise taxes , the fourth 20 % pays 21.9 % of excise taxes , and the top 20 % pays 34.1 % of all excise taxes .
You can easily see that excise taxes fall much more heavily on the poor than do the average federal taxes .
In fact , you can see from the chart that the bottom 40 % actually pay no income taxes and even received money back from the government , while the third 20 % pays only 4.4 % .
Combined , the bottom 60 % of wage earners pay only .6 % of federal income taxes , but pay 43.6 % of all excise taxes .
The point here is that excise taxes excessively burden the poor when compared to other taxes .
As the numbers from Gallup above showed , smokers are disproportionately poor .
It sounds simple , but increasing taxes on a product used primarily by the poor amounts to an increase in the taxation of the poor .
This brings me to my next point .
Here is an article from the AP criticizing Mr. Obama for raising cigarette taxes and calling it a violation of campaign promises .
A couple of key quotes from the article :
“ ” I can make a firm pledge , ” he [ President Obama ] said in Dover , N.H. , on Sept. 12 .
“ Under my plan , no family making less than $ 250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase .
Not your income tax , not your payroll tax , not your capital gains taxes , not any of your taxes .
[ emphasis added by me ] ” ”
“ No one making less than $ 250,000 under Barack Obama ’s plan will see one single penny of their tax raised , ” Joe Biden said , “ whether it ’s their capital gains tax , their income tax , investment tax , any tax .
[ emphasis added by me ] ”
To me , the word “ any ” means “ any . ” I dont have ANY idea why it wouldnt .
And of course , this tax was enacted in the name of the “ public good . ”
The money will go to fund S - Chip–a program which gives medical care to children of the poor .
I find this ironic for two reasons .
The first is that the government is essentially taxing the poor to provide their children with a service .
The second is that the government is also claiming that an increase in the tax on cigarettes will lead to a decrease in the number of smokers .
Im sure that this is a correct assumption , but the government is missing ( or masking ) the point here .
From the Danville Register and Bee :
“ The twisted logic of this tax increase as a way to modify behavior should n’t go unnoticed .
If higher cigarette taxes convince more people to quit smoking , wo n’t the S - CHIP program need a new source of federal dollars in the future ?
Wo n’t that lead to different taxes being raised to continue to cover the same number of children ? ”
The cigarette companies themselves realized that an increase in federal cigarette taxes would decrease the number of consumers using their products .
Can you guess how they responded ?
Altria , the maker of Marlboro , increased their prices by 71 cents per pack for Marlboros , but 81 cents per pack for their menthol cigarettes ( which tend to be smoked more often by the poor than other cigarettes ) to cover the anticipated losses in smokers due to the new tax .
This means that those who dont quit are being forced to spend at least an additional $ 1.33 per pack of cigarettes .
I have a friend who supports the cigarette tax increase–he said “ its about damn time smokers pay their share . ”
But he is missing the point too .
Smokers pay their share–they have the same income tax rates as everyone else in the country .
They are being taxed to pay for a program that they may not use .
Our system of government is supposed to protect citizens against tyranny of the majority , and so I must reiterate my point from above :
It is not fair to target one group of people and tax them for the benefit of others .
It sets a bad precedent and only sounds good until the government decides that it wants to tax a product that you enjoy .

MOSCOW , Russia ( CNN ) --
The United States is " absolutely not " giving Israel a green light to attack Iran , U.S. President Barack Obama told CNN Tuesday .
President Obama meets Tuesday with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin near Moscow .
" We have said directly to the Israelis that it is important to try and resolve this in an international setting in a way that does not create major conflict in the Middle East , " Obama said , referring to Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
Obama has been in Moscow for a summit aimed at trying to reset the U.S. - Russian relationship .
On Sunday , U.S. Vice President Joe Biden appeared to leave the door open for Israel to attack Iran if it saw fit .
" Israel can determine for itself -- it 's a sovereign nation -- what 's in their interest and what they decide to do relative to Iran and anyone else , " Biden said on ABC 's " This Week . "
Obama said Tuesday that Biden had simply been stating a fact , not sending a signal .
" I think Vice President Biden stated a categorical fact , which is we can't dictate to other countries what their security interests are .
What is also true is that it is the policy of the United States to resolve the issue of Iran 's nuclear capabilities in a peaceful way through diplomatic channels , " he said .
Watch CNN's Ed Henry interview President Obama »
The top U.S. military leader , Adm . Mike Mullen , said later on Tuesday that he understands Israel 's position .
" The Israelis see Iran achieving a nuclear capability as an existential threat , and that fact is tied to the rhetoric of the leadership of Iran , which ... has said that they would seek to eliminate Israel , " said Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
His counterparts in the Gulf also understand the Israeli stance , whether or not they agree , Mullen said .
" That gets back to the criticality ... of solving this before Iran gets a nuclear capability , or that anyone ... would take action to strike them .
And I think that window is a very narrow window , " he said in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .
He said he hoped diplomacy would resolve the issue .
" I am hopeful that that dialogue is productive .
I worry about it a great deal if it's not , " Mullen said .
The State Department took a similar line on Monday .
" Our goal here is to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons .
When I say ' our ' it is just not the United States -- it is the international community , " spokesman Ian Kelly said .
" Israel is a sovereign country .
We are not going to dictate its actions .
We also are committed to Israel 's security and we share Israel 's deep concerns about Iran 's nuclear program . "
Asked if this could be interpreted as the United States flashing a green light for Israel to attack Iran 's nuclear sites , Kelly said , " I certainly would not want to give a green light to any kind of military action . "
The Israeli government considers Iran 's nuclear program to be the dominant threat facing the country .
CNN White House Correspondent Ed Henry in Moscow and CNN's Emily Sherman in Washington contributed to this report .

Kardashian Friend Reveals New Venture
This Kardashian BFF and baby mama has launched her very own mama and baby clothing line .
Malika Haqq – Khloe Kardashian 's longtime best friend – partnered with Naked Wardrobe to create her Mama Malika clothing collection .
Calatrava adopted the strategy of giving a volumetric treatment to the roof and walls - physical limits of the landscape outside and the winery within - so that continuity between the two spaces is achieved through the " static movement " of the enclosures .
Two 196 meter long concrete , load - bearing walls , placed 26 meters apart , trace a sinusoidal shape in both plan and elevation .
The roof , composed of a series of laminated wooden beams , supported on the staggered sinusoidal cornice of the lateral walls , is treated as a continuation of the facades .
The result is a ruled surface wave , which combines concave and convex surfaces as it evolves along the longitudinal axis .
The building is outlined as a simple rectangular plan , along an east - west axis , to accommodate the linear program for the wine making process .
Two entrances in the side facades emphasize this linearity .
The interior of the winery unfolds in a roughly linear sequence on two levels , with hoppers of grapes entering on the west and finished cases of bottled wine exiting to the east .
Calatrava exposed the utilitarian nature of the interiors , specifying simple materials and finishes and allowing the swooping ceilings and zigzagging walls to provide the visual excitement.via arcspace

The active ingredient in marijuana appears to target cancerous brain cells for destruction while leaving healthy cells alone , according to a study conducted by researchers from the Complutense University in Madrid , and published in the Researchers first conducted an experiment in mice that had been engineered to carry three different grafts of human brain cancer .
They injected the mice daily with the molecule tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) near the site of the tumors once each day .
The chemical appeared to stimulate the cancerous cells to engage in a process known as autophagy , in which cells initiate their own breakdown .
" These results may help to design new cancer therapies based on the use of medicines containing the active principle of marijuana and / or in the activation of autophagy , " researcher Guillermo Velasco said .
THC belongs to a class of chemicals known as cannabinoids , named after the cannabis ( marijuana ) plant in which they occur .
It is the chemical responsible for the psychoactive effects of marijuana consumption .
In a followup experiment , the researchers extracted and analyzed brain tissue from two patients with an aggressive form of brain cancer known as " recurrent glioblastoma multiforme . "
The patients were treated with THC for either 26 or 30 days , then the researchers extracted and analyzed another sample .
After examining the brain tissue under an electron microscope , the researchers discovered that THC treatment resulted in death of cancerous cells but had no effect on healthy ones .
The researchers were also able to discover the signaling pathway by which THC acts .
The research opens up the possibility that cannabinoid research could yield " a new family of potential antitumoral agents , " the researchers wrote .
Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common and aggressive form of primary brain tumor .
Without treatment , the average patient lives only three months after being diagnosed with the cancer .
Treatment extends the average life expectancy after diagnosis by less than a year .

There 's a lot of doom and gloom floating around about health - care reform , it 's hard not to let it get you down .
But Nate Silver explains why Obamacare wo n't die anytime soon :
I had argued previously that Obama should have done more to frame the debate and put a particular health care bill in front of Congress , rather than letting Congress handle it themselves .
Maybe health care would be in a little bit better shape right now if he had done that and maybe it would n't ; we 'll never really be able to test the counterfactual .
But because he did n't do that , Obama still has most of his tactical flexibility intact .
And there are at least four scenarios under which health care reform could still pass this year :
1. Whip Democrats Into Submission .
This is probably the closest thing to the default approach .
So long as there are a dozen or a half - dozen different iterations of health care floating around Capitol Hill , individual Democratic Congressmen can afford to bargain for their preferred version .
" Progressive " Democrats from rich districts can object to the plan of raising taxes on the very wealthy to pay for expanded coverage .
Labor - backed Democrats can try and play hardball on any proposal to remove the benefits tax exemption .
The Blue Dogs can howl at the moon for whatever it is they want -- probably some kind of sweeteners for rural districts , like the ones given to farm - state Democrats on the climate bill .
And advocates of the public option can continue to treat it as a sine qua non and threaten to oppose any bill that does n't include one .
Once a particular bill is put up to a vote , however , the overwhelming majority of Democrats are going to have a difficult time voting against it .
Health care reform remains quite popular in theory and at least marginally popular in practice .
It will probably do the most good for those districts where conservative Democrats tend to reside .
And then there is the oldest motivator of all : survival .
The failure of health care reform in 1994 may have damaged Bill Clinton -- but it really damaged the Congressional Democrats , who lost 54 seats in the House and another 8 in the Senate .
Of the 36 incumbent Democrats who lost that year , only four ( North Carolina 's David Price , Ohio's Ted Strickland and Washington 's Maria Cantwell and Jay Inslee ) would ever return to the Congress ( whereas Clinton , of course , was re-elected ) .
Any Democrat who votes against health care , moreover , can expect to be permanently shut off from the Obama - run DNC and from most or all grassroots fundraising drives , and many of them can probably expect a primary challenger .
There are probably some Democrats who would be better off if health care went away .
But once it comes up to vote , I 'd imagine there will be very few who are actually better off voting against it .
Computers ' could disable children '
By BBC correspondent Christine Stewart Children learning to use computers are being put at risk of permanent injury , some health experts are warning .
They say thousands of children have already been damaged by medical problems associated with the operation of computers .
I think we are on a threshold of what could be a global disaster
Dr Leon Straker
These problems - neck , back and repetitive strain injuries ( RSI ) - have long been recognised as being linked to prolonged computer use and incorrect posture in adults .
As yet , no significant research into the risks of RSI among children , who spend hours on computers doing homework or playing games , has been carried out in the UK .
But doctors are reporting an increasing number of children complaining of computer - related injuries .
Muscles and bones Dr Leon Straker , who is researching the problem in Australia , believes the future is bleak for UK children unless more work is carried out to tackle such injuries .
" I think we are on a threshold of what could be a global disaster , " he said .
" This is the first generation of children who have used computers from early childhood while their muscles and bones are developing .
" If we do n't get knowledge quickly about how to use computers safely , then I think we will see a lot of children disabled from using computers . "
Dr Straker 's research at Curtin University in Perth involves using electrodes and mirrors wired to a computer to monitor children 's movements when they are using a mouse or keyboard .
' Nuisance pain '
One child experiencing the problem is Charlotte Cook , 14 , who has been receiving intensive treatment from a chiropractor for four years .
She suffers severe pain in her neck and back , which is always worse after prolonged periods on a computer .
" It 's like a muscular pain and a nuisance pain , " she said
We need to be setting healthy habits for children in school
Kim Beat , head teacher " It just wo n't go away and it does n't matter how you try to sit or lie you just can't get comfortable . "
Her chiropractor Anna Franklin says Charlotte is not alone , and she believes that there is going to be an increase in cases of RSI and posture problems among children .
Some schools are beginning to address the issue .
Head teacher Kim Beat realised that the more time she spent on her computer , the more painful her arms became .
She is now inviting RSI specialists into classes at Barham Primary in Wembley , London , to teach pupils how to work safely .
Adjustable furniture
She said : " It 's important parents understand the issues about RSI .
" We need to be setting healthy habits for children in school because they 're not going to get RSI in the 45 minutes that they use computers in school - it's when they 're at home doing school work or playing games that they could develop it . "
Advisers who visit the school start by looking at each child 's workstation .
Part of the problem in schools is that each class uses the same computer room , with chairs and desks which may not be adjustable for individual children .
There is usually only one size of mouse , which may not be appropriate for different hands .
Experts ' warnings are now being taken into account at Barham Primary so that any new furniture and equipment ordered can be adjusted to suit all its children from the ages of five to 11 .
Some human rights and employment lawyers specialising in RSI cases in adults now believe that , unless preventative measures are taken nationwide , schools could face legal action from pupils and parents claiming they have not fulfilled their " duty of care " responsibilities .

Diamonds in a Cloudy Sky
Credit & Copyright : Óscar Martín Mesonero ( OSAE ) , SAROS Group
Explanation : Cloudy skies over Wuhan , China hid the delicate solar corona during July 's total eclipse of the Sun.
Still , the Moon 's silhouette was highlighted by these glistening diamonds as the total eclipse phase ended .
Caused by bright sunlight streaming through dips and valleys in the irregular terrain along the Moon 's edge , the effect is known as Baily 's Beads , named after Francis Baily who called attention to the phenomenon in 1836 .
The dramatic appearance of the beads at the beginning or end of a total solar eclipse is also known as the Diamond Ring effect .
In this remarkable image , a small , pinkish solar prominence can also be seen along the edge , below the diamonds .
On the day of the funeral of Natalya Estemirova ( Natasha to her friends ) , a leading investigative researcher for Memorial human rights centre in Chechnya , her friends and colleagues gathered at the Memorial office in Grozny .
" Who is next in line ? " a sign said .
All of us there were devastated by Estemirova 's brazen murder , following her abduction by unidentified men who appeared to be law enforcement officers , on 15 July .
Many women were crying , while the men stood there grimly , as if entranced .
They knew someone would eventually be next , but thought that after Estemirova 's killing there would be at least a lull , a respite .
No one expected that less than a month later many of the same people would gather for another funeral .
This time that of Zarema Sadulayeva and Alik Dzhabrailov , from a small Chechen charity , Save the Generation .
They were found dead in the trunk of Dzhabrailov 's car on the outskirts of Grozny on 11 August , at about 4 am , confirming the worst fears of their family and colleagues .
They had been led away from their office in the Chechen capital the previous afternoon by five unidentified men , who said they were members of local security services .
Three of them were wearing black uniforms and carried weapons .
Several of the men returned to the organisation 's office soon afterward and took Dzhabrailov 's mobile phone and his car .
They assured the organisation 's staff that Sadulayeva and Dzhabrailov were all right and would soon come back .
They even left a mobile phone number " in case there would be any problems " .
In another couple of hours , with Sadulayeva and Dzhabrailov still missing , people tried calling the number – it proved to be out of the coverage area .
By the next day there was neither time nor reason to continue to call – the funeral of Sadulayeva and Dzhabrailov had to be arranged .
Save the Generation is a non-governmental organisation founded in 2001 that provides psychological and physical rehabilitation to children with disabilities , orphans and victims of landmines in Chechnya .
Sadulayeva , one of its founders and most active members , started running the group in 2005 , after the murder of its first director , Murad Muradov .
Dzhabrailov joined the organisation when he married Sadulayeva this year .
Estemirova had worked on some of the most sensitive cases of rights abuses in Chechnya : she documented extrajudicial executions , acts of torture and enforced disappearances by Chechen law enforcement and security agencies , and the Chechen authorities did not mince words to express their discontent with her and Memorial on numerous occasions .
By contrast , Save the Generation stayed away from sensitive political issues and controversy , focusing on humanitarian problems .
What made Estemirova and Sadulayeva similar , in addition to their horrifying deaths , was their unwavering dedication to helping the victims in Chechnya and their absolute independence from local authorities .
Independent activists are not tolerated in contemporary Chechnya .
This intolerance goes far beyond the seething contempt officials have expressed for human rights activists – it can be lethal .
As with the murder of Estemirova , there are grounds for suspecting official collusion by local authorities in the killing of Sadulayeva and Dzhabrailov and this possibility needs to be pursued by the investigation .
These killings brings to four the number of activists working on Chechnya who have been killed this year , starting with Stanislav Markelov , a prominent human rights lawyer , in January .
The perpetrators of all these crimes are at large , and this stark impunity is apparently inspiring more vicious and deadly attacks on activists in the region .
Only a thorough , effective investigation that ends in the prosecution of the killers can put an end to the chain of attacks .
Otherwise , more murders are bound to follow and we 'll keep asking ourselves , " Who 's next in line ? "
Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard exposed as a ' fraud ' by British diplomats 30 years ago
British diplomats investigating the qualifications of L Ron Hubbard exposed the Scientology founder as a fraud 30 years ago .
The science - fiction writer , who invented the religion now followed by celebrities including Tom Cruise and John Travolta , awarded himself a PhD from a sham ' diploma mill ' college he had acquired in California .
British consulate workers in Los Angeles secretly gathered information on behalf of the government .
Whitehall officials launched the covert investigation after Scientologists threatened to sue over the government 's 1968 decision to ban followers from entering the UK to visit the sect 's headquarters in East Grinstead , West Sussex .
Fraud : Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard awarded himself a PhD from a sham ' diploma mill ' college he had acquired in California
Britain needed to establish whether Hubbard was a charalatan to defend itself against any libel action .
The evidence was gathered during the 1970s and included the claim by a US official that the sect had sent bogus doctors to hypnotise a legal investigator , forcing him to retire ' due to his mental health ' .
The Department of Health files , many of which were classified until 2019 , were released to The Times by the National Archive following a Freedom of Information request .
Devotees : Hollywood stars Tom Cruise , pictured with wife Katie Holmes , and John Travolta , seen here with his wife Kelly Preston , are Scientologists
The dossier includes a signed statement by former senior Scientologist John McMaster , who said Hubbard and others faked ‘ qualifications ’ in Dianetics , the spiritual ‘ science ’ founded by Hubbard to provide spiritual healing .
He said : ' I understand it is asserted that L Ron Hubbard was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy by Sequoia University on February 10 1953 , in recognition of his outstanding work in the fields of Dianetics and Scientology and that the said degree was recorded with the Department of Education of the State of California .
' The position is L Ron Hubbard [ and others ] acquired premises somewhere in Los Angeles which they had registered as a university called Sequoia and immediately awarded each other doctorates . '
The Scientology headquarters in Los Angeles : British officials in California secretly gathered information on the sect during the 1970s
The British government had sent an urgent telegram to its consulate in Los Angeles asking officials there to find out as much information about Hubbard and Scientology as possible .
A reply on April 26 1977 said : ' After exhaustive enquiries we have now tracked down organisation named which was closed down by state authorities in 1971 and all documents impounded .
' The facts are that it neither has nor ever had approval and its status is not recognised in California ...
' It is a " will of the wisp " organisation which has no premises and does not really exist .
It has not and never had any authority whatsoever to issue diplomas or degrees and the dean is sought by the authorities " for questioning " . '
American officials were also investigating the origins of Hubbard ’s qualifications , the records show .
A letter from the California bureau of school approvals about the Sequoia university said : ' This institution has never been approved or recognised by this office .
Repeated attempts have been made to obtain compliance with the legal requirements .
None of these attempts have proved successful .'
Another telegram was dated May 18 1977 and written by Louis Sherbourne of the British Consulate - General in Los Angeles .
It shows that US officials were becoming nervous in their dealings with the sect .
It read : ' We have now come up against the usual brick wall of missing files and silence , each and every person and organisation treading very warily for fear of a libel or slander action . '
Mr Sherbourne added : ' United States Internal Revenue Services tried hard to obtain firmer evidence but appear to have failed .
A recent attempt to resurrect the enquiry resulted in all the papers from 1939 to 1963 being sent to Sacramento to the office of the State Attorney General .
' By 'an amazing coincidence ' the Deputy Attorney General dealing with them was taken ill and after seeing some ' doctors ' was retired " due to his mental health " .
' My very incensed informant in the California Department of Education is convinced that the " doctors " were scientologists who hypnotised him into mental ill - health and he feels very bitter but can do nothing about it '
A spokeswoman for the Church of Scientology dismissed the suggestion Scientologists had hypnotised a deputy attorney general .
She told The Times it is ' simply reflective of how astronomically paranoid they were ' .

O MIGHTY CALIPH AND Commander of the Faithful , I am humbled to be in the splendor of your presence ; a man can hope for no greater blessing as long as he lives .
The story I have to tell is truly a strange one , and were the entirety to be tattooed at the corner of one 's eye , the marvel of its presentation would not exceed that of the events recounted , for it is a warning to those who would be warned and a lesson to those who would learn .
My name is Fuwaad ibn Abbas , and I was born here in Baghdad , City of Peace .
My father was a grain merchant , but for much of my life I have worked as a purveyor of fine fabrics , trading in silk from Damascus and linen from Egypt and scarves from Morocco that are embroidered with gold .
I was prosperous , but my heart was troubled , and neither the purchase of luxuries nor the giving of alms was able to soothe it .
Now I stand before you without a single dirham in my purse , but I am at peace .
Allah is the beginning of all things , but with Your Majesty 's permission , I begin my story with the day I took a walk through the district of metalsmiths .
I needed to purchase a gift for a man I had to do business with , and had been told he might appreciate a tray made of silver .
After browsing for half an hour , I noticed that one of the largest shops in the market had been taken over by a new merchant .
It was a prized location that must have been expensive to acquire , so I entered to peruse its wares .
Never before had I seen such a marvelous assortment of goods .
Near the entrance there was an astrolabe equipped with seven plates inlaid with silver , a water - clock that chimed on the hour , and a nightingale made of brass that sang when the wind blew .
Farther inside there were even more ingenious mechanisms , and I stared at them the way a child watches a juggler , when an old man stepped out from a doorway in the back .
" Welcome to my humble shop , my lord , " he said .
" My name is Bashaarat .
How may I assist you ? "
" These are remarkable items that you have for sale .
I deal with traders from every corner of the world , and yet I have never seen their like .
From where , may I ask , did you acquire your merchandise ? "
" I am grateful to you for your kind words , " he said .
" Everything you see here was made in my workshop , by myself or by my assistants under my direction . "
I was impressed that this man could be so well versed in so many arts .
I asked him about the various instruments in his shop , and listened to him discourse learnedly about astrology , mathematics , geomancy , and medicine .
We spoke for over an hour , and my fascination and respect bloomed like a flower warmed by the dawn , until he mentioned his experiments in alchemy .
" Alchemy ? " I said .
This surprised me , for he did not seem the type to make such a sharper 's claim .
" You mean you can turn base metal into gold ? "
" I can , my lord , but that is not in fact what most seek from alchemy . "
" What do most seek , then ? "
" They seek a source of gold that is cheaper than mining ore from the ground .
Alchemy does describe a means to make gold , but the procedure is so arduous that , by comparison , digging beneath a mountain is as easy as plucking peaches from a tree . "
I smiled .
" A clever reply .
No one could dispute that you are a learned man , but I know better than to credit alchemy . "
Bashaarat looked at me and considered .
" I have recently built something that may change your opinion .
You would be the first person I have shown it to .
Would you care to see it ? "
" It would be a great pleasure . "
" Please follow me . "
He led me through the doorway in the rear of his shop .
The next room was a workshop , arrayed with devices whose functions I could not guess — bars of metal wrapped with enough copper thread to reach the horizon , mirrors mounted on a circular slab of granite floating in quicksilver — but Bashaarat walked past these without a glance .
Instead he led me to a sturdy pedestal , chest high , on which a stout metal hoop was mounted upright .
The hoop 's opening was as wide as two outstretched hands , and its rim so thick that it would tax the strongest man to carry .
The metal was black as night , but polished to such smoothness that , had it been a different color , it could have served as a mirror .
Bashaarat bade me stand so that I looked upon the hoop edgewise , while he stood next to its opening .
" Please observe , " he said .
Bashaarat thrust his arm through the hoop from the right side , but it did not extend out from the left .
Instead , it was as if his arm were severed at the elbow , and he waved the stump up and down , and then pulled his arm out intact .
I had not expected to see such a learned man perform a conjuror 's trick , but it was well done , and I applauded politely .
" Now wait a moment , " he said as he took a step back .
I waited , and behold , an arm reached out of the hoop from its left side , without a body to hold it up .
The sleeve it wore matched Bashaarat 's robe .
The arm waved up and down , and then retreated through the hoop until it was gone .
The first trick I had thought a clever mime , but this one seemed far superior , because the pedestal and hoop were clearly too slender to conceal a person .
" Very clever ! " I exclaimed .
" Thank you , but this is not mere sleight of hand .
The right side of the hoop precedes the left by several seconds .
To pass through the hoop is to cross that duration instantly . "
" I do not understand , " I said .
" Let me repeat the demonstration . "
Again he thrust his arm through the hoop , and his arm disappeared .
He smiled , and pulled back and forth as if playing tug - a - rope .
Then he pulled his arm out again , and presented his hand to me with the palm open .
On it lay a ring I recognized .
" That is my ring ! " I checked my hand , and saw that my ring still lay on my finger .
" You have conjured up a duplicate . "
" No , this is truly your ring .
Wait . "
Again , an arm reached out from the left side .
Wishing to discover the mechanism of the trick , I rushed over to grab it by the hand .
It was not a false hand , but one fully warm and alive as mine .
I pulled on it , and it pulled back .
Then , as deft as a pickpocket , the hand slipped the ring from my finger and the arm withdrew into the hoop , vanishing completely .
" My ring is gone ! " I exclaimed .
" No , my lord , " he said .
" Your ring is here . "
And he gave me the ring he held .
" Forgive me for my game . "
I replaced it on my finger .
" You had the ring before it was taken from me . "
At that moment an arm reached out , this time from the right side of the hoop .
" What is this ? " I exclaimed .
Again I recognized it as his by the sleeve before it withdrew , but I had not seen him reach in .
" Recall , " he said , " the right side of the hoop precedes the left . "
And he walked over to the left side of the hoop , and thrust his arm through from that side , and again it disappeared .
Your Majesty has undoubtedly already grasped this , but it was only then that I understood : whatever happened on the right side of the hoop was complemented , a few seconds later , by an event on the left side .
" Is this sorcery ? " I asked .
" No , my lord , I have never met a djinni , and if I did , I would not trust it to do my bidding .
This is a form of alchemy . "
He offered an explanation , speaking of his search for tiny pores in the skin of reality , like the holes that worms bore into wood , and how upon finding one he was able to expand and stretch it the way a glassblower turns a dollop of molten glass into a long - necked pipe , and how he then allowed time to flow like water at one mouth while causing it to thicken like syrup at the other .
I confess I did not really understand his words , and cannot testify to their truth .
All I could say in response was , " You have created something truly astonishing . "
" Thank you , " he said , " but this is merely a prelude to what I intended to show you . "
He bade me follow him into another room , farther in the back .
There stood a circular doorway whose massive frame was made of the same polished black metal , mounted in the middle of the room .
" What I showed you before was a Gate of Seconds , " he said .
" This is a Gate of Years .
The two sides of the doorway are separated by a span of twenty years . "
I confess I did not understand his remark immediately .
I imagined him reaching his arm in from the right side and waiting twenty years before it emerged from the left side , and it seemed a very obscure magic trick .
I said as much , and he laughed .
" That is one use for it , " he said , " but consider what would happen if you were to step through . "
Standing on the right side , he gestured for me to come closer , and then pointed through the doorway .
" Look . "
I looked , and saw that there appeared to be different rugs and pillows on the other side of the room than I had seen when I had entered .
I moved my head from side to side , and realized that when I peered through the doorway , I was looking at a different room from the one I stood in .
" You are seeing the room twenty years from now , " said Bashaarat .
I blinked , as one might at an illusion of water in the desert , but what I saw did not change .
" And you say I could step through ? " I asked .
" You could .
And with that step , you would visit the Baghdad of twenty years hence .
You could seek out your older self and have a conversation with him .
Afterwards , you could step back through the Gate of Years and return to the present day . "
Hearing Bashaarat 's words , I felt as if I were reeling .
" You have done this ? " I asked him .
" You have stepped through ? "
" I have , and so have numerous customers of mine . "
" Earlier you said I was the first to whom you showed this . "
" This Gate , yes .
But for many years I owned a shop in Cairo , and it was there that I first built a Gate of Years .
There were many to whom I showed that Gate , and who made use of it . "
" What did they learn when talking to their older selves ? "
" Each person learns something different .
If you wish , I can tell you the story of one such person . "
Bashaarat proceeded to tell me such a story , and if it pleases Your Majesty , I will recount it here .
THE TALE OF THE FORTUNATE ROPE - MAKER
THERE ONCE WAS a young man named Hassan who was a maker of rope .
He stepped through the Gate of Years to see the Cairo of twenty years later , and upon arriving he marveled at how the city had grown .
He felt as if he had stepped into a scene embroidered on a tapestry , and even though the city was no more and no less than Cairo , he looked upon the most common sights as objects of wonder .
He was wandering by the Zuweyla Gate , where the sword dancers and snake charmers perform , when an astrologer called to him .
" Young man !
Do you wish to know the future ? "
Hassan laughed .
" I know it already , " he said .
" Surely you want to know if wealth awaits you , do you not ? "
" I am a rope - maker .
I know that it does not . "
" Can you be so sure ?
What about the renowned merchant Hassan al - Hubbaul , who began as a rope - maker ? "
His curiosity aroused , Hassan asked around the market for others who knew of this wealthy merchant , and found that the name was well known .
It was said he lived in the wealthy Habbaniya quarter of the city , so Hassan walked there and asked people to point out his house , which turned out to be the largest one on its street .
He knocked at the door , and a servant led him to a spacious and well - appointed hall with a fountain in the center .
Hassan waited while the servant went to fetch his master , but as he looked at the polished ebony and marble around him , he felt that he did not belong in such surroundings , and was about to leave when his older self appeared .
" At last you are here ! " the man said .
" I have been expecting you ! "
" You have ? " said Hassan , astounded .
" Of course , because I visited my older self just as you are visiting me .
It has been so long that I had forgotten the exact day .
Come , dine with me . "
The two went to a dining room , where servants brought chicken stuffed with pistachio nuts , fritters soaked in honey , and roast lamb with spiced pomegranates .
The older Hassan gave few details of his life : he mentioned business interests of many varieties , but did not say how he had become a merchant ; he mentioned a wife , but said it was not time for the younger man to meet her .
Instead , he asked young Hassan to remind him of the pranks he had played as a child , and he laughed to hear stories that had faded from his own memory .
At last the younger Hassan asked the older , " How did you make such great changes in your fortune ? "
" All I will tell you right now is this : when you go to buy hemp from the market , and you are walking along the Street of Black Dogs , do not walk along the south side as you usually do .
Walk along the north . "
" And that will enable me to raise my station ? "
" Just do as I say .
Go back home now ; you have rope to make .
You will know when to visit me again . "
Young Hassan returned to his day and did as he was instructed , keeping to the north side of the street even when there was no shade there .
It was a few days later that he witnessed a maddened horse run amok on the south side of the street directly opposite him , kicking several people , injuring another by knocking a heavy jug of palm oil onto him , and even trampling one person under its hooves .
After the commotion had subsided , Hassan prayed to Allah for the injured to be healed and the dead to be at peace , and thanked Allah for sparing him .
The next day Hassan stepped through the Gate of Years and sought out his older self .
" Were you injured by the horse when you walked by ? " he asked him .
" No , because I heeded my older self 's warning .
Do not forget , you and I are one ; every circumstance that befalls you once befell me . "
And so the elder Hassan gave the younger instructions , and the younger obeyed them .
He refrained from buying eggs from his usual grocer , and thus avoided the illness that struck customers who bought eggs from a spoiled basket .
He bought extra hemp , and thus had material to work with when others suffered a shortage due to a delayed caravan .
Following his older self 's instructions spared Hassan many troubles , but he wondered why his older self would not tell him more .
Who would he marry ?
How would he become wealthy ?
Then one day , after having sold all his rope in the market and carrying an unusually full purse , Hassan bumped into a boy while walking on the street .
He felt for his purse , discovered it missing , and turned around with a shout to search the crowd for the pickpocket .
Hearing Hassan 's cry , the boy immediately began running through the crowd .
Hassan saw that the boy 's tunic was torn at the elbow , but then quickly lost sight of him .
For a moment Hassan was shocked that this could happen with no warning from his older self .
But his surprise was soon replaced by anger , and he gave chase .
He ran through the crowd , checking the elbows of boys ' tunics , until by chance he found the pickpocket crouching beneath a fruit wagon .
Hassan grabbed him and began shouting to all that he had caught a thief , asking them to find a guardsman .
The boy , afraid of arrest , dropped Hassan 's purse and began weeping .
Hassan stared at the boy for a long moment , and then his anger faded , and he let him go .
When next he saw his older self , Hassan asked him , " Why did you not warn me about the pickpocket ? "
" Did you not enjoy the experience ? " asked his older self .
Hassan was about to deny it , but stopped himself .
" I did enjoy it , " he admitted .
In pursuing the boy , with no hint of whether he 'd succeed or fail , he had felt his blood surge in a way it had not for many weeks .
And seeing the boy 's tears had reminded him of the Prophet 's teachings on the value of mercy , and Hassan had felt virtuous in choosing to let the boy go .
" Would you rather I had denied you that , then ? "
Just as we grow to understand the purpose of customs that seemed pointless to us in our youth , Hassan realized that there was merit in withholding information as well as in disclosing it .
" No , " he said , " it was good that you did not warn me . "
The older Hassan saw that he had understood .
" Now I will tell you something very important .
Hire a horse .
I will give you directions to a spot in the foothills to the west of the city .
There you will find within a grove of trees one that was struck by lightning .
Around the base of the tree , look for the heaviest rock you can overturn , and then dig beneath it . "
" What should I look for ? "
" You will know when you find it . "
The next day Hassan rode out to the foothills and searched until he found the tree .
The ground around it was covered in rocks , so Hassan overturned one to dig beneath it , and then another , and then another .
At last his spade struck something besides rock and soil .
He cleared aside the soil and discovered a bronze chest , filled with gold dinars and assorted jewelry .
Hassan had never seen its like in all his life .
He loaded the chest onto the horse , and rode back to Cairo .
The next time he spoke to his older self , he asked , " How did you know where the treasure was ? "
" I learned it from myself , " said the older Hassan , " just as you did .
As to how we came to know its location , I have no explanation except that it was the will of Allah , and what other explanation is there for anything ? "
" I swear I shall make good use of these riches that Allah has blessed me with , " said the younger Hassan .
" And I renew that oath , " said the older .
" This is the last time we shall speak .
You will find your own way now .
Peace be upon you . "
And so Hassan returned home .
With the gold he was able to purchase hemp in great quantity , and hire workmen and pay them a fair wage , and sell rope profitably to all who sought it .
He married a beautiful and clever woman , at whose advice he began trading in other goods , until he was a wealthy and respected merchant .
All the while he gave generously to the poor and lived as an upright man .
In this way Hassan lived the happiest of lives until he was overtaken by death , breaker of ties and destroyer of delights .
" That is a remarkable story , " I said .
" For someone who is debating whether to make use of the Gate , there could hardly be a better inducement . "
" You are wise to be skeptical , " said Bashaarat .
" Allah rewards those he wishes to reward and chastises those he wishes to chastise .
The Gate does not change how he regards you . "
I nodded , thinking I understood .
" So even if you succeed in avoiding the misfortunes that your older self experienced , there is no assurance you will not encounter other misfortunes . "
" No , forgive an old man for being unclear .
Using the Gate is not like drawing lots , where the token you select varies with each turn .
Rather , using the Gate is like taking a secret passageway in a palace , one that lets you enter a room more quickly than by walking down the hallway .
The room remains the same , no matter which door you use to enter . "
This surprised me .
" The future is fixed , then ?
As unchangeable as the past ? "
" It is said that repentance and atonement erase the past . "
" I have heard that too , but I have not found it to be true . "
" I am sorry to hear that , " said Bashaarat .
" All I can say is that the future is no different . "
I thought on this for a while .
" So if you learn that you are dead twenty years from now , there is nothing you can do to avoid your death ? "
He nodded .
This seemed to me very disheartening , but then I wondered if it could not also provide a guarantee .
I said , " Suppose you learn that you are alive twenty years from now .
Then nothing could kill you in the next twenty years .
You could then fight in battles without a care , because your survival is assured . "
" That is possible , " he said .
" It is also possible that a man who would make use of such a guarantee would not find his older self alive when he first used the Gate . "
" Ah , " I said .
" Is it then the case that only the prudent meet their older selves ? "
" Let me tell you the story of another person who used the Gate , and you can decide for yourself if he was prudent or not . "
Bashaarat proceeded to tell me the story , and if it pleases Your Majesty , I will recount it here .

Champion of the Dark Side
An unstoppable force of darkness , the Sith Warrior is entrusted with the task of destroying the Empire ’s enemies and enforcing Sith domination across the galaxy .
The Warrior channels the destructive emotions of fear , anger , and hatred to purge weakness from body and mind and become a being of pure , brutal efficiency .
Destined to eradicate the incompetent chaos created by the Jedi , the Sith seek to rule the galaxy through power and intimidation .
The armies of the Sith Empire are trained to accomplish this task , but they require the leadership of bold Sith Warriors — loyal and mighty overlords — who will drive them to conquest and victory .
These cold - blooded conquerors waste no time with cunning manipulations and carefully - crafted plans .
Sith Warriors crush their opponents and stride toward their goals with dreadful determination , leaving ruin and annihilation in their wake .
Emanating awe and terror at every step , they accept nothing but absolute obedience from their followers .
In turn , Sith Warriors can serve as loyal subjects to their own dark masters , often surprising enemies and allies with their rigorous honor and perfect discipline .
Whether they align their ambitions with those of the Dark Council or become renegades in pursuit of their own goals , they are never far from the action .
Their fierce hatred of the Jedi keeps Sith Warriors at the forefront of any conflict with the Republic .
The passion to eradicate the Jedi Order fuels many of their actions , but that does not make them single - minded fools .
Ultimately , the destiny of any Sith Warrior is his own to choose … and woe to those who would stand in his way .
Working with Others
A natural leader in any context , a Sith Warrior inspires both fear and undying loyalty into his followers and allies .
Though they rarely exercise patience for incompetence or indecisiveness , Warriors have realized the importance of strength in numbers in their war with the Jedi , and have learned to accept and sometimes even encourage their comrades , whether they are like - minded Sith , ruthless Bounty Hunters , or others who embrace the darkness .
“ The turning point for me was when I was able to see it less as an issue of censorship because we are not suppressing original material , ’’ Donatich said .
“ We are just not reprinting what was available elsewhere .
. . .
At that point , it became a security issue and not a censorship issue . ’’
Yale insists it had no responsible alternative .
Yale University Press director John Donatich said the university polled two dozen security and counterterrorism officials and academics who study Islam , and the majority of the security experts agreed that reprinting the images involved a risk of deadly violence .
Some scholars and conservative bloggers are accusing Yale of cowardice , arguing that academic freedom should not be surrendered to a handful of extremists .
And an Arab political website in Cairo is railing about the Danish professor from a Jewish university trying to publish cartoons to insult the Prophet , hardly the case by any measure .
Now she finds herself entangled in debates that sometimes seem reduced to posturing on the Internet , stripped of nuance , not unlike the original cartoon conflict .
Klausen , a native of Denmark who has been at Brandeis for 17 years and is a specialist on Muslim communities in Europe , seemed the ideal author to unravel how and why the original publication of the cartoons in the Jyllands - Posten newspaper resulted , several months later , in boycotts , protests , and violence thousands of miles away .
“ The metaphor I use is the monster in the woods :
You ca n’t see it at night but you know it ’s there , and if you provoke the monster , it ’s your responsibility , ’’ she said in an interview this week in her Brandeis office .
The book will appear with an author ’s note from Klausen , who says
Yale ’s decision is a violation of academic freedom and a case of “ anticipatory fear on the part of the university of consequences that it only dimly perceives . ’’
But she did not agree when Yale went further , editing out historical artworks showing the seventh - century Prophet .
Many Muslims object to any depiction of Mohammed .
Klausen argued against
Yale ’s decision , but in the end grudgingly acquiesced , in the face of Yale ’s insistence that more bloodshed would be likely to follow republication of the cartoons .
At the center of the controversy is a scholarly , footnoted manuscript by a respected academic who set out to explain how the original publication of the cartoons in a Danish newspaper in 2005 led to unrest that took more than 200 lives .
Four years after the publication of 12 cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed triggered boycotts and deadly violence , Yale ’s decision to cut them from Klausen ’s book has set off a second wave of arguments .
WALTHAM - When Yale University Press publishes “ The Cartoons that Shook the World ’’ by Brandeis University political scientist Jytte Klausen in November , the book will be missing a key element :
The cartoons that shook the world .
Though Klausen recognizes the predicament
Yale faced , she criticizes the way Yale handled it : “ The issue was , should you really ask for that sort of advice in the absence of providing context ?
But once you got that advice , and coming from the sources it came from , I do n’t think [ Yale ] had much choice .
If I was an administrator at the university , I would have pulled the cartoons . ’’
Amid the controversy , admirers of Klausen ’s work fear that her careful study of the conflict could be overwhelmed by the same kind of simplistic debate that enflamed the original dispute .
“ It ’s sad - and a little bit ironic - that after writing a book about the caricatures of the Prophet ( peace be upon him ) , she risks being caricatured herself , ’’ Tarek Masoud , an assistant professor at Harvard ’s Kennedy School of Government who was a peer reviewer of the book , said in an e-mailed reply to a request for comment .
“ She is a serious scholar with tremendous respect for Islam and Muslims , and I hope this will not be lost in this controversy . ’’
In her book , Klausen concludes that much of the violence , portrayed at the time as spontaneous outrage over the cartoons , was in fact manufactured to whip up anti-Western emotions for specific political goals .
The violence was focused in three countries : Libya , Nigeria , and Pakistan .
In each , she says , there were preexisting political conflicts for which the cartoon conflict offered fuel .
Donatich said he did not believe the images were essential because “ the book is not a graphic analysis of the cartoons , and it ’s not a history of the depiction of the Prophet . ’’
He called it “ very neutral , balanced , carefully reasoned , almost a detective story about how dissent is mobilized , and what are the political uses of dissent and the misunderstandings between cultures . ’’
He added that the newspaper page is available on the Internet .
The Boston Globe was among many publications that decided against publishing the cartoons in 2005 , in part because they were readily available online .
Fareed Zakaria , editor of the international edition of Newsweek and a member of the Yale Corporation , said he advised Yale to drop the images .
“ You ’re balancing issues of the First Amendment and academic freedom , but then you have this real question of what would be the consequences on human life , ’’ he said .
But Boston College professor Sheila Blair , a specialist on Islamic art , asked , “ Art history without pictures ? ’’
She was one specialist Yale consulted who favored publishing the images .
Blair said omitting the historical art was reinforcing the mistaken notion that all Muslims object to depicting the Prophet , when some cultures have rich traditions of doing so , and her own previous book had contained such images without a word of protest .
Klausen delivered her manuscript to Yale in December , along with the illustrations .
They were essential to understanding the story , she said .
“ The book was written around the illustrations . ’’
Her book was never meant to reprint the 12 cartoons produced by various artists for the newspaper , several of which are insulting to Islam .
Klausen wanted only to reproduce the offending Jyllands - Posten newspaper page from Sept. 30 , 2005 .
“ Many of the cartoons did not actually show Mohammed , ’’ she said .
“ Some of them made fun of the newspaper .
“ And some , three , arguably four , were racialist depictions of a Semitic Mohammed , drawn in the tradition of European anti-Semitism . ’’
On July 23 , Donatich asked Klausen to meet him and Linda Koch Lorimer , vice president and secretary of the Yale Corporation , at the Westin Hotel in Boston , where the decision to exclude the cartoon page was explained to the author .
“ We argued about it for two hours , ’’ Klausen said .
“ The people who gave advice to the university were not given the opportunity to read my book .
They reacted based on e-mailed pictures of the illustrations . ’’
“ What happened here is strikingly similar to when the Danish mullahs were traveling around the world e-mailing their pictures to make people angry , ’’ Klausen said .
“ Yale University also , in a similar fashion , removed the cartoons from the context . ’’

Way back in early May PlayStation LifeStyle first covered the rumors surrounding the PS3 Slim .
At the time it seemed like the system was destined to be revealed at E3 .
E3 came and went and PlayStation 3 Slim was a no show .
Sony denied the rumors of the PS3 on a diet , and was full steam ahead on PSP Go .
Now a listing has appeared on the German Amazon site for PlayStation 3 Konsole slim .
The listing has been updated with an image that definitely appears official .
So it looks like all the rumors were true .
It ’s doubtful Amazon would be listing this in their database without information from Sony .
As you can see these look exactly like all the images we have seen in the past .
Albeit the lighting is much better and the overall appearance is more polished .
No official word from Sony at this time .
[ Update ]
The image is a user submitted one , but does have the uncanny resemblance to what has been seen before .
So what do you think ?
Is the PS3 Slim real or fake ?

I thought this mousey was chewing gum , but it turns out that green lump in its mouth is a fully - functional , bioengineered tooth , the result of " tooth regenerative therapy " research at Tokyo University ( of the ear - pulling navigation system fame )

Basically that little mouse , let 's call him Jerry , lost a tooth and grew a a new one in its place with the help of some scientists :
To create the new tooth , the researchers [...] took epithelial cells and mesenchymal cells ( about 50,000 each ) from a mouse embryo and cultivated them together in a collagen - based medium to create a tiny tooth bud - a mass of tissue that has the potential to develop into a tooth .

This mass of tissues was implanted in the spot where Jerry 's old tooth used to be and after fifty days that mouse could nibble on cheese properly again .
The new tooth grew to the same height as the surrounding ones , is just as hard , and has all the same blood vessels and nerves .
Researchers are hoping that this bioengineering process will one day make dentures and false teeth obsolete , but I think that anyone watching Shark Week is secretly imagining growing a mouthful of chompers like that .

Spudly duckling : Four - year - old digs up a potato he can put in his bath
When four - year - old Zachary Clouter was asked to help out on his parents allotment , he did n't expect to find a spectacular spud .
The thrilled youngster dug up a potato the same size and shape as the rubber ducks which normally play in his bath .
Zachary is so pleased with his discovery that he has banned his family from eating the potato duck .
Looking chipper : Zachary Clouter discovered a duck - shaped potato in his parents allotment - and has banned anyone from eating it
His mother , Catherine , said he was not at all concerned that it has an odd brown colour or earthy smell , and has been rushing around to show everyone he knows at home in Ipswich , Suffolk .
' Zac was helping us out on the allotment which friends of ours let us share with them in Westerfield village .
' He was thrilled when he found it and rushed around showing people , ' she said .
' We 've been keeping in the fridge to preserve it .
' He thinks we should plant it back in the ground and see if more ducks grow next year . '
Whether he is successful or not , his potato friend is a quacking find .
[ digg - reddit - me ] Back when California ’s looming bankruptcy was in the news , George Will wrote :
California ’s perennial boast — that it is the incubator of America ’s future — now has an increasingly dark urgency …
California has become liberalism ’s laboratory , in which the case for fiscal conservatism is being confirmed .
Will may be right about fiscal conservatism – but he ’s wrong in laying the blame for California ’s problems on liberalism .
The fault in California , like the fault in America , is deeper – a refusal by the Baby Boom generation to make tough choices to create a sustainable world , economy , or government .
Bill Maher summarized California ’s trap best :
We govern by ballot initiative – and we only write two kinds of those : spend money on things I like and do n’t raise my taxes .
California ’s initiative system aggravated a tendency that has been dominant in American politics for some time now .
The problem with California – and America – is a combination of two factors :
a kind of accidental unholy alliance between liberals who push for more government spending to alleviate poverty and better the nation and conservatives who want to cut taxes – with neither group having the power or political will to be fiscally responsible at the same time as they push for their pet projects the deliberate plan of the right - wingers who want to “ starve the beast ” – by which they mean encouraging the irresponsible system above of increasing spending while cutting taxes ( and these right - wingers do this knowing that the system is unsustainable and will crash , which is the only way they see to get rid of popular programs . )
This is a story of the cowardice of politicians and the idiocy of people .
This idiocy – in almost all of its forms – can be traced to the ascent of the Baby Boom generation as they took power with the Reagan administration .
By increasing spending exponentially while cutting taxes – creating enormous deficits – Reagan supercharged ( stimulated ) the economy out of the stagflation of the 1970s .
At the same time , he began the American government ’s practice of becoming dependent on East Asia – relying on Japan to lend vast amounts of its money as our trade deficit with them grew .
Reagan also began the trend of deregulation of industries – allowing them to take greater risks and reap greater profits if they succeeded – which also allowed companies to kick off a merger boom , leading more and more companies becoming too big to fail while they were regulated less and less .
All of these steps led to an economy focused more on finance than industry – leading , along with factors due to globalization , to America ’s industrial decline .
The dominance of the financial sector in the economy , which is well known for its boom and bust cycle , led to a series of economic bubbles – and in fact , an economy in which growth was maintained through bubbles rather than real worth .
Beginning with Reagan , president after president stimulated the economy constantly – to avoid having to take the fall .
But this system was unsustainable .
As the Baby Boomers “ surfed on a growing wave of debt ” – both public and private – they sought to use debt to meet their rising expectations in the absence of creating real value .
This was the generational bargain at the heart of the Reagan presidency – a bargain that allowed America to spend the Soviet Union into the ground and jumpstart the economy from the stagflation of the 1970s – but that , unchecked , thirty years later , now threatens our future .
The Baby Boomers pissed away the prosperity their parents bequeathed them and squandered the opportunities presented to them – and now are busy using their children ’s future earnings ( our future earnings ) to buy their way out of the mess they have created .
They avoided the challenges of their times and found people to blame .
They focused on OJ Simpson , Britney Spears , Madonna , and Monica Lewinsky – on abortion , Vietnam , gays , and religion – and not on global warming , on campaign finance , on the corruption of our political process , on an overleveraged economy .
After decades of avoiding systematic problems – as the solutions became embroiled in the ongoing culture war – we now must face them .
With two wars in the Mid-East , a failing world economy , a growing threat of catastrophic terrorism , and whatever else may come our way , procrastination is impossible .
Now it ’s time for us to try to salvage this wreck .
It remains to be seen if we ’re up to it .
David Brooks explained this grave situation facing Obama and the difficult tasks ahead ( focusing especially on the growing deficit ) .
Brooks concludes with reasons for hope and despair :
The members of the Obama administration fully understand this and are brimming with good ideas about how to move from a bubble economy to an investment economy .
Finding a political strategy to accomplish this , however , is proving to be very difficult .
And getting Congress to move in this direction might be impossible .
Your cards do not improve if you complain about the hand you have been dealt .
But it is essential to understand how we got here .
We also must not be complacent now that a leader who we admire has been given power .
Individuals are empowered to a greater extent than ever before in history – for good or ill .
Which is why it is never enough to get the right man or woman into public office – even if this is a useful initial step .
What we must do – as individuals – is to see the world around us clearly and take steps to effect what changes we can , to live the values we hold in our hearts , to reach out to those affected by our actions .

CANNABIS CULTURE – CNN
News mainstay Larry King will discuss marijuana legalization tonight at 9 pm ET with Montell Williams , Stephen Baldwin , and Charles Lynch , owner of a California medical marijuana dispensary busted by the DEA .
Though medical marijuana is legal in the state of California , Lynch is facing up to 100 years in a federal prison .
King ’s CNN website poses the question “ Should Marijuana Be Legalized ? ” and continues “ Will President Obama make history and legalize the use of marijuana ?
Not if opponents can help it !
Montel Williams , Stephen Baldwin and other debate the issue ! ”
According to the website Friends of CCL ( Charles C. Lynch ) , Lynch will also appear on the show .
Lynch , whose dispensary was raided by the post - Obama DEA , recently had his sentencing postponed by a federal judge who said he wanted more information about a reported change in the Justice Department ’s policy , as President Obama recently told the agency to respect state laws and leave medical dispensaries alone .
Email The Larry King show your questions . , and go vote in the poll on Larry ’s website .
LISBON ( Reuters ) - Portuguese police have recaptured a convict who had escaped in 1993 and had been hiding in the caves in the mountains for 16 years receiving help from villagers nearby , local media said on Thursday .
The 54 - year - old former shepherd , thin and heavily bearded but healthy , was arrested on Wednesday in the north of the country in a police operation dubbed “ Cro-Magnon ” in reference to Europe ’s early humans who lived in caves thousands of years ago , Diario de Noticias daily said .
He had been convicted and sentenced to a 10 - year term for accidentally killing a neighbor in a discussion over a sheep flock , but escaped after about 2 years in prison .
Local residents were quoted as saying the man , who only had a dog for company during his hiding , never harmed anyone while on the run .
A local mayor said the village would hire a lawyer to try to alleviate his sentence .
Police were quoted as saying many locals had been helping the fugitive by giving him food , money or offering odd jobs , but would not tell the police about his whereabouts when questioned .
Police say he would have to serve at least the remaining eight years of his sentence .
Jornal de Noticias daily said the man was very worried about the fate of his pet and , when arrested , pleaded to give it to a villager he knew .
William Jefferson is the former Congressman currently on trial for corruption -- you know , one of those sacrificial lambs the government tosses out every once in a while to keep the public sated .
His main crime ( probably ) was being incredibly unsophisticated .
TPMMuckraker has some great pictures of the cold hard cash he kept in his freezer .
This second one is even more incriminating , because it shows that not only does he keep cash in the fridge , but he eats tofu ice cream and veggie burgers .
The stenographers of the Fawning Corporate Media ( FCM ) are missing the most obvious explanation for former Vice President Dick Cheney ’s widely reported " disappointment " with former President George W. Bush on the issue of pardons — self - interest .
Barton Gellman of the Washington Post has now joined feature writers from Time in aping Cheney ’s hagiographer in chief , Stephen Hayes of The Weekly Standard .
They all choose to dote on Cheney ’s loyalty to his former chief of staff , Irv Lewis " Scooter " Libby , while ignoring reasons why Cheney might have hoped for a presidential pardon himself .
Gellman is a talented journalist with a tainted record .
He wrote a truly shameless article for the Post when it was competing with The New York Times for cheerleading laurels prior to the war on Iraq .
Remember those dangerous sounding " aluminum tubes " said to be procured by Iraq to develop a nuclear bomb — the ones that turned out to be for conventional artillery ?
The Bush administration tasked the Times ‘ Judith Miller and Michael Gordon to push the canard that the tubes ’ technical properties showed the intended use to be as casings for rotors in centrifuges to enrich uranium , a key step in producing a nuclear bomb .
The pair rose to the occasion with flair .
The Times front - paged their story on Sunday , Sept. 8 , 2002 ; and on the morning talk shows Dick Cheney , Colin Powell , Donald Rumsfeld and Condoleezza Rice all referred to the Times story .
First leak it ; then confirm it .
It worked like a charm .
None of the talk show hosts thought to ask an impolite question — like who gave the information to the Times .
The Post ’s Gellman was suborned into doing a similar story on chemical weapons in the fall of 2002 , when the White House was fuming at recalcitrant analysts in both the Defense Intelligence Agency and the CIA .
The not - yet - corrupted intelligence analysts still there could simply not get the hang of it .
They were having a hard time , sans evidence , in producing faith - based intelligence on " weapons of mass destruction " in Iraq .
DIA had issued a formal report saying there was no evidence of active chemical or biological weapons programs .
And CIA analysts could find no credible evidence of meaningful ties between Iraq and al - Qaeda , despite the extreme pressure to find some .
( The CIA ombudsman told the Senate Intelligence Committee there occurred a " hammering " of analysts more severe than any he had seen in his 32 - year career in the analysis directorate . )
Gellman to the Rescue
On Dec. 12 , 2002 , the Post front - paged a Gellman report that " Islamic extremists affiliated with al - Qaeda took possession of a chemical weapon in Iraq last month or in late October . "
The story was attributed to " two officials with firsthand knowledge of the report and its source . "
Lest any readers miss the import , Gellman stressed that , if true , this " would be the most concrete evidence to support the charge , aired for months by President Bush and his advisers , that al - Qaeda terrorists receive material assistance in Iraq . "
The next 27 paragraphs of Gellman ’s story were so laden with caveats and the subjunctive mood that they brought to mind Alice ’s plaintive cry in Wonderland :
" There is no use trying , said Alice ; one ca n’t believe impossible things .
I dare say you have n’t had much practice , said the Queen .
When I was your age , I always did it for half an hour a day .
Why , sometimes I ’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast . "
The Dec. 12 , 2002
Post article drew loud complaints , including from the paper ’s ombudsman , Michael Getler , who asked : " What , after all , is the use of this story that practically begs you not to put much credence in it ?
Why was it so prominently displayed , and why not wait until there was more certainty about the intelligence ? "
Come on , Getler ; you know why .
Bush and Cheney were scraping for evidence to " justify " attacking Iraq .
Gellman and your paper were happy to oblige .
Having proved his mettle , Gellman was able to acquire the kind of access to Cheney and his palace guard that would enable him to write a useful book , Angler : The Cheney Vice Presidency , with some stunning revelations .
For example , Gellman describes how Cheney convinced then - House Majority Leader Dick Armey , a leading Republican opponent of war with Iraq , to vote in favor of the war resolution :
" Cheney … had … a borrowed hideaway office in the Capitol building .
…
He brings Armey in … [ and says ]
‘ Let me explain to you what ’s really going on .
… Saddam is much more dangerous than we want to tell the public . ’ "
" He told Armey two things that he ’s never said in public and that are not true , " Gellman continues .
" He said that Saddam personally … had direct ties with al - Qaeda .
And he said that Iraq was making substantial progress towards a miniature nuclear weapon " and would soon have " packages that could be moved even by ground personnel " and " a delivery system in their relationship with organizations such as al - Qaeda . "
These claims , writes Gellman , " crossed so far beyond the known universe of fact that they were simply without foundation . "
Good for Gellman —
Then
But Gellman now seems to be angling for still more access to Cheney and his dwindling circle of supporters .
In his Post article on Thursday , " Cheney Uncloaks His Frustration With Bush , " Gellman is back to fawning for food .
Maybe he has another book in mind , confident that no one will take seriously the panegyric likely to come from the pen of Cheney ’s " authorized biographer , " neocon Stephen Hayes .
Gellman ’s sugary piece gets a little sickening , but bear with me .
Apparently , it is easy to focus on Cheney ’s imaginary redeeming qualities , if you limit your interviews to his inner circle .
From Cheney ’s second - term national security adviser John Hannah , and Aaron Friedberg , a foreign policy adviser , Gellman learns that Cheney " really feels he has an obligation to save the country from danger . "
Another interviewee was impressed by Cheney ’s " continuing zeal " for the positions he took while in office .
Gellman describes Cheney as " urgently focused … on shaping events . "
Gellman also stirs up some empathy for the lion - in - winter ex-Vice President .
According to Gellman , Cheney takes a morning drive to Starbucks for a decaffeinated latte ( no caffeine because of his heart condition , you know ) and attends the soccer and softball games of his grandchildren .
The trouble for Gellman ’s sympathetic portrayal is that there is far too much evidence of criminal activity on the record about his subject , though you would n’t know that from reading the Post article .
What Cheney is " urgently focused " on right now is staying out of prison .
As he sits writing his memoir in his own Eagle ’s Nest over his garage in a fancy Virginia suburb , Cheney is pulling out all the stops to ensure that he does not have to face the music for war crimes .
For Cheney , there apparently will be no trips to Paris .
No , that ’s where Rumsfeld almost got arrested two years ago .
After a war - crimes complaint was lodged , he had to go out the back door of the embassy and dart to the airport for the first flight back to the U.S. , before the Paris magistrate decided whether or not to detain him .
Angry at Bush , But Why ?
I do think that Hayes , the pundits for Time , and Gellman have it right when they say that Cheney is angry with George W. Bush , but they are disingenuous about the reason why .
They must have figured out that when Cheney vents his anger at Bush ’s failure to pardon Libby , the ex-Vice President is really livid that Bush did not issue a blanket pardon for Cheney and other co-conspirators .
Cheney had every reason to expect the pardon ( excusing crimes such as torture and launching an aggressive war by deceiving Congress ) , given that he seems to have engaged in those crimes with his boss ’ full knowledge and encouragement .
Can these journalists be so dense that they miss this motive for Cheney ’s anger ?
They paint a picture of a man intensely loyal to a favored subordinate ; and that is no doubt true , since one ’s power is diminished to the extent you are not seen as able to rescue someone in your employ .
But when Cheney accuses Bush of abandoning " an innocent man " who had served the President loyally ; when Cheney excoriates anyone who would " sacrifice the guy who was asked to stick his head in the meat grinder " — he appears to be talking about himself as much as Libby .
It is such an obvious allegory , a classic example of self - pity masquerading as altruism ; and the pundits do n’t get it — or , more likely , pretend not to .
My sense is that Cheney is feeling abandoned ; that he senses the real danger of being brought to justice ; and that he is waging a series of pre-emptive strikes to head that off .
Put yourself in Cheney ’s shoes , as uncomfortable as they might be .
Daughter Liz has disclosed more than once what has her father so agitated — press reports that Attorney General Eric Holder is close to appointing a special prosecutor to investigate White House - authorized crimes , including torture — not policy differences , mind you , but capital crimes under U.S. as well as international law .
Cheney ’s war crimes and other felonies ?
Not enough room to list them all here .
But suffice it to say that Cheney ’s fingerprints – and those of his legal counsel David Addington – are all over the torture policies .
Inspector General reports from the Department of Justice and from the CIA are scheduled to be released soon and are sure to reveal more Cheney fingerprints .
Attorney General Holder reportedly found the CIA IG report nauseating with what are likely to be stomach - churning accounts of torture .
Revealing Photos
Still more photos , videos and documents are likely to surface in the months ahead revealing more evidence of torture , kidnapping and perhaps hit - team activities – even if President Barack Obama succeeds in keeping most of the photos under wraps .
Reading recently about the post - WWII Nuremberg Tribunal , I was reminded that it was the film of Nazi concentration camps that wiped the arrogant smirks off the faces of senior Nazi officials , defendants like Hermann Goering and Rudolf Hess .
Bulldozers pushing corpses into open pits , bodies stacked like cordwood — the films of such atrocities had devastating effect .
According to one witness , " Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel sat there , bent over and broken , mopping his lined face with a soggy ball of handkerchief . "
The smirks never came back .
Cheney and his associates have got to be prepared for something similar , even though they were not vanquished in war .
They probably consider the chances slight that they would be brought to an international court , even though Chief U.S. prosecutor , Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson , pointedly warned at Nuremberg :
" … the ultimate step in avoiding periodic wars , which are inevitable in a system of international lawlessness , is to make statesmen responsible to the law .
And … while this law is first applied against German aggressors , the law includes , and if it is to serve a useful purpose it must condemn aggression by any other nations , including those which sit here now in judgment . "
As for violations of U.S. law , the list is long .
Interestingly , two of the three Articles of Impeachment against Richard Nixon approved by the House Judiciary Committee on July 27 , 29 and 30 , 1974 , were based , in part , on misusing the CIA .
Such misuse was brought to a whole new level , as Cheney visited CIA Headquarters promoting " intelligence " on non-existent threats and took a leading role in misusing the agency to torture detainees .
There ’s also the possibility that some of Cheney ’s co-conspirators will renounce their abuses , either out of genuine remorse for the hubris they showed at the height of their powers or in a bid to rehabilitate their careers .
From his new job at Texas Tech in Lubbock , former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales earlier this week conceded that he erred in using the word " quaint " and " the Geneva Convention " in the same sentence in a memo he signed on its way to President Bush when Gonzales was White House counsel .
Now that Gonzales has a job with health benefits , we can expect further steps to disassociate himself from the smoking - gun executive memorandum of Feb.
7 , 2002 , which ordered that the protections of the Geneva Conventions would not apply to al - Qaeda or Taliban detainees .
Late last year , the Senate Armed Services Committee reported that this Feb. 7 , 2002 , memorandum " opened the door " to a wide range of abusive interrogations .
It is also an open secret that Cheney ’s chief lawyer , David Addington , drafted that memorandum , although Gonzales forwarded it on so Bush could sign it .
Though Addington mid-wifed a whole generation of Bush - era illegalities , he has pretty much disappeared from public view .
It seems a sure thing that the next time Addington comes to testify on the Hill , the smirks he displayed when he and John Yoo appeared before the House Judiciary will have disappeared .
Addington ’s view of the law is so bizarre that he might be disbarred .
He is more liability than asset to Cheney at this point .
What to Expect
The bottom line for Cheney is this :
Too much has gone wrong , and Cheney cannot afford to take any chances that there will not be more cracks in the wall protecting Bush - era secrets .
The good news , as far as Cheney is concerned , can be seen in the clear signs that neither Obama nor Holder have any stomach for holding Cheney to account — and still less for holding Bush accountable .
Perhaps there is something in the water here in Washington , but folks in power seem far more interested in circumventing the law than enforcing it — political expediency wins out over solemn oaths to protect and defend the Constitution .
At times this avoidance of accountability assumes ludicrous proportions , with the Obama administration going the extra mile and more to cover up its predecessors ’ misconduct .
For instance , releasing the suppressed testimony of Dick Cheney before U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald in 2004 concerning the leaking of the name of CIA operations officer Valerie Plame ( in order to discredit her husband , former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson , who had accused the White House of " twisting " Iraq War intelligence ) would certainly throw light on this sorry episode .
In the closing arguments of the trial at which Libby was found guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice , Fitzgerald declared : " There is a cloud over the Vice President … and that cloud remains because this defendant obstructed justice . "
Bush ’s Justice Department refused to release Cheney ’s testimony , even though , as Fitzgerald said , " there were no agreements , conditions and understandings " about keeping the transcript secret .
Then , instead of living up to President Obama ’s promise of openness , the new administration continued to oppose releasing Cheney ’s testimony .
In addition to the many reasons adduced by the former administration for keeping the testimony secret , Obama / Holder ’s lawyers added a new one , dubbed by Dan Froomkin the " Daily Show Disclosure Exclusion . "
A Justice Department lawyer actually argued in federal court that there should be an exemption from the Freedom of Information
Act disclosure rules for documents that might subject senior administration officials to embarrassment — as on Jon Stewart ’s " Daily Show " on Comedy Central .
Justice civil division lawyer Jeffrey M. Smith argued that , if Cheney ’s remarks were published , then a future Vice President might refuse to provide candid information during a criminal probe out of concern " that it ’s going to get on the ‘ Daily Show . ’ "
If I were Cheney , that feckless kind of lawyering would be music to my ears .
I would read it as a sign of cowardice on the part of Obama and Holder .
Obama and Holder sometimes appear so eager to prove themselves to the Washington Establishment that they protect Bush - Cheney secrets even when a disclosure would serve an important national security goal .
After all , a powerful argument for releasing Cheney ’s transcript would be that it might discourage future senior government officials from leaking the identity of undercover CIA officers for craven political reasons .
Also , it might give a politician pause before aiding and abeting a criminal cover-up .
It seems certain that prosecutor Fitzgerald asked Cheney to explain his handwritten note demanding that then - White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan falsely exonerate Libby in the Plame leak , like McClellan had already done for Bush ’s political adviser Karl Rove .
Cheney wrote :
" not going to protect one staffer and sacrifice the guy that was asked to stick his head in the meat grinder because of incompetence of others – "
However , instead of the words " that was , " Cheney had initially written , " this Pres " before striking through " this Pres. , " which was still legible .
You do n’t have to be a crackerjack analyst to figure out why Cheney changed the active to the passive voice and struck out " this Pres . "
The evidence indicates that President Bush was more directly involved in the Valerie Plame affair than is now understood .
Implicating Bush
Despite six months of resisting demands for a serious investigation of Bush - Cheney wrongdoing , Holder appears , finally , to be stepping to the plate with the intent of appointing a special prosecutor , albeit one whose authority may be tightly circumscribed .
But Cheney does n’t want to risk the chance that a special prosecutor might insist on expanding the probe beyond the possible indictment of a few low - level operatives who exceeded the Bush administration ’s prescriptions on how much water to use in waterboarding a prisoner .
So , Cheney appears to be pursuing a new strategy of pre-emption .
His most obvious tactic is to tie his actions on torture tightly to Bush .
On May 10 when Bob Schieffer asked Cheney how much Bush knew about the " enhanced interrogation techniques , " the former Vice President stated clearly , if redundantly :
" I certainly , yes , have every reason to believe he knew — he knew a great deal about the program .
He basically authorized it .
I mean , this was a presidential - level decision .
And the decision went to the President .
He signed off on it . "
Cheney was certainly eager to answer the question .
The idea , of course , would be to juice the jitters he already perceives at senior levels of the Obama administration , and to make it clear that no one will take Cheney down alone ; i.e. , without Bush right beside him .
In Cheney ’s view , this image of a former President in the dock is sure to deter dithering lawyers and politicos at the top of the White House and Justice Department , who are more interested in sniffing the political winds than in enforcing the rule law .
My worst fear is that Cheney may be right .

Intellectual Property may be the most pernicious myth of our time .
The lies , misunderstandings , and myths of Intellectual Property so obscure the truth about copyright , patent , and trademark law that even those of us who oppose such legalisms must still work to shake loose our last remaining illusions .
It seems like every few months I stumble across yet another insight into the nature of so - called Intellectual Property that leaves me surprised I never noticed the flaw in my thinking , and aghast at how deeply rooted the mythology of Intellectual Property has become .
The Product of the Intellect Is n’t Property
The first , most obvious , and perhaps most difficult to fight among all the superstitions surrounding Intellectual Property is the notion that it is property at all — at least in the way people talk about it being a matter of property .
People talk about “ owning ” copyright , and needing the protection of law to defend one ’s ability to profit from what one “ sells ” .
The truth of the matter is that copyright and property laws have nothing in particular to do with each other .
They are entirely distinct bodies of law .
Even the law does n’t recognize copyright as “ property ” .
If you violate copyright laws , it is not called “ theft ” ; it is called “ copyright infringement ” .
Here ’s a quick litmus test for your notion that copyright is property :
Why does copyright have a limited period under law , while property is forever ?
While you ’re at it , look into the US Supreme Court rulings on the subject starting with Wheaton v. Peters .
People Who Oppose Copyright Are n’t Thieves
Try disabusing someone of notions of the “ obvious ” moral imperatives of copyright law in a public online discussion forum , and you will almost certainly find yourself being called a thief .
The “ argument ” tends to go something like this load of claptrap :
[ You ] like to steal things that [ you ] like .
[ You ] have come up with several longwinded rationalizations for why [ you ’re ] entitled to have everything that anyone in the world creates without paying for it .
Cries of “ Thief ! ” are apparently the equivalent of calling someone a Nazi when it comes to a discussion of the ethicality of copyright law .
Similarly to Godwin ’s law , we seem unable to escape from the Law of Copyright Discussion Fallacy :
As a discussion of copyright law grows longer , the probability of someone ’s argument being fallaciously dismissed as mere justification for theft approaches one .
The thief card gets played more often and with greater certainty in discussions of copyright than the Nazi card ever did in Usenet , and it does n’t prove a thing about the rightness or wrongness of copyright law .
Try telling that to some self - satisfied copyright - wing conservative who is n’t willing to actually think through the opposing argument , however , and you will find yourself frustrated by the difficulties of teaching a pig to sing .
Patents Don’t Encourage Innovation
Milton Friedman once articulated the core economic fallacy of patent law quite clearly :
For one thing , there are many “ inventions ” that are not patentable .
The “ inventor ” of the supermarket , for example , conferred great benefits on his fellowmen for which he could not charge them .
Insofar as the same kind of ability is required for the one kind of invention as for the other , the existence of patents tends to divert activity to patentable inventions .
In short , patents do n’t encourage innovation ; they simply skew market activity toward patentable innovations .
I remember , back in the ’ 80s , that the Big Thing for eco-hippies to complain about was the vanishing rainforests .
All kinds of crazy excuses were advanced for why we should stop the slash - and - burn farming practices of South America , including the lunatic notion that we ’d destroy the Earth ’s ability to renew the oxygen content in the air and we ’d all end up suffocating as a result , completely ignoring the fact that the vast majority of plant - based oxygen production happened in the ocean .
Such arguments ultimately only harmed the eco-hippies ’ case , when arguments based on real concerns over vanishing rainforests would surely have been much more successful .
One such crazy argument was that the cure for cancer could be hiding in that forest , waiting to be discovered , amongst its many uncategorized species of life , and all we had to do to preserve it is ensure that nobody ever destroys plants in the Amazon rainforest again ( thus preventing them from finding the cure for cancer ) .
The real problem there , however , is that nobody will fund the search for a cure for cancer ( or HIV , or ebola , or whatever ) that comes from a natural source .
Extracts from natural sources are not patentable .
Only the process of creating synthetic compounds is patentable , which makes pharmaceutical research focus much more on developing salable synthetic compounds that require only the most minimal “ innovation ” rather than cures for the most problematic diseases .
An artificial advantage has been granted to any pharmaceutical research firm whose focus is on convenience synthetics , creating a skewing of market forces away from pursuit of necessary cures regardless of source .
Copyright Is n’t the Natural State
People seem , for some reason , to think that copyright is an integral part of a natural state of property ownership .
Self - styled libertarians in particular are often guilty of this line of thinking , particularly when the “ we have rights because we own ourselves ” set starts jawing about Intellectual Property .
The truth is that copyright is n’t about property at all ; it ’s about censorship .
People may balk at the notion that copyright is censorship .
They think of censorship as being something government does to suppress original speech .
The truth of the matter , though , is that speech does n’t have to be original to be censored .
Simply repeating something you were told is a form of free speech — and if someone else said it first , that person has the power of law on his side to censor what you ’re saying .
Even when confronted by obvious evidence of the fact that copyright is just a subset of censorship policy , as in the case of people who are threatened with DMCA takedown notices when they post customer service emails online while complaining about the company that sent the emails , people typically express their dismay that copyright is being “ abused ” to enact “ censorship ” when that ’s “ not what copyright is for at all ” .
Bad news , sweetie ; that ’s not abuse of copyright .
That ’s just the way copyright works .
Copyright is , in fact , such an unnatural state of affairs that it did n’t even exist as a policy until a mere 77 years before provision for copyright and patent law was written into the US Constitution , with England ’s Statute of Anne .
Trademark Law Is Not Trouble - Free
Even many who oppose copyright and patent law subscribe to the notion that trademark law is the exception to the “ Intellectul Property law is bad ” rule .
It seems clear , at first glance , that trademark law just protects us against fraudulent behavior — and for a while , I thought it was exempt from the problems of copyright and patent laws .
The truth of the matter is much more insidious , however .
Trademark law is not at all necessary to protect us from such fraud .
The law should simply recognize malicious deception as a violation of rights in and of itself , regardless of any trademark claims .
Meanwhile , trademark law has been used as a means of circumventing grants of license when distributing derivative works .
An accidental case of this sort of problem is that of the trademark brouhaha over Firefox that caused the Debian project to rebrand it as Iceweasel .
A much more intentional and malicious case is that of the way some third - party publishers deal with the OGL .
Take a look at the “ open content ” and “ product identity ” statements accompanying the OGL inside your D&D - derived game books at some point in the future ( if you have any ) .
Many of them will contain severely limited language about what qualifies as “ open content ” , such as the following from the Iron Kingdoms Character Guide , published by Privateer Press :
“ Open Game Content ” means the game mechanic and includes the methods , procedures , processes and routines to the extent such content does not embody the Product Identity and is an enhancement over the prior art and any additional content clearly identified as Open Game Content by the Contributor . . .
This boils down to saying “ Anything copyrightable is n’t Open Game Content unless we specifically say it is , and anything that falls more into the realm of patents is Open Game Content . ”
Considering that there ’s already case law pointing out that anything that falls under the rubric of patent law is n’t subject to copyright anyway , Privateer Press is just saying “ Yeah , all that OGL stuff ?
Fuck you . ”
The publisher is just trying to get away with something .
In fact , I ’m pretty sure that if WotC / Hasbro wanted to , it could destroy the entire Privateer Press line of Iron Kingdom RPG books and do some severe financial damage to this third - party publisher by taking it to court over violation of the OGL .
It gets worse when you see the Product Identity identification :
“ Product Identity ” means product and product line names , logos and identifying marks including trade dress ; artifacts ; creatures characters ; stores , storylines , plots , thematic elements , dialogue , incidents , language , artwork , symbols , designs , depictions , likenesses , formats , poses , concepts , themes and graphic , photographic and other visual or audio representations ; names and descriptions of characters , spells , enchantments , personalities , teams , personas , likenesses and special abilities ; places , locations , environments , creatures , equipment , magical or supernatural abilities or efects , logos , symbols , or graphic designs ; and any other trademark or registered trademark . . .
Hell , I ’m probably violating their asinine license - violating version of the license by discussing it with you , all because of this misuse of “ product identity ” — which is essentially a euphemism for “ pseudo - trademark ” .
For those of you familiar with Microsoft ’s antics , think “ look and feel ” .
Plagiarism Is n’t a Subset of Copyright Law
Plagiarism is deception .
Copyright infringement is copying .
Even giving credit to someone is copyright infringement if you copy the part of the work that gives credit to the original author .
Ironically , leaving out attribution for the original author actually reduces the amount of copyright infringement of which you ’re guilty .
I have no fucking clue how anyone can possibly think that eliminating copyright law is the same as endorsing plagiarism .
If you copy something and redistribute it , as long as you do n’t claim you created it when in fact someone else did , you are n’t committing plagiarism .
For some incredibly stupid and unfathomable reason , some people actually think that without copyright law plagiarism is “ okay ” , though .
Copyright Law is Not Enforceable
I recommend giving my recent TechRepublic article The Pirate Bay is back with a vengeance ( which you ’d already know about from an email if you were involved in the copyfree community . . . ) for more on this subject .
I ’ve written about it before , and do n’t feel like padding the word - count of this SOB entry much more .
And So On
I ’m sure I ’ve left a lot out that I could say .
I could write a book on the subject , but you ’re not here to read a book , and I have other stuff to do tonight — like eat dinner and do some work on some RPG materials ( which I will be releasing under an open content license when it is “ done enough ” to bother , most likely the Open Works License ) .

Recently by Gary North : When Atlas Shrugs : The Great Default
In a recent international Bloomberg poll , Bernanke was rated by investors as the greatest central banker , the man who saved the world ’s economy .
All it took was a doubling of the monetary base and $ 3 trillion — as of today — of government bailout money .
The FED still faces three problems .
( 1 ) If it deflates , the financial markets will collapse .
( 2 ) If it does nothing , there will be mass price inflation if banks start lending , making use of the FED ’s doubling of the monetary base .
( 3 ) If banks do n’t start lending , the recovery will not appear .
The FED wants to avoid all three .
How ?
His testimony on July 21 was a successful attempt to keep the public gulled .
He avoided all three issues .
He appeared before the House Committee on Financial Services , whose chairman is Barney Frank .
Bernanke reiterated the fact that the global financial system nearly collapsed in late 2008 .
Aggressive policy actions taken around the world last fall may well have averted the collapse of the global financial system , an event that would have had extremely adverse and protracted consequences for the world economy .
Even so , the financial shocks that hit the global economy in September and October were the worst since the 1930s , and they helped push the global economy into the deepest recession since World War II .
I think he is correct .
He never saw it coming .
With one exception , the chairman of the central bank of Lebanon , none of his peers saw it coming .
Their solution has been the same : monetary inflation .
Now he has a selling job ahead of him .
He has to persuade Congress that this near miss is behind us .
Having come close to a financial collapse , central banks ’ lowering of overnight interest rates saved the day .
Trust him , he says .
Today , financial conditions remain stressed , and many households and businesses are finding credit difficult to obtain .
Nevertheless , on net , the past few months have seen some notable improvements .
He says that the FED saved the day .
Many of the improvements in financial conditions can be traced , in part , to policy actions taken by the Federal Reserve to encourage the flow of credit .
For example , the decline in interbank lending rates and spreads was facilitated by the actions of the Federal Reserve and other central banks to ensure that financial institutions have adequate access to short - term liquidity , which in turn has increased the stability of the banking system and the ability of banks to lend .
Basically , he told Congress that merely by announcing lower rates , the FED kept the world ’s economy from collapsing .
If it was that easy , why did the economy come so close to collapse ?
How did central banks so completely misjudge conditions ?
If they were blind then , are they blind now ?
It was not that the FED lowered overnight rates .
It was that it doubled the monetary base and swapped T - bills for toxic assets at face value , thereby authorizing accounting subterfuge : “ American banks own liquid assets . ”
They borrowed liquid assets .
They still own hundreds of billions of dollars worth of unmarketable junk .
Will the FED ever swap back ?
No .
Congress does n’t understand any of this .
If it did , it would still do nothing .
Is the economy that vulnerable ?
It is .
But to admit this is to admit that the recovery should not be trusted .
He assured the committee that “ Better conditions in financial markets have been accompanied by some improvement in economic prospects . ”
What improvements ?
The best he could point to was tapering off of decline .
There were no green shoots mentioned .
Tapering off = positive signs .
Despite these positive signs , the rate of job loss remains high and the unemployment rate has continued its steep rise .
Job insecurity , together with declines in home values and tight credit , is likely to limit gains in consumer spending .
The possibility that the recent stabilization in household spending will prove transient is an important downside risk to the outlook .
There will be a slight increase in output in the second half of 2009 , gradual recovery in 2010 , and “ some acceleration ” in 2011 .
Unemployment will continue to rise in 2009 .
He promised an exit strategy from monetary expansion .
He always does .
He does not say how or what .
With the monetary base doubled , the FED now has to cut it by 50 % .
How ?
Silence .
Accordingly , as I mentioned earlier , the FOMC believes that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will be appropriate for an extended period .
However , we also believe that it is important to assure the public and the markets that the extraordinary policy measures we have taken in response to the financial crisis and the recession can be withdrawn in a smooth and timely manner as needed , thereby avoiding the risk that policy stimulus could lead to a future rise in inflation .
The FOMC has been devoting considerable attention to issues relating to its exit strategy , and we are confident that we have the necessary tools to implement that strategy when appropriate .
Sure the FOMC has the tools .
The question is this :
How to use them without bringing economy to the edge of another collapse ?
Perhaps the most important such tool is the authority that the Congress granted the Federal Reserve last fall to pay interest on balances held at the Fed by depository institutions .
Raising the rate of interest paid on reserve balances will give us substantial leverage over the federal funds rate and other short - term market interest rates , because banks generally will not supply funds to the market at an interest rate significantly lower than they can earn risk free by holding balances at the Federal Reserve .
Raising the rate of interest paid on deposits has the same effect as increasing the reserve requirement .
I am all for this .
But then where will the recovery come from ?
Banks are not lending .
He continued .
The attractiveness to banks of leaving their excess reserve balances with the Federal Reserve can be further increased by offering banks a choice of maturities for their deposits .
Great !
Then why will they lend to private industry ?
They wo n’t .
He said the FED can do other things .
For example , we can drain liquidity from the system by conducting reverse repurchase agreements , in which we sell securities from our portfolio with an agreement to buy them back at a later date .
That is monetary deflation .
Watch the economy fall into an even greater recession !
If necessary , another means of tightening policy is outright sales of our holdings of longer - term securities .
Not only would such sales drain reserves and raise short - term interest rates , but they also could put upward pressure on longer - term interest rates by expanding the supply of longer - term assets .
Raise interest rates !
Yes !
That is what the FED did in 2006 through 2007 .
We know what happened .
Ben is putting the shuck on Congress .
Congressmen never ask the obvious :
What will prevent a collapse next time ?
Then there is the Federal budget .
Stern Uncle
Ben lectured the committee , knowing that the committee will do nothing .
Prompt attention to questions of fiscal sustainability is particularly critical because of the coming budgetary and economic challenges associated with the retirement of the baby - boom generation and continued increases in the costs of Medicare and Medicaid .
Prompt attention !
Say , that ’s a great idea !
I have been waiting for 50 years , when my high school civics teacher said that Social Security would go bust in our lifetimes .
Nothing so far .
Addressing the country ’s fiscal problems will require difficult choices , but postponing those choices will only make them more difficult .
That ’s what I said in print back in 1976 .
Nothing so far .
Congress is still letting the programs go unfunded .
It ’s still “ pay as you go ” until the day it ’s “ print as you go . ”
Moreover , agreeing on a sustainable long - run fiscal path now could yield considerable near - term economic benefits in the form of lower long - term interest rates and increased consumer and business confidence .
Unless we demonstrate a strong commitment to fiscal sustainability , we risk having neither financial stability nor durable economic growth .
He is correct .
That is why we are going to get neither financial stability nor durable economic growth .
He then called for financial reform , meaning more power for the FED .
The Federal Reserve has taken and will continue to take important steps to strengthen supervision , improve the resiliency of the financial system , and to increase the macroprudential orientation of our oversight .
He wants more transparency .
The Congress and the American people have a right to know how the Federal Reserve is carrying out its responsibilities and how we are using taxpayers ’ resources .
The Federal Reserve is committed to transparency and accountability in its operations .
This does not include an audit by the FED by an agency not hired by the FED : the Government Accountability Office .
Such an intrusion is a very bad idea , he said .
The Congress , however , purposefully — and for good reason — excluded from the scope of potential GAO reviews some highly sensitive areas , notably monetary policy deliberations and operations , including open market and discount window operations .
In doing so , the Congress carefully balanced the need for public accountability with the strong public policy benefits that flow from maintaining an appropriate degree of independence for the central bank in the making and execution of monetary policy .
Financial markets , in particular , likely would see a grant of review authority in these areas to the GAO as a serious weakening of monetary policy independence .
Because GAO reviews may be initiated at the request of members of Congress , reviews or the threat of reviews in these areas could be seen as efforts to try to influence monetary policy decisions .
A perceived loss of monetary policy independence could raise fears about future inflation , leading to higher long - term interest rates and reduced economic and financial stability .
We will continue to work with the Congress to provide the information it needs to oversee our activities effectively , yet in a way that does not compromise monetary policy independence .
In short , “ hands off ! ”
Here ended his lesson .
You have read my analysis .
Presumably , it makes sense .
I am not quoting out of context .
I am quoting verbatim .
You can see it ’s a smoke screen .
The FED does n’t know what to do next .
Congress can not see this .
The stock market ignores this .
No one cares .
They also did n’t care with Greenspan , who was hailed as a genius .
Where did he get us ?

With Apple ’s Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard operating system arriving on people ’s doorsteps over the coming weekend , you ’d think that all the new features are known by now , and there will be no more major surprises .
Well , that ’s not entirely true : on Intego ’s Mac Security Blog , it is reported that Snow Leopard comes with anti-virus / malware functionality built - in .
Update : Snow Leopard testers on MacRumors confirmed the functionality .
How , exactly , it works , is not yet known , however .
The Intego blogs talks about “ reports we ’ve seen ” which state Snow Leopard comes with anti-virus / malware functionality built - in , and also provides a screenshot of how it looks .
This dialog appeared after downloading a file through Safari , and the operating system detected the RSPlug trojan .
There ’s no way at this point to confirm this news , but it ’s interesting nonetheless .
Only today did Apple release two Get a Mac ads which played on the rather outdated mantra of “ thousands of viruses ” for Windows , so if Snow Leopard came with built - in anti-virus / malware , that is sort - of funny .
Joshua Long theorised which anti-virus / malware scanner Apple chose to include with Snow Leopard ; ClamAV was a logical contender , but as it turns out , ClamAV ’s engine labels the above trojan differently .
Intego and Symantec do label it as such , and of those , Intego obviously could n’t be it .
Could this mean Apple licensed the engine from Symantec ?
Or did they develop their own ?
It is important to stress that there is currently very little to be worried about when it comes to the Mac and security .
While several security researchers claim Mac OS X is easy to hack , large - scale infections have yet to take place .
Still , proper security policies should always be enforced .
The Marijuana Policy Project is running ads calling for California to tax the sale of marijuana .
The AP has more details here .
A pro-marijuana group is launching another television bid to legalize pot in California — this time with the pitch that legalizing and taxing the drug could help solve the state ’s massive budget deficit .
The 30 - second spot , airing Wednesday and paid for by the Marijuana Policy Project , features a retired 58 - year - old state worker who says state leaders “ are ignoring millions of Californians who want to pay taxes . ”
“ We ’re marijuana consumers , ” says Nadene Herndon of Fair Oaks , who says she began using marijuana after suffering multiple strokes three years ago .
“ Instead of being treated like criminals for using a substance safer than alcohol , we want to pay our fair share . ”

If you 're under 40 years old , click the back button on your browser .
Turn around and walk away .
DO NOT , I repeat , DO NOT read this piece under any circumstances !
Okay , you 've been warned .
I just do n't want my 20 - something , 30 - something friends to get depressed .
Especially those of you who may be 39 and three - quarters years old or something close to that .
You see , when I hit 40 I felt like a car with an expired warranty .
Everything ( and I do mean , EVERYTHING ) started falling apart .
I should know about cars with expired warranties .
My first and so far only new car ever was great .
It lasted me many years .
It came off the lot with new tires , as all new cars do .
The tires had their own warranty , separate of the car's .
The warranty was , ahem , " backed " by the tire manufacturer .
I wo n't tell you who made the car or the tires .
I will tell you the tires had a 50,000 - mile warranty on them .
And I swear to you , the minute those tires hit the 50,000 - mile mark , they did n't just go flat , the tread did n't just wear out on them , nothing like that .
Oh , no .
Each tire , one at a time , DISINTEGRATED while I was driving on the highway .
The rubber treads just crumbled apart .
I felt as though I was suddenly driving on a rough patch of pavement and when I looked through the rear view mirror I could see little bits of tire flying up from the rear end of my car .
This happened three more times .
And it's how I felt after turning 40 years old a few years ago .
The tires were past warranty so there was nothing I could do other than to buy new tires -- a different brand of course .
As for me , I come with no warranty so my poor wife is stuck .
" Till death do us part " or something ( and no , divorce is not an option - - oh , hi honey ! ) .
The first things I started to notice were subtle .
Reduced flexibility ( not that I 've ever been flexible my entire life ) , more aches and pains , worse memory ( and my memory was always bad to begin with ) , feeling tired all the time .
I was never one to go to doctors before -- I practically had to be bleeding gallons to allow myself to be dragged to one -- but I became an instant hypochondriac .
It started with my IBS ( irritable bowel syndrome ) , or at least my belief I had IBS even though I had never officially been diagnosed as having this condition .
I went to see a gastroenterologist .
He was a young resident but he was meticulous and cautious .
He ordered a colonoscopy and an endoscopy for my esophagus and stomach .
In short , I was going to get it from both ends .
Literally .
I underwent both procedures on the same day , under ( very ) heavy sedation .
They also shoved an electronic capsule down my throat and I was to carry around a small beeper - like device for a couple of days to record measurements of my gastrointestinal acidity taken by the capsule .
After everything was said and done , the doctor did indeed diagnose me with IBS .
He also found I had acid reflux -- officially , gastroesophageal reflux disease , or GERD -- even though heartburn was not a major issue for me to that point .
Great , I thought sarcastically , another wonderful aspect to getting old .
The next medical issue I tackled involved my sleeping and snoring .
I was told I snored very heavily -- in fact , this had been going on since my late teens and early twenties , when I was in the Army and my barracks roommates constantly ragged on me for my snoring .
My father had had the same problem and it turned out he had sleep apnea , which is a condition where your airway is blocked or partially blocked by soft tissues ( this is what causes the snoring ) as you sleep .
Once he got treated for it , which involved sleeping with a special machine that helped you breath , he said he felt much better and more rested .
So I went to have a sleep study done and lo and behold , I was diagnosed with sleep apnea too .
That meant I 'd have to sleep with a CPAP ( continuous positive airway pressure ) machine , which sent pressurized air up my nose through a rubber hose and kept me from snoring .
The " mask " I wore to breathe at night with the CPAP looked like a cross between the headgear worn by college wrestlers and the monster from the movie Alien when it attached itself to its hosts ' faces .
Needless to say , I did n't have much of a love life .
But at least I was sleeping better now , if alone .
About this time I got on a health kick and decided to start working out and eating healthy .
I lost weight , put on muscle and started looking and feeling better until I hurt my lower back while working out .
I had had lower back problems since I was in high school , mostly associated to my weight ( I was always " the fat kid " in school ) .
Oddly enough , or perhaps because I was in great shape then , my lower back was never an issue during my four years in the Army .
I suppose I was lucky in one sense : my lower back problems were muscular in nature ; in other words , they were n't caused by a pinched nerve or a problem with my spinal column .
Does n't mean my lower back hurt any less , though .
I lived with the pain a few months and eventually regained all the weight I had lost , and lost all the muscle I had gained .
Then there were my allergies .
Or so I thought they were allergies .
I went to an allergy specialist who could n't find anything I was allergic to .
My official diagnosis was non-allergic rhinitis .
That did n't explain my constant sneezing -- so much so that at the cube farm where I worked , my co-workers had a betting pool going to see who could guess how many consecutive times I 'd sneeze when I got into one of my numerous daily sneezing fits .
The allergy doctor gave me some medications and nasal sprays which helped but were n't perfect .
It seemed as though I would just have to live with my non-allergy allergies , just as I had to live with back pain , heartburn , IBS and an awful mask so I could sleep .
Okay , you twenty - somethings and thirty - somethings who did n't listen to me earlier when I told you to quit reading ?
I have some advice for you :
Whatever you do , do n't grow old .
The warranty sucks .
Mr. Murtha , who put together the bill as the chairman of the House military appropriations subcommittee , defended the practice and lashed out at Mr. Flake .
Mr. Murtha said he had long sought earmarks as a way to create jobs in Pennsylvania .
He said the state had sent a disproportionate number of soldiers to Iraq and Afghanistan compared with the level of military contracts it had typically received .
He said that he had an obligation to bring work to the small businesses in his area and that some of the earmarks , like $ 2.2 million for body - armor research , grew out of his visits with troops in Afghanistan and with wounded troops in hospitals .
“ I ’m not sure how often Mr. Flake goes to the hospital , ” Mr. Murtha said .
Mr. Murtha , who was visibly angry , said several times that the bill included language instructing the Pentagon to seek competitive bids on the earmarked projects , and other lawmakers noted that Congress has the final say on spending decisions .
But Mr. Flake said that in the past , most companies that had sought the earmarks ended up with the contracts .
The overall bill , which would set military appropriations for 2010 , passed by 400 to 30 .
The Senate will take up its version later this year , and the two bills will need to be reconciled in conference .
Mr. Obama had repeatedly threatened to veto any bill that included more money for the F - 22 , the world ’s most advanced fighter , as the Pentagon seeks to shift more from high - tech weaponry to simpler systems the troops can use now .
A survey of children 's web habits shows that " sex " and " porn " are among the top 10 most - searched terms .
The study logged webpage visits through security firm Symantec 's OnlineFamily .
Norton , a web - monitoring service for parents .
Video website YouTube topped the list , as did search engines Google and Yahoo , along with social networking sites Facebook and MySpace .
The survey scanned 3.5 million searches between February 2008 and July 2009 .
TOP CHILDREN'S SEARCH TERMS 1 . YouTube 2 . Google 3 . Facebook 4 . Sex 5 . MySpace 6 . Porn 7 . Yahoo 8 . Michael Jackson 9 . Fred ( You Tube star ) 10 .
eBay
In a statement Symantec 's internet safety advocate , Marian Merritt , said that with the service , " parents can stay in the loop on what their kids are doing online " .
" It also helps identify ' teachable moments ' when parents should be talking with their kids about appropriate online behaviour and other issues in their kids ' online lives . "
One unexpected term in the top 10 is " Fred " - the internet name for a young performer whose YouTube channel is a favourite among young web users .
Terms such as " sex " and " porn " often figure in strongly when searches are ranked by popularity - with a notable exception being a survey in 2008 showing that they did not reach the top ten among Google users in China .
Ms Merritt said that the findings of the recent survey are not all that shocking .
" Any of us who have been teenagers are not surprised kids look for information about sex , " Ms Merritt told AFP news agency .
" I think we have all gotten over our shock that the Internet has porn . "
UPDATE : This smartone is no longer just a rumor .

This video , published to YouTube via the Nokia Conversations blog , was available to the public for only for a few hours before being changed to a private video .
Features Gleaned from the Video
From the video , it can be seen that the E72 will improve on the popular Nokia E71 .
While the QWERTY layout remains the same , the rest of the hardware lines are smoother .
The application buttons receive an update , looking more flush with the device .
And the directional pad surrounds what can be described as a touchpad - like scrolling mechanism .
A bump in the digital camera from 3.2 MPx to 5 MPx is the among the most noticeable changes .
The video also shows that the E72 will be offered in three colors : black , grey / silver , and gold .
However , these may not be available in all regions .
It also seems that this model will receive an update to the core operating system .
Screens from the video show that it looks to be running Symbian S60 Feature Pack 2 ( v3.2 ) .
This is the latest non-touchscreen Symbian OS used on Nokia ’s devices and has even been featured on the E71x , a version recently released by AT&T .
Lastly , it seems that the emphasis on communication will be upheld with the E72 .
Some of the interactions featured in the video show screens and workflow from the Nokia Messaging email client .
There is also some alluding to integration with Ovi Contacts — an IM and presence - enabled address book — and the Ovi Store .

In peril in Pyongyang ?
How jailed female journalists were in greater danger sharing a plane with Bill Clinton
Taking flight : Bill Clinton greets the women as they board his plane at Pyongyang airport
The story has all the ingredients of a Hollywood blockbuster .
Two beautiful girls in peril , an evil North Korean dictator holding them captive and , riding to the rescue , Slick Willy himself , former President Bill Clinton .
As journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee collapsed , sobbing tears of joy , into the arms of their relieved families after being pardoned from a sentence of 12 years ’ hard labour in North Korea , their palpable relief was perhaps enhanced by the flood of lucrative film , book and interview offers that came pouring in .
The pair had been arrested on the North Korea - China border last March , accused of illegal entry and spying .
Then , last Wednesday , the silver - tongued Clinton burst back on to the global political scene by flying to the world ’s most secretive state for what its regime described as ‘ sincere and exhaustive discussions ’ with leader Kim Jong Il .
Little over 24 hours later , the diplomatic mission apparently a huge success , Clinton was on a flight back to California with the women in tow to be greeted by the world ’s media .
As of last night , the bidding war for the first interview with the two heroines had reportedly reached ‘ the mid six figures ’ .
Book publisher HarperCollins is said to have offered a cool $ 1 million for a ‘ warts and all ’ account of their life during 140 days ‘ behind enemy lines ’ .
A movie deal will surely follow .
Laura ’s Scottish husband Iain Clayton , a 35 - year - old mathematician turned financial analyst , told The Mail on Sunday from the steps of their modest ranch - style home in the less than salubrious suburb of North Hollywood : ‘ I ’m afraid I ca n’t say anything .
No one is allowed to talk .
We are in the process of doing deals and I do n’t want to mess anything up .
Everything is being handled by our media adviser . ’
Time to celebrate : Laura Ling , top , and Euna Lee arriving back in California
Emotional : Freed journalist Euna Lee , left , is embraced by her husband Michael Saldate and daughter Hannah safely in California
Applause rings out : Bill Clinton claps as freed Laura Ling is hugged by former Vice President Al Gore at Bob Hope Airport in Burbank , California
Most of the breathless accounts of Clinton ’s mercy dash to North Korea – aboard a luxury Boeing 737 jet belonging to Liz Hurley ’s billionaire ex , Steve Bing – have taken up the story from the moment Laura and Euna were imprisoned back in March .
But who are these two fresh - faced women ?
What were they doing in North Korea , undoubtedly one of the most dangerous and repressed places in the world , and how on earth did they get themselves into what a friend jauntily described on one website as ‘ a bit of a disastrous pickle ’ ?
A Mail on Sunday investigation has unearthed some rather surprising facts about the pair – facts that show they were hopelessly ill - prepared for their ‘ mission ’ to the Chinese - Korean border , that they were working for a minor television organisation run by a former ambulance - chasing lawyer and , while they no doubt did not intend to be captured , the hapless twosome ended up as valuable pawns in an international game of bluff and double bluff .
Indeed , from the whole tawdry affair only one clear winner has emerged – an exuberant Bill Clinton – even if , according to an insider , ‘ the joke in the White House was that the girls were safer in North Korea than on the plane going home with Bill ’ .
Yet much of the pressure for their release was generated in the UK by the family of Laura ’s husband Iain .
A letter - writing campaign was co-ordinated by his older brother Charles Clayton , who lives in Oxford .
Other family members appealed to the North Koreans through their London ambassador .
Laura , 32 , describes herself as a ‘ Chinese American ’ , but a friend said : ‘ She was brought up as a true Valley girl [ an upper middle - class girl ] .
She ’s about as Chinese as the cuisine at Chin Chin [ a popular Californian - Chinese restaurant chain ] . ’
Laura is said to be the duo’s ‘ driving force ’ .
Euna , 36 , who had little journalism experience and counted making a yoga video as a career highlight , was her devoted lackey , who reportedly held the video camera as Laura ‘ danced around ’ on the North Korean side of the border .
For Euna , who was born in South Korea but moved to California when she was a university student , it was her first overseas assignment .
The trip was Laura ’s second ‘ dangerous ’ foreign job for Current , a Left - wing cable television network based in San Francisco that rather grandly aspires to ‘ democratise ’ the news .
Fronted by Clinton ’s former Vice - President Al Gore , now a bona fide green activist , the station is the brainchild of Joel Hyatt , a fabulously wealthy 59 - year - old lawyer who made his fortune running a chain of store - front legal offices .
In television adverts , he offered to launch massive lawsuits seeking compensation for the poor , saying : ‘ I ’m Joel Hyatt and you have my word on it . ’
Critics , however , denounced him as a ‘ shameless ambulance - chaser ’ .
The two women were sent to China in March to do a report about North Korean refugees pouring over the border .
A source familiar with Current said : ‘ It was the sort of bleeding - hearts liberal story that would play well to their target market .
But then Laura decided to take it a step further . ’
A hug for mum : Euna Lee is swept off her feet by Hannah and husband Michael Saldate
Laura , who is fiercely ambitious , has spent her life in the shadow of her more successful older sister , Lisa Ling .
Both were raised by Doug Ling , a 72 - year - old Chinese immigrant , in the middle - class , mostly white , mid-Californian city of Sacramento .
Lisa went from an early job in children ’s television to an illustrious national career , co-hosting The View , the US equivalent of Loose Women , seen by 24 million viewers a day .
She has been asked by talk - show doyenne Oprah Winfrey to host her own daytime show , due to start next year , and is married to a wealthy oncologist , Dr Paul Song .
Their wedding was reported in the celebrity - obsessed People magazine as ‘ Lisa Ling marries her Dr McDreamy ’ .
Jim Jordon , the sisters ’ former high - school English teacher , said Laura was a scrupulous student who set her heart on following Lisa into journalism .
‘ Laura worked on the school paper but she was just different from her sister , ’ he said .
‘ And more determined , in a sense . ’

The Mail on Sunday has spoken to a long - time Democratic Party insider , who is a confidant of Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary , now President Obama ’s Secretary of State .
‘ Laura is sweet but not very street - smart , ’ said the insider .
‘ She was sent to China to make a routine programme about refugees crossing the border from North Korea but , according to Kim Jong
Il ’s people , she was walking across the border and leaping about .
‘ The official North Korean report said Euna was holding the camera .
Of course , there was speculation they were working for the CIA .
Forget that .
This has been a farce .
It could n’t be more embarrassing for Obama and the agency .
No one hired these girls .
No one in Washington had ever heard about them until they were captured by the North Koreans .
‘ From everything I have heard about Laura , she is a Valley girl who wanted to play in the big league .
I think she did this as a stunt to compete with her sister .
Lisa Ling works with people like Oprah .
Laura earns peanuts at a network no one has heard of .
This was her big chance . ’
On March 17 , Laura and Euna were arrested by North Korean soldiers after they ignored orders to stop filming .
Then they vanished into the maw of the most isolated nation on Earth .

Do n't let go : Still clutching Hannah , Euna Lee gets a hug from Al Gore
Kim Jong
Il has ruled it with absolute authority since 1994 .
He was born in the Forties , but his exact birthday is asecret .
He wears platform shoes and a teased hairdo and is reputed to have had a string of lovers , both male and female .
His hobby is watching old Hollywood movies including Rambo , Friday The 13th and James Bond .
When the girls were taken into custody , he was preparing to test a ballistic missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads .
A US State Department source said : ‘ These two naive girls became useful pawns in a much bigger chess game .
The North Koreans ’ idea was to put them on trial , sentence them to prison camp and offer to free them for concessions . ’
In fact , their ‘ ordeal ’ appears to have been far from tough .
According to Professor Han Park , an American academic who was visiting North Korea at the time , they were housed in a guest villa designed for foreign visitors outside the capital of Pyongyang .
Professor Park said that Korean officials laughed at any suggestion that the women were receiving harsh treatment .
‘ We are not Guantanamo , ’ he was told .
The women were allowed to receive daily letters from their husbands and parcels from home .
Euna is married to struggling actor Michael Saldate , who has been in such B - movie classics as Absolute Debauchery and Man , Moment , Machine .
They have a five - year - old daughter , Hana .
Laura ’s husband , Iain , said he sent her ‘ things she loved , like dried squid and beef jerky ’ .
In a letter dated May 15 – read aloud at a candlelit vigil for the two women , the organisers of which included a Broadway theatre publicist – Laura related that her routine included yoga and meditation .
She said : ‘ I breathe deeply and think about positive things that happened in the day . ’
Jet -set :
The private plane paid for by billionaire businessman Steve Bing , a friend of Clinton's , which brought the journalists back to the Bob Hope Airport in California
Indeed , her worst complaint was that her rice tasted like ‘ rocks ’ .
The Clinton confidant said : ‘ The women were a prize .
Most people in North Korea would be lucky to be treated the way those girls were . ’
For Bill Clinton , it was an easy mission .
In a phone call to her husband a month ago , Laura said that if Clinton turned up , she and Euna would be granted amnesty .
The Clinton insider said : ‘ Obama ’s people suggested sending Al Gore , but Kim Jong Il only wanted Bill .
He idolises the former President because he thinks he is a virile stud with influence in Hollywood . ’
Just as Laura fretted she was being overshadowed by her sister Lisa , Bill Clinton has found it increasingly hard to reconcile himself to life on the sidelines .
When asked to undertake a ‘ sensitive ’ mission to ‘ rescue ’ the pair , he jumped at the chance .
He was picked up at an airport near his home in the bucolic New York suburb of Chappaqua by a private jet laid on by the Dow Chemical company .
It flew him 3,000 miles to Burbank , California , where he boarded a Boeing 737 provided by Steve Bing , one of his best friends and a generous contributor to the Clinton Foundation , the charity with which he has been occupying his post - Presidential years .
On arrival in North Korea , he was chauffeured to the Presidential Palace , where he was photographed posing alongside a triumphant Kim Jong Il .
According to an observer , no words were exchanged .
The women walked in , weeping , as they were told that they were being released .
The Clinton confidant said : ‘ This was n’t about the women – this was about a PR coup .
Barack Obama may have defeated Bill ’s wife but this is the Clintons ’ revenge .
The North Koreans are talking about nuclear disarmament but they say they will talk only to Bill .
It ’s a win -win situation for everyone except Obama .
‘ Two greenhorn journalists stand to make a financial killing .
And Bill is on a roll now that everybody has bought into the official story . ’
There ’s a tremendous amount of people that struggle and try really hard but never manage to strive in Network Marketing .
Super Mentor and Coach Mike Lewis figured out over the years why that is .
Most people that are attracted to Network Marketing are following rules by people that find this stuff easy .
People who can easily talk to strangers , people who can do presentations , people who love to run adds on the newspaper …
People that are natural born salespeople .
All these things come natural to them , they ’re just being who they are .
They ’re just doing what is natural to them .
The problem arises when they try to change everybody else to be like them and expect everybody else to change .
The vast majority of the population would struggle to sell a drink to a thirsty man !
They are not just cut out for “ selling ” in the context of direct sales .
Most of these Networkers are Articulate , caring , thoughtful , industrious people , and many are excellent business people in other fields .
Yet they struggle to even get off the start line with they Network Marketing Business .
They DO walk in shadows , searching for light …
They go to their upline or the company to ask for support , direction and guidance , but constantly get referred back to those old useless sales techniques .
“ Great !
Just 99 more “ NO ” s and you ’ll get lucky ! ”
“ It ’s a numbers game . ”
“ You must close the sale . ”
“ Work harder . ”
“ Get committed . ”
“ Be serious about your business . ”
Put your life on hold and get focused . ”
Does this sound familiar to you ?
Sooner or later Networkers clearly see it does n’t work for most of the people , so they resign themselves to the fact that is something wrong with them .
There ’s nothing wrong with you .
These natural born sellers , Heavy Hitters , will tell you that Network Marketing is a Sales Business .
It ’s NOT !
Network Marketing is a teaching and mentoring business .
Your product is People .
So study people .
Find out how you can help them reach their dreams .
People join people .
They do n’t join companies .
People do n’t care that the president of your company is a family man and has 3 or 4 families to prove it .
Build People .
People will build the business .
If you treat them like a number , you have no future in Network Marketing .
To Succeed long - term , you need to become a mentor with a Servant ’s heart .
When you do , people will ask you to PLEASE sponsor them into your business .
Are you a mentor with a Servant ’s heart ?
To your Success ,

This is the most frightening thing I have heard in a very long time : According to a poll conducted by the Daily Kos , which I fervently hope is wrong , 28 percent of Republicans believe that President Obama is not an American citizen .
Another 30 percent are undecided .
A wider survey to be released tomorrow takes that 58 percent of potential " birthers " nationwide up to nearly 70 in Virginia alone .
And this is not in dispute : Ten Republican congressmen have now signed on to a bill demanding that Obama prove his citizenship .
If a majority of our conservative population and that much of its elected leadership think that even some of this " birther " stuff is remotely possible , some very dark times may be heading to this country .
Early this spring , I spent two very long days traveling around Kentucky with Orly Taitz , one of the leading " birthers " in a nation full of them .
So I can tell you with confidence and show you later in this week 's column and next that this is much , much crazier than most people imagine and alarmingly in sync with the " tea parties " and wild accusations of socialism that seem to define the current " conservative " opposition .
Of course , if you 've been following this on CNN and Fox , where folks like Lou Dobbs and Sean Hannity have been offering " birther " commentaries at a fever pitch , you might think the whole thing boils down to a simple demand that Obama produce his birth certificate .
Even Andrew Sullivan of the liberal Atlantic magazine asked for that much on his usually excellent blog :
So many readers are furious that I have dared to ask the president to show the original copy of his birth certificate .
The reason for demanding it is the same reason for demanding basic medical records proving Sarah Palin is the biological mother of Trig .
Because it would make it go away and it 's easily done .
Others argue that the whole thing is getting overblown because it 's August the " silly season " for news and because the more reasonable and mainstream Republicans do n't want to take a stand that will further alienate part of their base .
This is probably true .
But it also obscures a troubling truth :
By focusing on the " news hook " about our president 's birth certificate , we are ignoring the broader mixture of paranoid apocalyptic fantasies that feed this troubling and growing , perhaps into the tens of millions group of people .
People who told me they 're not just looking for the president 's birth certificate .
They 're looking for his death certificate .
Bear with me before I introduce you to them , because the litany of events that got us to this point in American history should give anyone with a conscience cause for concern or at least a moment 's pause .
The Revolution Will Be Televised : 10 Malicious Moments and the Cult of Glenn Beck
M. Caulfield / WireImage.com
Almost immediately following the election , a rash of extreme but nonetheless important statements about Obama and his agenda started appearing in the media .
Here 's a small but representative sample , lest we allow the latest Dobbsian rhetoric ( or Chuck Norris ) to obfuscate the chorus :
1. Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma said the bailout was the start of America 's downfall .
" To abandon a market - oriented society and transfer it to a Soviet - style , government - centered , bureaucratic - run and mandated program , that is the thing that will put the stake in the heart of freedom in this country . "
2. Congressman Pete Sessions of Texas said that Obama intended " to inflict damage and hardship on the free enterprise system , if not kill it . "
3. Congressman Ron Paul of Texas said that " socialism " was too mild a word for what Obama was doing because taking over corporations " adds a fascistic aspect to socialism . "
4. Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota said she wanted her constituents " armed and dangerous " because Obama was planning " re-education camps for young people . "
She also said that " Thomas Jefferson told us having a revolution every now and then is a good thing . "
5. Ambassador Alan Keyes called Obama a communist who is trying to establish " an American KGB . "
6. Rush Limbaugh
Show guest host Mark Davis told a joke about a soldier who has only two bullets in his gun when he meets Osama Bin Laden , Harry Reid , and Nancy Pelosi and uses both bullets on Pelosi before strangling the other two .
7. Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama put his considerable weight behind the " birther " movement : " His father was Kenyan and they said he was born in Hawaii , but I have n't seen any birth certificate . "
8. Legislators in thirty states filed Tenth Amendment " sovereignty " laws as a symbolic gesture of defiance to Washington .
9 . Tens of thousands of YouTubers watched a video called " Revolution Now , " in which a masked man claiming to be a soldier and an " anonymous American patriot " warned of growing resistance within the military .
" There 's a revolution brewing , " he said .
" We have allowed the tyrants to take over this country . "
10 .
Seven percent of the country thought , at a time when the Republicans were almost unanimously resistant to everything the Democrats proposed , that the GOP was being too cooperative .
That 's roughly 21 million seriously alienated people .
But nobody vibrated with the new sense of alarm more vividly than Fox 's new talk - show host , Glenn Beck .
" The year is 2014 .
All the banks have been nationalized , " he began one show .
" Unemployment is about between 12 percent and 20 percent .
Dow is trading at 2,800 .
The real - estate market has collapsed .
Government and unions control most of business , and America 's credit rating has been downgraded . "
In another , he sounded exactly like a militia member from the backwoods of Montana : " They 'll take away guns , they 'll take way our sovereignty , they 'll take away our currency , our money .
They 're already starting to put all the global framework in with this bullcrap called global warming .
This is an effort to globalize , to tie together everybody on the planet ! "
Beck called for resistance and talked about storming Washington , selling T - shirts blazed with the pitchfork of an angry mob and all of this led to startling success .
Debuting last January in a weak 5 P.M. time slot , Beck shot to the No. 3 cable - news slot overnight , right behind Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity with 2.5 million viewers .
And all of this was nothing compared to the alarmed citizens raging away on his Web site :
* Obamacare meant that " bureaucrats are going to decide who lives and dies , " one said .
* The new pro-union card check law was " possibly the greatest threat against American free enterprise ever , " said another .
* People were " better off trusting their mattresses " than the greedy bankers , said another .
* There were " 35 terrorist training camps spread across the U.S.A. " that were run by Sheikh Gilani from Pakistan , said another .
* Homeland Security " deliberately ignores the border and the redistribution of wealth is NOT constitutional , " said another .
* Others solicited signatures for a new " martial law early alert " system and suggested that people download a video that " completely destroys the myth that Barack Obama is working for the best interests of the American people . "
* " GET YOURSELVES HUNKERED DOWN WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS , " one woman advised .
" GET PASSPORTS AND START LOOKING NOW FOR INEXPENSIVES SAFE PLACES TO GO THE U.S.A. IS OVER AS WE HAVE KNOWN IT . "
" Prepare Yourself for the Worst " : When the Neighbors Started Scaring Me
GlennBeck.com
It was difficult not to remain skeptical about all of this .
Despite the participation of some prominent figures , it just seemed like the usual lunatic fringe .
I did n't want to be alarmist ( or maybe I did n't want to be alarmed ) , but it still seemed like a phenomenon , and I continued to take notes .
One day , I decided to join one of the hundreds of " viewing parties " for Beck 's " We Surround Them " special .
After driving the back roads of the Catskill Mountains to a resort hotel just a few miles from the original site of the Woodstock Music Festival , I found well over a hundred of my neighbors sitting elbow - to - elbow at long tables arranged around a pair of giant flat - screen TVs .
They seemed like friendly , down - to - earth , everyday people .
The show was pure propaganda in the old , sneaky , manipulative sense : Beck flashed a picture of Obama over a line about " the liars who said we could have it all " and flashed a picture of Bush over " the eternal principles that made America the world 's beacon of freedom . "
Then he faked some blubbery tears : " I 'm sorry , " he said , wiping the tears away exactly on cue .
" I just love my country , and I fear for it ... "
After the show ended , the event sponsor passed around a microphone .
" Prepare yourself for the worst , " warned a nice - looking young mother named Andi .
" Stock up on water .
Conserve .
Start your own garden .
There wo n't be enough food to go around . "
A bearded man named Jim worried about all the companies that were about to leave New York , like Exxon and the Royal Bank of Scotland .
That 's what he heard on the Internet , anyway .
" You do n't hear this stuff on NBC or CBS .
You barely hear it on Fox .
Take a look a the FEMA camps there are concentration camps in the U.S. today ! "
A man with long hair and a black leather vest said we had gone back to taxation without representation .
" Keep up the spirit of 1776 !
Bring that revolution back ! "
And a prison guard named Steve said he knew what to do if the feds showed up at his door to take away guns .
" I 'll meet them me and my arsenal . "
At another viewing party down in Texas , Chuck Norris suggested that Texas secede from the nation .
In the following week , Texas governor Rick Perry said he was open to the idea and 50 percent of Texas Republicans said they were for it , too .
A few weeks later , ditto for 50 percent of Georgia Republicans .
Around the same time , a Florida congressman named Bill Posey submitted a bill demanding that Obama prove his citizenship by producing his birth certificate the first official action to endorse the movement .
Shortly afterward , I learned that Orly Taitz had scheduled an appearance to promote the " birther " agenda at the Knob Creek Gun Show in Kentucky , the largest military and machine - gun show in the world .
" Where Do You Think All This Ammunition Is Going ? " : What Real Gun Nuts Told Me
John H. Richardson
On a misty morning at the beginning of April , I arrived at Knob Creek and found a horde of men in camouflage selling a dizzying variety of guns and ammo and paraphernalia in a long series of tents and sheds .
I saw a T - shirt that read I'LL KEEP MY GUNS , MONEY AND FREEDOM YOU KEEP THE CHANGE .
And another : IN A TIME OF UNIVERSAL DECEIT , TELLING THE TRUTH IS A REVOLUTIONARY ACT .
And a bumper sticker on a truck outside one tent : 9 OUT OF 10 TERRORISTS SUPPORT OBAMA .
In the first open tent , I heard an air - gun salesman named Sam Kravets selling toy monkeys that reminded him of the president .
" They even sound like him , " he said , urging his customers to give them a squeeze .
" Everyone who voted for him ought to leave the country , " a customer said .
Near the cafeteria , a man named Ernie was passing out free copies of a video called The Obama Deception .
Produced by a Texas radio host named Alex Jones , it argues that the Wall Street elite created the economic crisis in order to cause a panic that would grease the skids to fascism .
( Jones also believes that 9/11 was an inside job . )
In the first two weeks after The Obama Deception 's release on YouTube in March , more than a million people watched it .
Ernie drove all the way from Minnesota to get the message out .
" The economy is collapsing and we 're being lied to on the federal - reserve system , " he said .
Near a stand of bleachers , a prominent militia leader named Mark Gregory Koernke was passing out flyers .
Under the name " Mark From Michigan , " he was one of the first people to raise the alarm about black helicopters back in the '90s .
Briefly a suspect in the Timothy McVeigh bombing that killed 166 people in Oklahoma City , Koernke was later arrested after a car chase and spent six years in prison on charges of resisting arrest and assaulting police .
He 's also a former 94B20 Intel analyst or so he told me , quite cheerfully , as his equally cheerful wife handed out flyers beside him who helped put together the first FEMA camps in the days of the old Rex 84 Program , back before the government was destroyed from within .
" If you 're pro-patriot , " he said , " the military does n't want you .
Same with federal agencies .
They 're after any American resistance to what 's happening with the globalists . "
Resistance ?
" Where do you think all this ammunition is going ? " he said .
An hour later , I found the " birther " booth behind the cafeteria .
A big sign loomed above it :
URGENT : CALLING ALL PATRIOTS
Barry Soetoro AKA Barack Obama is SHREDDING THE CONSTITUTION
Behind the table , a man named Carl Swensson passed out flyers that were still warm from running through the photocopier .
" If you agree with this , " he called out , " we need you to sign up . "
" String him up , " said a man passing by .
" Do you know his mother did pornography ? " said a woman sitting on the bleachers .
Another man stopped to look over the flyer .
" What are you demanding ? "
" We 're just looking for his birth certificate . "
" Or his death certificate , " said a third man .
" The media 's not going to report it . "
" That 's why you got to listen to Rush Limbaugh . "
Swensson chuckled .
" If you cut off the head of the snake , the rest of the serpent is pretty much gon ' die . "
Another man stopped to talk up the tea parties .
" You know what the Patriot said : Trust in God and keep the powder dry . "
" I 'm getting a lot of that , " Swensson said .
Swensson was a tall man with a long , earnest face .
The sole proprietor of a computer store in the suburbs of Atlanta , he told me he was just a regular John McCain supporter pro-choice , not very religious , working on his third marriage until he discovered on the Internet that the government was lying about the oil crisis .
There was plenty of oil , but they just did n't drill for it because of environmentalists and their spotted owls .
Eventually , that led him to the " birther " movement .
Swensson was an amiable guy .
I liked him .
He told me about growing up in Florida , poking around lagoons with his dad and marveling at all the beautiful coral fish .
But now his father was dead and the ocean off the Florida coast was like I -95 and it all felt like the end .
Obama was breaking the bank .
Soon China would stop buying T - bills .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- CIA interrogators threatened an al Qaeda prisoner with a gun and an electric drill to try to scare him into giving up information , according to a long - concealed inspector - general 's report due to be made public on Monday , sources familiar with the report confirmed to CNN .
Attorney General Eric Holder is considering appointing a prosecutor to investigate a CIA interrogation program .
The gun and drill were used in two separate interrogation sessions against Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri , one of the sources said .
Al - Nashiri is accused of plotting the 2000 attack on the USS Cole , which left 17 U.S. sailors dead .
The sources did not want to be identified because the report , completed by the CIA 's inspector general in 2004 , has not yet been made public .
A federal judge in New York has ordered a redacted version of the report released Monday as part of a lawsuit filed by the ACLU .
The interrogations took place in the CIA 's secret prisons before 2006 , when then - President George W. Bush moved all detainees from such facilities to the federal prison in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , both sources said .
Watch why ACLU says tactics are ' illegal ' »
Details of the report were first published by Newsweek magazine late Friday .
Newsweek also said that , according to its sources citing the inspector - general 's report , interrogators staged mock executions to try to frighten detainees into talking .
In one instance , Newsweek reported , a gun was fired in a room next to one terrorism suspect so he would think another prisoner was being killed .
A CIA spokesman would not talk about specifics of the inspector - general 's report but said all the incidents described in it have been reviewed by government prosecutors .
" The CIA in no way endorsed behavior -- no matter how infrequent -- that went beyond formal guidance .
This has all been looked at ; professionals in the Department of Justice decided if and when to pursue prosecution .
That 's how the system was supposed to work , and that 's how it did work , " CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said .
One of the sources , a former intelligence official who is familiar with the report , said that while the report " reaffirmed " the interrogation program , it " also showed some had strayed off center . "
The official said about a dozen cases of potential misconduct by interrogators were referred to the Justice Department .
Of those , only one person was prosecuted , the official said , with the rest being referred to the CIA accountability board , an internal disciplinary board .
Two people resigned rather than face the CIA board , the official said .
This official said that when CIA leadership found out about the drill incident , they were " angry as hell . "
The official called it " nickel - and - dime foolishness " that was not tolerated .
The individual who used the drill was pulled from the program and " sharply reprimanded , " the official said .
Anthony D. Romero , executive director of the ACLU , released a statement Sunday saying , " Leaked portions of the CIA Inspector General 's report offer more proof that government officials committed serious crimes while interrogating prisoners .
So - called ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' like mock executions and threatening prisoners with guns and power drills are not only reprehensible but illegal . "
In anticipation of the release of the report Monday , Romero added , " Releasing the report with minimal redactions is essential to knowing what crimes were committed and who was involved . "
The release of the inspector - general 's report comes as Attorney General Eric Holder is considering whether to appoint a prosecutor to investigate the CIA interrogation program , begun by the Bush administration after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .

On August 12th , Grassley told a health care town hall in his home state of Iowa :
" There is some fear because in the House bill , there is counseling for end - of - life .
And from that standpoint , you have every right to fear .
You should n't have counseling at the end of life .
You ought to have counseling 20 years before you 're going to die .
You ought to plan these things out .
And I do n't have any problem with things like living wills .
But they ought to be done within the family .
We should not have a government program that determines if you 're going to pull the plug on grandma . "
Meanwhile , on Face the Nation on Sunday , Grassley admitted there was no such thing as a " death panel . "
He stammered his way through explaining why he said that , however .
BOB SCHIEFFER : Now , Democrats say there is nothing in this legislation that would pull the plug on grandma , or even require people to discuss it .
Why did you say that , Senator Grassley ?
SENATOR CHARLES GRASSLEY : I said that because -- two reasons .
Number one , I was responding to a question at my town meetings .
I let my constituents set the agenda .
A person that asked me that question was reading from language that they got off of the internet .
It scared my constituents .
And , the lang -- the specific language I used was language that the President had used at Portsmouth , and I thought that it was -- if he used the language , then if I responded exactly the same way that I had an opposite concern about not using end - of - life counseling for saving money , then I -- I was answering --
BOB SCHIEFFER : All right .
SENATOR CHARLES GRASSLEY : -- and relieving the fears that my constituents had --
BOB SCHIEFFER : Well , did you --
SENATOR CHARLES GRASSLEY : -- and from -- from that standpoint , remember , you 're talking about this issue being connected with a-- a government - run program , which a public option would take you with .
You would -- you would get into the issue of saving money , and put these three things together and you 're scaring a lot of people .
BOB SCHIEFFER : Well --
SENATOR CHARLES GRASSLEY : And I know the Pel -- Pel -- Pelosi bill does n't intend to do that , but that 's where it leads people to .
BOB SCHIEFFER : Well , but that 's -- that 's what I was trying to get from you this morning .
You 're not saying that this legislation would pull the plug on grandma .
You 're just saying there are a lot of people out there who think that it would --
SENATOR CHARLES GRASSLEY : No , no .
BOB SCHIEFFER : -- or do you want to say this morning that that is not true , that it wo n't do that ?
SENATOR CHARLES GRASSLEY : Well , it wo n't do that .
" It wo n't do that . "
End of story .
But , as I said , the damage is done .
Audra Harmon , 38 , has sued the Onondaga County ( N.Y. )
Sheriff ’s Department in yet another abusive use of a taser without provocation .
In this video , the officer yanks Harmon out of the car in order to taser her .
What is fascinating is that the officer , Deputy Sean Andrews , could have cuffed her but repeatedly positions her to be tasered .
Harmon is a school bus driver with 11 years experience and contested the officer ’s claim of a traffic violation .
Her 15 - year - old son and 5 - year - old daughter watched the horrible scene unfold despite her pleas to the officer that he should not do this in front of her children .
Andrews is so busy tasering and arresting the mother that he leaves the children unattended in the van for forty minutes .
He then filed an array of abusive charges against her .
She was accused by Andrews of talking on her cellphone — which he then escalates into a tasering and arrest .
He also charged her with going 50 in a 45 mph zone .
That ’s right , five miles over the speed limit for a few seconds after making a turn .
She was also charged with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct .
The proliferation of charges is common in these abuse cases ( here ) .
All charges were later dismissed .
Based simply on the abusive charges , this officer should be removed from the force .
She has wisely sued for the violation of her Fourth and 14th Amendment rights as well as an array of torts claims , including intentionally inflicting emotional distress , false arrest , assault and battery and malicious prosecution .

Godwin ’s Law has the health care debate in a hammerlock .
Back in 1990 , when the Internet primarily meant user conversations — sometimes helpful , other times extremely vitriolic — on discussion boards known as Usenet , Mike Godwin composed the law that now bears his name : “ As a Usenet discussion grows longer , the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1 . ”
In this brief interview , an older protester outside the Raleigh , N.C. , office of Rep. Brad Miller , a Democrat , delivers the basic Obama - as - Hitler charge : “ Hitler got rid of his undesirable citizens through ovens .
Obama wants to get rid of people like me through hospice .
. . .
If [ people ] are a certain age , grim reapers calling themselves as counselors will go and tell them to take a pill and just die . ”
Just who introduced Hitler in to the town halls has been the subject of not inconsiderable debate itself : “ Nancy Pelosi started it , ” says Powerline .
Another theory has is that folks carrying the Obama / Hitler signs are Democratic plants .
Pamela Geller wrote yesterday at Atlas Shrugs , there is a “ fifth column manufacturing smears and lies . ”
Others on the right have tried to use confirmed reports that Lyndon LaRouche supporters are sporting Obama / Hitler posters at protests to distance themselves from the Obama - is - a - Nazi charge .
The LaRouchies notwithstanding , the distancing effort seems like an uphill challenge as long as folks like Rush Limbaugh are also talking the talk .
“ In recent weeks , ” wrote Michael Berenbaum in the Huffington Post , “ Rush Limbaugh and others repeatedly compared President Obama to Adolf Hitler and his health care policies to Nazi tactics . ”
“ They were for abortion and euthanasia of the undesirables , ” Limbaugh said of the Nazis on his radio program .
“ As we all know , and they were for cradle - to - grave nationalized healthcare . ”
It ’s also a challenge when when leading conservatives are calling on their own side to cut it out .
“ The reckless right courts violence , ” David Frum wrote today , invoking the protesters who have up armed at town halls .
“ We have to tone down the militant and accusatory rhetoric . ”
The Nazi comparisons from Rush Limbaugh ; broadcaster Mark Levin asserting that President Obama is “ literally at war with the American people ” ; former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin claiming that the president was planning “ death panels ” to extirpate the aged and disabled ; the charges that the president is a fascist , a socialist , a Marxist , an illegitimate Kenyan fraud , that he “ harbors a deep resentment of America , ” that he feels a “ deep - seated hatred of white people , ” that his government is preparing concentration camps , that it is operating snitch lines , that it is planning to wipe away American liberties ” :
All this hysterical and provocative talk invites , incites , and prepares a prefabricated justification for violence .
Writing at Aliciblog , Roy Ederoso says that Obama - is - Hitler is one of [ the right ’s ] steady tropes , ” and links to a roundup he compiled back in April .
“ Nowadays , ” he wrote then , “ you ca n’t click through a dozen rightblogger sites without reading that President Obama is a fascist . ”
“ The billions of dollars spent bailing out the auto industry and AIG , ” said Montana Conservative , “ was a smokescreen that allowed Obama the puppet and his radical handlers to begin pushing the government into a fascist state . ”
“ It is possible as of this writing , ” said The Promise of Reality , “ that Barack Obama will become the first true fascist leader in America . ” “ Fascism Officially Arrives in America … Freedom is now dead in America , ” said Free Oklahoma .
. . .
“ ‘ Fascist ' ” is a good , strong scare - word , ” wrote Ederoso .
“ It has the advantage of novelty .
And it ’s not as if it has to mean anything . ”
Then he added , somewhat prophetically :
When that flames out , they can take “ Nazi ” out of the test lab and start using it as an alternate .
That would be something of a nuclear option , but it only has to last them until the next election .
How to explain the furiousness now on display ?
Blogger Watertiger at Firedoglake says its about racism , pointing to a comment Politico reported from a protester outside a Maryland town hall meeting :
“ Obama energized the youth just like Hitler did , ” said Barbara Kelly , a substance abuse counselor from Hagerstown .
“ He ’s given the country away to the elitist Obama supporters .
They do n’t have to answer to anyone ! ”
“ For the uninitiated , ” wrote Watertiger , “ this is wingnut code . ”
What our substance abuse counselor ( egads ! ) really means is , “ No uppity , Harvard - educated Negro or any other black person is going to tell me what to do , even if it winds up improving my life quality of life . ”
Sadly , this is the crux of the matter .
All this town hall hullabaloo is n’t about government intervention , or socialism , or “ death panels , ” or pushing your grandmother and her moth - eaten cardigan into a mass grave filled with geriatrics .
Obama ’s skin color is what is generating all the hysteria and vitriol behind the teabaggers , the birthers and the anti-immigration crazies .
The health care reform debate is nothing more than today ’s white sheet and hood writ large .
Other observers want to refine the broad brush of racism to a finer point .
“ The aggressive , furious attempts to even shut down the possibility of a political discussion is reminiscent of the anti-desegregation movement , ” wrote the blogger Hunter at Daily Kos yesterday .
[ It ’s a ] point that becomes noteworthy when you aggregate the motives of the “ birthers ” , who loudly deny Obama ’s citizenship , the “ teabaggers ” , who loudly declare that the same taxes they paid under Bush are tyrannical under Obama , the “ deathers ” , who loudly assert that healthcare reform is secret plot to euthanize seniors and others that the government deems unproductive .
Athenea says
Hunter get ’s it right : “ The irrationality and rage and the arguments that do n’t reflect anything to do with the situation remind me EXACTLY of the way people talk about busing and school boundaries and the old neighborhood . ”
In old movies you ’ll see the signs : “ We Love Our Children ! We Hate Busing ! ”
Which love of your children has about as much to do with the question of segregation as Hitler has to do with health care ; it ’s all about resistance to the idea that things are going to change .
No matter the motivation , Nate Silver says there ’s a certain political effectiveness to these demonstrations :
“ The real upside to the protests is that they perpetuate misinformation about the Democrats ’ bills . ”
And , Silver says , the Democrats need modulate their message in rebuttal :
Ultimately , the message that Democrats need to be getting across is not that the protesters are protesting in the wrong way or for the wrong reasons , but that they ’re protesting , in some substantial measure , about the wrong things : that what they seem to think is contained in the health care package does n’t necessarily match the reality .
But it ’s hard to message precisely or effectively when you ’re stuck in “ nonsense feedback loop , ” according to Jonathan Cohn ( borrowing a phrase from Josh Marshall ) .
[ It ’s ] a conversation in which Zeke Emanuel wants to kill grandma , health care reform is bad for the people who ca n’t get health care , and Stephen Hawking has been snuffed out by the British National Health System .
Instead of arguments that are unrelated to reality , we ’re getting arguments that are the very opposite of reality .
Stepping back a bit from the fray , Ezra Klein says “ What ’s happening at those town halls , and what has been happening in American politics for at least two decades , is structural , not situational . ”
Which means it ’s not about health care or even the president per se , and it ’s not going away any time soon .

As some of you may be aware , Mark Sisson is running a Primal Blueprint Health Challenge throughout the entire month of August .
Every day he is posting a new primal - related contest on his blog .
Some contests simply require that you post a comment .
Others are a bit more involved .
Recently he posted a contest for the ‘ best ’ primal recipe video .
I ’ve been busier than planned this month with a variety of projects and have n’t been entering most of the daily contests , but this one caught my attention .
It ’s been fun coming up with new primal recipes over the past several months so I figured this would be a good way for me to get more involved in the Primal Challenge .
Digging around in the fridge for inspiration , I noticed that my supply of summer squash was getting out of hand .
I still had n’t finished up last week ’s share from my CSA box and received another big share that morning .
It was going to be hard for just Dave and I to eat all of these ( in addition to the massive amounts of other vegetables from the CSA that we fervently work through each week without the help of the children .
I decided to appeal to their love for shredded foods and make summer squash fritters .
The first step was to whip up an experimental batch to get the ingredient proportions ironed down .
I substituted almond flour for the usual wheat flour and played around with some additional flavors .
In the end I was very pleased and the girls wolfed them down !
They are pretty garlicky , though , so keep that in mind if youre not so fond of that flavor .
Once Dave arrived home we put together a video of me making another batch .
I always feel a little awkward watching myself on video , but what the heck , we ca n’t all be Rachel Ray .
If you watch the video , you ’ll notice there are lots of kid and dog sounds in the background – no avoiding that around here .
At some point I ’ll figure out how to enter it in Marks primal recipe video contest .
The prize I checked on that this morning and found that the winner gets a food dehydrator , a pair of Vibrams , a t- shirt , The Primal Blueprint book , and a supply of Marks supplements .
The whole time I thought the prize was some cooking oil !
Heres the video .
Recipe follows .
Garlicky Summer Squash Fritters
These are delicious with sour cream or topped with chopped avocado and tomato .
You could also serve them on a small bed of dressed greens .
Coconut oil is my preferred oil for this type of frying .
If you do n’t like the taste of coconut , fear not .
I have never noticed that the oil ever makes the final product taste like coconut .
Oh , and you can substitute zucchini here same thing , really .
1 lb summer squash
1 tsp salt
1 egg , beaten
2 cloves garlic , chopped , pressed , whatever
2 tbsp parsley , chopped fine
tsp chipotle chili powder
1/2 cup almond flour
pepper
c. coconut oil , plus a little more as needed for frying Grate the squash through the large holes of a cheese grater and combine with the salt .
Let sit for 10 15 minutes to allow the salt to draw the moisture from the squash .
By the handful , squeeze out as much of the water from the squash as you can and spread on a paper towel or absorbent kitchen towel .
When youve squeezed all the squash , use the towel to press more liquid from the squash .
Transfer the squash back to the bowl and combine with the egg , garlic , parsley , chipotle chili powder , almond flour and pepper .
Heat the coconut oil in a large pan until hot .
Drop 3 to 4 large spoonfuls of the squash mixture into the oil and press down gently to form little pancake shapes .
Let cook for a minute or so until the fritters brown around the edges and are sturdy enough to be flipped over without too much trouble .
Flip them over and continue cooking until nicely browned another 30 seconds to 1 minute .
Transfer to a paper towel and repeat with the remaining squash , adding more oil and adjusting the heat as needed .
Yield : 8 10 fritters

( CNN ) -- Meat is murder ?
Well , perhaps not for much longer .
Artist Banksy has satirized modern farming and meat production ; could in - vitro meat be a better option ?
A pioneering group of scientists are working to grow real animal protein in the laboratory , which they not only claim is better for animal welfare , but actually healthier , both for people and the planet .
It may sound like science fiction , but this technology to create in - vitro meat could be changing global diets within ten years .
" Cultured meat would have a lot of advantages , " said Jason Matheny of research group New Harvest .
" We could precisely control the amount of fat in meat .
We could make ground beef with an ideal fatty acid ratio -- a hamburger that prevents heart attacks instead of causing them . "
But it is n't just the possibility of creating designer ground beef with the fat profile of salmon that drives Matheny 's work .
Meat and livestock farming is also the source of many human diseases , which he claims would be far less common when the product is raised in laboratory conditions .
" We could reduce the risks of diseases like swine flu , avian flu , ' mad cow disease ' , or contamination from Salmonella , " he told CNN .
" We could produce meat in sterile conditions that are impossible in conventional animal farms and slaughterhouses .
And when we grow only the meat we can eat , it 's more efficient .
There 's no need to grow the whole animal and lose 75 to 95 percent of what we feed it . "

Watch : Drugs in meat
Conventional meat production is also hard on the environment .
The contribution of livestock to climate change was recently highlighted by the United Nations ' report , " Livestock 's Long Shadow " , while groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth have demonstrated how soy farming for animal feed contributes to the destruction of the Amazon .
In this context Matheny believes his project could significantly cut the environmental impact of meat production -- using much less water and producing far fewer greenhouse gases .
" We could reduce the environmental footprint of meat , which currently contributes more to global warming than the entire transportation sector , " says Matheny .
Preliminary results from a study by Hanna Tuomisto , at the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit , University of Oxford , suggest that cultured meat would reduce the carbon emissions of meat production by more than 80 percent .
Making cultured meat
In - vitro meat is made from samples of animals conventionally slaughtered .
For example , " pork " is made from pig ovaries retrieved from slaughterhouses , which are fertilized with pig semen , transforming them into embryos .
They are then placed in a nutrient solution , where they grow and develop .
It 's a long way from the popular image of animals wandering round the farmyard in the sunshine , but then so is modern intensive farming .
The factor that could take the research from the lab to the store and into refrigerators around the world is its remarkable commercial potential .
According to New Harvest , meat is already estimated to be a $ 1 trillion global market , and demand is expected to double by 2050 .
With concerns about health , animal welfare and the environment growing the appeal of in vitro meat is obvious .
Watch more Watch Eco Solutions interview with Jason Matheny , the research scientist for in - vitro meat , and more about meat 's impact on the environment on CNN International at 7 pm ET on Sunday , August 9 .
Matheny told CNN that venture capitalists Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers have shown an interest in his technology , while Stegman , a sausage subsidiary of food giant Sara Lee , is a partner .
The Netherlands ' Government has also invested around $ 4 million in Dutch research into in - vitro meat production .
But it is n't just the suits who are circling with their checkbooks out -- campaign group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) have announced a $ 1 million prize for the first commercially viable in vitro chicken product .
The Humane Society of the United States has also been supportive .
" We think that a technology to produce cultured ground meats -- burgers , sausages , nuggets , and so forth -- could be commercialized within ten years , " said Matheny .
" As with most technologies , successive generations should improve in price , quality , and acceptance .
We do n't think that matching the taste and texture of ground meats will be very difficult .
Both conventional and cultured meat is made of muscle tissue .
And conventional ground meat is typically highly processed .
Chicken nuggets for instance , are made of something called ' meat slurry ' -- it would be hard not to do better ! "
Public attitude
But the public does n't always blindly buy what companies believe they should , and acceptance of what is a very radical proposition certainly is n't a foregone conclusion .
There are bound to be claims of " Frankenfoods , " and reaction against the work .
" Social acceptance is n't guaranteed , but we all want meat that 's safer and healthier , " he said .
" If cultured meat looks , tastes , and costs the same as regular meat , then I think acceptance will be high .
The more we learn about the health and environmental impact of conventional meat , the more cultured meat looks like a good alternative . "
One obvious touchstone for how in - vitro - meat will be received by the public is perhaps the way GM crops were -- or were not - accepted around the world , something that Matheny draws encouragement from .
" What 's interesting about the GM issue is that it has been controversial in some places , but is a non-issue for most consumers , " he said .
" Most Americans are regularly eating GM foods .
In any case , it 's not necessarily the case that cultured meat would involve GM foods .
" We all want meat that 's safer and healthier .
If cultured meat looks , tastes , and costs the same as regular meat , then do we care that it 's produced in a steel tank , rather than in an animal farm ?
" Take hydroponic vegetables .
We like the idea that they 're produced in sterile water instead of dirt and manure .
It 's true that in - vitro meat is n't natural .
Nor for that matter are hydroponic vegetables , or bread , or cheese , or wine .
Raising 10,000 chickens indoors and pumping them full of drugs is n't natural , either , and it is n't healthy or safe .
The more we learn about how meat is produced now , the more in - vitro meat looks like a better alternative . "
Lab - produced meat also raises some ethical considerations .
Kate McMahon , Friends of the Earth Energy and Transport campaigner , believes more attention should be paid to improving livestock conditions rather than developing in - vitro meat .
" At a time when hundreds of small - scale , sustainable farming operations are filing for bankruptcy every day , it is unethical to consider purchasing petri dish meat .
Rather , we should be making it easier and more affordable to raise livestock in a safe , humane and ecologically sensitive manner , " she told CNN .
Gillian Madill , Genetics Technologies spokesperson for Friends of the Earth , thinks that clear parameters for in - vitro development need to put in place : " If we can successfully develop these products , what is the defining line between lab - grown meat and natural animals ? " she told CNN .
" That is an especially important question since a high level of differentiation and tissue complexity is required to replicate muscle tissue that we use as meat .
We need to draw clear lines in order to prevent the commodification of all life . "
Ultimately the success of in - vitro meat may be less about consumer sensibilities and more about the hard realities of feeding a growing global population in a finite world .
" With India and China doubling their meat consumption every decade , there 's no sustainable way to satisfy the growing global appetite for meat without a significant improvement in technology , " said Matheny .
" Cultured meat offers one solution .
Improved plant - based meat substitutes offer another .
I expect both will be needed . "

It seems you could be eating them sooner than you might expect .

Best server - side programming language
When it comes to developing server - side applications , there are only two serious contenders : PHP and Python .
But which one of them is the best solution for business applications ?
We hope that this article will help you take an educated decision .
While PHP and Python are both high level programming languages , which have successfully stood the test of time , Python is older , being created in the late 80s .
Python 3000 ( 3.0 ) was released in 2008 , and it was n’t backwards - compatible with the earlier versions .
Fortunately , the active community has already ported many of the new Py3 K features to the most up - to - date , and yet backwards - compatible Python version ( 2.7 ) .
PHP was invented in 1994 , and the latest major version ( PHP 7 ) was released in 2015 , with the main goal of optimizing performance .
It looks like the code was heavily optimized indeed , being able to double the loading speed of the WordPress - based websites which were used as benchmarks .
As an initial conclusion , we can confidently say that both Python and PHP are old enough , so they are solid platforms which are going to be supported in the future as well .
Let ’s see what else separates these two elegant programming languages .
If you want to develop a web - based application , for example a SaaS platform , it is important to understand that Python was n't created with web development in mind .
Sure , it includes several useful libraries , but it is n't a full - stack development platform yet .
On the other hand , PHP has been built with back - end web programming in mind from the very beginning , so it is the clear winner here .
Therefore , if you want to have a web - based application developed , you should ask your coders to use PHP for it , and not Python .
What about tech support ?
Let ’s search Google for “ python forum ” and “ php forum ” .
The first search has revealed almost 60 million results , while the second one has delivered 715 million results .
These figures may change significantly as Google discounts some of the results and adds new ones to its index , but I think that the conclusion is quite clear : most geeks use PHP for their projects , and this is another aspect that should be taken into account .
Python and PHP are both open source , and their code is quite easy to understand .
They integrate with most of the top IDEs without any problems , which is a huge advantage for programmers who are used to working with Visual Studio , for example .
Each one of them includes a detailed documentation .
However , there are several key differences that separate Python and PHP .
For starters , Python is aspect - oriented , while PHP is object - oriented .
This makes the PHP code more robust , while Python can be an attractive platform due to its flexibility .
PHP is similar with the C programming language , and this may be a positive aspect for C++ , and even C# developers .
However , due to the huge number of libraries , Python programmers can quickly create a large variety of applications that can help businesses which are active in pretty much any industry .
So , what is the best server - side programming language ?
By now you should have already figured out our answer : we ca n’t tell for sure .
While Python is very flexible , PHP was built with the goal of powering servers in mind , and it does that perfectly .
However , we can guarantee that both languages are powerful enough for most people 's needs .

Based on the data from previous surveys - InsideTwitter and the PearAnalytics study - the InformationIsBeautiful blog has constructed these gorgeous graphics showing the Twitter community represented as 100 people .
While beautiful , the data is being painted with broad strokes : those with 100 followers should overlap with the " loud mouths " , while having more than 100 followers in a population of 100 is technically not possible : it is , of course , a compromise to make the data more accessible via visualization .
The original data is also the subject of some debate .
Enjoy with a discerning eye . :)

Gallery : If the Twitter Community Were 100 People
This past Monday over 200 masked and camouflaged Israeli soldiers swarmed into the West Bank village of Bil ’in at 3 a.m. and raided five homes .
Eight people were arrested , including Mohammad Khatib a leader of the Bil ’in Popular Committee Against the Wall and Settlements ( pictured right ) .
These arrests were part of on ongoing effort by the Israeli military to end the nonviolent resistance in Bil ’in by carrying out now routine late night raids .
According to the International Solidarity Movement , since the beginning of June Israel has arrested 25 people in the village ( most are under 18 ) .
The ISM also says that " Israeli forces have been using interrogation techniques to pressure the arrested youth to give statements against Bil ’in community leaders . "
There are several ways you can help .

' Alien baby ' stumps experts - is it just an elaborate hoax ?
Is this bizarre creature really an alien baby or just part of an elaborate hoax - and was it the cause of a mysterious revenge death ?
Secret UFO files
Fighter jets hunted ' aliens ' !
Hitler apparently tried to construct a UFO too ... 1 / 2 vorheriges Element nächstes Element
Mexican TV revealed the almost unbelievable story - in 2007 , a baby ' alien ' was found alive by a farmer in Mexico .
He drowned it in a ditch out of fear , and now two years later scientists have finally been able to announce the results of their tests on this sinister - looking carcass .
At the end of last year the farmer , Marao Lopez , handed the corpse over to university scientists who carried out DNA tests and scans .
He claimed that it took him three attempts to drown the creature and he had to hold it underwater for hours .
Tests revealed a creature that is unknown to scientists - its skeleton has characteristics of a lizard , its teeth do not have any roots like humans and it can stay underwater for a long time .
But it also has some similar joints to humans .
Its brain was huge , particularly the rear section , leading scientists to the conclusion that the odd creature was very intelligent .
But it has seemingly left experts stumped .
And in a further mystery , Lopez has since mysteriously died .
According to American UFO expert Joshua P. Warren ( 32 ) , the farmer burned to death in a parked car at the side of a road .
The flames apparently had a far higher temperature than in a normal fire !
Now there are rumours that the parents of the creature Lopez drowned were the ones who in turn killed him out of revenge .
There are frequent UFO sightings and reports of crop circles in the area where the creature was found .
Perhaps it was left behind deliberately by aliens .
Mexican UFO expert Jaime Maussan ( 56 ) was the first to break the story .
He claimed it was not a hoax .
Farmers also told him that there was a second creature but it ran away when they approached .
The puzzle has caused intrigue amongst BILD ’s readers .
Some say it is a mutant , others wonder why aliens would leave a baby behind - and one reader asked why aliens do n’t wear clothes .
And the bizarre story has reached as far as South Korea and China !
Mexico is n't the only hotspot of apparent extra-terrestrial activity , either - Germany has had 366 UFO sightings this year !

One article on this can be read here in Spanish .
Some info from the article :
Spanish was installed throughout secondary education in Brazil in 2005 , where students from ages 14 to 17 began learning the language .
Now the government has decided to extend this to primary school instead , which will increase the number of those learning the language from 11 million to 50 million .
Brazil itself will have a population of 230 million by 2015 .
The reasons for the extension of Spanish are quite simple : Brazil is surrounded almost entirely by Spanish - speaking countries , the language itself is continuing to expand ( not just the US but also countries like Trinidad and Tobago which declared in 2005 that it would become bilingual ) , and Spanish just is n't that hard for Brazilian students to learn .
This article on the same subject says that those aged 7 to 17 in Brazil number 41 million , and that the number of teachers will need to be expanded from the current 12,000 to 26,000 .
Both articles also mention Portuñol , a kind of mix of the two that happens due to code - switching , but also a distinct phenomenon with the Riverense Portuñol language where it does n't just exist as a temporary mixed language but something much more ingrained into the region where it is used daily .
A lot of strength for languages comes from a kind of soft outer core comprised of people that are n't anywhere close to being fluent but have still decided to learn the language in order to travel or obtain information in the language .
This can be seen in particular at airports where broken English is used to order food and drinks or get information on how to do A or B , and the fact that most will be able to understand even one 's broken English is what makes the language so useful .
With an extra 40 or so million people that are capable of understanding and expressing themselves in Spanish in Brazil , now simply learning Spanish alone will enable people to largely get by in the same manner there too .
Finally , do n't think that Brazil is getting the short end of the stick here either .
Fairly large mutual comprehensibility between the two languages means that anyone that decides to learn Spanish due to its usefulness in Latin America , Europe and elsewhere may then be able to wade through a document written in Portuguese too ( mutual comprehensibility is a bit above 50 % but lexical similarity is 89 % ) .
Mutual comprehensibility between the two is a bit overrated but if a strong Spanish language makes the difference between Hiroshi in Japan deciding to learn the language vs. picking another language unrelated to either one ( Chinese / Korean / Turkish / etc. ) , it 's beneficial to both .

Futuristic - looking robots like Honda ’s sleek humanoid Asimo do n’t cut it for designer James Auger , at the Royal College of Art , London .
Believing that they need to fit unobtrusively into the home , he has built robotic furniture .
And , believing they need to be useful and entertaining , he has given the furniture an appetite for vermin , like mice and flies .
See a gallery of images of the carnivorous robotic furniture
Auger worked with long time collaborator and fellow designer Jimmy Loizeau to build the five domestic robots .
Each can sense its environment , has mechanical moving parts , and can perform basic services for its human hosts , such as telling the time or lighting a room .

‘ Game of life ’
But the robots also have a taste for flesh .
They can gain energy by chomping on flies and mice , an idea inspired by researchers at Bristol Robotics Lab , UK , who built a fly - powered robot and have also suggested that marine robots could feed on plankton .
The pests are lured in and digested by an internal microbial fuel cell .
This exploits the way microbes generate free electrons and hydrogen ions when oxidising chemicals for energy .
Electronics can be powered by directing the electrons around an external circuit before reuniting them with the ions .
“ As soon as there is a predatory robot in the room the scene becomes loaded with potential , ” Auger told New Scientist .
“ A fly buzzing around the window suddenly becomes an actor in a live game of life , as the viewer half wills it towards the robot and half hopes for it to escape . ”
Although , for now , the robots rely on mains power , Auger believes they could become truly self - sufficient .
“ If the system fails , the grid goes down and all humans die , these robots could go on living so long as the flies do n’t go with us . ”

Photojournalism , often said to have begun with the American Civil War photographer Mathew Brady , experienced a golden age lasting from before World War II through the 1970s .
Magazines like Time , Life and Paris Match — and virtually all of the world ’s major newspapers — had the budgets to put legions of shooters on the ground in competition for the best pictures .
Today , from the point of view of the news image buyer in a magazine or newspaper , it comes down to a calculation for the photo editor :
At a time of shrinking advertising revenue and layoffs , can I afford to send a photographer at a cost of $ 250 a day or more plus expenses ?
If not , I may be able to illustrate the story adequately with a “ live ” photo from one of the newswires or with an archival photo , both options available for a fixed monthly subscription .
“ This is not a new trend ; it ’s the continuation of an old one , ” said John G. Morris , a former photo editor whose résumé includes years at The New York Times ( which publishes the International Herald Tribune ) , Life magazine and The Washington Post .
“ I ’m 92 years old , and I ’ve survived a lot of crises in photojournalism , ” he said .
“ I find the present situation depressing , but I ’m crazy enough to be hopeful .
There have never been more images out there , and we need more help in sorting out all the information . ”
Eyedea Presse said its problems were compounded by a provision of French labor law that requires agencies take on photographers full - time after using a certain amount of their work , a serious competitive disadvantage when the competition overseas employs a much greater percentage of freelancers .
“ We held out as long as we could , but this business model just is n’t viable anymore , ” Stéphane Ledoux , the Eyedea chief executive , said after the court hearing .
“ They ’ve killed French photojournalism by requiring the agencies to make salaried employees of the freelancers . ”
French photographers acknowledge the problem , but they say agency managers exaggerate it to justify job cuts .
Serie A giants Roma have admitted that they would be willing to discuss the sale of Alberto Aquilani .
Italian outfit prepared to listen to offers for midfielder
Serie A giants Roma have admitted that they would be willing to discuss the sale of Alberto Aquilani .
The Italy international is reported to be a target for Liverpool , while Arsenal have expressed an interest in the creative midfielder in the past .
A move to Anfield has been touted in the wake of Real Madrid 's continued interest in Xabi Alonso , with Aquiliani seen as an ideal replacement should the Spaniard head home .
Roma have previously maintained that they would be unwilling to part with the talented 25 - year - old , but boss Luciano Spalletti has revealed that stance could be about to change .
" We need to be open and listen to any type of offers that are proposed to us , " he said .
" We are not worried , we know what we need to do .
" There will probably be two or three transfer market deals done and I am convinced we will be able to work well . "
Aquilani is under contract with Roma until 2013 and despite Spalletti's admission , club director Bruno Conti insists no approach has been received as yet .
" The situation as it is right now is that Aquilani will remain until there is a team that makes an offer , " Conti said to .
" Once this happens then we will see . "
The Indus civilization , which flourished throughout much of the third millennium B.C. , was the most extensive society of its time .
At its height , it encompassed an area of more than half a million square miles centered on what is today the India - Pakistan border .
Remnants of the Indus have been found as far north as the Himalayas and as far south as Mumbai .
It was the earliest known urban culture of the subcontinent and it boasted two large cities , one at Harappa and one at Mohenjo - daro .
Yet despite its size and longevity , and despite nearly a century of archaeological investigations , much about the Indus remains shrouded in mystery .
What little we do know has come from archaeological digs that began in the 1920s and continue today .
Over the decades , archaeologists have turned up a great many artifacts , including stamp sealings , amulets and small tablets .
Many of these artifacts bear what appear to be specimens of writing — engraved figures resembling , among other things , winged horseshoes , spoked wheels , and upright fish .
What exactly those symbols might mean , though , remains one of the most famous unsolved riddles in the scholarship of ancient civilizations .
There have been other tough codes to crack in history .
Stumped Egyptologists caught a lucky break with the discovery of the famed Rosetta stone in 1799 , which contained text in both Egyptian and Greek .
The study of Mayan hieroglyphics languished until a Russian linguist named Yury Knorozov made clever use of contemporary spoken Mayan in the 1950s .
But there is no Rosetta stone of the Indus , and scholars do n’t know which , if any , languages may have descended from that spoken by the Indus people .
About 22 years ago , in Hyderabad , India , an eighth - grade student named Rajesh Rao turned the page of a history textbook and first learned about this fascinating civilization and its mysterious script .
In the years that followed , Rao ’s schooling and profession took him in a different direction — he wound up pursuing computer science , which he teaches today at the University of Washington in Seattle — but he monitored Indus scholarship carefully , keeping tabs on the dozens of failed attempts at making sense of the script .
Even as he studied artificial intelligence and robotics , Rao amassed a small library of books and monographs on the Indus script , about 30 of them .
On a nearby bookshelf , he also kept the cherished eighth - grade history textbook that introduced him to the Indus .
“ It was just amazing to see the number of different ideas people suggested , ” he says .
Some scholars claimed the writing was a sort of Sumerian script ; others situated it in the Dravidian family ; still others thought it was related to a language of Easter Island .
Rao came to appreciate that this was “ probably one of the most challenging problems in terms of ancient history . ”
As attempt after attempt failed at deciphering the script , some experts began to lose hope that it could be decoded .
In 2004 , three scholars argued in a controversial paper that the Indus symbols did n’t have linguistic content at all .
Instead , the symbols may have been little more than pictograms representing political or religious figures .
The authors went so far as to suggest that the Indus was not a literate civilization at all .
For some in the field , the whole quest of trying to find language behind those Indus etchings began to resemble an exercise in futility .
A few years later , Rao entered the fray .
Until then , people studying the script were archaeologists , historians , linguists or cryptologists .
But Rao decided to coax out the secrets of the Indus script using the tool he knew best — computer science .
On a summer day in Seattle , Rao welcomed me into his office to show me how he and his colleagues approached the problem .
He set out a collection of replicas of clay seal impressions that archaeologists have turned up from Indus sites .
They are small — like little square chocolates — and most of them feature an image of an animal beneath a series of Indus symbols .
Most samples of the Indus script are miniatures like these , bearing only a few characters ; no grand monoliths have been discovered .
Scholars are uncertain of the function of the small seals , Rao told me , but one theory is that they may have been used to certify the quality of traded goods .
Another suggests that the seals might have been a way of ensuring that traders paid taxes upon entering or leaving a city — many seals have been found among the ruins of gate houses , which might have functioned like ancient toll booths .
Rao and his colleagues did n’t seek to work miracles — they knew that they did n't have enough information to decipher the ancient script — but they hypothesized that by using computational methods , they could at least begin to establish what sort of writing the Indus script was : did it encode language , or not ?
They did this using a concept called “ conditional entropy . ”
Despite the imposing name , conditional entropy is a fairly simple concept : it is a measure of the amount of randomness in a sequence .
Consider our alphabet .
If you were to take Scrabble tiles and toss them in the air , you might find any old letter turning up after any other .
But in actual English words , certain letters are more likely to occur after others .
A q in English is almost always followed by a u .
A t may be followed by an r or e , but is less likely to be followed by an n or a b .
Rao and his collaborators — an international group including computer scientists , astrophysicists and a mathematician — used a computer program to measure the conditional entropy of the Indus script .
Then they measured the conditional entropy of other types of systems — natural languages ( Sumerian , Tamil , Sanskrit , and English ) , an artificial language ( the computer programming language Fortran ) and non-linguistic systems ( human DNA sequences , bacterial protein sequences , and two artificial datasets representing high and low extremes of conditional entropy ) .
When they compared the amount of randomness in the Indus script with that of the other systems , they found that it most closely resembled the rates found in the natural languages .
They published their findings in May in the journal Science .
If it looks like a language , and it acts like a language , then it probably is a language , their paper suggests .
The findings do n’t decipher the script , of course , but they do sharpen our understanding of it , and have lent reassurance to those archaeologists who had been working under the assumption that the Indus script encodes language .
After publishing the paper , Rao got a surprise .
The question of which language family the script belongs to , it turns out , is a sensitive one : because of the Indus civilization ’s age and significance , many contemporary groups in India would like to claim it as a direct ancestor .
For instance , the Tamil - speaking Indians of the south would prefer to learn that the Indus script was a kind of proto - Dravidian , since Tamil is descended from proto -Dravidian .
Hindi speakers in the north would rather it be an old form of Sanskrit , an ancestor of Hindi .
Rao ’s paper does n’t conclude which language family the script belongs to , though it does note that the conditional entropy is similar to Old Tamil — causing some critics to summarily “ accuse us of being Dravidian nationalists , ” says Rao .
“ The ferocity of the accusations and attacks was completely unexpected . "
Rao sometimes takes relief in returning to the less ferociously contested world of neuroscience and robotics .
But the call of the Indus script remains alluring , and “ what used to be a hobby is now monopolizing more than a third of my time , ” he says .
Rao and his colleagues are now looking at longer strings of characters than they analyzed in the Science paper .
“ If there are patterns , ” says Rao , “ we could come up with grammatical rules .
That would in turn give constraints to what kinds of language families ” the script might belong to .
He hopes that his future findings will speak for themselves , inciting less rancor from opponents rooting for one region of India versus another .
For his part , when Rao talks about what the Indus script means to him , he tends to speak in terms of India as a whole .
“ The heritage of India would be considerably enriched if we were able to understand the Indus civilization , ” he says .
Rao and his collaborators are working on it , one line of source code at a time .
World Net Daily has done it !
They 've finally proven that President Obama was , in fact , born in Kenya :
The document lists Obama 's parents as Barack Hussein Obama and Stanley Ann Obama , formerly Stanley Ann Dunham , the birth date as Aug. 4 , 1961 , and the hospital of birth as Coast General Hospital in Mombasa , Kenya .
Read on ...
There 's just one teensy little problem here -- The Republic of Kenya did n't exist until 1964 -- three years after Obama 's birth .
Right wing blog Little Green Footballs is calling this a hoax , but leave it to the nutbags at Free Republic to take the debunked myth to a whole new level .
See , the whole thing ties into the divorce of President Obama 's parents !
Judge Samuel P. King who granted the divorce – last I heard was retired and alive ( for now ) in his 90s in Hawaii -- MAY or MAY NOT have asked to see the Marriage Certificate .
BUT , I bet Judge King asked to see Obama JR's Birth Certificate to confirm
Ann 's claims that Obama SR was in fact the father .
That is “ standard ” policy to have a Birth Certificate in case the mother asks for child support from the father ( or Welfare ) later after the divorce .
Judge King probably told
Ann to produce a birth certificate before or at trial , which would have been sometime in mid- to late - February 1964 HAD Obama SR answered his notice that was sent to Cambridge .
When Judge King wrote the order on Jan. 23 , he had his clerk notify Obama SR via what 's referred to as a " knock and nail " .
That is , the postman leaves the notification on the door for ( generally ) 10 days and retrieves it after that time passes -- signed or unsigned .
That order was sent on Jan. 23 via airmail from Hawaii and was probably posted on Obama SR 's door Jan. 27 - 28 .
Read on ...
Nevermind the fact that Barack Obama 's birth announcement appeared in two Hawaiian newspapers in 1961 .
Hell , even Karl Rove says it 's likely a forgery .
You can be sure the Fox News gang will be running with this story , but will CNN's Lou Dobbs continue to go down the Birther path that 's killing his ratings and embarrassing the entire network ?
Wait , is n't President Obama the Antichrist ?
My brain hurts .
If I could speak directly to every Birther face to face , this is what I would say .

The most amazing thing about the Creation Museum is that it espouses evolution .
In this week ’s Science Times , I wrote about a group of professional paleontologists visiting the Creation Museum , which fits into all of cosmic history into the 6,000 or years of a literal reading of the Bible .
The key event for the young Earth creationist interpretations of geology and biology is the great flood , which the museum places at 2348 B.C.
Obviously , Noah ’s ark could not fit two of every single land animal .
The exhibit notes that the Bible says two of every “ kind ” of animal , so there were n’t two dogs , two wolves , two dingo dogs , etc. , but rather one pair of wolf - like dogs .
After the flood , the two wolf - like dogs multiplied and “ diversified ” into a panoply of species .
The descendants of the ark dog include foxes , states one of the museum signs .
This is pretty incredible if you do n’t accept the theory of evolution .
Dogs ( and wolves ) have a genome of 78 chromosomes .
The red fox has 34 chromosomes .
By most any measure , dogs and foxes are different species and yet here in the Creation Museum , it was stated that foxes had diversified from dogs , with major changes in appearance and genetic make - up , in an incredibly short time of less than 4,500 years — far , far faster than an evolutionary biologist would claim .
Usually , creationists make a distinction between “ microevolution ” — antibiotic resistance among microbes , for instance , which they accept — and “ macroevolution ” — the appearance of new species , which they dispute .
If dog to fox is microevolution , then it seems that hominid to human would also be microevolution .
In reporting the article , I talked with Andrew Snelling , the museum geologist who helped put together the flood exhibit .
He said the rapid diversification occurred because of the open ecological niches after the flood and the geographical isolation of small population groups .
His explanation fit with the usual biological explanation of how evolution works .

Advertisement Taiwan has appealed for international technical assistance to help rescue more than 2,000 people stranded after Typhoon Morakot caused major mudslides .
The Taiwanese authorities say they need giant cargo aircraft able to drop large earth diggers and other machinery into remote mountain areas to re-open roads .
Correspondents say only Russia and the US are believed to have such aircraft .
Relatives of those stranded and of the hundreds feared dead have urged the government to speed up rescue efforts .
Many have been waiting for days at the rescue operation centre in Qishan for news of family members missing since the typhoon struck over the weekend .
In pictures : Taiwan misery ' Washed away by the typhoon '
Hundreds of people feared buried by mudslides in the south of the country have been found alive .
But Taiwan 's President Ma Ying - jeou - who visited the area on Wednesday - said hundreds more were likely to have died .
The number of confirmed dead stands at 108 .
The Taiwanese government is sending more than 4,000 extra soldiers to speed up rescue efforts , with thousands already working to reach areas cut off when roads and bridges were swept away .
See map of affected area Speaking while inspecting the rescue operations , President Ma said : " We welcome all forms of aid , and we also need equipment , especially helicopters that can carry cranes . "
He assured anxious relatives waiting for news that no effort would be spared to find their loved ones .
AT THE SCENE Cindy Sui , BBC News , Kaohsiung county
The Taiwanese government wants to dig out mud and open roads so it can bring out villagers stranded for the past four days .
Earth diggers are already digging from outside the villages , but authorities say if they can get them inside , the vast amount of mud dumped can be removed more quickly and roads can be reopened - easing the rescue efforts .
So far rescues have been carried out only by helicopters , but that has been a slow process .
While typhoons are common in Taiwan at this time of the year , this one caught people by surprise , dumping about half the average annual amount of rainfall in many places , and about two - thirds in the worst affected places .
' Devil ' typhoon causes havoc
The authorities also need 1,000 pre-fabricated houses for families left homeless , correspondents say , as well as supplies of disinfectant to help prevent disease spreading .
Nearly 14,000 people have now been evacuated by air from the worst - affected areas .
Military helicopters have been dropping provisions for others , but continuing rain has hampered their efforts .
It is now confirmed that all three crew aboard a rescue helicopter which crashed in bad weather on Tuesday were killed .
The typhoon struck Taiwan at the weekend , causing the worst flooding in 50 years .
The BBC's Alastair Leithead , at the Qishan rescue base , says thousands of extra Taiwanese troops have been drafted in to help the rescue efforts .
The military is now trying to push out into remote areas on foot as well as by helicopter to establish who is most in need of help , he says .
According to news reports , a wooden sign saying " 32 dead , SOS " was posted by a collapsed bridge at the only entrance to one village , Hsinfa , on Wednesday .
Several survivors were pulled to safety using ropes thrown across the river .
TYPHOON MORAKOT Deluged Taiwan with at least two metres ( 80 in ) of rain over the weekend Caused the country 's worst flooding in 50 years Some 108 people confirmed dead , hundreds unaccounted for Some 14,000 people airlifted out of affected areas
Eyewitness : Pacific storms
The National Fire Agency said about 200 people were awaiting rescue from a hot spring resort in Liukuei , while the military said it had found another 700 survivors in the area and was starting to move them to safety , the AFP news agency reports .
Villagers in some areas are at further risk as lakes created by floodwaters burst their banks , relief official Hsu Chin-biao told the Associated Press news agency .
Some 300 people in the township of Taoyuan had been told to run to higher ground about half an hour before floods crashed down when an embankment holding back a lake gave way , he said .
Typhoon Morakot , which lashed Taiwan with at least two metres ( 80 in ) of rain over the weekend , has caused at least $ 225 m ( £ 135 m ) in agricultural damage and left tens of thousands of homes without power and water .
The storm also hit mainland China , where about 1.4 million people were evacuated from coastal areas , eight people died in flooding and up to 10,000 homes were destroyed .

Heavy , constant drinking damages the brain in many different ways , including contributing to difficulties in accurate perception of emotional expressions .
Recent brain - imaging findings show that abstinent alcoholics have decreased activation in the amygdala and hippocampus regions of the brain when viewing faces with positive or negative emotional expressions .
Misreading facial cues can escalate interpersonal conflict and difficulties , creating liability for impaired social interaction and continued drinking .
Excessive , chronic drinking can lead to brain damage on multiple levels , including the development of emotional abnormalities that can interfere with healthy interpersonal relationships .
Findings from a recent study using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) suggest that diminished activity of the amygdala and hippocampus underlie emotional impairments observed in abstinent long - term alcoholics .
Results will be published in the November issue of Alcoholism : Clinical & Experimental Research and are currently available at Early View .
" Like most body organs , the brain is vulnerable to injury from excessive alcohol consumption , " said Ksenija Marinkovic , assistant professor in residence in the radiology department at the University of California , San Diego .
" Risk of brain damage and related neurobehavioral deficits vary from person to person , depending on a wide range of factors such as the amount and duration of drinking , age , gender , family history of alcoholism , and overall health .
Most common deficits include difficulties with memory , reduced reasoning and problem solving abilities , and emotional abnormalities . "
Alcoholism - related emotional abnormalities can be subtle , Marinkovic explained , such as misperceiving facial and verbal cues , or obvious , such as emotional flatness and apathy , or sudden outbursts of anger .
" Alcoholics also have problems in judging the emotional expressions on people 's faces , " she added .
" This can result in miscommunication during emotionally charged situations and lead to unnecessary conflicts and difficulties in interpersonal relationships .
The resulting negative repercussions can , in turn , contribute to increased drinking . "
For this study , researchers used fMRI technology to examine two groups of men matched on socioeconomic backgrounds , age , education , and IQ : 15 abstinent long - term alcoholics and 15 healthy , nonalcoholic controls .
While in the scanner , participants were presented with positive , negative , or neutral words and photographs of faces .
These were divided into two different kinds of encoding .
One was " deep " or semantic , such as classifying a word as abstract or concrete , or rating a face for intelligence , thereby leaving a robust memory trace ; and the other was " shallow " or perceptual , such as the simple classification of color vs. no color , leaving a weak memory trace .
In parts of the temporal lobes of the brain called the amygdala and hippocampus , faces evoked stronger activation than words , especially in the deep encoding testing .
" The amygdala normally responds to face expressions , and the hippocampus is involved in remembering them .
In addition , faces are more visually complex stimuli , which could have had a bearing on increased activity in the amygdala and hipppocampus , " Marinkovic explained .
" The neuroimaging evidence from our study suggests that deficient activation of limbic structures inside the temporal lobes – the amygdala and hippocampus – may underlie emotional difficulties in abstinent long - term alcoholics , " said Marinkovic .
" Whereas nonalcoholic adult men showed stronger activation in the amygdala and hippocampus when viewing faces with emotional expressions , the alcoholics showed decreased activation in these brain areas , and furthermore responded in an undifferentiated manner to all facial expressions .
The alcoholics also were impaired on the intelligence - appraisal task , possibly due to their dampened amygdala activity . "
" In addition , " said Edith V. Sullivan , professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine , " unlike the controls , the alcoholics recruited the prefrontal cortex while processing facial emotions , perhaps compensating for dampened activation of neural centers , such as the amygdala and hippocampus , which are normally invoked for such processing . "
Use of a different neural " route " to process the same facial emotional information presented to controls is consistent with other fMRI studies , Sullivan added , which have demonstrated that alcoholics can invoke additional and sometimes higher - order brain systems to accomplish a relatively simple task at normal levels .
Marinkovic said these findings are also in agreement with prior studies showing amygdala hypoactivity in psychopathy and also in individuals with a family history of alcoholism , particularly those with more disinhibited traits .
" Amygdala hypoactivity may underlie emotional dysfunction in chronic alcoholics … and be a part of a wide array of behavioral problems , including disinhibition and disregard for social norms , " she said .
" Viewed in their totality , " said Sullivan , " these results show that not all facial expressions are necessarily perceived the same by everyone , and that alcoholics may be at a special disadvantage in detecting emotion - filled facial expression , which we all naturally use to convey information , such as warnings , love , anger , and defense , among others , and assume that the intended message is accurately perceived .
Whether the differences between controls and alcoholics in brain activation existed before the onset of alcoholism , or are the result of neural circuitry changes or differences in blood perfusion caused by chronic alcohol consumption , intoxication or withdrawal , remain as questions to be answered . "

EU 's Benita Ferrero - Waldner said cutting aid was a difficult decision
The European Union has suspended more than $ 90 m ( 63 m euros ; £ 54 m ) in aid to Honduras in the wake of a coup there .
It follows the failure of talks to resolve the country 's political crisis .
President Manuel Zelaya was ousted from office by troops on 28 June over his plans to hold a referendum on changing the constitution .
The current interim government , led by Roberto Micheletti , has rejected a proposal that Mr Zelaya return as leader of a unity government .
The EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero - Waldner said in a statement : " In view of the circumstances , I have taken the difficult decision to suspend all budgetary support payments .
" I strongly appeal to both parties to refrain from any action or declaration which might further escalate tension , thus making the prospect of a solution more difficult . "
Honduras 's political leaders are still at loggerheads after the weekend talks mediated by the Costa Rican President Oscar Arias collapsed .
The deposed president has vowed to return home despite warnings from the interim government that they will arrest him if he does .
Why can't the BBC understand that we are STILL a Christian country ?
Aaqil Ahmed :
The BBC 's new head of religious affairs is a practising Muslim
The BBC ’s director - general Mark Thompson has said that religious broadcasting gives rise to more controversy in his job than any other subject .
I am afraid he has n’t seen anything yet .
On Monday , the Corporation announced that it has appointed a Muslim as head of religious broadcasting .
This is not a joke , I can assure you .
The person responsible for overseeing the BBC’s — so far — largely Christian output will be Aaqil Ahmed , a practising Muslim .
Let me say at once that I have nothing whatsoever against Mr Ahmed , who is , I am sure , an excellent broadcaster who may have much to contribute to the coverage of religion .
Some say that he has done a good job producing religious programmes in his present job at Channel 4 , though he has been accused of intellectual shallowness , and last year some Roman Catholic priests alleged he had commissioned documentaries that appeared to contain a pro-Islam bias .
Nor do I doubt that Britain ’s three million Muslims have every right to expect the BBC to provide some religious broadcasting directly aimed at them .
They pay their licence fee like everyone else , and their views should be properly and proportionately reflected in the Corporation ’s programming .
That said , they still constitute a small ( though doubtless devout ) minority of this country ’s population of 60 million .
Some 70 per cent of adult Britons describe themselves as Christian , though a far smaller proportion regularly attend church .
Culturally , this still remains a Christian country with a national Church , the Church of England , whose supreme head is Her Majesty the Queen .
I realise there are also millions of atheists , Muslims and Hindus , and a smaller number of Sikhs and Jews , who may not embrace Christian religious broadcasting .
But I suspect that most of them are happy to put up with it , partly because they respect this country ’s Christian traditions , and partly because , in any case , the BBC is producing fewer and fewer specifically Christian programmes .
Majority faiths :
The Church of England 's Archbishop of Canterbury the Most Reverend Doctor Rowan Williams ( left ) and leader of English Catholics Cardinal Cormac Murphy - O'Connor , who later this month retires from his post as Archbishop of Westminster
My quarrel is not so much with Mr Ahmed as with the BBC .
Despite being required under its charter to provide religious programming , and despite being funded by licence - payers who overwhelmingly describe themselves as Christian , the Corporation has been increasingly pursuing what can only be , at best , described as a non-Christian agenda and , at worst , as an anti-Christian one .
Do I exaggerate ?
I do n’t believe so .
Religious programming on the BBC has dwindled over the past ten years , and what remains is usually anodyne — calculated not to offend non-Christians , and therefore likely to provide very little inspiration to those who have Christian leanings .
Songs Of Praise , for example , has become little more than a jolly sing - a- long with very little Christian input .
A few years ago the BBC ’s own governors criticised the Corporation for ‘ earlier and irregular scheduling ’ of this once popular programme .
In others words , the BBC was attempting to marginalise it , and to a large degree it has succeeded .
In a bizarre move which prefigured the appointment of Mr Ahmed , the Corporation last year made Tommy Nagra , a Sikh , the producer of Songs Of Praise .
So we have a non-Christian in charge of a programme which , not at all surprisingly in the circumstances , has less and less Christian content .
Christians at the BBC appear to be surplus to requirements .
During the past year , four out of seven executives in its already diminished religion department have been made redundant .
These included Michael Wakelin , a Methodist preacher , who was removed as head of religious programmes to clear the way for Aaqil Ahmed .
I imagine that having a Methodist preacher at the heart of the BBC was more than it could stomach .
What the Corporation does at home , it does even more blatantly abroad .
Dr Rowan Williams , the Archbishop of Canterbury , recently complained to Mark Thompson at a private lunch that the BBC World Service has reduced its English - language religious coverage from one hour 45 minutes a week in 2001 to a mere half an hour a week in 2009 .
Tommy Nagra : Sikh producer of Songs of Praise
Half an hour !
This is a highly significant reduction .
For in the Third World , and particularly in Africa , there are hundreds of millions of Christians who probably yearn for more religious programmes on the BBC , and yet the grim , secular - minded commissars who oversee these matters have chosen to cut them back .
The BBC does not like God , unless perhaps it be a Muslim , Hindu or Sikh version .
At every possible opportunity it will wheel forward one of those professional atheists who are not happy to live silently with their own non-belief but are determined to shove it down everyone else ’s throats .
I am thinking particularly of the biologist Richard Dawkins , the novelist Philip Pullman and the philosopher A. C. Grayling .
Can you think of a Christian biologist , novelist or philosopher who is afforded one - tenth of the airtime of these militant , omnipresent non-believers ?
The odd thing is that we live in an age of growing religious conviction .
Even in this country there is a small resurgence of Christianity , largely outside the mainstream churches .
But the BBC is travelling fast in the opposite direction .
The new intellectual orthodoxy , among the narrow group of people who control it , is profoundly anti-Christian .
Yet the Roman Catholic Mark Thompson is probably the most devoutly Christian director - general since John Reith , the first man to have the job and who , as a flinty Presbyterian , must now be spinning in his grave .
Alas , in marked distinction to the militant atheists I have mentioned , Mr Thompson will not stand up for his beliefs .
Being , I trust , fairly realistic , I do not expect him to push back the encroaching secular tide that has taken over so many of the Corporation ’s religious programmes .
But one might reasonably hope that he would at least hold the line .
That line is in keeping with the BBC ’s obligations under its charter , and with the predilections of the Christian majority of this country .
Mr Thompson will not defend it .
To judge by Mr Ahmed ’s appointment , he did not heed the Archbishop of Canterbury ’s concerns at their recent lunch that the BBC is ignoring its Christian audience .
However , the director - general does not mind intervening when he sees fit .
Last year he suggested that Islam should be treated more sensitively by the media because it is a minority religion in this country .
For all I know , Mr Ahmed may prove himself remarkably sympathetic to the sensibilities of Christians in his new job .
One cannot , however , count on that , and it is interesting that he has said there should be more coverage of Muslim matters in the media .
Will this , on the BBC , be at the expense of an already reduced number of Christian programmes ?
In all kinds of ways the publicly funded BBC does not reflect the views of the public it is supposed to serve .
No doubt its secular suits assume that Britain is as anti-Christian as they are .
They ’re out of touch again .
In appointing Aaqil Ahmed they do not simply offend against this country ’s Christian heritage and traditions .
They also further weaken the hold and authority of the BBC .

We do n't know where to GOTO if we do n't know where we 've COME FROM .
This linguistic innovation lives up to all expectations .
A Linguistic Contribution of GOTO - less Programming
By R. Lawrence Clark *
From DATAMATION , December , 1973
Nearly six years after publication of Dijkstra 's now - famous letter , [ 1 ] the subject of GOTO - less programming still stirs considerable controversy .
Dijkstra and his supporters claim that the GOTO statement leads to difficulty in debugging , modifying , understanding and proving programs .
GOTO advocates argues that this statement , used correctly , need not lead to problems , and that it provides a natural straightforward solution to common programming procedures .
Numerous solutions have been advanced in an attempt to resolve this debate .
Nevertheless , despite the efforts of some of the foremost computer scientists , the battle continues to rage .
The author has developed a new language construct on which , he believes , both the pro- and the anti-GOTO factions can agree .
This construct is called the COME FROM statement .
Although usage of the COME FROM statement is independent of the linguistic environment , its use will be illustrated within the FORTRAN language .
box 1
Unconditional COME FROM statement :
General Form COME FROM xxxxx
Where : xxxxx is the number of an executable statement in the same program unit .
This statement causes control to be transferred to the next statement ( the statement immediately following the COME FROM upon completion of the designated statement .
Example : 10 J=1 11 COME FROM 20 12 WRITE ( 6,40 ) J STOP 13 COME FROM 10 20 J=J+2 40 FORMAT ( 14 )
Explanation :
In this example , J is set to 1 by statement 10 .
Statement 13 then causes control to be passed to statement 20 , which sets J to 3 .
Statement 11 then causes control to be passed to statement 12 , which writes the current value of J . The STOP statement then terminates the program .
box 2
Conditional COME FROM statement :
General Form IF ( cond ) COME FROM xxxxx
Where : cond is any logical expression .
xxxxx is the number of an executable statement in the same program unit .
This statement causes control to be transferred to the next statement whenever the condition cond is true and the designated statement has just been completed .
Example : I = 1 IF ( I .LT . 10 ) COME FROM 50 I = I+1 50 WRITE ( 6,60 ) I STOP 60 FORMAT ( 14 )
Explanation :
The COME FROM takes effect only while I is less than 10 .
Thus when I is equal to 10 , the program continues past statement 50 and terminates .
This is equivalent to the now - obsolete formulations :
I = 1 30 I = I+1 WRITE ( 6,60 ) I IF ( I .LT . 10 ) GO TO 30 STOP 60 FORMAT ( 14 ) or DO 50 I = 2 , 10 50 WRITE ( 6,60 ) i STOP 60 FORMAT ( 14 )
Note how much cleaner is the intent of the code containing the COME FROM construct .
box 3 :
Computed COME FROM statement
General Form COME FROM ( x1 , x2 , x3 ...., xn ) , i Where : Each x is the number of an executable statement in the same program unit .
i is an integer variable .
This statement causes control to be transferred to the next statement whenever any of the following conditions holds :
* statement x1 has just been executed and i is equal to 1 * statement x2 has just been executed and i is equal to 2 * statement x3 has just been executed and i is equal to 3 * statement xn has just been executed and i is equal to n
If , when statement xj is executed , i has any value other than j , this statement has no effect .
Example :
DO 200 INDEX=1,10 10 X=1. 20 X=X * 2. 30 X=X * 3. 40 X=X * 4 . 50 X=X * 5 . 60 X=X * 6 . 70 X=X * 7. 80 X=X * 8. 90 X=X * 9 . 100 X=X*10 .
COME FROM ( 10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100 ) , INDEX WRITE ( 6,500 ) INDEX , X 200 CONTINUE STOP 500 FORMAT ( 14,2X , F12.0 )
Example :
This program illustrates the power of the computed COME FROM by providing a compact algorithm for computing factorials .
On the first iteration ( INDEX=1 ) , as soon as statement 10 has been executed , control passes to the WRITE statement .
As a more general case , consider the fifth iteration : X is set to 1 , and the multiplied by 2. , 3. , 4 . and 5 . before control passes to the WRITE statement .
box 4 :
Assign and assigned COME FROM statements
General Form ASSIGN xxxxx TO m * * * COME FROM m , ( x1,x2,x3 , ..., xn )
Where : xxxxx is the number of an executable statement .
It must be one of the numbers x1,x2,x3 ..., xn Each xx if the number of an executable statement in the same program unit .
m is an integer variable which is assigned one of the statement numbers x1,x2,x3 , ..., xn .
The assigned COME FROM causes control to be transferred to the next statement upon completion of the statement whose number is currently assigned to m .
This provides a convenient means of passing control to a common point from a variety of points in the program unit .
The actual point from which control is to be passed can be selected under program control .
Example :
DO 60 I=6,32 20 X=I * 6+14 IF ( X - 20 . ) 10 , 30 , 50 , 10 ASSIGN 40 TO JUMP 30 Y=2*X**2.-17.4 COME FROM JUMP , ( 40,20,30 ) ASSIGN 30 TO JUMP X=X*Y - X**2 40 ASSIGN 40 TO JUMP IF ( Y-X ) 20 , 60 , 50 50 ASSIGN 20 TO JUMP 60 CONTINUE
Explanation :
This example is self - explanatory .
The author feels that the COME FROM will prove an invaluable contribution to the field of computer science .
It is confidently predicted that this solution will be implemented in all future programming languages , and will be retrofitted into existing languages .
Although it is clear that the COME FROM statement fulfills most of the requirements of the advocates of GOTO - less programming , it remains for the practitioners of automatic programming to evaluate just how much this construct contributes to the development of automatic proofs of program correctness .
Having at last put to rest to GOTO controversy , we now may enter the era of the COME FROM conundrum .

In BMW , Cars , Concept Cars , Hybrids , EVs and Alternative Fuel / By Paul Tan / 30 August 2009 12:59 pm / 57 comments
And here we have it , BMW ’s secretive concept car with the radical rear tail lamps set for its Frankfurt showcase unveiled before the show – the BMW Vision EfficientDynamics .
If you ’ve been following the motoring scene closely you ’ll remember back in early 2008 there was another concept car with the exact same name but with a much less radical body .
Come to think of it the design was probably inspired by the GINA concept .
2008 ’s Vision EfficientDynamics
Concept was built using the body of an X5 but featured a 2.0 litre twin turbodiesel ( from the 123d ) with 204hp mated to a 15 kW electric motor .
For this new vehicle , you can see its clearly a sports car , a 2+2 seater to be exact .
It ’s very aerodynamic , rated at 0.22 for its CX drag coefficient .
The car ’s 0.22 figure for its aerodynamics were achieved using various methods .
At the front , you have active air flaps which channel only the required amount of air smoothly into the car .
A number of body elements are used as air deflectors and guide vanes , like the A - pillar .
The underbody is completely covered with a smooth surface .
BMW says this car ’s development concept was to offer the performance of a BMW M Car and a highly emotional character combined with the fuel economy and emission management of a modern small car in the premium class .
Make no mistake , it ’s a hint that future M cars might have KERS - like hybrid electric motors for power assist .
Under the hood of the new BMW Vision EfficientDynamics is something very interesting .
It ’s BMW ’s first modern three - cylinder engine in a long time – a 1.5 litre inline - 3 , mated to two electric motors , one each on the front and rear axle .
It is mounted in a mid-engine position behind the rear seats and puts out 163hp and 290 Nm of torque by itself , and is mated to a 6 - speed twin clutch transmission with its TCU tuned for fuel economy ( other twin clutch previously announced by BMW have been 7 - speed ) .
Overall system output – 356hp and a massive 800 Nm of torque .
0 to 100 km / h takes 4.8 seconds and the car goes up to an electronically limited top speed of 250 km / h. EU test cycle fuel consumption is rated at 3.76 litres per 100 km , and CO2 output is pegged at just 99g / km .
BMW says it can go up to 700 km or just 650 km on the diesel motor alone .
The rear motor sits between the turbodiesel and its twin clutch transmission , while the front motor stands on its own and puts its drive through a two stage single speed reduced ratio transmission .
It puts out 60 kW on its own with a peak torque of 220 Nm but can boost this up to 84 kW for up to 30 seconds and even up to 104 kW in 10 seconds .
The rear motor makes more torque – 290 Nm but less power at 25 kW constant to a peak of 38 kW .
The rear motor also performs the brake energy regeneration functions .
The exhaust system even has a Thermo - Electric Generator which scavenges exhaust gas heat to generate power – up to 200 watts in this instance .
The Vision EfficientDynamics can run on electric power alone for about 50 km – an EV mode as people usually call it .
And the 10.8 kWh ( 80 % discharged capacity ) lithium polymer batteries ( 98 cells ) on - board can be recharged via your wall socket , not just through brake energy regeneration .
When plugged in , a full charge can be done in 2.5 hours with a regular 220V wall plug , or down to 44 minutes at most with a 380V quick charger .
I like how BMW is honest in saying EV mode emissions are rated at about 50g / km when you take into account how the electricity that you pump in from the grid is generated typically in Europe .
The rest of the manufacturers claim completely zero emissions – of course there are emissions , just not from your tailpipe .
You ’re going to have trouble finding tyres for this guy though , the size is quite weird .
195/55R21 .
The whole chassis and suspension are made out of aluminium while the roof and outer skin of the doors are made out of a special polycarbonate glass which have a darkening function when there is excessive light .
Weight is pegged at just 1,395 kg with a low centre of gravity .
The Vision ED measures 4,600 mm in length , 1,900 mm in width and 1,240 mm in height .
Maximum luggage capacity is 150kg , which BMW says the shape and size is enough for 2 golf bags .
Look after the jump for hi-res images of the new Vision ED .
Also check out the video which reveals alot more about how the Vision ED looks like especially at night , and how the front flaps move – this is n’t found in the photo gallery .

Prince Philip fury : Duke of Edinburgh ' irritated ' with Meghan 's failure to support royals
PRINCE PHILIP is said to be " very , very disappointed " with Meghan Markle over her inability to put aside her public career to support Prince Harry and the Royal Family .
Outside of Franklin County High School in Kentucky , students protested an email sent to their teachers instructing them not to allow homosexuals to use the restroom during class .
The email sent by Asst. Principal Karen Buzard was in response to an incident where two female students were caught kissing in the school restroom .
From Kentucky Equality Federation ( KEF ) :
“ I have been in contact with one of the parents of the children involved in the protest , and we support and encourage their constitutional right to assemble peacefully , ” stated Kentucky Equality Federation President Jordan Palmer .
“ We call on the media to investigate this issue further and shed light on the discrimination gays and lesbians face throughout the Commonwealth .
Kentucky Equality Federation will also be contacting the other parents of the children involved in today ’s protest . ”
Laura Reed , Managing Director of KEF is concerned because they have also received complaints from other counties .
“ I ’d like to know what level this mentality , that gay and lesbian students should not be treated equally is coming from .
An incident in one county could be called an isolated incident , but we now have similar reports in three other Kentucky Counties .
I ’d certainly like to know what Education Secretary Helen W. Mountjoy has to say about these incidents . ”
How odd .
According to the school ’s website , April is the month for tolerance .
Does n’t sound like a very tolerant school if you ask me .

But in the course of a few dozen lengthy interviews , not once did I encounter an interview subject who wanted to trade places with an American .
And it was easy enough to see why .
People in these countries were getting precisely what most Americans say they want :
Timely , quality care .
Physicians felt free to practice medicine the way they wanted ; companies got to concentrate on their lines of business , rather than develop expertise in managing health benefits .
But , in contrast with the US , everybody had insurance .
The papers were n’t filled with stories of people going bankrupt or skipping medical care because they could n’t afford to pay their bills .
And they did all this while paying substantially less , overall , than we do .
Over the course of a month , I spoke to just about everybody I could find who might know something about these healthcare systems :
Elected officials , industry leaders , scholars - plus , of course , doctors and patients .
And sure enough , I heard some complaints .
Dutch doctors , for example , thought they had too much paperwork .
French public health experts thought patients with chronic disease were n’t getting the kind of sustained , coordinated medical care that they needed .
Last year , I had the opportunity to spend time researching two of these countries : France and the Netherlands .
Neither country gets the attention that Canada and England do .
That might be because English is n’t their language .
Or it might be because they do n’t fit the negative stereotypes of life in countries where government is more directly involved in medical care .
But no serious politician is talking about recreating either the British or the Canadian system here .
The British have truly “ socialized medicine , ” in which the government directly employs most doctors .
The Canadians have one of the world ’s most centralized “ single - payer ” systems , in which the government insures everybody directly and private insurance has virtually no role .
A better understanding for how universal healthcare might work in America would come from other countries - countries whose insurance architecture and medical cultures more closely resemble the framework we ’d likely create here .
Typically the people making these arguments are basing their analysis on one of two countries , Canada and England , where such descriptions hold at least some truth .
Although the people in both countries receive pretty good healthcare - their citizens do better than Americans in many important respects - they are also subjected to longer waits for specialty care and tighter limits on some advanced treatments .
That was Arizona Senator Jon Kyl , speaking last month about healthcare reform .
But it could have been virtually any other Republican , not to mention any number of sympathetic interest groups , because that ’s the party line for many who oppose healthcare reform .
If President Obama and his supporters get their way , this argument goes , healthcare in America will start to look like healthcare overseas .
Yes , maybe everybody will have insurance .
But people will have to wait in long lines .
And when they are done waiting in line , the care wo n’t be very good .
This is particularly true in the Netherlands , thanks to a nationwide network of urgent care centers the government and medical societies have put in place .
Not only do these centers provide easily accessible care for people who use them ; they leave hospital emergency rooms free to concentrate on the truly serious cases .
Tellingly , a Dutch physician I met complained to me that waiting times in her emergency room had been getting “ too long ” lately .
“ Too long , ” she went on to tell me , meant two or three hours .
When I told her about documented cases of people waiting a day , or even days , for treatment in some American emergency rooms , she thought I was joking .
( In a 2007 Commonwealth Fund survey , just 9 percent of Dutch patients reported waiting more than two hours for care in an ER , compared to 31 percent of Americans . )
The contrast with after - hours care is even more striking .
If you live in either Amsterdam or Paris , and get sick after your family physician has gone home , a phone call will typically get you an immediate medical consultation - or even , if necessary , a house call .
And if you need the sort of attention available only at a formal medical facility , you can get that , too - without the long waits typical in US emergency rooms .
In both the Netherlands and France , most people have long - standing relationships with their primary care doctors .
And when they need to see these doctors , they do so without delay or hassle .
In a 2008 survey of adults with chronic disease conducted by the Commonwealth Fund - a foundation which financed my own research abroad - 60 percent of Dutch patients and 42 percent of French patients could get same - day appointments .
The figure in the US was just 26 percent .
You could be forgiven for assuming , as Kyl and his allies suggest , that so much government control leads to Soviet - style rationing , with people waiting in long lines and clawing their way through mind - numbing bureaucracies every time they have a sore throat .
But , in general , both the Dutch and French appear to have easy access to basic medical care - easier access , in fact , than is the American norm .
The Dutch and the French organize their healthcare differently .
In the Netherlands , people buy health insurance from competing private carriers ; in France , people get basic insurance from nonprofit sickness funds that effectively operate as extensions of the state , then have the option to purchase supplemental insurance on their own .
( It ’s as if everybody is enrolled in Medicare . )
But in both countries virtually all people have insurance that covers virtually all legitimate medical services .
In both countries , the government is heavily involved in regulating prices and setting national budgets .
And , in both countries , people pay for health insurance through a combination of private payments and what are , by American standards , substantial taxes .
Dutch and French patients do wait longer than Americans for specialty care ; around a quarter of respondents to the Commonwealth Fund survey reported waiting more than two months to see a specialist , compared to virtually no Americans .
But Dutch and French patients were far less likely to avoid seeing a specialist altogether - or forgoing other sorts of medical care - because they could n’t afford it .
And there ’s precious little evidence that the waits for specialty care led to less effective care .
On the contrary , the data suggests that while American healthcare is particularly good at treating some diseases , it ’s not as good at treating others .
( In some studies , the US did pretty well on cardiovascular care , not so well on diabetes , for example . )
Overall , the US actually fares poorly on measures like “ potential years of lives lost ” - statistics compiled by specialists in an effort to measure how well healthcare systems perform .
In a 2003 ranking of 20 advanced countries , the US finished 16th when it came to “ mortality amenable to healthcare , ” another statistic that strives to capture the impact of a health system .
The Dutch were 11th and the French were fifth .
These statistics are necessarily crude ; diet , culture , and many other factors inevitably affect the results .
But , taken together , they make it awfully hard to argue that care in these countries is somehow inferior .
If anything , the opposite would seem to be true .
Critics of health reform frequently point to cancer as proof that American healthcare really is superior .
And , it ’s true , the US has , overall , the world ’s highest five - year survival rate for cancer .
But that ’s partly a product of the unparalleled amount of government - funded research in the US - something healthcare reform would not diminish .
Besides , it ’s not as if the gap is as large or meaningful as reform critics frequently suggest .
France ( like a few other European countries ) has survival rates that are generally close and , for some cancers , higher .
Much of the remaining difference reflects differences in treatment patterns that have nothing to do with insurance arrangements and everything to do with idiosyncratic medical cultures .
This is particularly true of prostate cancer , where a staggeringly high survival rate in the US seems to be largely a product of aggressive US treatment - treatment that physicians in other countries , and increasingly many specialists here , consider unnecessary and sometimes harmful .
None of this is to say that either the Dutch or French systems are perfect .
Far from it .
In both countries , healthcare costs are rising faster than either the public - or the country ’s business interests - would like .
And each country has undertaken reforms in an effort to address these problems .
The French have started to introduce some of the managed care techniques familiar to Americans , like charging patients extra if they see specialists without a referral , while developing more evidence - based treatment guidelines in the hope that it will reduce the use of unnecessary but expensive treatments .
The Dutch overhauled their insurance arrangements a few years ago , to introduce more market competition and reward healthcare providers - that is , doctors and hospitals - who get good results .
But cost is the one area in which France and the Netherlands are a lot like Canada and England :
They all devote significantly less of their economy to healthcare than we do .
The French spend around 11 percent of their gross domestic product on healthcare , the Dutch around 10 .
In the US , we spend around 16 percent .
And , unlike in the US , the burden for paying this is distributed across society - to both individuals and businesses - in an even , predictable way .
Of course , reforming health insurance in the US is n’t going to turn this country into France or the Netherlands overnight , any more than it would turn the US into Britain and Canada .
The truth is that the changes now under consideration in Washington are relatively modest , by international standards .
But insofar as countries abroad give us an idea of what could happen , eventually , if we change our health insurance arrangements , the experience of people in Amsterdam and Paris surely matters as much as - if not more than - those in Montreal and London .
In those countries , government intervention has created a health system in which people seem to have the best of all worlds : convenience , quality , and affordability .
There ’s no reason to think the same thing could n’t happen here .

I ’ve started a new service for enrolled members called the Martenson Insider where I will be putting my more timely and market - sensitive thoughts .
This week it is freely available to all .
Here ’s a recent example illustrating that the Fed ’s actions are more consistent with financial desperation than economic health .
In concert with the claims I made in the prior Martenson Insider post , The Fed bought $ 7 billion in Treasuries today and even more yesterday .
This is at the upper end of their recent range of already exceptional purchasing activity .
If things are so rosy that every single dip is being bought in the stock market with a vengeance , I wonder why these printing operations are really necessary ?
This $ 14 billion plus buying activity by the Fed represents fresh money created out of this air that was exchanged for the sovereign debt of the US .
However , since the Fed has , for all practical purposes , never undone its permanent operations ( hey , that ’s why they are called " P OMOs " ) we can consider these additions of money as good as permanent themselves .
.
Looking at the maturity range we can see that these are all long - dated bonds with the one today specifically offering us a tantalizing clue as to how the shell game is being played .
Here ’s the Treasury announcement for the 7 - year auction that came out on July 30 ( last Thursday ) .
Please note the specific CUSIP number circled .
Every bond in this auction carries this specific identifying number .
And now let ’s look at the detail for this most recent POMO :
Good grief !
Just last week , when the auction results were announced it was trumpeted to great fanfare that there was " more than sufficient " bid - to - cover , " strong demand " and all the rest .
And now it turns out that 47 % (! ) of the bonds that were taken by the primary dealers in that auction have been quietly bought by the Fed and permanently secreted to its balance sheet .
They did n’t even wait a full week !
A more honest and open approach would have been for the Fed to simply buy them outright at the auction but this way , using " primary dealers " and " POMOs " and all these other extra steps the basic fact that the Fed is openly monetizing US government debt is effectively hidden from a not - too - terribly inquisitive US press and public .
The speed of the shell game is accelerating .
This immediate repurchase of newly auction bonds by the Fed tells us that demand for these bonds is not nearly as high as advertised , and that things are not quite as strong as represented .
And oh , by the way , do n’t expect any stock market weakness while so many billions are being shoveled out the Fed and into the pockets of the primary dealers .
They ’ll have to do something with all that freshly minted cash …..

I just deleted my mom's number from my cell phone .
That 's because she called me in a panic after seeing a special on CNN about swine flu asking me what she should do .
How about getting a clue , mom ?
Idiot .
You 're all idiots .
If you 've spent more than a few minutes worrying about swine flu , you are an idiot .
That 's because it only takes a few minutes to look up the symptoms , mortality rate , and treatment to realize that it's no different from the common flu ( which kills way more people and by extension is way more awesome ) , and going back to whatever it is you were doing , which was probably turning off CNN and canceling your cable subscription .
In fact , worrying at all makes you an idiot .
Why worry ?
Cowards worry and there is a 100 % overlap between people who worry and people who regularly make cowardly decisions .
That 's why natural disasters kick so much ass .
You never really know when they 're going to hit , so you might as well let go and stop being such a scared pussy all the time .
You 'll cross the bridge of death when you get to it .
Time to start taking risks , asshole !
Quit your job .
Quit answering your boss ' calls during your time off .
Go do something with your life .
Jesus !
Which leads me to why swine flu is stupid .
If I were to worry about anything — and I do n't — swine flu would be pretty near the bottom of the list .
Here 's a list of things that are a higher priority of things to worry about : Dying alone .
Not getting recognized for your genius .
Settling for a shitty job .
Getting married .
Just to be clear , not getting married is n't a problem , getting married is .
Most people , due to fears of dying alone , will marry some jackass because they think nothing better will come along .
They 're usually right .
But even if you find someone who is n't a total cock , marrying them will ruin everything because marriage is a false institution , and a waste of time and money .
Cancel that big wedding party and buy a house , dipshits !
Nobody wants to go to wedding parties .
Besides , big gatherings lend themselves to communicable diseases .
Holy shit that was a sweet transition .
For those of you still not convinced that swine flu is bullshit , here 's a list of symptoms for swine flu versus the regular flu :
See no difference ?
That 's because there is no difference .
Quit closing schools down every time someone gets swine flu , morons !
The problem is n't swine flu , but people talking about it ( this article withstanding , because I'm the exception to every rule , that rule withstanding ) .
Remember SARS ?
More bullshit .
Fewer than 800 people died from it world wide .
Yet the news networks prattled on about it for months .
Now the slow news cycle lends itself to talking about swine flu ad nauseam even though there 's already a vaccine for it .
Oh , did n't know there was a vaccine ?
Yeah there has been a vaccine for it in the works almost since the beginning , rendering this non-issue even more irrelevant .
I will never take the swine flu vaccine because I already have it ; it 's called my immune system , and it 's badass .
I have never gotten sick in my life .
My immune system is so strong that I have to get AIDS just to be normal .
Your best defense against getting swine flu is to be me .
Your second best defense is to have me cough in your face .
In fact , I 'm going to put my money where my mouth is :
Swine Flu Challenge :
I 'm holding a contest because I want to get swine flu just to prove how stupid it is .
If I get it ( unlikely ) , I will document my recovery on Youtube for the entire duration .
Expect a short video .
Here 's what I 'm willing to do :
Contest Rules :
One lucky person will get the opportunity to fly me out to where you live * for one night ** , and you get to sneeze in my face .
Winner must provide a proof of having swine flu ( signed doctor blood test or something along those lines ) .
Winner must not have any other bullshit diseases .
I do n't want your herpes , even though I can't get them .
This contest is real .
Email me if you have swine flu and are willing to fly me out to sneeze in my face .
Do n't email me unless you 're serious and unless you have the money to fly me out first class .
I 'm totally serious about getting swine flu , but I have other shit to do too , so your window of opportunity is limited .
You must fly me out between September 7 , 2009 and September 21 , 2009 because I 'll be on book tour before then .
If you miss your window of opportunity , too bad .
Plan better next time and do n't get sick unless I hold a contest .
Make it happen .
1,509,450 people want me to cough in their faces .

Every year , university programs spit out thousands of highly trained jazz musicians sporting hard - earned diplomas and high hopes .
But when these graduates hit the first formal rite of jazz passage a desperate trip to the local pawn shop they learn that the diploma is literally not worth the paper it 's printed on .
Entering school , their dream was simple :
To perform music they love for attentive audiences in jazz clubs , concert halls , and festivals , and to earn a fair wage for their efforts .
But set loose from the nurturing womb of the campus , they quickly experience the shock of an indifferent and often hostile new reality .
The world does n't take kindly to jazz artists , and before long these graduates find their ideals displaced by bitter cynicism .
At best , one percent of them will eventually realize their dreams , and only after years of paying dues .
These are the , whose success results from a rare combination of often freakish talent , perseverance , good looks , personality , ambition , geography and an ability to skillfully navigate unpredictably changing public tastes .
Why so few Chosen Ones ?
Simple economics :
People who want to play jazz actually outnumber those who enjoy or even tolerate it , let alone pay to hear it .
Consequently , in the microscopic jazz economy , there is n't nearly enough to go around , though competition for the crumbs is relentless and sometimes brutal .
This simple financial reality underlies virtually all of the infighting , backbiting , and doomsaying that define the jazz condition .
But when the jazz bug bites , it 's hard to shake .
Of the remaining 99 % , the vast majority continues the battle , even in the face of shattered dreams and personal defeat .
How do they get by ?
By compromising their music , their lifestyle , their self - respect , or any combination of the three .
What , then , are the paths to survival ?
Whether through free choice or fate , hopeless devotion or clinical insanity , jazz musicians eventually sort themselves out into the following subtypes :
Gig Whores are the largest class within the jazz community , and are the easiest to find .
They ply their wares in hotel lobbies , restaurants , private parties of all types , and anywhere else that jazz is degraded to an artless commodity and sold to the highest bidder .
This is done knowingly and willfully , but not without self - pity ; while a Gig Whore may claim to be working " in the trenches , " the jazz musician within knows that he 's really plumbing untreated musical sewage .
Even outside the jazz arena , jazz Gig Whores , working undercover , populate the music world 's ample underbelly : the pianist wearily accompanying a tone - deaf vocalist in a community musical theater production or demonstrating Costco 's latest digital keyboard , the bugler announcing post parade at a horse racing track ( slyly inserting a Charlie Parker lick disguised as a flourish ) , the off - camera bassist backing American Idol contestants , the herald trumpeters dressed in renaissance costumes serenading department store shoppers at Christmas time , the wedding band leader cajoling guests into a conga line for " Hot , Hot , Hot " ( and the six accomplices to his musical crime , barely hiding their disgust and self - loathing ) , the drummer making " punch - line " sounds for a would - be comedian ...
Each banking part of his pay to subsidize the day when he might dare to take the jazz plunge , holding his nose with one hand as the other gratefully palms the ample paycheck .
Yet there is room for heroism in the Gig Whore 's world .
That same pianist might acrobatically shift keys and drop beats in tandem with the vocalist , magically masking her every misstep .
The bassist might find mistakes in the vapid Idol charts and fix them on the fly with improvisational prowess .
The wedding band members might " fake " the bride 's favorite song , a last - minute obscure request they all just happen to know by ear .
More often than not , jazz Gig Whores make up in talent what they lack in pride , taste or integrity .
While money motivates the Gig Whore 's musical lifestyle , fear motivates his more immediate actions .
Gig Whores have an intense phobia of open spaceson their calendars which can elicit sudden adrenaline - fueled outbreaks of cold - calls to contractors , restaurateurs and wedding planners .
Between calls , they sit by their phones with the desperation of dateless adolescents .
They 're also terrified of their booking agents , clients and contracts , and compensate by overworking shortening their breaks and prolonging their sets .
You 'll often find a Gig Whore ( and his unfortunate band ) playing in an empty room long after the clients and guests have left , a lone custodian angrily mopping the floor , his iPod unable to fully drown out the tired music emanating from the bandstand .

They eat only out of necessity , seemingly nourished by the music they play , including their hours of daily practicing .
Most varieties of Epiphytes thrive in subterranean environments , such as dank basement apartments , with little apparent need for sunlight .
They move frequently from hovel to hovel after seemingly exhausting the available air that sustains them .
Their skin is wan , and they blink uncomfortably in daylight , preferring to wear sunglasses around the clock .
Epiphytes are the trendsetters in the jazz community , admired and emulated by their peers .
Their speech is heavily peppered with cutting - edge jazz lingo , and they are often innovators in jazz vocabulary .
Although they are the elite class of the working musicians ( short of Chosen Ones , who live in a separate musical universe ) , they are the least likely to reproduce , finding economic advantage in a more streamlined lifestyle .
In this sense , an adverse Darwinian effect works against the forward movement of jazz , as natural selection favors gene propagation from the less talented , more whorish players .
Caucasian Epiphytes often live their lives as modern - day extensions of the Beat Generation .
African - American Epiphytes are frequently motivated by a mandate to explore and perpetuate the roots of contemporary black culture and identity .
Regardless of race , Epiphytes can be highly temperamental , and many are gifted with a special ability to make the other musicians on the bandstand hate one another .
The relationship between Epiphytes and Gig Whores is particularly intriguing : Epiphytes live on the fringes of mainstream society in order to stake their place in jazz music ; Gig Whores work on the fringes of the jazz world in order to stake their place in mainstream society .
Yet between them is a quiet understanding , a shared realization that there is no perfect solution to the Jazz Problem .
Both are driven by a Buddhist sensibility : Epiphytes believe that material objects are impermanent and of no value ; Gig Whores embrace the notion that life is suffering .

The clearest path to survival in jazz is simply to have no need for money .
And while many jazz artists create their music with little regard for listeners , those who are independently wealthy have the luxury of disregarding their audience entirely .
As a general rule , the wealthier the artist , the less accessible his music and the loftier his rhetoric about musical freedom and innovation .
Many of these artists purchase their own concert spaces , where they book themselves , joined by their fellow moneyed , avant peers or by Epiphytes with avant leanings .
Although anger is often a central element of their musical aesthetic ( inspired , as they are still , by the spirit of 1960s rebellion ) , in the largest sense , no harm is done .
Their audience consists of the same four to eight people for each concert .
Because so few people will pay to hear the music , it is often supported by grants from arts agencies .
Silver Spoons spend their abundant free time thinking about , and writing descriptions of , the deep philosophical underpinnings of their work .
These descriptions are then adapted to serve as the narratives of their grant proposals .
The grants panelists , who know nothing about jazz , equate the artists ' impressive discourse with depth of musicality , and reward them accordingly .
It should be noted that not all independently wealthy artists are drawn to the avant - garde .
Some take part in the mainstream jazz arena , where they play out a conflicted relationship with their money .
The most callous ones offer to perform in jazz venues for free , undercutting their working peers and driving down the already meager local pay scale .
Others carefully pick their spots , accepting only the most flattering gigs , thereby earning an artificially exalted reputation among audiences and the media .
And some , uncomfortable with the seeming oxymoron of being a " moneyed jazz artist , " live Spartan lifestyles that enable them to " pass " among their less privileged colleagues .
SubsetIdentifying SignsSurvival TechniquesLike Silver Spoons , Career Professionals have no shortage of money ; the difference is that they work for it .
Although they take their " straight gig " seriously often earning advanced college degrees and struggling to climb the corporate ladder they still self - identify primarily as jazz artists .
This creates an inevitable disconnect between their day - to - day and stage personae .
In their suburban neighborhoods they 're accepted as hard - working citizens , lent an air of the exotic by their occasional late - night jazz gigs .
Among their jazz peers , they spin their personal narratives along these lines :
By making a living outside the workaday jazz world , they 're able to keep their music " unpolluted " by artistically compromising gigs .
The reality beneath the spin that they and / or their spouse simply do n't want to forgo the creature comforts that a jazz income can't buy goes unstated , but is silently understood by all .
Career Professionals have tremendous admiration for Epiphytes , but are reluctant to take the corresponding vow of poverty .
On the other hand , they view Gig Whores with outright disdain ; ugly cousins who have chosen the musical low road .
The biggest challenge faced by Career Professionals is maintaining their chops .
Working nine to five makes it difficult to keep up any sort of practice regimen , and insisting on playing only meaningful gigs minimizes their time on stage .
They compensate with intensive bursts of practice before each performance , shutting themselves off from their families and shortening their sleep habits .
At the same time , they insist that mere chops are irrelevant to any music of significance , which is , by definition , the only music they play .
Identifying SignsSurvival TechniquesUnlike the more highly trained and thoroughly moneyed Career Professionals , Survivalists typically bounce among unskilled jobs , taking them mainly out of desperation as their gigging income falls short .
More often than not this sets off a perpetual cycle of gigging , falling into debt , washing dishes or working at a music store to get back ahead , quitting to gig full - time again , then falling back into debt .
Few have the wisdom to leave the jazz world altogether ; many are trombonists .
Artists in this group are envious of Gig Whores , who are more successfully able to troll the depths of the music world for scraps .
They view Epiphytes with ambivalence , being reluctant to admit that they are separated from them only by a lack of talent .
Identifying SignsSurvival TechniquesJazz musicians with working wives may be nearly as fortunate as the Silver Spoons , and freed to lead similarly privileged lifestyles .
Or they may discover over time that their jazz career and the terms of their marital relationship are virtually incompatible .
It all depends on a complex formula that charts the timing of an artist 's marriage against the progress of his career to that point .
The results of this equation can be distilled into two subsets , with highly divergent outcomes .
A jazz artist who marries young , when his bride shares his delusion that he might become a Chosen One , eventually develops an inevitable air of failure and defeat .
His once idealistic wife , hardened by the burden of becoming the family provider , reminds him constantly that his career choice has proven to be a selfish indulgence .
Though she once bought into the jazz community 's inflated sense of self - importance , she quickly loses interest in her husband 's gigs , considering them as does the rest of the outside world trivial and irrelevant .
Forced to carry his weight , he becomes unavailable for rehearsals , instead preparing family meals or driving his kids to soccer games .
He may cancel gigs at the last minute because his wife needs " a night out with the girls , " and he can't find a sitter .
Deemed unreliable and uncommitted by his jazz peers , he gets fewer and fewer calls .
Under pressure especially if his wife can't fully pay the bills he gradually morphs into a Gig Whore of the most desperate variety , eventually landing in a high - paying , soul - crushing variety band .
In the worst - case scenario , the wife at that point discovers that her husband who if nothing else was at least once an idealistic artist has lost all appeal .
She leaves him for a successful businessman who has a clear concept of self , does n't work nights , and listens to music that is n't all crazy .
The artist 's life continues its downward spiral until he hits bottom as a bitter Survivalist .
By contrast , the jazz artist who is already an established Epiphyte by the time he meets his future wife has found his salvation .
The wife - to - be understands the realities of the jazz world , perceives her future husband 's devotion to his financially unviable art form as romantic , and marries the husband and his music alike .
Such women are the angels of mercy in the jazz world ; the sole counter - evidence to cosmic indifference .
Their fortunate husbands become , in a sense , quasi- Chosen Ones , minus the true Chosen Ones ' fame and ( modest ) fortune .
Identifying Signs , Survival TechniquesJazz music , like philosophy , ancient literature , and other insular fields with limited real - world application , has created its own cozy home in the educational system .
In secondary schools , it gives young musicians a relatively harmless introduction to a music they 'll later discard as outdated and irrelevant .
But at the college level , jazz majors are irretrievably immersed in the music 's history , theory and above all performance .
Once the real world shatters their performing aspirations , many flee right back to the university or conservatory where , safely ensconced in a tenured position , they perpetuate the vicious cycle .
Tenured university teaching posts are probably the most coveted positions in the jazz field ( other than the exclusive province of the Chosen Ones ) .
Ironically , the personality traits that make for success in the academic world have nothing in common with jazz artistry .
Jazz professorships require advanced degrees , and those who pursue them are by nature practical , career - minded and with their orientation to future security rather than present artistic expression far from spontaneous .
Perhaps that 's why the university professors have pioneered their own form of jazz .
As they 'll explain to their Jazz History classes , jazz music has evolved since its inception to reflect the lives and times of its practitioners .
From bebop through free jazz , the music has been the artists ' vehicle for reacting to their social , political and cultural environment .
No surprise then , that jazz enables these same professors to express their own unique academic milieu : their music is the sound of personal ambition and scholarly thought .
Performance and composition alike are theory - driven , and the ability to navigate complex written chord changes is paramount .
Rather than relying on their ears , faculty performers are glued to their scores , negotiating obtuse chords by calculating scale choices with mathematical efficiency .
Unfortunately , the music 's intellectual underpinnings render it inaccessible to all but fellow professors and advanced students .
Undereducated audiences are left behind , even those who recognize that appreciation of such intricate music is a mark of personal sophistication .
Although jazz professors rarely overlap in style with the Chosen Ones , most still aspire to join their ranks .
Toward that end , they book Chosen Ones for concerts , often finding ways to share the stage with them , sometimes composing a special tune for the occasion ( and typically naming the tune after the Chosen One , thereby marking their relationship for eternity ) .
They wine and dine them , take joint photos , and if possible book them on the side for personal recording projects .
Interestingly , although Chosen
Ones are the subject of great envy among jazz professors , many aging Chosen Ones who neglected to plan for retirement eventually seek and easily land University posts .
There they are allowed to bypass normal hiring procedures in exchange for lending their credibility and doing virtually nothing .
Like other tenured faculty , jazz professors are required to publish , and as the number of jazz PhDs increases , so does the obscurity of their topics .
Jazz Educators ' conferences are full of presentations scheduled early in the morning and sparsely attended on subjects ranging from " The Scalar Implications of Minor Seventh Flat Nine Chords in Mid-period Bill Evans Voicings " to " A Study of Coltrane 's Reed and Mouthpiece Choices in Relationship to His Late Career Dental Work " to " Post - Chromatic Stress Disorder in the Neo Lydian Landscape .

If you , Reader , were to try to look like a jazz artist , you would wind up looking like the jazz professor , who tries far harder to look like a jazz artist than an actual jazz artist does .
Goatees , berets , tinted glasses , African scull caps , ponytails , and earrings are standard fare .
By contrast the committed jazz artist , especially the Epiphyte , does n't much care what he looks like and does n't have the money to try anyway .
Identifying SignsSurvival TechniquesWe've all heard the story of the awkward kid taunted throughout his school years .
He 's the first to be bullied , the last to be picked for sports teams , and the least likely to land a date ; his only recourse is to plan his eventual revenge .
Entering adulthood , he channels his rage into his career , fighting his way , dog - eat - dog , to the top .
Whether a greedy CEO , an evil slumlord , or a powerful politician , underlying his every move is the subconscious desire to exact payback on his early enemies and redeem his tormented youth .
So it is with the child who is drawn to music , but simply has no talent for it .
No matter how much he practices he never makes it past third chair in band , never gets to play in rock bands with his friends , and never gets picked to solo in stage band .
Undaunted , he pursues a music degree , majoring in jazz the most challenging and hopeless musical form .
He gets called for a few scattered gigs at first , then never called back , shunned once again for his tin ear .
It does n't take him long to discover that there 's only one path to success ; best of all , by taking it , he 'll be able to wield devastating power over those who have rejected him .
Without looking back , he joins " The Industry " or its periphery : label executives , radio programmers and promoters , critics , arts administrators , booking agents , soundmen , and recording engineers .
Collectively , they ruthlessly bully working musicians and ensure that the jazz world will forever be a career cesspool .
Describing the industry 's destructiveness could be a full story in itself , but for the sake of brevity , here are single examples of how each of its component parts might suppress an artist .
In reality , the examples are endless , and the whole the machinery 's ability to demolish aspiring musicians is far greater than the sum of its parts .
Booking Agent : Promises the client a polka band ; books three jazz artists and a french accordian player , omits all details until the day of the gig , then assigns the artists a complete setlist for the evening all authentic polkas and insists they wear lederhosen and pretend to be German .
Critic :
In a race against his peers to discover and give birth to the next Chosen One , finds the least accessible new artist on the scene and writes a review glorifying his music as simply too sophisticated for less enlightened ears , provoking the other critics , in the spirit of competition , to trash the young artist as " utterly without talent , " destroying his career before it has even begun .
Soundman : Working with an acoustic jazz trio in a small hall , uses the concert as an opportunity to show off massive new gear .
Tapping into finely honed heavy metal sensibilities , mixes the kick drum and bass above all else , rocking the house with his thunderous , state - of - the - art subwoofers .
Recording Engineer :
In the middle of a sensitive song , where the band members are interacting at an artistic level previously unknown to them , accidentally hits a button that not only destroys the take , but sends a deafening , ear - piercing squeal through the headphones .
Arts Administrator : Diverts and sucks dry the scant dollars that governmental agencies and charitable foundations earmark for jazz artists .
Club Owner : Books a jazz artist for a weeklong stint , persuading him to cancel several lesser gigs already on his calendar .
Shortly before the week begins , dumps him for a better - known Smooth Jazzact .
Radio Programmer : Conducts focus groups to determine which new jazz CDs are least likely to distract " listeners " in their office environments .
Broadcasts this music exclusively , rejecting any jazz that is remotely assertive or interesting , thereby convincing the station 's audience that jazz is , indeed , dead .
Radio Promoter : Charges artists exorbitant fees in exchange for pestering radio programmers to play the artists ' new recordings .
Easily gets compliance of the radio programmers , who are happy to be relieved of the task of sorting through hundreds of new CDs that arrive every week from other hopeful , but less wealthy , musicians .
Thereby ensures that airplay goes to the artists with the most money , rather than to those who make the best music .
Record Label : Signs an artist to an exclusive deal , does nothing to promote his music , then discards him as used goods , yesterday 's news , tomorrow 's Gig Whore .
These disparate industry segments do n't lend themselves to generalization , beyond their destructive effect on the jazz environment .
However , those who reach the top of their profession particularly the more highly paid record label executives may share certain characteristics : Identifying SignsSurvival Techniques
When times get tough , industry members survive by moving from bankrupt company to soon - to - be - bankrupt company .
Most recently they 've discovered a more sure - fire survival technique , stacking their supposed jazz rosters with artists who actually have nothing whatsoever to do with jazz .
This fires up a " jazz revival , " wherein the public now fed a diet of pop music labeled as jazzsuddenly discovers that it likes jazz after all .
The industry , as described above , still exists , but breakthroughs in digital technology have created promising new opportunities for better exploiting na ?ve jazz artists .
Digitally enabled predators include jazz - specific web - hosting sites ( charging more than double the typical web - hosting fee in exchange for burying the artists ' information among hundreds of his peers ) , database companies selling lists of email contacts ( primarily addresses of festivals that do n't accept unsolicited materials ) , and international " promoters " who request CDs from artists looking to perform at festivals abroad , then sell them on eBay .
All have in common that in a field where there 's not nearly enough to go around they siphon money directly from artists , further reducing their minimal incomes by preying on desperate , false hope .
The jazz class system is both hierarchical and pliable .
This enables an artist not only to interact with artists from other classes , but also to move from one class to others below it as his career inevitably declines .
When musicians from two or more classes interact professionally , the results are both predictable and entertaining .
Example One : A bandleader , knowing an Epiphyte has fallen on hard times , invites him to play a wedding gig , along with the leader 's usual assemblage of Gig Whores .
What happens ?
The Epiphyte shows up for the tux gig wearing black jeans , black tennis shoes , white tee - shirt , dark navy blazer , and bow tie .
He begins the gig playing in a correctly subdued , unswinging style .
During each break , he eats frantically off the buffet , then stuffs more food cocktail shrimp , brie cheese , spanakopita , and swedish meatballs into his pockets .
He also drinks furiously from the open bar .
Each subsequent set , his playing becomes louder and more adventurous , and before long he 's embarking on long , angular , ear - bending solos , even as he 's swearing at the drummer for not digging in hard enough .
The rest of the Gig Whores , caught between wanting to please the leader and emulate the Epiphyte , begin to similarly stretch .
The bride 's mother complains , the Epiphyte storms off the bandstand , and the leader silently vows to replace his entire band .
Example Two : A record label , impressed by a Gig Whore 's resourcefulness , invites him to join its staff .
Now , instead of wearing a clown nose and playing " Pop Goes the Weasel " for toddlers ' birthday parties , he can have a dignified day job oppressing his fellow jazz artists .
What is his response ?
" How much does it pay ?
" Jazz career trajectories conform directly to the law of gravitational forces :
Any and all movement is downward .
One Gig
Whore might marry a woman who financially supports but personally belittles him ; another , when times get lean , might be forced to take a low - level day job for survival .
An Epiphyte , finding his available oxygen supply running low , might compromise his musical ideals by becoming a Gig Whore , or stand on principle and join the Survivalists .
A Silver Spoon , tired of playing inaccessible music for audiences of four to eight people , might instead enter the industry , founding a new record label that documents , for eternity , the same inaccessible music .
Full Circle # 1: A label A&R man hears a standout young soloist at a New York club one night and quickly signs him to a deal .
The thusly anointed Chosen
One puts out several critically acclaimed releases and tours internationally for a number of years before falling out of favor with changing public tastes .
Moving back to his hometown , staying rent - free at his parents ' house , he becomes an Epiphyte , playing with the best local musicians , but with gigs far from plentiful in a relatively small city barely making enough money to cover his living expenses .
Memories of his glory days make it hard for him to accept this austere lifestyle , and he gradually lowers the bar , earning more money and retaining less dignity as he becomes a Gig Whore .
The demeaning gigs eventually drive him to drink , and he becomes notoriously unreliable .
Before long , his calendar starts to empty , and he 's forced to look for non-playing work .
He holds a series of meaningless part - time day jobs while gradually building a roster of untalented private students .
One day , having hit rock - bottom , he is seemingly rescued when his old label calls , looking for a new A&R man , hoping to cash in on his name recognition .
He relocates to New York where , his first week on the job , he hears a standout young soloist at a club .... Full Circle # 2: An impressionable young jazz pianist is booked by an agent for a solo gig in a hotel lobby .
He quickly discovers that the clientele hate it when he plays Coltrane tunes , but love it when he sings Sinatra songs , no matter how badly .
Soon , he parlays his vocal success into a steady gig with a bassist and drummer , and before long begins to get lucrative work playing corporate receptions .
He hires more band members , and expands the repertoire to include pop favorites .
He stops playing piano , preferring instead to front the band on vocals , adding dance steps , shaking his ever - widening butt .
One night while singing " Mustang Sally " at a wedding reception , he coaxes the drunken crowd to yell " Ride , Sally , Ride , " and discovers the euphoria of audience participation .
From there , his life as an entertainer becomes an unquenchable thirst for affirmation .
When he occasionally encounters a quiet audience , attentive to the music , it frightens him , sweat flowing from his brow as he tries ever harder to get them dancing and singing .
His eventual midlife crisis points him toward the more lucrative , less stressful life of an agent , and the day he books his first job he will have successfully matured from whore to pimp , sending an innocent young pianist into the very lobby where he got his own start .
The variations are endless .
Additionally , a declining but still significant subgroup of males enter the jazz world motivated by the idea that , as artists , they might somehow have special appeal to women .
Their miscalculation is gross , in that : 1 ) Women prefer men who are n't broke ; 2 ) Women prefer men who bathe regularly ;
3 ) Women prefer men whose music is n't antiquated and irrelevant ;
4 ) Women can grow tired , after spending another lonely night on a barstool in a deserted jazz club , of assuring men that the first two measures of their second chorus in the fourth tune of the last set did n't really suck in fact , were pretty good , actually very good especially knowing that the singer 's charts were pathetic , the drummer was rushing maniacally , the bassist was drunk and near comatose , the piano was painfully out of tune , and the sound coming from the stage monitors was like a chamber of horrors ; really , in light of all that , the whole solo was practically super - human , the work of a great artist overcoming adversity to make a powerful , transcendent statement .
A more gender - neutral report might recognize the growing number of female instrumentalists by referring to " working spouses " rather than " working wives . "
However , the sample of female players has n't been large enough , for long enough , to yield statistically significant results .
It is hoped that they will be more grateful than resentful for being excluded from this admittedly phallocentric document .
Female vocalistsas has been extensively documented outside this reportare a different species altogether .
While this discussion of " Jazz Educators " focuses on university professors , jazz is also taught in the secondary schools and through private instruction .
These lower - level teachers have one commonality with university faculty :
They 'd really rather be gigging .
Beyond that , though , they have their own unique profiles : Secondary school teachers :
Although these teachers rank beneath university teachers in the jazz pecking order and in societal standing , theirs is the more noble calling .
While university professors are largely responsible for the flooding of the market with aspiring professionals highly trained and largely generic secondary school teachers are more interested in building the future jazz audience .
Their focus is on instilling an understanding of and appreciation for jazz among their students ; unfortunately , this appreciation quickly fades with the students ' maturity .
Private instructors :
Whether teaching in the back rooms of music stores or out of their own homes , these are individuals who tried and failed to make it as Gig Whores .
Although most other musicians consider private instruction the final stop before suicide , society is kinder to these unfortunates , allowing them to hide their indignity behind " the importance of arts education , " " passing knowledge from generation to generation , " and " keeping youth off the streets .
" This well - fed , parasitic middlemantypically a jealous amateur musician formally trained in non-profit business administration may work either directly for the government or for a government - funded non-profit presenting agency .
Either way , he or she enjoys a salary and accompanying benefits unthinkable for a working jazz artist .
Smooth Jazz is , of course , not jazz at all .
Apart from the fact that its bass and drum parts are actually repetitive pop patterns and its harmonies are simple pop progressions , its practitioners are entirely unlike jazz artists .
They are well - paid , well - balanced , enjoy normal hobbies , have many fans , appreciate their audiences , and seem to harbor minimal disdain for mankind as a whole .
Three teenagers are dead and 11 injured in an attack on a gay youth club in Tel Aviv last night .
A masked man opened fire on a crowd in front of a gay community centre in Tel Aviv late Saturday , killing three people and wounding at least 10 others , Israeli emergency services said .
A young man and a young woman were killed on the spot while the third victim died in hospital and one of the wounded was in serious condition , they said .
The gunman , who was dressed in black , unloaded an automatic weapon on the young group of gays and lesbians at the entrance of the centre , located in the heart of Tel Aviv , and then ran away , witnesses said .
You might not know it , but you 've heard about the XP3 :
It 's that phone that 's always getting drenched , elephant - smooshed or shot , and surviving .
Well , I finally got one , and the timing could n't be better .
XP3 , I 'm going to eat you .

The Price
The Sonim XP3 is by no means a new phone , either as a product or a piece of technology .
For the US , though , it 's still semi- fresh :
It 's just been announced on regional carriers around the country , and as of last week you can pick one up unlocked for about $ 400 at Best Buy .
Advertisement
The Verdict
As you can see , this thing is a brick .
It 's a heavy , Tonka - yellow slab of plastic and rubber that sometimes makes calls , sends texts and visits a website or two .
In a way it 's the ultimate dumbphone :
It 's not annoyingly dumb — it 's actually got a decently attractive UI , and it 's worlds easier to use than the not - as - tough Casio G'z One — and the battery life is conversely related to the phone 's feature set , just like it should be .
( I 've been playing with this thing on and off for more than a week , and I still do n't need to charge it . )
Also , of course , it 's tough , like all my favorite dumb people .
It 's the anti-iPhone , and not necessarily in a bad way .
When I say tough , I do n't mean to say this is a phone for people who go through a lot of handsets , or hate that their Pre 's backplate keeps getting scratched — this is in a different league , for a different type of human :
Do you work on an oil rig ?
As a stuntman ?
Underwater , sometimes ?
Did you sign a 100 - page insurance waiver before starting your current job ?
Have you ever watched a coworker get crushed to death , along with his phone ?
No ?
Advertisement
Ok , but would you like the option to occasionally cook your phone ?
Spaghetti con Tele
Gallery or video , take your pick :
Sonim never claimed this would n't kill the phone , and the battery clearly states that it should n't be heated past 130 degrees .
After a brief speaker fritz that solved itself , though , the XP3 works perfectly .
Advertisement
You can boil it , like pasta , for at least three minutes
Advertisement
It 's surprisingly pleasant to use , for what it is
Advertisement
Battery lasts forever
Advertisement
It 's not terribly huge , but not thin either
Advertisement
It 's fundamentally ridiculous , though necessary for a select group of people
Advertisement
No 3G , or major carriers ( yet )

Extremely hard to chew , even harder to pass

Oh , it 's a British beauty , a long - necked blond with a pale complexion , as coveted as an English rose .
It 's brewed in England , but Bud Light Lime is a Canadian hit and it's one of the hottest - selling beers at the LCBO .
But the Corona look - alike in the clear bottle swept into GTA liquor stores at the beginning of May .
Since then , it 's moved into the top 10 selling beers at the LCBO , having had unprecedented sales growth despite often being out of stock for weeks .
Brewed by Anheuser - Busch in the U.K. , and distributed here by Labatt , the beer came to Ontario as an import and by July 11 , the LCBO had sold 70,000 cases .
Twelve - packs leave the Beer Store just as fast as they come in .
On the city 's east side , a store sold its shipment of 144 cases of Bud Light Lime bottles in a day , said an employee .
" What 's salient is that this product has made it into the top 10 after only two months of sales in LCBO stores , " says company spokesperson Chris Layton .
" If this growth continues it could continue to move up the list . "
Like its distant cousin from a decade ago , Mike 's Hard Lemonade , the naturally lime - flavoured beer has created a sober buzz .
Fans of the light beer , which has been selling in the U.S. since April last year , used Facebook to petition Labatt to bring the beer here and supporters on the social networking site now number almost 60,000 .
But not all of the comments have been good .
One likens finding the beer to rare superhero sightings : " is it a bird is it a plane no it just sold out it is moving so fast , you just can't find it to buy . "
Another posting says , " Everytime ( sic ) I go to buy it they are out , if you do n't have it on the shelves ... kind of pointless . "
The reason for the shortage is that demand surpassed even the supplier 's expectations , says Layton .
" It was such a fast seller , and there was such an unanticipated demand , there were periods of time that some liquor stores were sold out . "
Six packs of cans , brewed in the U.S. , were introduced to the LCBO a couple of weeks ago to ensure there was enough product on the shelves .
Labatt started producing the cans a year earlier than planned and is now brewing more of the beer to meet demand .
Layton credits several factors for the brew 's success including the clear bottle , the continued popularity of lager and lime and timing .
" Summer is beer time in our business , " says Layton .

And he says , " every so often you get a product that captures the public 's imagination .

Americans Lives vs. Insurance Company Profits : the real battle in healthcare reform
Lying about healthcare , indeed fear - mongering about healthcare , has ramped up as insurance companies attempt to keep their profits .
Those profits are created by a system where the US spends 5 % more of its economy on healthcare in exchange for the worst results of anywestern nation .
To insurance company executives , their profits , their executive salaries , and their bonuses , are not just worth lying for , but also worth killing for — or at least letting people die .
The Shona Holmes Healthcare Hitjob
Case in point : Shona Holmes is the current poster girl for the liars slandering Canadian health care in an attempt to discredit reform .
Ms. Holmes alleges she was horribly endangered by Canada ’s healthcare system :
Both CNN and McConnell made a big deal out of Shona Holmes , an Ontario woman who claims she was forced by Ontario ’s health system to go to the United States for life - saving surgery for a brain tumour .
She claims that in 2005 delays in access to treatment at home made it necessary to go to the Mayo Clinic in Arizona and pay $ 97,000 for her care .
Her story sounds bad , does n’t it ?
Except , of course , it ’s a lie :
On the Mayo Clinic ’s website , Shona Holmes is a success story .
But it ’s somewhat different story than all the headlines might have implied .
Holmes ’ “ brain tumour ” was actually a Rathke ’s Cleft Cyst on her pituitary gland .
To quote an American source , the John Wayne Cancer Center , “ Rathke ’s Cleft Cysts are not true tumors or neoplasms ; instead they are benign cysts . ”
There ’s no doubt Holmes had a problem that needed treatment , and she was given appointments with the appropriate specialists in Ontario .
She chose not to wait the few months to see them .
But it ’s a far cry from the life - or - death picture portrayed by Holmes on the TV ads or by McConnell in his attacks .
In other words , her condition was not immediately life threatening , and it was prioritized accordingly .
But Holmes did n’t want to wait behind people who needed care more than she did , so she went the US where she could pay out of pocket to jump to the head of the line .
Healthcare Triage : US vs Canada
Here ’s the deal : both the US and Canada prioritize patients , and both engage in health care rationing .
In Canada health care is prioritized by how urgently a patient requires treatment .
In America , to a much greater extent , access to medical care is prioritized by how much money the patient has .
Someone in the US who was sicker than Ms. Holmes was forced to wait longer for treatment because Holmes was rich enough to pay $ 97,000 .
A Personal Perspective on Canadian Healthcare
I should add that I have firsthand experience with how the Canadian system prioritizes treatment .
In 1993 , at the age of 25 , I became very ill with ulcerative colitis .
I was hospitalized , and put on very expensive drugs .
About a week after being hospitalized , the nurse watching me called in my doctors on a Sunday because I was deteriorating so fast — pain killers were no longer having any effect ( i.e. , high doses of morphine were not working ) , I would n’t let anyone touch me , and I was becoming delirious .
At about midnight , they wheeled me into the operating chamber and took out my large intestine .
While they were digging around , they found out I had appendicitis , and they took that out too .
It would have burst within 2 days , and in my weakened state , it would have killed me .
Unfortunately , one of the treatments for ulcerative colitis involves immune suppressing drugs .
My immune system basically shut down , my liver almost shut down , and I spent almost another 3 months in the hospital , riddled with extremely painful and crippling infections and other problems .
At one point I was on 9 drugs ; one of them was an antibiotic so expensive that only a single doctor in the hospital could approve it .
My gastroenterologist called the treatment the equivalent of “ pouring gold dust into your veins . ”
I wasted away , my weight dropping below 90 lbs .
I often joke that I was old young : I ’ve used a walker , crutches and cane .
The Universal Healthcare Bottom Line
The ultimate point of my story is simple : I got the care I needed , when I needed it , and I never paid a single red cent .
Which is good , because I could n’t have afforded to pay .
I was young and had very little money .
The kind of care I received , even back then , would have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in the US .
If I had lived in the US , my parents would have faced a choice between paying for my incredibly expensive treatment , or watching me die .
They were both old , and it would have wiped out their savings entirely and thrown them into bankruptcy , and frankly , I do n’t know how they could have supported themselves .
My life , at that cost , would have had too high a price .
I wonder how many Americans have had to make that calculation .
But I survived , and neither I , nor my parents , was bankrupted .
In similar circumstances I doubt all of those things would be true for an American 25 - year - old trying to survive the same medical condition in America ’s health care industry .
Healthcare Rationing , American - style
I have had two American friends die in the last 5 years who would have survived if they had had fully covered health care .
( Note I did n’t say health insurance , that ’s not what people need .
They need health care . )
One of them died of the flu .
He did n’t seek treatment because of the cost of his insurance co-payment , and he was found dead .
Another had a heart condition , but did n’t know it , because she did n’t have health care , because she could n’t afford it .
If she ’d had health care , she would probably still be alive .
Both of those people are dead because of people like Holmes , and the people behind her .
My two friends are dead because insurance company executives want to keep their obscene salaries , and force Americans to pay more for health care than they should .
So What ’s the Healthcare Reform Fight Really About ?
Billions of dollars are at stake in the battle for American healthcare reform .
That ’s the sort of money executives , and their lobbyists , and their bought - and - paid - for politicians are willing to kill for : to let you , or your friends , or your family suffer and die .
Think of your dead friends and relatives as collateral damage in the fight for health industry profits ; that ’s how the insurance executives see them .
Recall for matrices that a similarity transformation is one that takes a ( square ) matrix A to SAS - 1 , where S is some invertible matrix of the same size as A .
Standard linear algebra courses like to beat into students just how important similarity transformations are , which makes sense from their point of view because linear algebra is really more about studying operators than matrices themselves , and similarity transformations correspond to just a change of basis .
The downside is that many people end up thinking of similarity as the equivalence relation among matrices and hence the Jordan canonical form as the canonical form .
This month ’s Lemma of the Month is about the canonical form under a different equivalence relation : *- congruence .
What is *- Congruence ?
Two square matrices A and B are said to be *- congruent if there is an invertible matrix S such that SAS * = B .
Even though no inverses are present in that equation , invertibility really is required for any nice results to be obtained ( for example , *- congruence would not even define an equivalence relation if S were allowed to be singular ) .
For people who like knowing applications of mathematical tools before knowing the tools themselves , *- congruence has an important role when dealing with quadratic forms .
Also , the inertia of a matrix , which will be defined in the next paragraph , comes into play when looking at sign pattern matrices ( apologies for the lack of a wiki link ; it seems as though sign pattern matrices are at that ugly stage after there are lots of papers written about them but before there is a Wikipedia page written about them ) .
Sylvester ’s Law of Inertia
By far the most well - known result about *- congruence is Sylvester ’s Law of Inertia , which gets its name from the seldom - used inertia of a matrix .
The inertia of a Hermitian matrix A is defined to be the tuple
where n + is the number of positive eigenvalues of A , n 0 is the number of zero eigenvalues of A , and n – is the number of negative eigenvalues of A ( recall that Hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues , so this definition makes sense ) .
Sylvester ’s Law of Inertia is as follows :
Theorem [ 1,2 ] .
Let A , B ∈ M n be Hermitian .
Then A and B are *- congruent if and only if they have the same inertia .
One obvious corollary of this theorem is that every Hermitian matrix A is *- congruent to a diagonal matrix with n + ones , n 0 zeroes , and n – negative ones on the diagonal ; this is the canonical form for Hermitian matrices under *- congruence .
Generalizations of Sylvester ’s Law
If you ’re a linear algebra nerd like me , then you might be thinking to yourself that Sylvester ’s Law of Inertia seems trivial in light of the Spectral Decomposition Theorem ; for any Hermitian A we could find a unitary so that UAU * is real and diagonal , and then we could find a diagonal D such that DUAU * D* is scaled appropriately to satisfy the theorem .
Setting S = DU then shows us that we can always arrive at the canonical form .
Notice , however , that the Spectral Decomposition Theorem applies not only to Hermitian matrices , but to normal matrices as well .
Thus , using the same logic outlined in the previous paragraph , it stands to reason that the canonical form under *- congruence for normal matrices should be a diagonal matrix in which each diagonal entry either has modulus one or zero .
Indeed , this is essentially the content of the following theorem of Ikramov , which was proved in 2001 .
Theorem [ 3 ] .
Let A , B ∈ M n be normal .
Then A and B are *- congruent if and only if they have the same number of eigenvalues on each open ray from the origin in the complex plane .
This theorem truly generalizes Sylvester ’s Law of Inertia ; in the Hermitian case , the only two open rays that eigenvalues can lie on are the positive real line and the negative real line .
What I would like to know , though , is why on Earth this theorem was first proved / published so recently — it seems like such a natural generalization of Sylvester ’s Law of Intertia that it seems like it should be a very old result !
Is it just a hole in the literature that was n’t noticed until recently ?
Anyway , for the really interested reader , there is a generalization of these results to the case when A and B need not even be normal , but it ’s quite technical so I wo n’t present it here .
See [ 4 ] if you ’re curious .
Thanks to Roger Horn for his great series of lectures at the Summer School and Advanced Workshop on Trends and Developments in Linear Algebra , which introduced me to the generalizations of Sylvester ’s Law .

IT ’S NOT clear why Phil Redo thinks we need a plan to keep people from leaving Massachusetts , or why our lagging population growth relative to the nation as a whole is a “ predicament ’’ ( op-ed , Aug. 18 ) .
He goes on to say that population loss per se is not the problem - although how 2.3 percent population growth can be described as population loss is also unclear .
Rather , population “ loss ’ ’ is a symptom of deeper problems , e.g. , housing issues , lack of jobs , anti-business policies , etc. , which we need a plan to solve .
Whether immigration is a problem for Massachusetts depends on who is leaving the state .
If we are losing our young , well - educated , or highly trained people , that would be a cause for concern .
But a shrinking , or slower growing , population is not in and of itself bad .
In a survey conducted several years ago by MassINC , the number one reason cited by people who would leave Massachusetts if they could is the weather .
With the planet heating up and the Southwest doomed to become a vast , waterless desert , all we have to do is bide our time .
Migration patterns will turn around and the Northeast will have a different kind of population problem .

Following the installation of Windows 7 on my desktop machine that was previously running Ubuntu 9.04 , I realized that one of my partitions was missing .
It was formatted as ext3 so of course it would n’t show up in windows .
When I went to boot back into linux the grub boot manager was gone .
The machine just booted straight into windows 7 .
To re-enable grub was a lot simpler than I thought it would be .
Since the Ubuntu 8.04 install disc that I had lying around also works as a live disc I booted my desktop off that .
Once Ubuntu started up I opened up a terminal and typed these commands :
sudo grub root ( hd0,7 ) setup( hd0 ) quit
I then rebooted and grub was back to normal with both my Ubuntu operating system and windows 7 listed .
Note that hd0,7 was the partition where I installed Ubuntu .
If you installed linux before windows then you will probably want to use hd0,0 .
I installed windows 7 over a broken windows xp partition that I had installed before everything else .
If you installed ubuntu before you installed windows then you ’re probably going to have to edit your ‘/ boot / grub / menu.lst ’ file .
The grub documentation may be helpful .
Karl and Dorsey Gude of East Lansing , Mich. , can remember simpler mornings , not too long ago .
They sat together and chatted as they ate breakfast .
They read the newspaper and competed only with the television for the attention of their two teenage sons .
That was so last century .
Today , Mr. Gude wakes at around 6 a.m. to check his work e-mail and his Facebook and Twitter accounts .
The two boys , Cole and Erik , start each morning with text messages , video games and Facebook .
The new routine quickly became a source of conflict in the family , with Ms. Gude complaining that technology was eating into family time .
But ultimately even she partially succumbed , cracking open her laptop after breakfast .
“ Things that I thought were unacceptable a few years ago are now commonplace in my house , ” she said , “ like all four of us starting the day on four computers in four separate rooms . ”
As Barack Obama and members of Congress spend the August recess discussing America 's healthcare system in town hall meetings , Fox News and a group called Conservatives for Patients Rights ( CPR ) are comparing the president 's reform plan - unfavourably - to the British NHS .
Both Fox and CPR have invited UK doctors , politicians and patients to voice their concerns and frustrations on the air .
Take a look and tell us what you think : fair criticisms or overstated hype ?
Here , Fox News presenter Glenn Beck interviews Tory MEP Daniel Hannan , focusing on the wait times for treatment in the UK .
They reported , you decide : Is this Fox News segment a good representation of the NHS ?
British cancer specialist Karol Sikora and UK health policy analyst Roy Lilley are among the experts assembled for the segment .
CPR has been producing ads like this one , referenced in the Fox clip above , that criticise Britain 's NHS .
Kate Spall , Katie Brickell and Angela French further detail their personal experiences with the NHS in this CPR video .
Spall says : " If you have cancer in the UK you are going to die quicker than any other country in Europe . "
Dr Sikora makes another appearance as well .

Les utopies apparaissent bien plus réalisables qu'on ne le croyait autrefois .
Et nous nous trouvons actuellement devant une question bien autrement angoissante : comment éviter leur réalisation définitive ?…
Les utopies sont réalisables .
La vie marche vers les utopies .
Et peut - être un siècle nouveau commence - t - il , un siècle où les intellectuels et la classe cultivée rêveront aux moyens d'éviter les utopies et de retourner à une société non utopique moins ' parfaite ' et plus libre .

Quotations
" There is heavy rain and Kokoda will become the main transport site .
Locals guided the team up and are helping now .
They landed in Kokoda and some walked to the spot .
I can't recall anything thing worse , this could be the worst crash for PNG . "
Mr Kintau said it would be difficult to recover the bodies .
" It 's difficult terrain , it 's a big challenge to fly there , we never pretend it 's not going to be challenging , " he said .
Mr Rudd paid condolences to the families , saying that the Australian high commission had conveyed a report from PNG authorities that there had been no survivors .
The families of the Australians have all been informed .
" This is distressing news for the families concerned , ’’ he told Parliament .
" There is a horrible tragedy involved when families send off their loved ones for what they expect to be the experience of a lifetime , only for it to turn into tragedy like this .
’’
The Opposition Leader , Malcolm Turnbull , also paid condolences to the families .
Struggle to get to crash site Earlier , as darkness fell over the Owen Stanley Range , a team of eight struggled to get through the dense jungle to the crash site .
The rescuers had dropped down ropes from a helicopter in a valley below the mountain ridge where the plane crashed , PNG's Transport Minister Don Polye told journalists in Port Moresby .
" The crash site is about 5000 foot on a mountain and the people have been dropped on the ground below at about lunch time , " he said .
" They have to walk up and it's about six to seven hours walk in the very difficult , rugged terrain .
" The weather is very difficult the terrain is very difficult . ''
Mr Polye said helicopters which flew over the site did not see any sign of life .
" There was no movements , " he said .
But he said it could not be confirmed that the passengers were all dead .
" I convey my deep sympathies to the families , that 's all I can do at this stage , " he said , adding that it was one of PNG 's worst aviation disasters .
He said the bodies would be recovered from the site , taken to Kokoda then to Port Moresby and finally Australia .
He said the bodies would be recovered from the site , taken to Kokoda then to Port Moresby and finally Australia .
He would not speculate on what went wrong .
" I have an ordered an investigation into Airlines PNG and that will be carried out by the department , '' he said .
He would not comment on PNG authorities failing to properly investigate 19 air crashes which have killed 16 people , including three Australians and three New Zealanders since 2000 .
TheCourier - Mail reported that the Twin Otter crashed into an almost sheer cliff minutes from its destination after aborting its first attempt to land .
David Inau , a former air safety investigator who flew over the Owen Stanley Range today , said the plane had hit a tree - covered mountainside and was tangled in the canopy with its wings folded around it .
Mr Inau said the pilot , Jannie Moala , had apparently stopped her first approach five minutes away from the Kokoda Village landing strip but crashed as she tried to go back for a second attempt .
He said Ms Moala appeared to have been looping back to line up for another landing attempt when she hit the cliff face .
The extent of the damage to the plane was such that it was unlikely anyone survived , Mr Inau said .
" It must have gone in hard , " Mr Inau told smh.com.au .
" The plane is at the bottom of a canopy - you ca n’t see from the air if anybody has survived .
" The trees bounced back up after the plane went in , that ’s why you ca n’t see much , ’’ he said .
‘‘ There ’s a couple of villages nearby but it is very rugged terrain . ’’
The lost Twin Otter aircraft was ferrying tourists to the village of Kokoda when it disappeared during bad weather yesterday morning .
In a written statement , Airlines PNG said its plane was found at 8.40 am today at an altitude of 5500 feet ( 1676 metres ) in the Kokoda area .
Seven Victorians and two Queenslanders were among those on board the ill - fated flight .
Seven Victorians and two Queenslanders were among those on board the ill - fated flight .
The Queenslanders were Dr June Canavan , of Maroochydoore , and her close friend Keith Gracie from the Sunshine Coast .
Other Australian members of the group are believed to be Victorian fireman and part - time tour guide Matthew Leonard , 28 , Max Cranwell , Kelly Weir , Max Harris , Euan Comrie and Peter Holliday .
Mr Leonard is the son of WA police inspector Bill Leonard , say police .
Local guide Steven Jaruba of Kokoda was also reportedly on board , as well as a Japanese tourist and two local pilots , Ms Moala and Royden Sauka .
Three separate search parties are their way to the site of the crash near Isurava - the site of a World War II battle - in the Owen Stanley Range , but face a long trek and difficult weather conditions .
The Foreign Affairs Minister Stephen Smith described it as a ‘‘ tragic and terrible ’’ outcome .
The Foreign Affairs Minister Stephen Smith described it as a ‘‘ tragic and terrible ’’ outcome .
No Roads Expeditions , the tour company that organised the flight , issued a statement through managing director Peter Miller saying : " We are hoping and praying that there may still be a positive outcome .
" This is an incredibly difficult time for those affected by this situation and for us , " he said .
" Our guides are like an extended family , and our groups become friends as they travel together , so this has deeply affected us and our travelling community . ''
He said the group was one of about 50 trips No Roads booked to Kokoda each year .
The group was on a scheduled commercial flight , although charters are often used , but otherwise there was nothing unusual about this trip , he said .
Peter Holliday 's wife Shonia , of Bendigo , has booked flights and the Australian Foreign Affairs Department has assisted with organising visas , she told Fairfax Radio .
" We 've got flights booked for tomorrow morning , '' she said .
Her husband was on his way with his cousin to walk the iconic Kokoda Track in a tribute to his veteran grandfather .
" His grandfather fought in World War II in that area , so he and his cousin wanted to go and experience it for themselves , I guess , " she said today .
An emotional Ms Holliday said all the families of the missing adventurers needed positive support .
" We just need everyone [ to ] stop talking negatively , " she said .
" The best thing is to talk positively .
" They are going to come home , they 're going to be fine , there might be a few cuts and bruises but that 's going to be the extent ... " PNG's PM calls for investigation Papua New Guinea 's Prime Minister Michael Somare expressed " great sadness " over the crash and extended his sympathies to the families of the crew and passengers on board .
He called for a full investigation .
" I have requested the ministers of the various responsible authorities to commence investigations into the accident and to furnish a report to cabinet .
" Kokoda holds great historic and sentimental value to the people of Australia and it is with great sadness that we experience such tragedy that took place yesterday , " he said .
Crowd gathers at airport A large crowd of worried Papua New Guineans , fearing their relatives were on board , gathered at Port Moresby airport .
More than 60 PNG porters , who assist Kokoda trekkers along the famous 96 - kilometre walk , have arrived at the airport with the hope their loved ones were not on board the plane .
Kokoda Track veteran Norris Selu said groups from different trekking companies gathered to find out information about the flight .
Loading " We are here to show sympathy and provide moral support .
" All of us are worried someone we know may have been on board .
At this stage we just do n't know and are waiting for more information . "

FOR 30 years , the tradition has been for each newly elected president of the Is lamic Republic to travel at once to Mashad , Iran ’s main “ holy ” city , to thank Ali bin Mussa , the only one of Shiism ’s 12 imams buried in Iranian soil .
When he was first elected president four years ago , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made much of the Mashad trip by spreading rumors about his “ secret ” connections with the imams .
This year , the state - owned media were presented his new pilgrimage as a “ working visit ” during which the imam would review and approve the president - elect ’s program .
But Ahmadinejad was forced at the last minute to scrub the trip .
Angry Mashadis , many of whom believe Ahmadinejad stole the election , were determined to give him a rough reception .
Despite the presence of some 15,000 Basij security men in the city , the authorities could n’t guarantee the president ’s safety — let alone deliver the enthusiastic , welcoming crowds that he requires for propaganda purposes .
The canceled pilgrimage is the latest sign of trouble in the wake of Ahmadinejad ’s controversial re-election .
Last Friday , his visit to Shiraz , Iran ’s cultural capital , was called off on “ security grounds . ”
On Monday , the Foreign Ministry canceled what was to be the first - ever visit by an Iranian leader to Libya .
Planned a year in advance , that trip was to feature Ahmadinejad signing a “ treaty of friendship and cooperation ” with the African Union and addressing a summit of African leaders .
( Yesterday , it was announced that the visit would happen , somewhat shortened — but then it was called off again . )
On Tuesday , it was announced that yet another of Ahmadinejad ’s “ historic visits ” was off — he will not travel to Sharm - el - Sheik in Egypt to address the summit of the nonaligned movement after all .
Since 2007 , Ahmadinejad has campaigned to lead the “ nonaligned ” group and to host its next summit in Tehran in 2012 .
His “ brother , ” Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , has visited a dozen capitals to win support for the Iranian bid — efforts now clearly all in vain .
Wounded politically at home , perhaps mortally , Ahmadinejad is in no position to claim an international leadership position .
Another long - planned trip , visits with six leftist leaders in their Latin American capitals , already postponed once because of the election imbroglio , was definitively back - burnered yesterday .
With his re-election approved by the Council of the Guardians of the Constitution , Ahmadinejad may be out of immediate danger .
But he ’s a diminished figure even if he manages to hang on .
Four years ago , he won as a populist candidate who owed no debt of gratitude to “ Supreme Guide ” Ali Khamenei ( who had tacitly endorsed another candidate ) .
His prestige was further enhanced when , in a second round of voting , he crushed former President Hashemi Rafsanjani , a grandee of the Khomeinist nomenklatura .
Ahmadinejad could claim that he was his own man , relying on no establishment cabals .
The June 12 election changed all that .
Whatever the truth of allegations about massive fraud , the fact is that many Iranians , perhaps a majority , believe that Ahmadinejad did n’t win .
To many , his re-election seems merely the result of plotting by a power clique centered on Khamenei .
“ Ahmadinejad is president not because people voted for him , but because Khamenei says so , ” notes Tehran analyst Saeed Hajjarian .
Worse still , the authorities have had to deploy tens of thousands of security agents , kill dozens of protestors and imprison more than 4,000 dissidents to prevent Ahmadinejad ’s victory from being challenged by millions of protest marchers every day .
He governs thanks to the say - so of the “ supreme guide ” and the batons and bayonets of the security agents — not what populist Ahmadinejad had hoped .
His legitimacy is challenged at all levels of Iranian society , including every segment of the Khomeinist establishment .
He has to invoke Khamenei ’s authority in support of every move he makes .
He is the first Islamic Republic president to have split the Khomeinist camp so deeply , and perhaps permanently .
With the presidency ’s loss of legitimacy , the “ republic ” part of the “ Islamic Republic ” may have gone forever .
The emerging system could be called an “ imamate , ” with the “ supreme guide , ” who now calls himself “ the living imam , ” running the show .
In that case , the re-elected president no longer needs to go to Mashad to communicate with an imam who died 1,200 years ago .
Amir Taheri ’s new book is “ The Persian Night : Iran Under the Khomeinist Revolution . ”
GameStop is an amazingly profitable company , and those profits are due largely to the margins the company enjoys on used game sales .
When GameStop gives you $ 15 to $ 20 for a game that has been out a mere week , then sells the same game for $ 45 , they 're making money that no retailer selling new games can match ; new games have a very thin profit margin for retailers .
Which is why it is surprising to see Best Buy make its new game prices competitive with GameStop 's used game prices .
In West Jordan , Utah , an eagle - eye Cheapassgamer reader snapped a picture of a sign at a local Best Buy .
It said that Best Buy would price - match any used game from GameStop or GameCrazy with a new copy .
So instead of going to GameStop for a $ 45 used game that has been opened — and of course , used — you can go to Best Buy and pay the same price for a brand - new , sealed copy .
All evidence is pointing to this promotion being a small test run in a very few locations , but it did n't take long for GameStop to fire back .
GameStop has the margins to make this fight ugly
Soon after the Best Buy story hit the Internet , Kotaku was given a copy of a flier from GameStop that showed some amazing price cuts on a wide selection of used games .
Do n't be confused if you have n't seen this sale at your local store ; it seems to be localized around ... wait for it ...
West Jordan , Utah .
The games on sale are newer titles , with an additional $ 10 or $ 15 knocked off GameStop 's normal prices for used games .
It does n't take a cynic to realize that Game Stop is hoping customers flood Best Buy locations with the flier , demanding price - matched new copies of these games .
And if gamers go into GameStop locations to take advantage of the sale , the company still wins ; the margins on GameStop 's used games are so high that it can afford to run this sale and turn a profit , while forcing Best Buy to lose money on each game it sells at these prices .
The thought process going on at both companies has been opaque when it comes to the competing promotions — we contacted both Best Buy and GameStop and have yet to hear a comment from either — but the economics of the situation are clear .
GameStop can fight the good fight on used game pricing and still come out the victor , because new games purchased from distributors , even with the scale of large retailers , leave only a few dollars of profit when the game is sold .
GameStop does n't have to buy its games from a distributor ; the retailer has a huge base of loyal customers who are more than happy to turn over games for low trade - in amounts , giving GameStop a margin that can be as high as $ 30 .
Best Buy has to be wondering if the buzz is worth selling games below cost .
Will this skirmish turn into a war ?
It 's doubtful , since both companies are fighting in such a way that their bottom lines are compromised .
Best Buy may not be ready to turn its entire new game inventory into a loss - leader , and GameStop loves its high - margin used games .
The gaming retailer is likely hoping that its counter - attack will make Best Buy skittish about trying this tactic in other markets , and there may be room to dump used prices further in case the message was n't strong enough .
Once Best Buy kills its promotion , GameStop kills its sale .
It 's a cat and mouse game between two giants in the gaming world , with only one clear winner : gamers looking for a bargain in West Jordan , Utah .

So , it turns out me and everyone I know have opened a Banana the wrong way our entire lives .
I have always thought that banana ’s could only be opened that one way and always been rejecting any other way of doing it .
If you live you learn and this me included .
When I watched this for the first time I thought to myself that this guy has to be joking .
What ’s the joke in the whole clip … but how wrong I was .
It actually turned out to be a much more efficient way of pealing the banana to get to the actual fruit .
Watch carefully , you are about to have a live altering experience .
You will forever be transformed into a better person opening a banana without getting pissed that you have to dig your finger in to the stem in order to be able to peal it .
Or are you just pissed that you did n’t think about this yourself ?
LOL
How to Open a Banana – Monkey Style
Comics titan Alan Moore once called his Watchmen series " unfilmable . "
But , with Zack Snyder 's three - hour - plus director 's cut hitting store shelves Tuesday and Watchmen 's international box office slugging its way past $ 180 million , that claim has surely been laid to rest .
So , which revered books and comics are next up for the film treatment ?
Try these five geek sacred texts on for size , then add your own " unfilmable " submissions below .
Writer : Neil Gaiman
Lame excuse : Too long .
Spanning 74 issues and more than a decade , if you count spinoffs and standalones , Neil Gaiman 's decorated mythopoetic fantasy starring Dream , Death and other revered , abstract personifications is stuck in film limbo .
" There is talk of an HBO Sandman , " Gaiman told Wired.com in March , " because no one quite knows what to do with it .
But the truth is , if anybody is going to make [ it ] a movie , it will probably be a kid in film school right now to whom The Sandman was the most important thing ever .
It will take the amount of commitment , dedication and madness that Peter Jackson brought to Lord of the Rings to get it on the screen .
Honestly , it could happen after I am dead . "
But we doubt it .
After the runaway success of Coraline , Gaiman 's stop-motion stunner with director Henry Selick , the writer 's fabled franchise is overdue for cinematic adaptation .
The biggest hurdle ?
Where to start .
" It ’s not film - shaped , " Gaiman said .
" I went out to Hollywood with beautiful artwork and toys and did a presentation ....
I got to the end , very proud of myself for encapsulating 2,000 pages of comics into a giant visual pitch , and what I got was , ' Does The Sandman have a clearly defined bad guy ? '
I said , ' No it does n’t , ' and they said , ' Thanks for coming ! ' "
Chance in hell ?
Slight .
Gaiman 's not holding his breath .
Why would you ?
Frank Miller 's The Dark Knight Returns features an aging Batman reborn by rage .
Image courtesy DC Comics
Writer : Frank Miller
Lame excuse : Batman 's too old .
Quick , what helped Christopher Nolan 's The Dark Knight rake in more than $ 1 billion worldwide ?
Tech noir , and an untimely death .
That pretty much encapsulates Miller 's milestone comic , which catches up with an aging Batman nearly trampled underfoot by a strange new technoculture of media overload , gang warfare , geopolitical intrigue and a compromised Superman .
Not that fans , including Gaiman , could resist dreamcasting the possibility .
Once Miller 's comic exploded into pop culture , Gaiman explains , " there was all this talk about whether Clint Eastwood could do it .
If they actually made The Dark Knight Returns with Clint , I would have gritted my teeth and seen it .
It probably would have been awesome . "
An elderly Batman is only the appetizer .
In The Dark Knight Returns , villainous geriatrics like Joker and Two - Face either die or succumb to failure .
The death of Heath Ledger , the actor who played Joker in The Dark Knight , no doubt garishly contributed to the blockbuster 's allure , but re-creating the haunting suicide of Batman 's nemesis onscreen is another matter entirely .
As is the matter of Superman killing Batman , come to think of it , or the entry of yet another Robin , this time a tomboy who haunts the Caped Crusader 's steps .
But if the success of Nolan 's Dark Knight proved anything , it 's that fandom wants Batman 's younger model to stick around for awhile .
Leaping from his early years to his last in Miller 's Dark Knight Returns might not be the smartest cinematic move to make .
But hey , a past - it Bruce Wayne made the underrated animated series Batman Beyond a show worth watching .
Done right , bringing Miller 's graphic novel to the big screen would be a brave , and lucrative , move .
Chance in hell ?
Definitely .
Come back next decade .
Bring your wallet .
Grant Morrison's
The Invisibles may be too taboo for the big screen .
Image courtesy DC Comics
Writer : Grant Morrison
Lame excuse : Too taboo .
Like Gaiman's
The Sandman , Grant Morrison 's hyper- allusive , brain - bending mega- narrative about a band of subcultural superagents is a serious yarn , albeit slightly shorter .
It has inspired The Matrix ( and more ) , borrowed from The Prisoner ( and much more ) and rubbed readers not hip to Morrison 's merry pranksterism the wrong way ( a lot ) .
It was routinely censored , with offended parties simply blacked out of the comic in some cases .
A sequence involving the Marquis De Sade was inflammatory , leading to questions of child abuse in comics , and bad - mouthing of Walt Disney was summarily redacted .
And that 's just the start of The Invisibles ' gleeful transgressions .
Plus , the comic boasts a band of anarchist outsiders often mistaken for terrorists .
From Morrison 's bald - headed avatar King Mob and his time - traveling girlfriend Ragged Robin to the transgender Lord Fanny , hedonistic Jack Frost and the ex-NYPD female cop named Boy , The Invisibles are n't exactly the Justice League .
But that 's what makes Morrison one of comic 's enduring greats :
His resistant texts are meant to be challenging , to make you think of comics in entirely new ways .
Whoever translates his biggest middle - finger to the big screen will be in for a seriously bumpy ride .
Chance in hell ?
Probably not on the big screen .
But a kick - ass television series would not be out of the question .
BBC Scotland reportedly finished two out of six scripts , before rethinking .
It will happen .
Thomas Pynchon 's timeless tome Gravity 's Rainbow of post - war paranoia and conspiracy won the National Book Award in 1974 .
Image courtesy Penguin Classics
Writer : Thomas Pynchon
Lame excuse : Too inaccessible .
Cinema in the 21st century has so far made its name adapting seminal comics , but the 20th century was spent on great novels .
From The Bible to the Mahabarata , from Shakespeare to Naked Lunch , literature has pretty much had its day .
But what of this cryptic , challenging tome from literature 's last superstar ?
Gravity 's Rainbow is packed with paranoia , rocketry and post - World War II occultism , and barely clocks in under a thousand pages .
Plus , it is written by a reclusive genius with a gift for brain - teasing gab and a tendency to avoid the press like the plague .
How does that translate into a popcorn blockbuster ?
It does n't .
Chance in hell ?
Next to none .
Think The Invisibles , plus Naked Lunch , stir in some Watchmen and you 're there .
Neuromancer
Writer : William Gibson
Lame excuse : Too legendary .
If Gravity 's Rainbow is the last literary titan standing , then William Gibson 's world - beating Neuromancer is the first sci- fi colossus to beat when it comes to the cinema crossover .
A mash of punk , technology , noir and metaphysics , it one - upped Pynchon 's challenging masterpiece by being both accessible and mind - blowing , ushering in the 21st century before its time .
With a hacker antihero in Case , and a supporting cast made up of unhinged cyborgs and desperate gangsters , Gibson 's award - winning page - turner rebooted not just speculative fiction , but sci - fi cinema as we know it .
He 's even rebooted himself :
His not - great 1995 adaptation of Johnny Mnemonic , starring a clumsy Keanu Reeves , was upgraded into a mirrored money - machine called The Matrix .
And yeah , that ended clumsily as well , but it all points out the obvious .
William Gibson is due .
He 's so due .
William Gibson 's seminal Neuromancer is in development ( again ) .
Image courtesy Seven Arts Pictures
We need to live in a century where William Gibson helps turn Neuromancer into a better film than the three made by two Wachowski brothers hypnotized by the meatspace merge .
That century is now , actually : Neuromancer has been on Seven Arts Pictures ' front burner for around a year now , and looks set to roll with Torque director Joseph Kahn in the hot seat .
Wait , a young hotshot commercial and video director taking on a culturally important monster narrative ?
Where have we heard this before ?
So it's with pride that Wired.com , which probably would n't exist without William Gibson 's technocultural contributions , throws its money down on Neuromancer , an easy bet given the chatter .
We 'll try and corner the press - shy Seven Arts Pictures to back up that bet , and report what we learn .
But of all the candidates on this list , it seems Gibson 's classic is on the fast track to make history and move units .
Chance in hell ?
Oh yeah .
Turn on , jack in , good luck .

Best Buy has signed on to sponsor Brammo's electric motorcycle racing team in a deal that could see the consumer electronics retailer sell battery - powered motorcycles alongside laptops and DVD players .
Beyond providing the Oregon motorcycle manufacturer with an outlet for its Enertia street bike , the arrangement gives Brammo the financial support and technical assistance to compete in next month 's zero-emission TTxGP motorcycle grand prix .
Brammo is one of 18 teams bringing 23 bikes to the Isle of Man for the June 12 race around one of the most storied courses in motorcycling .
" It 's a great way to show what the future of our product is and to test the technology that will end up in consumers ' hands , " company CEO Craig Bramscher told Wired.com in an exclusive interview .
Best Buy is no stranger to the track , as it already sponsors a NASCAR team .
Working with Brammo " is a natural extension of our Best Buy Racing initiatives , " Paul Zindrick , senior manager of event marketing , said in a statement .
The company is " thrilled to be part of such an innovative racing endeavor . "
The team goes by the unwieldy name of Team Brammo Enertia Best Buy Racing , and it has assembled two very sweet motorcycles .
Bramscher says he did n't want to build a wild one - off suitable only for the track , so Brammo started with the stock Enertia street bike the company began selling for $ 12,000 last year .
" We could have started from scratch and thrown a whole lot of money at the project , " he said .
" But rather than go all out , we wanted to show the heritage of the Enertia and show where it is headed . "
The Enertia TTR features the same extruded aluminum frame found on the street bike , but the front end was reworked for more responsive handling .
Sapa , an aluminum extruder based in Portland , Ore. , built the frame , which houses an 8.1 kilowatt - hour lithium polymer battery packs significantly more power than the street bike 's 3.1 kWh unit , and the technology could trickle down to the street bike soon .
Bramscher could n't say how much range the battery provides .
" Hopefully 37 - 1/2 miles , " he said with a laugh .
That 's the length of the course .
" Having enough gasoline on a motorcycle has never been a challenge .
Having enough battery on a motorcycle will be a challenge . "
The battery powers a permanent magnet AC synchronous brushless motor .
Bramscher says the bike tops out at 90 mph .
That 's significantly slower than the Mission One and other bikes on the grid , but Bramscher is n't worried .
The course has more hairpins than a beauty salon , so supreme handling is more important than sheer speed .
" Our goal is to be the best handling bike and the one that goes through the curves the fastest so we 've got the highest average speed , " he said .
Handling is the name of the game , then , and Brammo dealt the TTR an excellent hand .
The fork is custom - made with Traxxion Dynamics internals and an Ohlins steering stabilizer .
The rear shock is from Elka .
Forged magnesium Marchenisi wheels wear Dunlop rubber stopped by radially mounted Brembo brakes .
It 's all top - shelf stuff , wrapped in carbon fiber bodywork on a bike that weighs 360 pounds .
That 's 12 pounds less than the amazing Ducati 1198 S .
" At the end of the day , when the rider gets off the bike , I want him to say , ' That was a complete blast , ' " Bramscher said .
The riders are Roy Richardson , a third - generation racer who 's competed in the Isle of Man TT several times .
He 's joined by verteran racer and journalist Mark Buckley .
So why team up with an electronics retailer ?
Because when you strip away the Enertia 's bodywork and take off the wheels , you 're left with a bunch of black boxes , a bunch of cable and a battery .
In other words , a pile of electronics managed by sophisticated software .
" It does n't look much like a motorcycle , " Bramscher said of the bike 's drivetrain .
" It looks like a big server .
That was our first inclination that maybe what we 're doing is selling consumer electronics that you ride .
Coming at it from that direction opens a lot of possibilities . "
Brammo started discussing those possibilities with Best Buy , which invested in the company and expressed an interest in distributing the bikes .
" We can't go into too much detail , but they will be testing on the West Coast in June , " Bramscher said .
" They 've committed to testing the bike in stores , and we 're exploring distribution . "
He suggested the retailers Geek Squad of technicians could be used to provide customer service and support for the Enertia bikes .
" You can draw your own conclusions on what the Geek Squad could do when they have people in - store and outbound who service electronics , " he said .
Brammo has no plans to sell the TTR to consumers , but Bramscher says the bike " has provided a lot of R&D " that will appear on the company 's next two bikes .
" We 'll be announcing two new models within the next six months , and they 'll will incorporate some of the technology we 've developed for the race bikes , " he said .
" We 'll have one bike below the Enertia in terms of price and another akin to the race bike but more appropriate to the street . "

Date # 3 is a pretty big milestone for us as men because we know it ’s when most females feel that they can spread eagle on a guy ’s twin bed without feeling like a whore .
After an exciting make out session you begin to sneak below for the old ‘ lick n’ stick ’ .
Â
It is here that you are hit with a combination of armpit and dirty diaper .
Â
The kind of aroma that would stop a charging bison in it ’s tracks .
What should you do ?
Â
On your first time together you will need to power through the experience without saying a word .
Â
Tell yourself that it was a hot day and your junk probably does n’t smell much better .
However , we ’re going to focus on what you need to do if this becomes a recurring issue .
Â
Remember , there is no safe zone when it comes to offering a female advice on her appearance or hygiene .
Â
Dropping hints will be your safest option .
Combined Shower – Before things get too steamy , let her know that you want to take a shower with her .
Â
Seriously , if you stick to your guns and suggest a shower every single time , she ’ll start to wonder if something is wrong with her .
Refusing Service – Refusal of service or simply staying away from the area says a few things :
I do n’t like chowing on box
I do n’t like chowing on YOUR box
If your girlfriend has an IQ over 90 she ’ll use the process of elimination to pin point the problem .
Gag noises –
This can be the most difficult to pull off because it involves a shit load of good acting and passive aggression .
What you ’ll want to do is start making awful noises with your throat , kind of like you just took a bite out of a shit sandwich .
Â
Then as you come back up , say something like “ it ’s not you it ’s me . ”
Â
Once you toss that line out there , she ’ll know something is up .
Confrontation –
You like your girlfriend and you ’d hate to throw it all away because of some odor .
Â
You know you ca n’t live like this though .
Â
Remember , always use confrontation as a last resort .
Â
We ’ve outlined a right way and wrong of going about this .
Right Way : Honey , I was wondering if you noticed a peculiar smell coming from your vagina ?
Â
Is there anything I can do to help ?
Wrong Way : Babe , you realize your vag smells like a Taco Bell dumpster right ?
Â
I mean , I ’ll still hit it but my face wo n’t go anywhere near that axe wound , lol .
Conclusion : Being in a situation like this is never pleasant .
Â
We ’d like to suggest a screening process before you get to the point of no return .
Â
Sort of like you test drive a car before you buy it .
Â
We ’ll call it the “ first date scratch n’ sniff . ”
Â
From here you should be able to size up the situation and make a decision on whether or not this is a road you ’d like to go down .

Written by Denny Gibbons
( Fortune Magazine ) -- On Oct. 1 , 2008 , BlackRock 's CEO , Larry Fink , was sitting in his glass - framed Manhattan office when CNBC reported that Warren Buffett was buying a big stake in General Electric .
Black Rock 's nearby trading floor erupted with excitement .
The experts and the pundits on the tube viewed the Buffett news as a sign that the markets were stabilizing .
Fink did n't see it this way and shared his gut reaction with an associate .
" This is n't about a sweet , clever grandfather from Omaha making a nice deal !
It means GE can't roll over its commercial paper , and corporate America can't fund itself ! "
As the TV buzzed with happy talk , Fink predicted a new round of fear , panic , and collapsing asset prices , loudly concluding , " This is a disaster ! "
It is precisely this type of contrarian , worst - case - scenario thinking that has propelled BlackRock ( BLK , Fortune 500 ) over the past 21 years from an eight - partner bond shop to the best - performing financial services company of its generation .
Since BlackRock made its debut on the NYSE in late 1999 , its shares have jumped 14 - fold , from $ 14 to $ 198 , creating more than $ 25 billion in market value .
By contrast , Goldman Sachs 's just about tripled during the same period .
BlackRock is now by far the biggest , fastest - growing asset manager in the world .
When BlackRock completes its $ 13.5 billion acquisition of Barclays Global Investors ( known on the Street as BGI ) later this year , it will more than double its assets under management , to $ 3.1 trillion -- yup , trillion .
That 's twice as big as its nearest rivals , State Street ( STT , Fortune 500 ) and Fidelity .
BlackRock is also a totally new creation in the world of asset management , a one - stop shop offering a smorgasbord of products to both institutional and retail investors .
Unlike banks or brokerages , it does nothing but manage money , and it is the largest provider of fixed - income funds .
No wonder Cisco ( CSCO , Fortune 500 ) , FedEx ( FDX , Fortune 500 ) , and the public school teachers of California trust the firm to help invest their retirement savings .
But as the Book of Luke says , " To whom men commit much , of him they will demand the more . "
And therein lie the challenges for BlackRock : Can a former bond boutique manage trillions of dollars ?
What are the thought processes that drive its investment decisions ?
Can BlackRock deliver consistent returns in an industry where turnover is frequent and talented money managers do n't always play nicely with one another ?
Answers to these and other mysteries are just some of the secrets that Fortune sought to unlock by spending a month talking with BlackRock executives about how it has flourished during some of the most nightmarish moments in high finance , including 1998 's Long - Term Capital Management debacle , 2000 's tech crash , and 2008 's credit crisis .
What follows are four strategies for managing a company and gauging the markets that have driven BlackRock to No. 50 on the Fastest - Growing Companies list .
LESSON 1 : Make a big business feel like a small company
To understand BlackRock 's corporate culture , you need to understand the interplay of Fink and the firm 's president , Rob Kapito , who have worked as a team for more than 20 years , and have two very different styles of leadership .
The son of a shoe store owner , Fink is a workaholic who arrives at the office at 5:45 a.m .
He spends most of his time on the big picture , talking to important clients , plotting acquisitions , and counseling the Washington regulators who have become a crucial source of business .
In his spare time he likes to live well .
His brother Steve , a Silicon Valley entrepreneur , describes Larry 's property in rustic North Salem north of Manhattan as " Disneyland on a farm . "
It boasts an indoor riding ring and an 18th - century manor house containing one of the greatest collections of American folk art .
Kapito , 52 , is as quiet and precise as Fink , 56 , is gregarious and opinionated .
Kapito runs the day - to - day operations -- everything from personnel to accounting .
He is also the guardian of BlackRock 's corporate culture , doing a lot of little things to keep BlackRock feeling familial .
One manager found Kapito sitting in her hospital room when she awakened after cancer surgery .
In July 2008 , Kapito wanted to do something special for the London gold and natural - resources team when their funds reached a milestone of $ 50 billion .
So he flew to London , rented a house , and personally cooked a lamb - chop - and - salmon dinner for the troops , whom he enlisted as sous - chefs with toques inscribed with their names .
Another hallmark of the BlackRock ethos is the daily morning meeting , held at 8 a.m. around a gigantic oval table in a fourth - floor Manhattan conference room .
" It 's mandatory , like church when you 're a kid , " says co-chief operating officer Charlie Hallac , who each morning takes the 6:03 a.m. train from his home in Scarsdale , N.Y. , with a bunch of BlackRock managers .
More than a dozen offices from around the world -- London , Tokyo , Hong Kong , to name a few -- attend via audio- or videoconferencing .
Some satellite offices appear in boxes on a giant screen .
It 's sort of Hollywood Squares meets high finance .
Around the table , managers with nameplates reading " U.S. rates " or " Securitized assets " give pointed , usually one - minute presentations ending with " That 's it ! "
One morning in July the round of presentations jumped from a description of potash pricing in Britain , to the chances of the government 's nationalizing Fannie Mae , to an update on CIT 's efforts to raise capital .
When participants talk too long , Kapito chides them to keep their presentations brief and pithy .
Aside from Kapito and Hallac , key leaders include COO Sue Wagner and Ben Golub , a Ph.D. from MIT , who is the overlord of Black Rock 's risk - management system .
These managers devote a lot of attention to employees , who are encouraged to spend their entire careers at the firm -- in fact , the turnover rate is a mere 11 % , a figure unheard - of on Wall Street .
Fink prizes loyalty in his people and his partners .
He steams when he does n't get it .
A case in point would be his reaction in the summer of 2008 when he learned that Merrill Lynch , which then owned a 49 % stake in BlackRock and needed to raise capital , was considering selling that stake .
According to close friends of Fink , he called Merrill CEO John Thain and exploded : " Why the [ expletive ] did I read about this in the paper ?
Why did n't you tell me to my face ? "
LESSON 2 : When investments get complex , do your homework
The simplest explanation of how BlackRock 's strategy differs from that of other bond experts like Pimco : BlackRock does not invest by forecasting which way interest rates are headed .
Instead BlackRock wonkishly focuses on the other factors that drive bond values : prepayments and default risk .
As a result , BlackRock was better equipped to analyze the complex mortgage securities that came to dominate the fixed - income markets and that caused so much havoc last year .
BlackRock 's approach works like this :
Say mortgage bonds are selling at a big discount because rates recently rose .
Black Rock 's models are expert at judging if those bonds are " rich " or " cheap " based on its technology for predicting prepayment trends and defaults .
If the model predicts , for example , that prepayments will be higher than most investors expect , BlackRock can garner extra returns because homeowners will pay off their loans at full value , and the fund can reinvest the proceeds at higher rates .
The firm 's analytical modeling gets so granular that BlackRock found that people living near IBM offices prepay frequently because IBM executives are often dispatched to new cities .
" The BlackRock team is one of the few that can break down those products and assess their true risks , " says Michael Rosen of Angeles Investment Advisors , a firm that counsels pension funds and other institutions on choosing money managers .
BlackRock executives are constantly refining their models to stay one step ahead of the latest funky financial product from Wall Street 's wizards .
" The firms that design securitized products are always conspiring against us with new , increasingly complex instruments , " says Rob Goldstein , who oversees BlackRock Solutions , which leases an ultrasophisticated technology platform to clients and has a team that helps companies analyze and run their portfolios .
" It 's our mission to make sure they do n't win . "
On behalf of the Federal Reserve , BlackRock Solutions is managing troubled assets from AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) and Bear Stearns .
Even with all this quantitative firepower , the company does not always get it right : BlackRock spotted the bubble in subprime , but it misjudged the commercial mortgage - backed securities market .
In late 2006 the company developed a model that put a lower , more realistic number on the incomes subprime borrowers were claiming on their " no doc " loans .
The projections were shocking : BlackRock figured that when the loans reset to their new , higher rates in a couple of years , most borrowers would be spending more than half their real incomes on mortgage payments .
Foreseeing an avalanche of defaults , BlackRock dumped subprime bonds in early 2007 when the prices were still lofty .
Nevertheless , even the best models can fail when markets go haywire , and that explains how BlackRock simply misread the commercial real estate market .
As subprime bond prices plunged in late 2007 and early 2008 , the value of real estate securities that BlackRock deemed far more solid dropped as well .
By the spring of last year , the interest - rate spreads between Treasuries and commercial mortgage - backed securities ( CMBS ) -- loans secured by office buildings and shopping centers -- ballooned from 2.5 to 10 percentage points .
BlackRock thought the bonds were a great buy , since the buildings were often fully leased , their AAA tranches had first claim on payments , and the mortgages frequently dated from 2004 or 2005 , before lending got wildly excessive .
BlackRock placed the bonds in dozens of its funds , often substituting them for Treasuries or corporates , reckoning that they were safe and would produce superior returns .
But by late 2008 the prices of CMBS cratered again , this time sending spreads to an incredible 16 points .
It was n't that the bonds were unsound , at least over the long term .
The problem was that highly leveraged hedge funds , REITs , investment banks , and other investors that depended on short - term financing could n't roll over their commercial paper and other loans , so they were dumping whatever they could sell , including CMBS .
Because of the drag from CMBS , Black Rock 's returns were so weak that two - thirds of its bond funds languished in the bottom half of their categories for 2008 .
The apocalypse Fink predicted as he watched the Buffett announcement on CNBC had trampled even Black Rock 's vaunted risk models .
" It was a year where the unpredictable turned into the unimaginable , " says Fink .
This year the bonds have rebounded strongly , providing a major boost to the company 's performance in fixed income .
For 2009 , BlackRock 's 124 bond funds have delivered average returns of almost 20 % .
Nearly two - thirds rate in the top half of their categories .
BlackRock still has n't caught the benchmarks for the past 18 months , but the gap is narrowing dramatically .
For BlackRock the lesson of 2008 is that " market risk can hurt you , but liquidity risk can kill you , " says Goldstein .
In other words , BlackRock was prepared to cope with the normal ebb and flow of the market , but not a panic where no one wants to own anything but Treasuries .
As a result , BlackRock has now recalibrated its models to predict scenarios where buyers disappear .
To do so , it 's tracking the leverage of financial players as never before -- the more leveraged the system , the bigger the chance for another chaotic selloff .
It 's also advising college endowments and other clients to reduce their exposure to illiquid private - equity investments and hold far more in easy - to - sell bonds or even hedge fund stakes .
LESSON 3 : Acquire to grow , not to cut
BlackRock does not make acquisitions where the main goal is to pare costs by eliminating people and combining similar products .
" We 've seen in many mergers , both in asset management and banking , that bloodletting does n't work , " says Fink .
Instead ,
Fink prefers to go after firms that add to BlackRock 's roster of products and extend its footprint into new international markets .
Nor does
Fink want to sell BlackRock to a major bank , in part because he believes that if he did so , other banks would be reluctant to sell Black Rock 's products .
An illustration of Fink 's credo in action was BlackRock 's 2006 acquisition of Merrill 's asset - management arm , known back then as Merrill Lynch Investment Managers .
Accounting for only 7 % of Merrill 's profits , MLIM was something of an orphan .
The group had built an excellent family of mutual funds , but they were shunned by other brokerages and banks precisely because they bore the Merrill moniker .
" Even the Merrill financial advisers were reluctant to sell our funds , because clients would think they favored the hometown product , " says Frank Porcelli , who joined BlackRock from Merrill and now heads the U.S. retail business .
MLIM executives became so frustrated that they planned on dumping the name and rebranding as Princeton Portfolio Research .
In the Merrill deal , BlackRock followed its classic template :
It acquired a business with complementary financial products , stamped its brand on them , and then inducted the conquered people into its culture .
One way that Fink does this is by avoiding the toxic power - sharing arrangements that are common in Wall Street mergers , where the head of the division from the acquired company is given a seat alongside the person who runs the same division at the acquiring company .
No co-heads , no infighting .
Fink wanted to keep MLIM 's talented money managers , so he elevated Bob Doll , a Merrill veteran , to head equities over the BlackRock candidate .
All told , BlackRock kept around 2,400 of MLIM 's 2,500 employees ( BlackRock will have 9,000 employees after the BGI merger ) , and the deal is a proven winner : Under the BlackRock banner , the former MLIM funds now sell briskly at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney , UBS , Wachovia , and of course Merrill .
BlackRock 's independence and lack of its own brokerage business helped it beat out Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) and Vanguard for the soon - to - close BGI deal .
iShares , which is the world 's largest family of ETFs , are sold through brokers , and Barclays president Bob Diamond feared that as the bank grew bigger in the securities business , rivals would shun his trophy product .
The opportunity to own a 19.9 % stake in BlackRock also proved extremely alluring .
The deal 's announcement this summer had its comic side .
Diamond flew in from London for an interview on Bloomberg TV .
When he was dropped off at Bloomberg headquarters in the pouring rain , he discovered that the interview was to be held at the BlackRock building , and that with nothing but British pounds in his pocket , he could n't pay for a taxi .
So Diamond grabbed a young Bloomberg reporter , dragged him into a cab , and got the young man to pay for his ride to BlackRock , where he bummed the bucks to pay him back .
" I practically scared the journalist to death , " jokes Diamond .
LESSON 4 : Know where your business is heading
With his trader 's gut , Fink is betting that last year marked a paradigm shift in the ways institutions invest their money .
He calls it the " new conservatism . "
In recent years , pension funds and endowments rushed to diversify into alternative assets like private equity and timberland , which turned out to be highly illiquid when the credit crunch hit .
To meet their obligations , those investors were forced to sell their best , most liquid assets at distressed prices .
Now , he predicts they will move to a " barbell " strategy :
They will place the bulk of their portfolios in plain - vanilla bonds and indexed equity funds .
That tranche will form the low - risk , conservatively - managed end of the barbell .
To boost returns , they will stick the rest with a select group of equity managers with sharply - focused strategies and a history of high returns , as well as hedge funds with easy - to - trade financial assets .
Private equity investments with their long lockups and illiquid holdings will fall out of favor .
" We 're in a period where liquidity will be far more important , " says Fink .
So the next time disaster strikes and Buffett is snatching bargains from the flames , Fink -- ��� �and investors with trillions looking to BlackRock to model the unimaginable -- ��� �will be prepared .

From the ' Hackers for Charity ' files :
LAS VEGAS .
For many , the term ' Hacker ' is something to be feared .
But after sitting through Johnny ' I hack stuff '
Long 's Black
Hat session titled , " From Me to We ' - the definition of hacker needs to be redefined .
Long told the capacity crowd that he quit his job and moved to the African nation of Uganda in order to support an effort known as Hackers for Charity .
He 's currently living on donations , from fellow hackers .
In his talk , Long detailed his rise to fame as one of he most prominent hackers on Earth thanks to his book , " Google Hacking . "
Yet even with all his fame , he was n't happy he want to do something useful and make a difference and that 's what he 's doing now - helping the under - privileged in Africa to live better ( and more connected ) lives .
Long noted that his skills as a hacker were developed in part by his participation in the hacker community .
" I did n't have a single o- day to may name , I did n't invent anything but I ended up with a dozen book projects , " Long said .
Long book 's are part of his charity effort .
Long 's book ' No Tech Hacking ' which he packaged as part of his 2007 Black Hat session had all of its net proceeds going to charity .
Beyond just living in Africa , he has successfully solicited the help of the hacker community , with fellow hackers donated money , time and skills .
There is also an effort called the informer project , where hackers give paying / donating member pre-releases of stuff .
" There is darkness in our community there is evil here , but that 's the minority , " Long said .
" The majority of us are just curious .
But the work hacker is applied and that 's a word for criminal . "
Long is no criminal in my view , he 's a missionary and that 's his message now too .
" The message is to get involved in something bigger than yourself , make a difference , " Long said .
SHIAO LIN , Taiwan ( CNN ) --
From the side of the road leading to the former village of Shiao Lin , a woman cried as she viewed the flattened plain of mud where homes once stood .
A 4 - year - old boy , left , holds his mother 's hand at a rescue center in southern Taiwan on Friday .

" All of my relatives -- including my older brother -- are gone , " cried Luo Yong Ling .
" Only my brother 's son is alive .
More than 10 of my relatives and just one left . "
Local authorities estimate scores of people were buried when a massive mudslide caused by Typhoon Morakot covered the village .
As many as 200 people from Shiao Lin could be trapped under five stories of mud , said Wang Yuchi , a spokesman for President Ma Ying Jeou .
Residents said more people than usual were in the village when the storm hit last weekend because Saturday was Taiwanese Father 's day .
On this day , many people return to their home villages to be with family .
As of late Friday night , the death toll from the typhoon was put at 121 , but the office of Taiwan 's president said the number of deaths could exceed 500 .
Fifty - three people were missing and 45 were injured , according to official numbers , government spokesman Andrew Cheng told CNN .
" We try to minimize the death tolls , but you know these mudslides are quite serious .
We have done our best to do the rescue work , " Cheng said .
Government authorities told CNN's John Vause Friday that they believe most of the people able to be rescued have been .
Rescuers tried to determine Friday whether the mud was stable enough to bring in excavators to begin searching for bodies in Shiao Lin .
Since the typhoon made landfall over the weekend , more than 31,000 people have been pulled from villages , according to official government figures .
Chen Chiu Lian , 76 , who lives in Shiao Lin with her teenage grandson , Wang Hsin Hong , explained to CNN 's Pauline Chiou how the typhoon hit .
" I had just finished eating .
My grandson was taking a nap .
It rained and rained .
There was water to my left and to my right ...
The next day , it was still raining .
" Our house was like a boat .
The water was like an ocean .
How can you escape ?
There was no way to escape .
My grandson told me to swim .
I was swimming and crawling through the water and debris . "

She said their home was the only one left in the village where about 160 once stood .
The two eventually were rescued by a helicopter from the roof of the house , Chen said .
They went to stay with friends .
In other remote mountainous areas of Kaohsiung County , where Shiao Lin is located , rescues also have proved difficult .
Torrential downpours , dense fog , rugged terrain and raging rivers have made it difficult to get through .
Washed - out roads and bridges rendered ground rescue operations virtually impossible in the central and southern regions of the island , the National Disaster Prevention and Protection Commission said .

Earlier in the week , the six - story Jinshuai Hotel in Jhihben collapsed into the Jhihben River after its foundations were eroded by surging floodwaters .
Media reports showed the building toppling into the water with a huge splash .
Those inside had already been evacuated .
Typhoon Morakot dropped 2.6 meters ( 102 inches ) of rain on southern and central parts of this island this week , according to CNN International meteorologist Brandon Miller .
Rescue commander Lu Chin Hong said the wind and rain caused mudslides on each side of the valley where Shiao Lin sits .
Pan Yuan
Yin , who also lost relatives to the mudslides , said he does n't want to rebuild the village .
Watch rescuers reach stranded villagers »
" I want this to become a memorial and let the dead rest in peace , " he told CNN .
In the nearby village of Shing Ki , where a bridge collapsed , rescuers evacuated as many people as possible using a cable system strung over the river .
However , when the cable slackened , workers got worried and stopped .
About 300 people left the village , but a dozen opted to stay behind , said Vause .
In some places , the mud is waist - deep , he said .
The only way people can escape the village is to climb down the side of the valley and cross the river , which is swollen and fast - moving .
It is fed by mud lakes at higher altitudes .
After hitting Taiwan , Morakot roared on to mainland China on Sunday , killing at least six people and displacing 1.4 million , authorities said .

I know a little something about living an adventurous life .
I ’ve hot air ballooned Kathmandu , glacier trekked Patagonia , gone paragliding in the Andes , slept in a snow - shelter at the top of the Rocky Mountains , scuba - dived in the tropics , camel trekked the Sahara , rock - climbed in Thailand and been on an African safari .
Oh , and I ’ve been sky diving , cliff diving , rafting on Class V white water , and I was even swept over a waterfall once .
Huff , huff …
You thought I was finished , did n’t you ? 😉
I ’ve also visited 20 % of the world ’s countries and circled the globe twice .
I ’ve explored ancient castles , palaces , temples , tombs , catacombs and labyrinths .
I ’ve stayed in 5 star hotels , caves and dessert caravan tents .
I ’ve seen the pyramids , Machu Picchu , the Amazon , the African savanna , the Himalayas , the Eiffel Tower , the Acropolis in Athens and the Taj Mahal .
And I have to tell you – it ’s been extraordinary .
It ’s an absolutely amazing , brilliant , beautiful world out there filled with dazzling wonders that are readily available for you to experience .
You do n’t have to be rich .
You do n’t have to be exceptional .
If you want to experience it all , you just have to make a decision , set some goals , and make it happen .
Here ’s how :
Step 1 : Discover Your Vista ’s of Adventure
First get a clear vision of what the word ‘ adventure ’ means to you .
Take 30 minutes , put on some inspiring music , get excited and write down everything that comes to mind when you think about an adventure .
What movies inspire you ?
Indiana Jones ?
James Bond ?
The Bourne Series ?
What types of adventures appeal to you ?
Adventurous sports ?
Travel ?
The great outdoors ?
What specific activities sound like a heart - pounding blast ?
Bungee jumping ?
Exploring ancient ruins ?
Heli - skiing ( skiing areas you can only get to by helicopter ) ?
Step 2 : Choose 5 Specific Adventure Goals
Life is short !
Now is the time to get real .
Now is the moment to make a commitment to experience the life adventures you want to experience before you die .
Choose 5 adventure goals from your brainstorm that you ’re most excited about .
Pick one that you will do within 3 months , one that you will do by the end of the year , one within 2 years , one within 3 years and one within 5 years .
The first 3 - month goal should be exciting , but reasonable , so it ’s actually possible to achieve in a short time frame .
This one is very important because it will help you build momentum and faith in yourself .
Also , be firm and DECIDE that you WILL give yourself the gift of an adventurous life .
Spend an additional 5 minutes writing out why this is important to you , and then write a formal commitment to yourself and hang it where you ’ll see it every day .
Step 3 : Learn How to Take the First Step
Now take your first 3 - month goal and figure out what you need to do to make it a reality .
One of the most common reasons people do n’t make their life more exciting and adventurous is that they do n’t know how to start .
But that ’s okay – you can learn .
Search the Internet , the library , or talk to people who ’ve done what you ’re planning to do .
Ask questions .
Make calls .
Figure out what steps you need to take .
There are companies that arrange everything from local rock - climbing and white - water rafting trips to round - the - world , multi- month adventures .
Also , read “ 25 Ways to Learn How to Do Absolutely Anything ” for more ideas .
Step 4 : Create a Plan for Your First Adventure
Once you understand the initial steps that are required to embark on your first adventure goal , create a clear plan .
Make a detailed list of what actions you need to take and set a date for completing each action so that you ’ll be off experiencing this first adventure in exactly 3 months from today .
Step 5 : Jump into Action Immediately
If you ’re like most people , you ’ve probably just read the previous 4 steps without actually doing anything .
And guess what ?
You ’re in danger of finishing this article without ever taking action .
Here ’s how to make sure that does n’t happen :
Take action immediately !
Yes , right now !
Start brainstorming your adventure goals .
Pick your top 5 goals .
And then do one more step …
Figure out what the logical first step is towards your first adventure goal .
Additional Tips on Living an Adventurous Life
Overcoming your fears is half the fun of adventuring .
The adrenalin rush can be exhilarating !
And when it passes , and you realize you ’re still standing , you feel a great sense of accomplishment .
Remember most fears are not real .
Fear could stand for : “ False Experiences Appearing Real . ”
Fear is also a great way to get people ’s attention and motivate them to do things ; so the media , politicians , companies and many other organizations spend a lot of time and money trying to make the world seem like a scary place .
It ’s not .
Even for people living adventurous lives , disaster rarely strikes .
That ’s why when it does strike it makes the evening news … because it ’s rare .
Ultimately the secret to fear is :
Feel the fear and do it anyway .
Whenever you have a choice of activities to do , pick the one that will make for a better story .
Do n’t have the time ?
Instead of going to see an action movie , take action in your own life .
Instead of sitting in front of the TV , sit on a ski lift .
Instead of sleeping in your bed , sleep on a bus on the way to the Grand Canyon .
Instead of going out to the park , go out rock climbing .
Instead of vacationing at Disneyland , vacation in Thailand .
Do n’t have the money ?
International travel is much cheaper than it seems .
Just give up a few luxuries and do n’t try to keep living exactly the same way you do at home .
You will keep costs down and have a much more profound experience if you eat what the locals eat , sleep like the locals sleep and travel like the locals travel .
Visit countries that are more affordable than your home country .
As for adventure sports , most of them are filled with specialized , expensive gear that you do n’t need .
You need SOME to be safe , but do n’t be fooled into a thousand dollar shopping spree for a weekend camping trip .
Rent , borrow or go without .
Yes you can !
For additional advice on doing the impossible , I recommend reading ( or rereading ) Marc and Angel ’s excellent post “ How to Walk on Water . ”
And one last tip from someone who ’s been there :
As your life unfolds with new excitement , experiences and adventure , you must , must , must keep a journal of your experiences .
Also , take thousands of pictures and lock those precious moments into your memory forever .
Someday , when you ’re sitting with your children or grandchildren , you ’ll be so happy you did .
What adventures would you like to conquer ?

Liberals introduce legislation to make Sept. 30 Indigenous reconciliation holiday
It is so named in memory of a piece of clothing one First Nations girl in British Columbia had taken away from her on her first day at a residential school in 1973 .
Binyam Mohamed :
An MI5 officer faces investigation over his case
An independent inquiry is needed into claims UK security services were complicit in the torture of terrorism suspects , say MPs and peers .
The Joint Human Rights Committee said it was unable to establish whether British officers were involved in mistreatment of suspects .
It also criticised ministers and the head of MI5 for refusing to testify at parliamentary hearings on the claims .
Minister Ivan Lewis said torture was " unacceptable and abhorrent " .
" We neither engage in , collude with or condone torture , " the foreign affairs minister told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
Asked whether Britain was complicit in torture , he said : " I do n't believe that that 's the case .
" We stand very firmly in saying that torture is not acceptable .
We make it clear to those countries that we work with .

" What we can't do is simply turn away from our responsibilities to the security of the British people . "
In a highly critical report , the joint parliamentary committee said there was now a " disturbing number of credible allegations " of British complicity in torture .
These allegations include the rendition and alleged abuse of British resident Binyam Mohammed from Pakistan to Morocco , prior to being taken to Guantanamo Bay .
The Metropolitan Police are investigating the role of one MI5 officer in Mr Mohamed 's case .
Last week the High Court revealed that the same officer visited Morocco three times during the period that Mr Mohamed says he was being secretly tortured there .
' COMPLICITY ' ALLEGATIONS
Binyam Mohamed : Claims to have been tortured in Morocco by interrogators who asked him questions about his life which he says could only have come from British authorities Salauddin Amin : Claims Britain was complicit in alleged torture suffered following his arrest in Pakistan Rangzieb Ahmed : Claims his fingernails were pulled by a Pakistani torturer and MI5 supplied Pakistani interrogators with questions
' Torture complicity ' cases in detail
The committee also looked at other cases where British men , two of whom have been convicted of terror offences , say they were visited by British intelligence officers while they were detained and allegedly mistreated by Pakistani authorities .
But in all the cases , the parliamentary committee said it could not get to the facts because too many questions were not being properly answered .
It said that both the foreign secretary and home secretary , as well as the director general of MI5 , had declined to give evidence on what was known about torture or mistreatment .
The ministers appeared " determined to avoid parliamentary scrutiny " , said the report , and had batted away important questions with standardised answers .
Committee chairman Andrew Dismore MP said : " The allegations we have heard about UK complicity in torture are extremely serious .
" It is unacceptable both for ministers to refuse to answer policy questions about the security services , and for the director general of MI5 to answer questions from the press but not from a Parliamentary committee . "
Revised guidance due
But foreign affairs minister Ivan Lewis insisted the foreign secretary had answered questions on torture allegations .
The prime minister has pledged to publish revised guidance to intelligence officers but Mr Dismore added : " General assertions of non-complicity are no longer an adequate response to the many detailed allegations .
A more obvious case of outsourcing of torture , a more obvious case of passive rendition , I cannot imagine
David Davis MP
" An independent inquiry is the only way to get to the bottom of these stories , clear the air and make recommendations for the future conduct and management of the security services .
" The recent allegations should be a wake - up call to ministers that the current arrangements are not satisfactory .
We look to the government to respond positively to our recommendations and not to continue to hide behind their wall of secrecy . "
Clive Baldwin , a senior legal adviser for Human Rights Watch , said a full public inquiry was needed because the " nature , level and rapidity " of allegations meant it was " something more than a one - off case " .
Shadow foreign secretary William Hague said : " We also call on the government urgently to clarify what legally constitutes complicity in torture .
" All credible allegations of complicity in torture should be thoroughly investigated if public trust is to be restored . "
Ticking bomb scenario HAVE YOUR SAY
I would prefer that time and money be spent on the creation of a definitive legislation to control any current and future use of torture .
Stephen McCann , Glasgow Former shadow home secretary David Davis , who resigned his seat in protest over civil liberty issues , said the national security arguments had been " grotesquely misused " .
" This is not simply a question of accepting intelligence , everyone accepts that if on one occasion or a couple of occasions , something turns up that tells you something is about to happen - it 's actually got a name , the ticking bomb scenario - then you would be duty - bound to use that intelligence to the best of your ability .
" What this is , is about a policy of encouraging , of complicity , of involvement effectively in a pattern of torture and it's much , much more than just accepting the odd piece of intelligence . "
A spokesman for the government rejected the call for an independent inquiry , saying that oversight was already sufficient .
" The government unreservedly condemns the use of torture as a matter of fundamental principle and works hard with its international partners to eradicate this abhorrent practice worldwide , " said the spokesman .
" The government has already made clear it is committed to publishing guidance to intelligence officers as well as asking the Intelligence and Security Committee to consider new developments on detention and rendition . "

In the initial love study at SUNY - Stony Brook , 10 women and 7 men in intense , " early - stage " love were put into a functional MRI brain scanner , which can detect activity in specific parts of the brain .
They were then shown pictures of their loved one or a neutral person .
Emory 's Young noted in the Nature paper that both Prozac , an antidepressant , and Viagra , an erection enhancer , appear to affect the oxytocin system , though it 's not yet known whether such drugs affect relationships by changing brain chemistry .
In fact , a study published this year in Biological Psychiatry supports that idea , showing that oxytocin may help human couples get along better .
Swiss researchers gave 47 couples a nasal spray containing either oxytocin or a placebo .
The couples then participated in a videotaped " conflict " discussion .
Those that got oxytocin exhibited more positive and less negative behavior than those given the placebo .
Oxytocin was also linked to lower secretion of cortisol , a stress hormone .
And it 's conceivable that , as Emory University neurobiologist Larry J. Young pointed out in the journal Nature earlier this year , once scientists understand the chemistry of love , drugs to manipulate the process " may not be far away . "
But they do have a plausible hypothesis : that dopamine plays a big role in the excitement of love , and oxytocin is key for the calmer experience of attachment .
Granted , the data are preliminary .
But the findings so far are provocative .
It 's way too soon - and hopefully , always will be - to say that brain scientists have translated all those warm and fuzzy feelings we call romantic love into a bunch of chemicals and electrical signals in the brain .
In the same lab , older volunteers who claimed to still be intensely in love after two decades of marriage participated in the same experiment .
The same brain areas lit up , showing that , at least in some lucky couples , that honeymoon feeling can last .
But in these folks , other areas lit up , too -- those rich in oxytocin , the " cuddling " chemical that helps new mothers make milk and bond with their babies , is secreted by both sexes during orgasm , and that , in animals , has been linked to monogamy and long - term attachment .
At a university in Stony Brook , N.Y. , a handful of young people who had just fallen madly in love volunteered to have their brains scanned to see what areas were active when they looked at a picture of their sweetheart .
The brain areas that " lit up " were precisely those known to be rich in a powerful " feel good " chemical , dopamine -- the substance that brain cells release in response to cocaine and nicotine .
Dopamine is the key chemical in the brain 's " reward system , " a network of cells associated with pleasure -- and addiction .
For centuries , love has been celebrated - and probed - mostly by poets , artists , and balladeers .
But now , its mysteries are also yielding to the tools of science , including modern brain scanning machines .
One dopamine - rich region in particular consistently lit up when these lovebirds viewed the loved one , but not the neutral person , according to the research , published in 2005 .
The intensity of the brain 's response to falling in love , says coauthor Lucy L. Brown , a neuroscientist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine , suggests that it " is not just an emotion but a drive , a real goal like food or water . "
The team found the same brain areas at work in people recently rejected by a loved one .
Perhaps loss of love triggers the same kind of craving as withdrawal from cocaine or cigarettes , suggests Helen Fisher , a biological anthropologist at Rutgers University who also worked on the study .
In new data presented at scientific meetings this year and last , Bianca Acevedo , formerly at Stony Brook and now a post - doctoral fellow at the University of California - Santa Barbara , focused on 10 women and 7 men still in love after 21 years of marriage .
Like the young lovers , when these volunteers were put in scanners and shown pictures of their partners , their dopamine - rich areas lit up .
" But in contrast to those newly in love , " says Acevedo , other brain regions did , too , including areas rich in oxytocin , vasopressin ( a similar chemical ) and serotonin , a brain chemical associated with well - being and calmness .
The link between long - term attachment and oxytocin has long fascinated researchers , among them , Sue Carter , a neuroendocrinologist at the University of Illinois in Chicago .
Carter 's work has centered on prairie voles , known for their enduring bonds .
Compared with other rodents , prairie voles -- among the only 3 percent of mammals that form monogamous bonds -- have more active oxytocin .
Moreover , brain cells with " receptors " that specifically latch onto oxytocin lie in the very brain regions believed to be important in forming attachments , Carter says .
Other researchers have shown that when mice ( not known for their monogamous ways ) are injected with a gene containing instructions for making the receptor for oxytocin , the mice cozy up to their mates like voles .
Lack of oxytocin is important , too .
For instance , if female animals are stressed by being isolated , their oxytocin drops .
In humans , Emory University research shows that women who were seriously abused as children have low oxytocin levels as adults .
One question emerging from all this is whether knowing the chemistry of love can help in picking a compatible partner in the first place .
Fisher , the Rutgers anthropologist , who consults for the dating websites Match.com and Chemistry.com , thinks so .
She believes that certain personality types correspond to the preponderance and ratios of specific chemicals in the body ; her team is now examining blood , urine , and saliva samples to test her theory .
In a study that involved 28,000 clients using the Chemistry.com dating site , Fisher built personality profiles based on people 's answers to a long questionnaire , then sorted them into different " types " and followed their dating experiences to see which types were attracted to which other types .
Creative , risk - taking personalities , which she calls " explorers , " may have more active dopamine systems , as well as more activity of another brain chemical , norepinephrine , she says .
She found that " explorers " are drawn to other " explorers . "
People she calls " builders , " conventional , calm , conscientious folks , may have more active serotonin and may also be drawn to other " builders . "
By contrast , Hillary Clinton types - " directors " - who are analytical and tough - minded , may be high in testosterone and regularly drawn to their opposites , the " negotiators " like Bill Clinton , who may be fueled by estrogen and oxytocin , Fisher says .
Whether this love chemistry will pan out in the new research is still an open question .
In the meantime , remember those prairie voles - they get what Fisher calls " life 's greatest prize - an enduring mate and partner . "

Emotional experience similar to " bitter sweet "
Saudade ( , [1 ] European Portuguese : [ sɐwˈðaðɨ ] , Brazilian Portuguese : [ sawˈdadi ] or [ sawˈdadʒi ] , Galician : [ sawˈðaðɪ ] ; plural saudades ) [ 2 ] is a deep emotional state of nostalgic or profound melancholic longing for an absent something or someone that one cares for and / or loves .
Moreover , it often carries a repressed knowledge that the object of longing might never be had again .
It is the recollection of feelings , experiences , places , or events that once brought excitement , pleasure , and well - being , which now trigger the senses and make one experience the pain of separation from those joyous sensations .
However it acknowledges that to long for the past would detract from the excitement you feel towards the future .
Saudade describes both happy and sad at the same time , which is most closely translated to the English saying ‘ bitter sweet ’ .
Nascimento and Meandro ( 2005 ) [ 3 ] cite Duarte Nunes Leão 's definition of saudade : " Memory of something with a desire for it . "
In Brazil , the day of Saudade is officially celebrated on 30 January . [ 4 ] [ 5 ]
History [ edit ]
The distant lands of the Portuguese Empire made a special longing for the loved ones of explorers and sailors
The word saudade was used in the Cancioneiro da Ajuda ( 13th century ) , in the Cancioneiro da Vaticana and by poets of the time of King Denis of Portugal [ 6 ] ( reigned 1279 –1325 ) .
Some specialists say the word may have originated during the Great Portuguese Discoveries , giving meaning to the sadness felt about those who departed on journeys to unknown seas and disappeared in shipwrecks , died in battle , or simply never returned .
Those who stayed behind — mostly women and children — suffered deeply in their absence .
However , the Portuguese discoveries only started in 1415 and since the word has been found in earlier texts , this does not constitute a very good explanation .
The Reconquista also offers a plausible explanation .
The state of mind has subsequently become a " Portuguese way of life " : a constant feeling of absence , the sadness of something that 's missing , wistful longing for completeness or wholeness and the yearning for the return of what is now gone , a desire for presence as opposed to absence — as it is said in Portuguese , a strong desire to matar as saudades ( lit. to kill the saudades ) .
In the latter half of the 20th century , saudade became associated with the longing for one 's homeland , as hundreds of thousands of Portuguese - speaking people left in search of better futures in South America , North America , and Western Europe .
Besides the implications derived from a wave of emigration trend from the motherland , historically speaking saudade is the term associated with the decline of Portugal 's role in world politics and trade .
During the so - called " Golden Age " , synonymous with the era of discovery , Portugal rose to the status of a world power , and its monarchy became one of the richest in Europe .
But with the competition from other European nations , the country went both colonially and economically into a prolonged period of decay .
This period of decline and resignation from the world 's cultural stage marked the rise of saudade , aptly described by a sentence in Portugal 's national anthem : Levantai hoje de novo o esplendor de Portugal ( Lift up once again today the splendour of Portugal ) .
Definition [ edit ]
The Dicionário Houaiss da Língua Portuguesa defines saudade ( or saudades ) as " A somewhat melancholic feeling of incompleteness .
It is related to thinking back on situations of privation due to the absence of someone or something , to move away from a place or thing , or to the absence of a set of particular and desirable experiences and pleasures once lived . " [ 7 ]
The Dictionary from the Royal Galician Academy , on the other hand , defines saudade as an " intimate feeling and mood caused by the longing for something absent that is being missed .
This can take different aspects , from concrete realities ( a loved one , a friend , the motherland , the homeland ... ) to the mysterious and transcendent .
It is quite prevalent and characteristic of the Galician - Portuguese world , but it can also be found in other cultures . "
Related words [ edit ]
Saudade is a word in Portuguese and Galician that claims no direct translation in English .
However , a close translation in English would be " desiderium " .
Desiderium is defined as an ardent desire or longing , especially a feeling of loss or grief for something lost .
It also has a meaning of having feelings for something that we no longer have and wish very much we did .
Desiderium comes from the word desiderare , meaning to long for .
Connections between desiderium and nostalgia have also been drawn ; the former can be seen as expressing the latter for things that ca n’t be experienced any more , or things that someone may have never experienced themselves . [ 8 ]
In Portuguese , " Tenho saudades tuas " ( European Portuguese ) or " Estou com saudades de você " ( Brazilian Portuguese ) , translates as " I have ( feel ) saudade of you " meaning " I miss you " , but carries a much stronger tone .
In fact , one can have saudade of someone whom one is with , but have some feeling of loss towards the past or the future .
For example , one can have " saudade " towards part of the relationship or emotions once experienced for / with someone , though the person in question is still part of one 's life , as in " Tenho saudade do que fomos " ( I feel " saudade " of the way we were ) .
Another example can illustrate this use of the word saudade : " Que saudade ! " indicating a general feeling of longing , whereby the object of longing can be a general and undefined entity / occasion / person / group / period etc .
This feeling of longing can be accompanied or better described by an abstract will to be where the object of longing is .
Despite being hard to translate in full , saudade has equivalent words in other cultures , and is often related to music styles expressing this feeling such as the blues for African - Americans , Sehnsucht in German , dor in Romania , Tizita in Ethiopia , Hiraeth in Welsh , or Assouf for the Tuareg people , appocundria in Neapolitan .
In Slovak , the word is clivota or cnenie , and in Czech , the word is stesk .
In Turkish , the word Hasret meaning longing , yearning or nostalgia has similar connotations .
The similar melancholic music style is known in Bosnia - Herzegovina as sevdah ( ultimately from Arabic سَوْدَاء sawdā ' : ' black [ bile ] ' , translation of the Greek µέλαινα χολή , mélaina cholē from which the term melancholy is derived ) .
Elements [ edit ]
Saudades de Nápoles ( Missing Naples ) , 1895 by ( Missing Naples ) , 1895 by Bertha Worms
Saudade is similar but not equal to nostalgia , a word that also exists in Portuguese .
In the book In Portugal of 1912 , A. F. G. Bell writes :
The famous saudade of the Portuguese is a vague and constant desire for something that does not and probably cannot exist , for something other than the present , a turning towards the past or towards the future ; not an active discontent or poignant sadness but an indolent dreaming wistfulness . [ 9 ]
A stronger form of saudade may be felt towards people and things whose whereabouts are unknown , such as old ways and sayings ; a lost lover who is sadly missed ; a faraway place where one was raised ; loved ones who have died ; feelings and stimuli one used to have ; and the faded , yet golden memories of youth .
Although it relates to feelings of melancholy and fond memories of things / people / days gone by , it can be a rush of sadness coupled with a paradoxical joy derived from acceptance of fate and the hope of recovering or substituting what is lost by something that will either fill in the void or provide consolation .
To F. D. Santos , Saudade as a noun has become a longing for longing itself :
There was an evolution from saudades ( plural ) to Saudade ( singular , preferably written with a capital S ) , which became a philosophical concept .
...
Saudade has an object ; however , its object has become itself , for it means ' nostalgia for nostalgia ' , a meta - nostalgia , a longing oriented toward the longing itself .
It is no more the Loved One or the ' Return ' that is desired , based on a sense of loss and absence .
Now , Desire desires Desire itself , as in the poetry of love for love 's sake in Arabic , or as in Lope de Vega 's famous epigram about the Portuguese who was crying for his love for Love itself .
Or , rather , as poetess Florbela Espanca put it , I long for the longings I do n't have ( ' Anoitecer ' , Espanca 1923 ) . [ 10 ]
Music [ edit ]
As with all emotions , saudade has been an inspiration for many songs and compositions .
" Sodade " ( saudade in Cape Verdean Creole ) is the title of the Cape Verde singer Cesária Évora 's most famous song .
Étienne Daho , a French singer , also produced a song of the same name .
The Good Son , a 1990 album by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds , was heavily informed by Cave 's mental state at the time , which he has described as saudade .
He told journalist Chris Bohn : " When I explained to someone that what I wanted to write about was the memory of things that I thought were lost for me , I was told that the Portuguese word for this feeling was saudade .
It 's not nostalgia but something sadder . "
saudade Cape Verdean pop singer Cesária Évora had her biggest hit singing about
The usage of saudade as a theme in Portuguese music goes back to the 16th century , the golden age of Portugal .
Saudade , as well as love suffering , is a common theme in many villancicos and cantigas composed by Portuguese authors ; for example : " Lágrimas de Saudade " ( tears of saudade ) , which is an anonymous work from the Cancioneiro de Paris .
Fado is a Portuguese music style , generally sung by a single person ( the fadista ) along with a Portuguese guitar .
The most popular themes of fado are saudade , nostalgia , jealousy , and short stories of the typical city quarters .
Fado and saudade are intertwined key ideas in Portuguese culture .
The word fado comes from Latin fatum meaning " fate " or " destiny " .
Fado is a musical cultural expression and recognition of this unassailable determinism which compels the resigned yearning of saudade , a bitter - sweet , existential yearning and hopefulness towards something over which one has no control .
Spanish singer Julio Iglesias , whose father is a Galician , speaks of saudade in his song " Un Canto a Galicia " ( which roughly translates as " a song / chant for Galicia " ) .
In the song , he passionately uses the phrase to describe a deep and sad longing for his motherland , Galicia .
He also performs a song called " Morriñas " , which describes the Galicians as having a deeply strong saudade .
The Paraguayan guitarist Agustin Barrios wrote several pieces invoking the feeling of saudade , including Choro de Saudade and Preludio Saudade .
The term is prominent in Brazilian popular music , including the first bossa nova song , " Chega de Saudade " ( " No more saudade " , usually translated as " No More Blues " ) , written by Tom Jobim .
Jazz pianist Bill Evans recorded the tune " Saudade de Brasil " numerous times .
In 1919 , on returning from two years in Brazil , the French composer Darius Milhaud composed a suite , Saudades do Brasil , which exemplified the concept of saudade .
" Saudade ( Part II ) " is also the title of a flute solo by the band Shpongle .
The fado singer Amália Rodrigues typified themes of saudade in some of her songs .
J - Rock band Porno Graffitti has a song entitled " サウダージ " , " Saudaaji " transliterated ( " Saudade " ) .

The rock band Extreme has a Portuguese guitarist Nuno Bettencourt ; the influence of his heritage can be seen in the band 's album Saudades de Rock .
During recording , the mission statement was to bring back musicality to the medium .
" Nancy Spain " , a song by Barney Rush , made famous by an adaptation by Christy Moore , is another example of the use of saudade in contemporary Irish music , the chorus of which is :
" No matter where I wander I 'm still haunted by your name
The portrait of your beauty stays the same
Standing by the ocean wondering where you 've gone
If you 'll return again
Where is the ring I gave to Nancy Spain ? "

Literature [ edit ]
The Portuguese author Fernando Pessoa 's posthumous collection of writings
The Book of Disquiet is written almost entirely in a tone of saudade , and deals with themes of nostalgia and alienation .[ citation needed ]
Australian author Suneeta Peres Da Costa 's novella Saudade follows Maria , a young girl from a Goan immigrant family , growing up in a political hierarchy of racism and colonialism [ 12 ]
Variations [ edit ]
saudade .
The Spanish region of Galicia ( red ) lies north of Portugal and shares a cultural history of
Saudade is also associated with Galicia , where it is used similarly to the word morriña ( longingness ) .
Yet , morriña often implies a deeper stage of saudade , a " saudade so strong it can even kill , " as the Galician saying goes .
Morriña was a term often used by emigrant Galicians when talking about the Galician motherland they left behind .
Although saudade is also a Galician word , the meaning of longing for something that might return is generally associated with morriña .
A literary example showing the understanding of the difference and the use of both words is the song Un canto a Galicia by Julio Iglesias .
The word used by Galicians speaking Spanish has spread and become common in all Spain and even accepted by the Academia . [ 13 ]
In Portugal , morrinha is a word to describe sprinkles , while morrinhar means " to sprinkle . "
( The most common Portuguese equivalents are chuvisco and chuviscar , respectively . )
Morrinha is also used in northern Portugal for referring to sick animals , for example of sheep dropsy , [ 13 ] and occasionally to sick or sad people , often with irony .
It is also used in some Brazilian regional dialects for the smell of wet or sick animals .
In Goa , India , which was a Portuguese colony until 1961 , some Portuguese influences still remain .
A suburb of Margão , Goa 's largest city , has a street named Rua de Saudades .
It was aptly named because that very street has the Christian cemetery , the Hindu shmashana ( cremation ground ) and the Muslim qabrastan ( cemetery ) .
Most people living in the city of Margão who pass by this street would agree that the name of the street could not be any other , as they often think fond memories of a friend , loved one , or relative whose remains went past that road .
The word saudade takes on a slightly different form in Portuguese - speaking Goan families for whom it implies the once - cherished but never - to - return days of glory of Goa as a prized possession of Portugal , a notion since then made redundant by the irrevocable cultural changes that occurred with the end of the Portuguese regime in these parts .
In Cape Verdean Creole there is the word sodadi ( also spelled sodade ) , originated in the Portuguese saudade and exactly with the same meaning .

Sony has announced on the Spanish PlayStation Forums that a new Singstar game is being made for Spanish pop band Mecano .
Mecano debuted in 1980 during the ‘ La Movida Madrileña ’ , a Spanish countercultural movement after Francisco Franco ’s death .
The group found considerable commercial success in the ’ 80s and early ’90s , both in its native country and in Latin America , France , and Italy with 25 million worldwide sales .
James Armstrong , Senior Vice President of Southern Europe and Managing Director for Spain and Portugal , stated that it is logical that the band gets its own game , as even ABBA and Queen have their own game .
What makes this decision justified is that in Spain , Mecano is more popular .
Singstar Mecano will appear on both the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 2 , with the release date still to be confirmed .

Arsène Wenger admits that he does indeed see fouls committed by his Arsenal players , and that his famous tendency for myopia when it comes to his own team comes from his own struggles to justify their actions .
" Many times I say things I find hard to endorse in my mind , " Wenger says , " but this job can be like quicksand when you lose .
Everyone wants to push you down .
It is all guided by fear . "
Asked whether he sometimes only pretends not to have noted a particular infraction committed by an Arsenal player , Wenger agreed : " Yes , because you are thinking , ' Why has he done that ? ' and you know you cannot explain it .
At times I saw it [ a foul ] and I said that I did n't to protect the player , because I could not find any rational explanation to defend him .
" This is a job where you have to have an optimistic view of human nature or you become paranoid .
You always have to think that a guy wants to do well .
A coach is there to help .
He must think that if he helps in the correct way the players will respond .
You can not be suspicious .
" The common denominator of successful teams is that the players are intelligent .
That does not always mean educated .
If you speak to a player after the game and ask him to rate his performance , if he analyses well , you know he is the sort who will go home thinking , ' I did this wrong , I did that wrong ' .
His assessment will be correct and he will rectify .
That player has a chance .
The one who has a crap game and says he was fantastic , you worry for him . "
In the tumult of the Premier League , Wenger has acknowledged that it helps to be a little mad .
" No great things have ever been accomplished without someone 's crazy belief , " said the Arsenal manager .
" The biggest advances have been made by people who , at the start , would have been judged mad . "
Wenger has described how football is his life , how losing is like being in quicksand and defended his often - criticised transfer policy .
" What will happen if you do not win ?
Why do you not buy players ? "
Wenger asked .
" When you allow that to infiltrate your brain too deeply you become guided by it .
" If you lose a game you drive away and you feel completely sick .
Then you think as well of all the people who 's weekend is dead because of it .
So you feel that responsibilty too .
If you think about that too much , you can become crazy , but it makes you rigorous in your preparations .
That 's how I became the person I am today .
I know I look like a robot ; but everyone who has targets is like that . "
Wenger credited the former Arsenal stars Dennis Bergkamp and Theirry Henry with being some of the most diligent players he had managed .
" I worked with Bergkamp for 10 years and I have not seen a man more obsessed with every little technical thing .
Thierry
Henry the same .
You could call Thierry at home , 10 o'clock every night , and he was there .
At 23 years of age .
And talk to Thierry about football : you can not beat him . "
Wenger remains respectful of other managers but suggests friendship is impossible : " On the day , it is you or them , so there is always mistrust .
You can not be completely open .
There are managers I respect , but I can not be completely friendly .
That is why I do not go for a drink after matches .
What can you say if you have won ?
And if you have lost all you want to do is get home and prepare for the next game . "
The notion that deficits do not matter is a widely held and deeply ingrained economic philosophy .
This line of thought took a stronghold in the 1980s and has seemed to stick to our ever - growing dismay .
Yet budget deficits do matter if we are looking at an economic horizon that is longer than one fiscal year .
You need to put this into context of your own household .
If you as an average American spend more than you make , it will eventually catch up to you .
In a more distant past , the American consumer did not have access to debt as they do now .
So they in effect had the ability to run localized deficits .
Americans took this notion of spending more than you earn to heart .
Many bought homes , cars , entertainment systems , and other consumer goods that simply did not jive with their income .
This can last for a few years but eventually it will catch up .
Now we are seeing the housing bubble burst and bankruptcies soaring .
Now I want to bring this to a more micro level because similar rules apply to larger systems .
Many Americans have had their access to credit cutoff .
The U.S. Government for many years has been relying on cheap money fuel from foreigners to keep our deficit engines going .
This will only work if we can eventually get the revenue side of the equation up .
Otherwise , foreigners will do what many credit card companies are doing to consumers and that is pulling away that easy debt .
It probably helps to see the actual cash flow sheet of the United States :
This chart is so important because it strikes at the root of our current dilemma in that we are spending more than we are bringing in .
So what would this ratio look like if we apply it to an easier example ?
Let us use a simple example to understand this ratio .
This is like the $ 50,000 American household spending $ 80,000 a year .
How long can that go forward ?
Sure you can have the artifacts of wealth like a leased Lexus and a new McMansion giving the appearance of wealth but once the access to credit runs out , it is a sudden freefall .
People quickly realize who owns the underlying asset when they are unable to make the debt payment .
For Q2 of 2009 the government spent on a seasonally adjusted annual rate $ 3.5 trillion .
In Q1 of 2009 ( the latest point on the chart ) the government brought in $ 2.2 trillion in tax revenues .
We have never run such deep deficits so we are in uncharted territory here .
It will help to look at the monthly data since we still have two more months left for this historic fiscal year :
For the 2008 fiscal year , we ran a $ 454 billion budget deficit .
That is deep but nothing compared to our current deficit .
This fiscal year we are running a $ 1.26 trillion budget deficit and we still have two more months of data .
Keep in mind the recent improvement in GDP is largely due to massive amounts of government spending , bailouts , and taxpayer subsidies .
The so - called recovery did n’t occur naturally .
Now we all understand that the government has been spending to support the economy .
Yet one factor that is being largely ignored is the revenue side of the equation .
The 2008 fiscal year saw $ 2.5 trillion in tax receipts and this year we have seen only $ 1.74 trillion .
Depending on the next two months , we are looking at a $ 600 to $ 700 billion short fall in income from last year .
Keep in mind that 2008 was already a battered year so this is significant .
Moreover , this is not something that only applies to tough times like this extraordinarily painful recession .
In Q1 of 2007 , our highest tax revenue quarter we brought in $ 2.66 trillion on a seasonally adjusted annual basis .
Even during this supposedly good quarter , we managed to spend $ 2.88 trillion on a seasonally adjusted annual rate .
This stems from the pervasive mentality that deficits simply do not matter .
If they do not matter during good times or bad times then we have to conclude that the entire policy is based on believing that deficit spending is okay under any circumstance .
This has been going on for 30 years .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve are spending as if nothing has changed during this recession .
Let us look at where all the money is going :
For all the talk about certain agencies , there are four major expenses here :
(1) Department of Defense
(2) Health and Human Services
(3) Treasury Department
(4) Social Security
And the cost for each is increasing .
The only one we seem to be talking about is healthcare but the dialogue is being sidetracked .
The other three seem to be off limits or a third rail of politics .
Yet anyone looking at this chart realizes this is unsustainable unless one thing happens .
Revenues increase .
How can we increase revenues ?
There are a couple of ways .
The economy improves and incomes pick up naturally or we raise taxes .
Yet that may not help .
Let us look at the tax structure :
Source : Federal Reserve , St. Louis
The top 10 percent of taxpayers already pay 54 percent of income taxes .
Drop down to the top 25 , and you have 83 percent of all taxes .
This is a question that we need to seriously explore .
In terms of the economy improving , most are hoping that it does improve with job losses abating and growth occurring .
That has not been happening .
The economy will improve when it finds an equilibrium .
The root of our problem dealt with spending more than we earned .
Yet here we are offering people money to purchase cars .
Why give tax rebates for people to purchase homes subsidizing their purchase on the backs of non-homeowners ?
I think many can understand spending money on modernizing roads or building new schools but rebates for cars ?
Yet increasing taxes is something that probably will occur and with such massive deficits , this is something that will be on the table .
The question is , will this help the overall economy ?
The U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve are going to realize in the next few years that deficits do matter .
Publicly our officials keep saying that they do care about deficits and the world seems okay with this for now .
Yet the massive bet here is that the income side of the equation will improve .
But , what if it does n’t ?

Janie VandenBosch 's blood boils when she receives telephone solicitations from a group that calls itself the Minnesota Disabled Veterans .
The caller has offered to send her plastic bags , lightbulbs and other items in exchange for a donation .
Problem is , VandenBosch works for Minnesota Disabled American Veterans ( DAV ) -- and her group has nothing to do with the calls .
" Sometimes I think I should just let them send me the bags so I can see who they are , '' said VandenBosch , who coordinates clothing donations to the state DAV .
" But I 'm also hearing about them from people who donate clothes to us .
They say , ' You called us 10 times this week .
What 's happening ? ' ''
What 's happening is that the Twin Cities is in the midst of a fundraising scam working its way around the nation .
Nobody knows who is behind the phone calls , where they are being made and what the money is used for .
In Minnesota , a live caller or a prerecorded announcement claims to represent " Minnesota Disabled Veterans , '' confusing itself with the 89 - year - old Disabled Veterans of America .
But not a penny of the money goes to the roughly 40,000 disabled veterans in Minnesota or the 2.5 million nationally , said Tim O'Connor , executive director of the DAV Department of Minnesota .
Likewise , Minnesota chapters of the Paralyzed Veterans of America and the Veterans of Foreign Wars report no affiliation with the callers .
" It 's disgraceful , '' said O'Connor .
" You have disabled veterans , some amputees , from World War II up to Afghanistan and Iraq being taken advantage of .
Our members have Purple Hearts , they 've been prisoners of war .
" This farce of an organization has been in and out of different states , '' he added .
" We 're trying to spread the word about them . ''
Minnesota Disabled Veterans is not a registered charity in Minnesota , the attorney general 's office said .
The office , which investigates charity fraud , said it could not reveal whether it is investigating the operation .

Lock - free programming frees you from system failure by tolerating individual process failures .
How can a process failure cause system failure ?
When a process fails while holding a lock , other processes in the system requiring that lock have to wait indefinitely .
On the other hand , lock - freedom ( or " non-blocking behavior " ) guarantees that the system makes progress when some process takes few steps [ 1 ] .
By definition , lock - free systems enjoy freedom from deadlocks .
This property of lock - free systems can be handy in applications like API monitoring .
Many malware analysis tools monitor Win32 APIs .
These tools [ 2 ] work by injecting code into monitored process and use Interprocess communication ( IPC ) to log API calls [ 3 ] .
If this IPC mechanism uses locks , then it can result in deadlock .
In this case , the probability of deadlock is real because execution of monitored process can halt while some thread may be logging an API call .
Scenarios which increase the likelihood of deadlock include :
The monitored process is killed by users .
The monitored process exits without waiting for all the threads to terminate .
A thread in the monitored process is killed by the process itself .
If lock - free data structures are used for IPC , then the system can tolerate process / thread halts .
In this article , I present a multi- producer / single - consumer lock - free buffer which can be used for IPC .
( The complete source code and related files are available here . )
In this particular situation , the consumer is the monitoring tool which logs API calls , whereas producers are the monitored processes which produce API call records .
To simplify matters , I assume consumer does not fail .
This lock - free buffer is different from usual circular buffers commonly used .
A circular buffer uses in and out pointers to track free and used items , whereas this lock - free buffer uses a special value to track free items .
This special value is never used as data .
This simplifies the problem because you do n't have to worry about updating in and out pointers atomically .
The declaration of the buffer is :
const int MAX_SIZE=255 ; int buffer [ MAX_SIZE ] ={0} ;
This declares a buffer of integer items .
You might be wondering how integer slots can store API call records .
I build on this buffer of integers and construct a buffer which can hold strings .
Returning to the integer buffer , an item with a zero value indicates a free slot .
All the items in the buffer are initialized to zero .
Insertion is straightforward .
The insert operation iterates through the items to find an empty one , then tries to put an integer value using atomic primitive CAS .
( For description of CAS , see the sidebar " CAS and ABA " . )
Note that writing lock - free code requires care to avoid potential pitfalls see [ 4 ] for details .
int Insert ( int data ) { int i=0 ; for ( i=0 ;i<' MAX_SIZE ;i++ ) { if ( CAS ( & buffer [i ] , data , 0 ) ) return i ; } return - 1 ; }
There is another handy insert operation on the buffer which tries to put the integer value at a particular index :
BOOL InsertAt ( int data , int index ) { if ( CAS ( & buffer [ index ] , data , 0 ) ) return TRUE ; return FALSE ; }
Similarly , Delete operation iterates through the buffer to find an inserted item and tries to take it out using CAS :
int Delete ( int * data ) { int i=0 ; for ( i=0 ; i< MAX_SIZE ;i++ ) { * data=buffer[i ] ; if (* data !=0 ) { if ( CAS ( & buffer [ i ] , 0 , * data ) ) return i ; } } return - 1 ; }
This implementation is lock - free because no process owns any slots in the buffer which means a process failure does not result in loss of any slots .
As the buffer slots remain intact it is always possible to put an item if the buffer is not full .
The ABA problem ( see the sidebar titled " CAS and ABA " ) commonly faced by lock - free data structures miraculously does not cause any problems .
Consider a scenario :
First process reads the buffer slot to be empty , but is preempted by second process which inserts an item in that slot .
This is followed by a third process which takes out that item .
This in turn is followed by the resumption of the first process which finds the slot to be empty .
But it does not matter if first process inserts an item in that slot .
It shows that ABA problem is not an issue in this case .
CAS and ABA CAS takes three arguments : the address of a memory location , a new value , and an expected value .
If and only if the memory location holds the expected value , the new value is written to it , atomically .
A Boolean return value indicates whether the write occurred : CAS ( address , new value , expected value ) if ( * address != expected value ) return false ; } else { * address = new value ; return true ; } According to Maged Micheal in " Hazard Pointers : Safe Memory Reclamation for Lock - Free Objects " ( see " The ABA Problem " ) : ABA problem occurs when a thread reads a value A from a shared location , and then other threads change the location to a different value , say B , and then back to A again .
Later , when the original thread checks the location , e.g. , using read or CAS , the comparison succeeds , and the thread erroneously proceeds under the assumption that the location has not changed since the thread read it earlier .
As a result , the thread may corrupt the object or return a wrong result .

How you can build on this integer buffer to put strings ?
You can put individual characters one at a time into the integer buffer .
The immediate question is how to separate a character of one string from a character of another string .
A simple answer is to use unique Message Number for a string .
The next question is how the consumer can link these characters to form the string again .
This is tricky .
A simple approach can be to put index of the character in the buffer along with message number and actual character .
However , this approach has a serious drawback .
It will limit the length of string which can be transferred through the buffer .
The approach used to overcome this limitation is to find a free slot to put the first special character along with the relative offset of the second character in the lock - free buffer .
This is followed by putting the second character at the announced index along with offset of the third character and so on .
This allows unlimited size strings to be transferred through the buffer .
See the TransferString function in Listing 1 for complete implementation .
volatile unsigned int msgCount=0 ;// Number of Unique Message Numbers In Use const int MAX_NEIGHBOURS=255 ;// consecutive characters max distance in buffer BOOL TransferString ( char * str ) { unsigned int msgNumber=0 ; int i=0 ; int data ; int inserted At= - 1 ; int nextInsertAt= - 1 ; //Following loop tries to get a unique message number to transfer string .
do { msgNumber=msgCount ; if ( msgNumber + 1>0xFFFF ) { return FALSE ; } } while (!
CAS ( &msgCount , msgNumber+1 , msgNumber ) ) ; msgNumber=msgNumber+1;//Unique
Message Number // pack the message number and start of string marker into data data=msgNumber ; data=data << 16 ; data=data|255 ; // Following loop finds a free slot to transfer the start of string marker while ( insertedAt== -1 ) insertedAt=FindFreeSlot ( ) ; // Following loop finds a free slot in close vicinity of the previous slot while ( nextInsertAt== - 1 ) nextInsertAt=FindFreeSlot( insertedAt, MAX_NEIGHBOURS ) ; // pack the information about where the next character is expected .
data=data|( nextInsertAt <<8 ) ; //Following loop inserts the packed data at previously decided index while (!
InsertAt( data, insertedAt ) ) ; // Calculate the absolute location in the buffer for the next character insertedAt=( insertedAt+nextInsertAt ) % MAX_SIZE ; // Following loop transfers all the characters in the string except null character .
for ( i=0 ; str[i ]!=0 ;i++ )
{ // Pack and put the messange number the current character and the offset data=msgNumber ; data=data << 16 ; data=data|str[i ] ; while ( nextInsertAt== -1 ) nextInsertAt=FindFreeSlot( insertedAt , MAX_NEIGHBOURS ) ; data=data|(nextInsertAt << 8 ) ; while (!
InsertAt( data, insertedAt ) ) ; insertedAt=( insertedAt+nextInsertAt ) %MAX_NEIGHBOURS ; } //Pack the message number and character and offset 0 to communicate string end .
data=msgNumber ; data=data << 16 ; while (! InsertAt( data, insertedAt ) ) ; return TRUE ; } // Find free slot at max " range " away from " startIndex " and return the offset .
int FindFreeSlot ( int startIndex , int range ) { int i ; // find free slot onwards from start index and return the relative offset if found for ( i=startIndex+1 ;i< MAX_SIZE&&i< startIndex+range ;i++ ) { if ( buffer [ i] ==0 ) return i-startIndex ; } if( startIndex+range >=MAX_SIZE ) { // find free slot from 0 index onward but before startIndex and in range for ( i=0 ;i< startIndex&&i<=( startIndex+range ) % MAX_SIZE ;i++ ) { if ( buffer [ i] ==0 ) return i+( MAX_SIZE - startIndex ) ; } } return - 1 ; } // Find first free slot int FindFreeSlot ( ) { int i ; for ( i=0 ; i< MAX_SIZE ;i++ ) { if ( buffer [ i ] ==0 ) return i ; } return - 1 ; } //Maximum Number of threads in the system ( this limitation is in demo version ) const int THREAD_COUNT=4 ; // Maximum Number of characters in a string ( this limitation is in demo version ) const int MAX_STRING_SIZE=255 ; //tempBuffer array which holds the integers deleted from the integer buffer int tempBuffer [ THREAD_COUNT *MAX_STRING_SIZE ]={0} ; //deleteIndexes array to hold index from which item was taken out of the integer buffer int deleteIndexes [ THREAD_COUNT *MAX_STRING_SIZE ]={0} ; // tempBufferIndex points to next free slot in tempBuffer as well as deleteIndexed .
int tempBufferIndex=0 ; // strings is a two dimensional array to hold string transferred by each thread char strings [ THREAD_COUNT ] [ MAX_STRING_SIZE ]={0} ; // stringIndexes [ i ] tells where to put the next character in strings [ i ] int string
Indexes [ THREAD_COUNT ] ={0} ; // next At [ i ] tells where the next character is expected to be inserted by thread i in the // integer buffer int nextAt [ THREAD_COUNT ] ={0} ; // This function tries to retrieve the strings transferred by many threads in an infinite loop void RetrieveString ( ) { int data ; int i=0 ; //Initialize the next

=Delete ( &data ) ; // Try to rearrange already transferred characters RearrangeString ( ) ; } // put the deleted item from integer buffer into array local to consumer .
tempBuffer[tempBufferIndex+1] =data ; // advance the local buffer index tempBufferIndex ++ ; } } // This function tries to rearrange already transferred characters void RearrangeString ( ) { int i ; unsigned int msgNumber ; int data ; unsigned int charMask=255 ; int ch ; for ( i=0 ;i< =tempBufferIndex ;i++ ) { data=tempBuffer[i ] ; if ( data==0 ) continue ; msgNumber=data >>16;// unpack the message number ch=data&charMask ;// unpack the character if ( ch==255 ) {// if it is start of string marker // unpack the next character offset .
Calculate the absolute index at which next character is expected nextAt[msgNumber -1]=( deleteIndexes [ i ] +( ( data&0xFF00 ) >>8 ) )
%MAX_SIZE ; //initialize the string index string Indexes [ msgNumber - 1]=0 ; tempBuffer [ i] =0 ; } else if ( ch==0 ) {// if it is end of string marker // if it is the next character in the message if ( nextAt[msgNumber-1]==deleteIndexes[i ] )
{ //null terminate the string strings [ msgNumber -1][stringIndexes[msgNumber -1 ] ] =0 ; tempBuffer [ i]=0 ;// remove item from tempBuffer printf ( " %s
" , strings[msgNumber - 1 ] ) ;// print it } } else { // if it is the next character in the message if ( nextAt[msgNumber-1]==deleteIndexes[i ] ) { // form the string by storing the next character strings [ msgNumber -1][stringIndexes[msgNumber -1 ] ] =ch ; stringIndexes[msgNumber -1 ]++;// increament index //unpack the next character offset and calculate absolute one nextAt[msgNumber -1]=( nextAt[msgNumber -1 ] +( ( data&0xFF00 ) >>8 ) ) %MAX_SIZE ; tempBuffer [i]=0 ;// remove item from tempBuffer } } } }
This TransferString function implementation builds on integer buffer .
This implementation assumes that integer size is 4 byte on the target platform .
The 4 bytes of an integer item which is put into the buffer holds the following information ( see Figure 1 ) :
The lowest order byte call it byte number zero holds the character to be transferred .
The byte number 1 immediately next to byte number zero holds the relative offset of next character from the current one in the buffer .
Finally , the byte number 2 and 3 hold a 2 - byte message number .
Again , there is a single consumer .
This simplifies the problem because concurrency is not an issue .
I am going to discuss a demo consumer implementation here .
The consumer calls Delete function on the integer lock - free buffer in an infinite loop .
The consumer remembers the index from which the item was taken out of the buffer as well as the integer data itself .
In the infinite loop it calls RearrangeString function which loops through those remembered items and checks three conditions :
Integer value contains the first special character to indicate start of string Integer value contains the last character to indicate the end of string Integer value is the next character of the string
In the first case , consumer calculates the index of the next character in the buffer and remembers it to check later on that an item with the same message number is really the next item in the sequence .
In case 2 consumer prints out the string .
In all three cases the consumer forgets this remembered item so that the same character is not repeated again .
This approach works even in case when two nonconsecutive characters of the same string are inserted at the same index of the buffer because it is not possible to insert an item at an in use index .
This means an item inserted first at the index is removed first .
This result in RearrangeString function correctly linking the item inserted first at the same index .
For a complete implementation of RearrangeString function , see Listing 1 .
There are 0xFFFF possible message numbers which is very limiting for this implementation to be used for IPC in malware analysis tool .
To make this implementation practical the same message number can be used again by the same thread in a process to communicate as many API calls as it makes .
This implies that the resulting implementation can have 0xFFFF threads communicating API calls simultaneously .
In other words , this lock - free buffer can tolerate failure of 0xFFFF threads .
The system is not in dead - lock even if all message numbers are consumed .
The new threads can continue their execution with out logging the API calls .
No requirement of memory management is another advantage of this implementation .
Although the demo implementation of consumer assumes maximum number of threads at compile time , however this technique has no such limitation .
There can be any number of threads in the system .
Lock - freedom has the potential to make a difference .
It invites you to think about new ideas and change the status - co in lock - free paradigm .
You can start by thinking about ways to avoid the limitation on number of thread failures this implementation of lock - free buffer tolerates .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp. has pleaded guilty and will pay $ 600,000 in fines for the deaths of 85 protected migratory birds in the company 's wastewater ponds in five states .
Waterfowl , hawks and owls protected under an international treaty were killed after landing in uncovered pools , where they were coated with or ingested fatal doses of hydrocarbons , federal officials said .
The facilities are in Colorado , Wyoming , Kansas , Oklahoma and Texas .
" This is a great win for the environment , " Acting Assistant Attorney General John Cruden told reporters in a telephone news conference .
Justice Department lawyers announced that Exxon Mobil also agreed in a plea deal filed in federal court in Denver , Colorado , on Wednesday to spend millions of dollars to implement a three - year program to cover its natural gas well reserve pits and wastewater storage facilities .
A government lawyer said the law requires oil and gas companies to scrub the water of contaminants , remove the ponds , or place an obstruction such as plastic netting over the water to prevent birds from landing .
The government 's environmental lawyers credited Exxon with fully cooperating after the issue was brought to the company 's attention .
" They 've already spent about $ 2.5 million and will spend quite a bit more to implement the environmental compliance plan , " trial attorney Robert Anderson said .
The birds killed over a five - year period were identified by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as ducks , grebes , ibis , passerines , shore birds , owls , martins and a hawk .
None is listed as an endangered species .
The Justice Department said $ 400,000 of the fines will go to a wetlands conservation fund , and $ 200,000 in community service payments will be directed to waterfowl rehabilitation and preservation organizations .

The parents of Nataline Sarkisyan removed her from life support Thursday .
" Now we have to start the healing process to try to figure out what happened and why it happened , " said a friend of the family .
Nataline had been in a vegetative state for three weeks , her mother Hilda Sarkisyan told the Daily News .
CIGNA initially declined to pay for the transplant for Nataline because her plan did not cover " experimental , investigational and unproven services , " her doctors said .
The denial prompted a rally by Armenians outside CIGNA 's Glendale offices attended by a crowd estimated by organizers at 150 .
Hundreds of telephone callers also clogged lines at CIGNA offices around the nation today on Nataline 's behalf , organizers said .
About 15 minutes into the rally , it was announced that CIGNA would make an exception to its rules and approve the transplant .
" This is an incredible turnaround generated by a massive outpouring around the country that proves that an engaged public can make a difference and achieve results , " Rose Ann DeMoro , executive director of the California Nurses Association and National Nurses Organizing Committee , one of the rally 's organizers , said before Nataline 's death .
" CIGNA had to back down in the face of a mobilized network of patient advocates and health care activists who would not take no for an answer . "
The Armenian National Committee and Eve Gittleson , a blogger on the Web site Daily Kos , also help organize the protests .
Nataline was diagnosed with leukemia at age 14 .
After two years of treatment the cancer went into remission but came back this summer , Sarkisyan told the Daily News .
When doctors said Nataline could use a bone - marrow transplant , the Sarkisyans discovered that her only sibling , Bedig , 21 , was a match , and he donated his bone marrow the day before Thanksgiving , the newspaper reported .
However , Nataline developed a complication from the bone - marrow transplant and because her liver was failing , doctors recommended a transplant , according to an appeal letter sent to CIGNA earlier this month , the Daily News reported .
The Sarkisyans filed an appeal with the California Department of Insurance , which sent a letter this week saying it needed more information .
Canonical , the company behind the Ubuntu Linux distribution , announced this week that it has opened the source code of its Launchpad project hosting service .
This will enable third - party developers to participate in improving the software and could also make it a lot more attractive as a project hosting option .
Launchpad provides much of Ubuntu 's underlying development infrastructure , including bug tracking , code hosting , project management , and localization tools .
Canonical has broadly encouraged open source software developers to bring their own projects to Launchpad and take advantage of this functionality .
Launchpad itself , however , was a proprietary service and the source code was not available .
This became a source of friction between Canonical and the open source software community , deterring some potential adopters .
Canonical 's move to completely open the Launchpad source code will largely address the concerns expressed by prospective adopters .
Canonical began the long process of opening Launchpad in 2007 when it released some key components , such as the Storm object - relational mapping framework , under open source licenses .
During a keynote last year at the 2008 OSCON conference , Canonical CEO Mark Shuttleworth revealed plans to open most of the Launchpad source code within approximately twelve months .
Despite warnings about the possibility of delays , Canonical has succeeded in delivering the Launchpad code within the promised timeline .
In a surprising show of commitment to open source values , Canonical has released the entire code base , including several pieces that it had originally intended to keep to itself for competitive reasons , such as the Soyuz build system and package management component .
" I 'm very happy to announce that today we open - sourced Launchpad .
This is the fulfilment of a commitment made a year ago , as well as an experiment in involving the community in the development of a hosted service , " wrote Canonical 's Karl Fogel in a statement at the official Canonical blog .
In a follow - up post with additional technical details at the Launchpad blog , Fogel described the scope of the code release and explains how developers can participate in the project .
" We released Launchpad today under the GNU Affero General Public license , version 3 , " he wrote .
" Note that although we had previously announced that we'd be holding back two components ( codehosting and soyuz ) , we changed our minds : they are included — all the code is open . "
The GNU Affero General Public License ( AGPL ) is a special variant of the GPL that is intended specifically for open Web services .
Those who deploy code that is licensed under the AGPL are obligated by the terms of the license to disclose their modifications and improvements .
This ensures that the freedom of users to study , modify , and redistribute the source code is preserved even when it is hosted on a server rather than shipped as a product .
The AGPL is part of a broader movement to open the Web by fostering interoperability and enabling individuals to self - host their own technical infrastructure .
Launchpad reflects the philosophy of the open Web in other key ways in addition to its adoption of the AGPL .
It will facilitate data portability by making its underlying information accessible to third - party software through APIs .
Launchpad is a very powerful and impressive hosting service with a wide range of tightly integrated features and strong support for inter-project collaboration .
Several highly prominent open source software projects use Launchpad as their primary hub of development , including MySQL and Zope .
I use it extensively myself for my own small projects .
Now that Launchpad is open source and will be able to benefit from community participation in ongoing development , the rate at which it evolves and attracts adopters will likely increase .
We could also see the emergence of some very compelling derivatives or mashups as the code base is repurposed by independent developers and other Linux distributors .
The Pirate Party of Ireland has expressed its disappointment regarding the blocking of the Pirate Bay website by eircom .

Listed Under Industrys :

End
-- The Pirate Party is deeply concerned by news that eircom is to block access from its subscribers to thepiratebay.org .
The Pirate bay is a website that provides listings of content hosted by people all around the world that can be searched and downloaded via peer - to - peer technology .
It hosts absolutely no copyrighted material itself , only links .
The Pirate Party , which has no connection to the Pirate Bay , is extremely disappointed that the site will be blocked for Eircom customers from September 1st 2009 .
The Party , which is opposed to censorship and stands for the protection of individual privacy , finds this action wholly disturbing and believes it should not go ahead .
The block is as a result of pressure from IRMA ( the Irish Recorded Music Association , representing the " big four " major record labels ) .
The Party notes that there are a significant amount of independent artists and labels , in competition with those that IRMA represents , who use the Pirate Bay as a distribution platform for their work .
They will be adversely affected by this block .
The Pirate Party believes that this block will set a precedent not only for further monitoring of Internet users , censorship and general debilitation of Internet services in Ireland , but also for similar action against other Irish companies providing Internet services , such as BT Ireland , Smart Telecom , Perlico and UPC ( two of which have already been similarly threatened ) , severely damaging competition in this sector and curtailing efficient broadband rollout .
In recent weeks , copies of the Pirate Bay have appeared at different locations all over the web .
The Pirate Party wonders if blocking the website will be at all effective in a world where copies of the website can be set up in a couple of hours .
When the Pirate Bay was blocked in Denmark , traffic to the website grew by 12 % .
Dick Doyle of IRMA has made references to Section 40 Sub-section 4 of the Irish Copyright and Related Rights Act , 2000 in order to support his position : ( 4 ) " Without prejudice to subsection ( 3 ) , where a person who provides facilities referred to in that subsection is notified by the owner of the copyright in the work concerned that those facilities are being used to infringe the copyright in that work and that person fails to remove that infringing material as soon as practicable thereafter that person shall also be liable for the infringement .
" Subsection 4 however clearly references subsection 3 which is rarely , if ever , mentioned .
Subsection 3 states : ( 3 ) " Subject to subsection ( 4 ) , the provision of facilities for enabling the making available to the public of copies of a work shall not of itself constitute an act of making available to the public of copies of the work .
"
Not only does subsection 3 state that Eircom 's ( or any ISP 's ) position " shall not of itself constitute and act of making available " - subsection 4 also makes specific reference to " removal of materials " .
Neither the Pirate Bay , nor Eircom , store any copyrighted materials on any of their servers or within theirservice infrastructure .
Also since the law specifically refers to singular works this section of the law cannot be used against an entire site or service .
The Pirate Party of Ireland is part of a global movement in more than 35 countries worldwide dedicated to protecting peoples ' rights and personal liberties in the digital age .
The Party made headlines when it was elected to the European Parliament in Sweden , with popular support from younger voters .

The Pirate Bay et les trackers miroirs d'OpenBitTorrent sont inaccessibles ce lundi .
A la stupeur des administrateurs du site , la principale société qui loue de la bande passante au site de liens BitTorrent a été contrainte par la justice à fermer brutalement les tuyaux , ou à payer une forte amende .
Elle a préféré la première option , le temps d'examiner ses voies de recours , ce qui impacte une grande partie du trafic BitTorrent aujourd ' hui .
Mise à jour 19h05 : The Pirate Bay est de nouveau en ligne , trois heures après la mise en application de l'ordre judiciaire .
Les administrateurs ont très vite réagi pour re-router le trafic et remettre le site sur pieds .
Rien ne va plus pour The Pirate Bay .
La vente paraît extrêmement compromise , et les ayants droit ne lâchent rien de la pression qu’ils exercent contre le site de liens BitTorrent .
Lundi , à la demande de studios de cinéma , l’un des principaux fournisseurs d’accès de The Pirate Bay a reçu notification d’un ordre judiciaire de coupure d’accès au site .
Le prestataire a décidé de s’y plier , pour éviter d’avoir à payer de fortes astreintes financières .
« Nous avons reçu la décision à propos de l’astreinte juste après le déjeuner , et nous avons fermé la capacité ( en bande passante , ndlr ) juste avant trois heures , environ « , explique le directeur de Black Interent , Victor Moller .
Le tribunal d’instance de Stockholm a mis en demeure la société d’interrompre toute fourniture d’accès au site , ou de payer une amende de 500.000 couronnes suédoises ( environ 50.000 euros ) en cas de refus .
« Il y a des lois et des règles dans la société et nous devons les suivre .
Nous verrons ce que nous ferons dans le futur , nous n’avons pas encore décidé « , ajoute M. Moller .
Selon lui , Black Internet n’est pas le seul FAI du site suédois , mais tous decvraient recevoir la même injonction .
Il serait aussi le principal fournisseur de bande passante du site , qui est aujourd ’hui inaccessible pour une période indéterminée .
« Ils pourraient rediriger et obtenir la capacité ailleurs , mais bien sûr ça prend du temps « , estime Victor Moller .
En principe , le trafic interrompu par Black Internet devrait être réparti chez les autres hébergeurs du site , qui n’ont pas encore obéi à l’injonction .
Mais la charge est trop lourde pour eux .
Les trackers d’OpenBitTorrent , qui n’étaient pour le moment que des miroirs des trackers de The Pirate Bay , semblent également impactés à l’heure où nous publions ces lignes .
Ce qui représente , selon certaines études , un . torrent sur deux en circulation .

Good news Japanese PSN account holders !
You can now browse and download from the PSN Store ’s video section on your PlayStation Portable .
It ’s rather slim pickings over in that store right now , though .
There are around 100 titles to choose from , though obviously Sony plans to expand your choices exponentially soon .
You can rent titles as well , which once purchased are valid for 72 hours .
The service has been available in the US since E3 , and apparently has yet to launch in the UK .

Since I 'd have to rent a tux , and she 's the only reason to show up , could she let me know ?
Or is this factual information also subject to debate ?
Here we go ...
“ The governor may be on the East Coast this weekend to attend state events and meetings .
If she is there , the governor may accept one of the standing invitations for dinner . ”
Jeez .
It 's not as if we 're asking for a medical record or something .

Owners of Amazon 's Kindle electronic book reader have received a nasty surprise , after discovering that copies of books by George Orwell had been deleted from their gadgets without their knowledge .
The books - downloaded from Amazon.com by American Kindle users - were remotely deleted after what the US company now says was a rights issue regarding the publisher , MobileReference.com .
" These books were added to our catalog using our self - service platform by a third - party who did not have the rights to the books , " spokesman Drew Herdener told the Guardian .
" When we were notified of this by the rights holder , we removed the illegal copies from our systems and from customers ' devices , and refunded customers . "
Amazon refunded the cost of the books , but told affected customers they could no longer read the books and that the titles were " no longer available for purchase " .
In an ironic twist , one of the titles in question was Orwell 's classic dystopian novel 1984 - the book that introduced the concept of Big Brother .
The story , considered a modern classic , has become synonymous with political spin and remote surveillance - and many Kindle owners could not help but see the juxtaposition as amusing .
" Sounds ironically like Big Brother is monitoring our Kindle content , " said one user .
Others were simply angered or annoyed by the sudden move , which they felt treated them unfairly simply for having bought the book in the first place .
" It 's like having Barnes & Noble sell you a book , charge your Visa and then 3 months later change their mind , credit your card and demand their book be returned , " said a disgruntled reader on the Amazon website .
" I was in the middle of reading the book on my Kindle , " said another .
Initially Amazon customer service representatives had said the book had been withdrawn at the request of the publisher - a move it said was " a rarity [ but ] publishers can decide to pull their content from the Kindle store " .
However Herdener said the company would be altering its policy so that it could block illegal copies , but not take back copies innocently downloaded by customers .
" We are changing our systems so that in the future we will not remove books from customers ' devices in these circumstances , " he said .
MobileReference did not respond to the Guardian 's request for comment .
It is not the first time that Amazon has removed titles that were produced in breach of copyright and sold illegally through its store .
Examples include pirated copies of Twilight books by Stephanie Meyer , Harry Potter books and the works of novelist Ayn Rand .
Although the work of Orwell - who died in 1950 - has entered the public domain in some countries , it is not yet free of copyright restrictions in the United States or Europe .
Although Amazon is believed to be in negotiations with a number of European mobile manufacturers to support the Kindle , the device has only gone in sale in the US .
This means that any copy produced for it would need to have been officially licensed by the Orwell Estate - which has been careful to protect its rights in the past .
Texting While Driving : Transportation Secretary Advocates Ban Ray LaHood says he'd prohibit practice " if it were up to me . "
Aug. 4 , 2009  --
If it were his decision , Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood would ensure that every text message and Blackberry e-mail you send from behind the wheel would be a crime .
" If it were up to me , I would ban drivers from texting immediately , " LaHood said today in a news conference on the dangerous combo of driving and texting .
But it 's not up to LaHood .
State legislatures are responsible for deciding whether to prohibit texting while driving , and thus far several states have done just that :
On Friday , New Hampshire and Oregon became the 15th and 16th states to prohibit the practice .
" Regardless of the law , texting and driving should not mix .
We need to restore some common sense to driving , " Barbara Harsha , the executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association , said in the July 31 statement announcing the state bans .
The New Hampshire and Oregon laws take effect in January of next year , with New Hampshire 's law also specifying that typing on a laptop or any other device is also illegal while driving .
In addition to state texting laws , five states and the District of Columbia have also decided that drivers can use cell phones in transit if , and only if , they use a hands - free device to carry on the conversation .
September Summit Will Focus on Texting While Driving
This morning LaHood announced a September summit to examine various options on how to remedy distracted driving .
Transportation officials , law enforcement and members of Congress will be among those who gather for the Transportation Department 's meeting on texting while driving .
" When we are done , I expect to have a list of concrete steps to announce , " LaHood said .
The summit plan comes as more and more information about the dangers of electronic distractions while driving spur lawmakers to take action .
A July 27 study from the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute focused on long - haul truck drivers , finding that drivers who text are 23 times more likely to crash than those who do n't .
And documents released earlier last month by Public Citizen and the Center for Auto Safety revealed that documents from the Transportation Department 's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration charged that the government has not been up front for six years about driving distractions caused by cell phones .
The death of a teen this summer who was texting while driving in LaHood 's hometown illustrates the problem , and several other accidents have impacted people around the country :
Last week , the distracted driver of a tow truck injured two people in Western New York while texting and chatting .
More than 60 people were injured in Boston on May 8 when two trolleys collided shortly after the a trolley operator sent a text message to his girlfriend .
In September 2008 , 25 commuters died and another 135 were hurt on a train in Southern California -- including the operator , who sent 29 text messages on the day of the crash .
Officials Hope For Concrete Steps to Curb Texting While Driving
Despite all the examples of inherent danger , some say even laws wo n't be enough to help people kick the habit .
" We want to figure out how to solve the problem of texting while behind the wheel beyond a simple ban , which often does n't work , " said Transportation Department spokeswoman Jill Zuchman .
" Our experience getting people to wear seatbelts or to stop driving while drunk has shown you need both law enforcement and you need education . "
Studies have also revealed other hazards related to cell phone use -- whether due to kids using a phone in the crosswalk or people talking while ambling down the street .
The government documents released July 21 suggest it does n't matter whether commuters are holding their cell phones in hand or not : Data shows chatting while driving slows reaction time -- a finding consumer groups now say the government never stressed at the expense of people 's lives .
Data from the government 's 2003 document also showed that there 's a 38 percent increase of accident risk for cell phone users .
It revealed that drivers made more the 200 million in - car calls each day at that time .
" What the government knew is that talking and driving is just as bad as drinking and driving , " Clarence Ditlow , executive director of the Center for Auto Safety , told ABC News July 21 .
" It does n't matter whether it 's handheld or hands - free , " he added .
" It 's the distraction of talking to someone else , the conversation itself that causes the inattention that leads to crashes , deaths , and injuries . "
At that time , Dr. Jeffrey Runge , NHTSA administrator when the studies were done , told ABC News that the previous administration was not trying to bury the data .
He said other priorities at the time took precedent , adding that officials did not mount a full force campaign to publicize the cell phone studies .
Meantime , the government did warn that using a cell phone while driving can be dangerous .
On its Web site , NHTSA states that , " The safest course of action is to refrain from using a cell phone while driving . "
ABC News ' Ann Compton , Lisa Stark and Matt Hosford contributed to this report .

Running business in Mandovi river since 1984 , the cruise boat operators have decided to introduce single window system for ticketing and also streamline the entertainment services offered on these boats .
State - run Goa Tourism Development Corporation ( GTDC ) has brought the operators under one banner in a bid to weed out touts who used to harass tourists .
GTDC chairman Nilesh Cabral told reporters today that from November 1 onwards , the cruise boats will do away with their ticket counters and operate from a single window .
The rush to attract tourists will also end in the process , he said .
There are 10 boats operating at Santa Monica jetty in Panaji and another jetty across Mandovi river at Brittona with a capacity to carry 1,600 tourists .
Cruise Boat Owners Association of Goa secretary Anil Madgavkar said boats will leave from the jetty at regular intervals , thus cutting out on competition .
The association has also decided to put a moratorium on the number of cruise boats , he said .
" No new cruise boats would be introduced .
The existing operators can replace their old boats , " he said .
Police use of Taser stun guns has increased by nearly a third , figures revealed today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Officers fired the electro - shock weapons 226 times in the first three months of this year - up from 174 in the last three months of 2008 .
The sharp rise followed the decision to allow forces in England and Wales to give Tasers to officers who do not carry traditional firearms .
Critics said the 50,000 - volt guns were in danger of becoming " standard issue " .
But Police Minister David Hanson said the weapons helped save lives by defusing dangerous situations .
He said : " I am determined to give police all the tools they need to crack down on violent crime .
" Tasers are a vital tool for our frontline officers and that is why we allowed forces to issue them to specially - trained units .
" They are making a real difference on our streets and helping to keep both the public and our police officers safe .
" Tasers have helped defuse dangerous situations where people could have been seriously injured or even killed .
" And often just the threat of the device is enough .
On many occasions , drawing or aiming a Taser has proved enough of a deterrent . "
But Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Tom Brake said : " Tasers should be for a few specially trained officers , not standard issue .
" The Government has put large numbers of Tasers in the hands of police officers without any debate .
" Given the increase in Taser use and the fact they have killed hundreds of people in the United States , we must have a full public debate before we slip any further down the slope to fully armed US - style policing . "

Is he gontna make a trebuchet
< linforcer > no
< PhoenixBourne >
You know date rape drugs ?
< linforcer >
Sure
< PhoenixBourne >
Right , rhyphonol is one of these .
It knocks you asleep after an hour or two .
< PhoenixBourne >
I should also mention , a side affect of rhyphonol is amnesia of events whilst under influence of the drug .

1 ) Prepare ingredients
2 ) Take rhyphonol
3 ) Bake cake
4 ) Fall asleep
5 ) ??????
6 ) Wake up
7 ) CAKE ?!
CAKE !
Where did this come from ?!

As part of launching our Perspectives on Feelings audio program , Shelly and I asked for your questions related to feelings , so we could get a discussion going around the topic .
You might have seen our video blogs the last few weeks .
I ’m giving the camera a rest and going back to the old familiar keyboard this week .
One of you asked , “ My son ’s a wiggler .
Sometimes I need to use force to put him in diapers , into a car seat , or other places .
What do you recommend ? ”
Here are some things to keep in mind :
As the parent , you are in charge .
As much as we try to create opportunities for autonomy , ultimately , you need to get the family from Point A to Point B .
Your child relies on knowing this , and even if they fight you , they get a sense of comfort from you knowing that you ’re in charge — this is probably even part of why it seems they ’re testing you — to find out if they ’re really in a stable container .
There are many ways to be in charge .
What happens before , during and after you exert force to make something happen , makes all the difference in how your child experiences it , and how your connection is impacted .
Before :
If you can think of it and remember to do so , giving your child two or three heads - ups before something happens will help them shift internally to prepare for it , so it ’s not as much of a surprise .
For example , “ In five minutes , we ’re going to get in the car to go to Grandpa ’s , and I ’m going to need to put you in the carseat . ”
If you encounter resistance when it ’s time to make the transition , here ’s one trick that even works with my especially willful child :
“ Do you want to go now , or in two minutes ? ”
( They ’ll probably answer “ in two minutes ! ” )
“ Okay , we agree–yay !
I ’ll be back in two minutes to collect you ”
This gives them a measure of autonomy .
Remember , when they fight you , it ’s not you they ’re fighting — they ’re fighting for their sense of autonomy , and to test the boundaries .
It ’s through this back - and - forth that they develop a feeling for who they are , and a sense of self - confidence .
The more you can weave contained opportunities for autonomy into your everyday activities , the more cooperation you ’ll get , because your child will pick up on your respect of him , and respond accordingly .
Okay , but what about when they ’re all out , full - on fighting you ?
And you need to get out the door ?
Here are some more ideas :
During :
Here ’s how to make the most of a situation where you need to exercise your will over theirs :
1 ) Give the heads - ups , as above .
2 ) Say what you need , what exactly what you ’re going to do , and offer one last out : “ I really need to get out the door because … I ’m going to give you until three to come with me , then I ’m going to pick you up and take you .
3 ) DO IT LOVINGLY !!!
This is the most important .
I understand you might feel frustrated and powerless — I often do !
And we ’ll address expressing your own big feelings to your kids soon .
There are times when you might need to sound authoritative to get a response — just try to remember the love if you can .
4 ) As you begin to interact , however , pay attention to your tone .
There ’s a huge difference between , Get in this car or I ’ll haul you away with a crane !
And Okay , sweetie , here we go , up , up and away , my little airplane !
With the latter , you might even get a giggle .
After
Once you ’ve decided on a course of action and enforced it , your child may have a lot of feelings : frustration , fear , anger , relief .
If you can at least acknowledge and reflect back those feelings , you ’ll add to the trust and connection between you .
Here ’s the secret :
You can listen to your child ’s feelings without giving in .
Conversely , you can be in charge and set the limits you feel comfortable setting , and still lovingly allow your child to have their feelings about how things are .
Let us know how it goes !
Warmly ,
Jill

Federal officials remain vulnerable in the state of Michoacan Ten Mexican police officers have been detained in connection with the torture and murder of 12 federal agents during a major escalation in the drug war .
The arrests come as more than 5,000 troops and federal police are deployed in the western state of Michoacan .
The troop surge , one of the biggest in the anti-drugs campaign , comes after a local drug gang launched co-ordinated attacks in 10 cities last week .
The state governor has protested against the " military occupation " .
The federal authorities say they are investigating links between the municipal police and drug traffickers in the murder of the agents , whose bodies were found bound and gagged and shot through the head next to a major highway .
In a statement , prosecutors said the detentions would enable them to strengthen evidence that the officers " undertook criminal acts " in support of the Michoacan drugs gang and to " determine their responsibility for the murder of federal agents " .
Earlier this year 10 mayors in the state were arrested by the federal authorities on suspicion they were working with the drug gangs .
Cocaine transit Troops with automatic weapons and ski masks to shield their identity have set up roadblocks across Michoacan , President Felipe Calderon 's home state , in a major show of force .
Nineteen police were arrested in one small town , 10 of whom are still being held in custody while alleged links with drug gangs are investigated .
The federal government believes that local police and officials have long been in the pay of the drug gangs .
The Michoacan gang , known as the " Family " , announced itself as a terrifying new force three years ago when its hitmen tossed the severed heads of five victims onto a dancefloor in a city nightclub .
Despite the roadblocks , analysts say federal agents remain highly vulnerable in a region where drug gangs can easily get intelligence about their movements .

Issues with latency and dropped packets can kill a network 's performance and cripple applications like real - time communications , scientific computing , and high - frequency trading .
But the problems can be extremely difficult to diagnose , as they may not appear under test conditions , and real - time monitoring of performance can require dedicated hardware or procedures that actually cut into the usable bandwidth .
A team of academic researchers have come up with what they think is a solution , one that could sample the transmission of a collection of representative packets in real time , in a manner that 's inexpensive in terms of both hardware and networking resources .
The researchers , who were supported by grants from both the National Science Foundation and Cisco , presented their work at the SIGCOMM meeting on Thursday ; they 've placed a paper describing it online as well .
The paper describes how the system — which they term a Lossy Difference Aggregator — would operate in principle , describe some simulations of its performance , and suggest how it might be implemented .
Unfortunately , it appears that it would require an extension to an IEEE standard that 's only been adopted recently , as well as dedicated processing hardware .
Doing real - time monitoring , if you ignore implementation details , is simple : simply assign each network packet a timestamp when it leaves a piece of hardware , and then compare that to the time at which it 's received .
The challenge is communicating these timestamps between the hardware .
Each has to be matched with a specific packet , which can be computationally intensive , and the two pieces of hardware have to transfer the data in order to make time comparisons .
It 's possible to cut down on the work by choosing a representative sample of packets for a given time period , but coordinating the choice of packets across hardware can be a challenge .
The Lossy Difference Aggregator , as the " lossy " part of its name implies , is a way of selecting a representative subset of packets to track .
Basically , as each one comes into the router , it 's assigned a hash value .
That value is then used to assign it a position in a data structure that has an arbitrary number of columns , termed " banks , " and slots within each column .
( Normally , I 'd consider this structure a matrix , but the word does n't appear at all in the paper . )
Each entry contains the packet 's hash value and a timestamp .
So , for example , a structure limited to 1024 entries could contain a single bank with 1024 entries , or four banks with 256 entries each .
The hash value is used to place the packet in a specific location in the structure .
So , in the authors ' example , a hash with three leading zeros might assign it to bank 1 , while seven leading zeros would place it in bank 2 .
A separate function can be used to assign it a row within the bank .
Anything that does n't find a place in this structure is discarded .
After a set sampling time , the sending hardware transmits this structure to the equipment that should be receiving it , which has been building a similar structure out of the same packets .
At this point , the actual performance data should be simple : lost packets can be identified as unfilled slots , and the time stamps can be used to calculate various latency figures .
Because it 's so simple , the authors calculate that implementing it would require adding only an additional one percent to the transistor count of even the low - end ASICs currently in use .
The data structure itself would require only 72 K bits of control traffic a second .
Mathematically , the authors demonstrate that the system would provide a statistically accurate measure of both the latency and its standard deviation .
They also created a simulator , which they used to demonstrate its accuracy .
Even under really bad conditions , like a 20 percent packet loss rate , its estimates of latency would be off by only four percent — and really , if you 're losing 20 percent of your packets , latency 's probably the least of your concerns .
Comparisons with a method of actively monitoring network performance showed that the Lossy Difference Aggregator provided more accurate latency measures .
Of course , network hardware will need to recognize this traffic as distinct from the packets it 's supposed to be routing .
The authors suggest adding an extension to the IEEE 1588 standard , which is used for synchronizing the clocks of network equipment .
Since accurate comparisons of time stamps require clock synchronization anyway , this seems like a reasonable suggestion .
The remaining challenge involves actually putting an implementation into hardware .
The authors , perhaps due to their interactions with their sponsors at Cisco , seem especially attuned to the realities of the networking hardware world .
The power of embedded processors , they suggest , is starting to commoditize the networking hardware market in the same way that the power of desktop processors has transformed the PC market .
The specialized real - term monitoring hardware could represent a value - added proposition for vendors .
Its first likely customers — high frequency traders and high performance computing centers — are also among the least price - sensitive .
The authors also point out that the data generated by their method can provide value well before it 's fully deployed .
Putting this hardware on either side of major network bottlenecks could be extremely useful , and it might be possible to arrange the protocol so that it operates across hardware that 's separated by a number of intervening devices .
As the intervening hardware is replaced , the data returned will simply become finer - grained .

The nuclear envelope is the double membrane that surrounds the nucleus and separates the genetic material and nucleoplasm from the cytosol in eukaryotic cells .
It is composed of the inner and outer nuclear membranes ( each consisting of a lipid bilayer ) , nuclear pore complexes , and the nuclear lamina .
The nuclear envelope is also known to have some associations with chromatid .
The space between the inner and outer nuclear membranes is called the perinuclear space ( Mounkes et al. , 2003 ) .
The outer membrane is covered in ribosomes and is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum .
The inner membrane is associated with the nuclear lamina ( Wehnert and Bonne , 2002 ) .
The major components of the nuclear lamina , the nuclear lamins , are Type V intermediate filaments ( Mounkes et al. , 2003 ) .
Lamins are evolutionarily conserved nuclear - specific intermediate filaments that support many nuclear functions that include maintaining nuclear shape , DNA replication , regulation of gene expression , transcription elongation by RNA Polymerase II , nuclear positioning , segregation of chromosomes , meiosis , and apoptosis ( Wiesel et al. , 2008 ) .
In metazoan cells there are four major lamin proteins encoded by three genes .
The A - type lamins ( lamins A and C ) are different splice variants of the same gene , LMNA .
The B - type lamins ( lamins B1 and B2 ) are the products of two separate genes , LMNB1 and LMNB2 respectively ( Meshorer and Gruenbaum , 2008 ) .
All B - type lamins and lamin A ( not lamin C ) are synthesized with a conserved CaaX ( Cysteine – aliphatic amino acid – aliphatic amino acid ‑ any amino acid ) motif in their carboxyl tails that is subject to post - translational modifications ( Liu and Zhou , 2008 ) .
The maturation of the prelamin begins with the farnesylation of the cysteine in the CaaX motif by a farnesyl transferase .
Next , the last three residues on the carboxyl tail ( aaX ) are cleaved off by either Ras- converting enzyme ( Rce1 ) or Zinc metalloproteases related to Ste24 p ( Zmpste24 ) .
As a result , the cysteine undergoes methylation by the isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase .
Prelamin
A then undergoes a final processing step in which the 15 amino acids of the carboxyl tail , including the farnesyl group , are cleaved off by Zmpste24 ( Fig. 1 ; Meshorer and Gruenbaum , 2008 ) .
The second cleavage of 15 amino acids at the carboxyl tail of prelamin A results in the removal of the farnesyl residue and subsequent dissociation of mature lamin A from the nuclear membrane ( Mattioli et al. , 2008 ) .
B‑type lamin , however , does not go through a second cleavage by Zmpste24 leaving B - type lamin constitutively farnesylated and associated with the nuclear membrane .
A - type and B - type lamins also differ based on the types of cells tin which they are expressed .
All cell types express at least one of the B - type lamins , whereas some cells simply do not express , or express at significantly lower levels , the A - type lamins ( e.g. cells of the early embryo , embryonic stem cells , stem cells in the immune and haematopoietic systems , and cells in the neuroendocrine system ) .
The birth of mice with null mutations in their LMNA genes which were phenotypically indistinguishable from their wild type siblings during their first two weeks of postnatal development supported the hypothesis that A - type lamins are not essential to the overall development process ( Mounkes et al. , 2003 ) .
However , mutations in the human LMNA gene are the cause of at least 11 different heritable diseases that are commonly known as laminopathies ( Wiesel et al. , 2008 ) .
The Laminopathies
One of the laminopathies that has drawn a great deal of attention from researchers is Hutchison ‑Gilford progeria syndrome ( HGPS ) .
Hutchison - Gilford progeria syndrome is a disease in which the physical aspects of aging are accelerated ( Fig. 2 ; Scaffidi et al. , 2005 ) .
Most of the patients who suffer from Hutchison - Gilford progeria syndrome have a point mutation in the LMNA gene .
This mutation results in the translation of a lamin A lacking 50 amino acids , including the second cleavage site in prelamin A. ( Figure 1 ; Meshorer and Gruenbaum , 2008 ) .
The mutant protein ( Called LAD50 ) is therefore constitutively farnesylated and incorporates abnormally into the nuclear lamina .
This grouping of LAD50 proteins leads to mechanical defects , thickening of the lamina , loss of peripheral heterochromatin , and increased DNA damage , among other things .
If farnesyl transferase inhibitors are administered , the cellular phenotypes can be treated .
Also , mutations in the protein that performs the second cleavage ( Zmpste 24 ) lead to similar cellular phenotypes .
This gives evidence for the hypothesis that the permanent farnesylation of the LAD50 protein is what leads to the diseases associated with this lamin A mutant .
( Meshorer and Gruenbaum , 2008 ) .
Unlike the pluripotent and rapidly growing embryonic stem cells , that do not express A - type lamins , somatic ( adult ) stem cells are tissue specific and highly dependent on their niche , from which they receive signals that influence the stem cells ’ fates .
The signaling mechanisms that are used by the different stem cell niches converge on four main pathways ( Notch , Wnt , TGF β , and Sonic hedgehog ; Meshorer and Gruenbaum , 2008 ) .
The Notch signaling pathway is a major regulator of stem cell fate that has been implicated in premature aging .
To study the molecular mechanisms that make the LAD50 mutant produce progeroid phenotypes , two separate stable cell lines , one with the LAD50 protein and the other with the wild type protein , were created and the gene expression of the two cell lines was compared .
In the cells expressing LAD50 , downstream signaling via the Notch pathway was induced by the Notch co‑activator Ski‑interacting protein which loses its grip due to the progerinated lamina produced by the LAD50 proteins .
Because Notch is a major regulator of stem cell fate , and because they are the main tissue group that is affected by progeria , the mesenchymal stem cells were chosen to be studied in this experiment .
In addition to activation of the Notch pathway , the mesenchymal cells responded to the mutant LAD50 protein by displaying sporadic , undirected differentiation along all three germ layers .
This result shows the involvement of mesenchymal stem cell regulation in the pathology of Hutchison - Gilford progeria syndrome through the downstream activation of Notch signaling ( Meshorer and Gruenbaum , 2008 ) .
Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( EDMD ) is another laminopathy which is usually inherited as either an X‑linked form of muscular dystrophy or an autosomal - dominant form .
However , rare cases of autosomal recessive transmission have been reported ( Wehnert and Bonne , 2002 ) .
Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is generally characterized by three symptoms which include early onset contractures ( chronic loss of joint motion typically in elbows or achilles tendon ) , very slow progressive muscle weakness and degeneration involving the upper arms and lower legs , and cardiac disease in adult life ( Wehnert and Bonne , 2002 ) .
It is caused by mutations in the STA gene which encodes emerin .
Mutations in the STA gene almost always lead to the displacement of emerin from the nuclear envelope .
( Mounkes et al. , 2003 ) .
Emerin is anchored to the inner nuclear membrane by its carboxy - terminal tail , the remainder of the molecule resides in the nucleoplasm .
It has several serine protein kinase sites and seems to have a role in the organization of the nuclear membrane during cell division ( Fig. 3 ; Wehnert and Bonne , 2002 ) .
Emerin is known to interact with nuclear lamins and many of the lamin associated proteins including Barrier - to - autointegration factor ( BAF ) and Btf , a death promoting transcriptional repressor .
The exact consequences of a loss of emerin from the nuclear envelope on the activities of these emerin - binding proteins remains to be established but it is clear that a lack of emerin due to a mutation in the STA gene is the cause of Emery ‑Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( Mounkes et al. , 2003 ) .
Disease Causing Mechanisms
It has been sufficiently demonstrated in the above examples that mutations in nuclear lamin can lead to a diverse array of diseases .
These laminopathies are a group of heritable diseases that are the product of mutations in genes that code for A‑type lamin and lamina - associated proteins .
They include Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy , Pelger - Huet anomaly , Limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B , dilated cardiomyopathy , Dunnigan ’s familial partial lipodystrophy , mandibuloacral dysplaysia , Hutchison ‑Gilford progeria syndrome , and more ( Mounkes et al. , 2003 ) .
The laminopathies show a wide variety of inheritance patterns and mechanisms of causing laminopathies .
Some of the diseases resulting from mutations in laminal genes are tissue specific while others are harmful to multiple tissue types , all leading to the question :
Why is it that mutations affecting the nuclear lamina give rise to such a diverse group of diseases ?
( Worman and Courvalin , 2004 ) .
One hypothesis for the disease causing mechanism of these mutations involves defects in lamin synthesis caused by mutations in genes encoding the lamins .
Although in metazoan cells B - type lamins are the products of two separate genes , in Caenorhabditis elegans B - type lamins are the product of a single gene .
Most biological roles of mammalian lamins are evolutionarily conserved in C. elegans .
In addition , the single C. elegans lamin probably functions both as A - type and B - type lamin .
Recently , it has been shown that the B - type C. elegans lamin ( Ce- lamin ) is able to form stable intermediate filaments in vitro .
Therefore , by inserting mutations into conserved residues in Ce- lamin that cause diseases when mutated in human lamin A , it can be investigated how mutations in specific residues of Ce- lamin corresponding to laminopathic disease causing mutations in the human LMNA gene affect filament and paracrystal assembly in vitro and lamin organization and dynamics in vivo .
The assembly of the filaments and paracrystals can be seen using negative staining electron microscopy techniques .
Fourteen laminopathic disease causing mutations were studied in this way ; of the fourteen studied , only six of them showed evidence of disruption to the assembly of Ce-lamin filaments or paracrystals .
This finding suggests that although defects in filament assembly may be one of the mechanisms that leads to laminopathies , it cannot be the only mechanism involved in causing these diseases ( Wiesel et al. , 2008 ) .
The “ mechanical stress ” hypothesis of laminopathic disease diversity states that abnormalities in nuclear structure that are caused by mutations in lamin encoding genes can make the cell more susceptible to cellular damage that is caused by physical stress ( Worman and Courvalin , 2004 ) .
Mutated cells under such conditions of stress show a significant redistribution of the proteins that are associated with the nuclear envelope and an increased fragility of the nucleus .
In effect , cells that undergo large amounts of mechanical stress begin to function improperly .
It would follow from the same line of reasoning , however , that the mechanical stress model is less likely to account for the defects in white adipose tissues that are associated with the diseases mandibuloacral dysplasia and Dunnigan ’s familial partial lipodystrophy because of the lack of mechanical stress that is placed on these tissues on a consistant basis ( Mounkes et al. , 2003 ) .
Therefore , there must be yet another mechanism for the causal agent of these laminopathies .
The “ gene expression ” hypothesis on the diversity of laminopathic diseases suggests that LMNA mutations may affect the structure and function of the nucleus which can in turn have an effect on gene expression ( Worman and Courvalin , 2004 ) .
A class of proteins known as the Nespirins localize to the nuclear envelope and interact with emirin and A - type lamins .
These Nespirins appear to be integral to anchoring the nucleus to the interphase cytoskeleton .
Such an interaction may be important to the correct transmission of mechanically induced signaling from the cell surface to the nucleus that could be potentially disrupted at many levels , including at the level of a nuclear envelope that is functioning improperly because of mutations in genes encoding laminal proteins ( Mounkes et al. , 2003 ) .
Although there is not a common molecular mechanism for disease causing that unites all of the laminopathies , the models that we have thus far discovered and suggested are nonexclusive to each other , giving us room for models that can be used together to help find treatments for laminopathic diseases .
Even without a single common mechanism of action among the laminopathies , many scientists are coming up with ideas on how to treat cells with LMNA mutations and people who suffer from crippling laminopathies .
As was illustrated above , prelamin A processing is altered in some LMNA ‑linked diseases , including Hutchison ‑Gilford progeria syndrome , which leads to permanent farnesylation of the mutated lamin A protein .
Permanently farnesylated lamin A is toxic to the cell and leads to cell dysfunction and diseased phenotypes ( Meshorer and Gruenbaum , 2008 ) .
Accumulation of prelamin
A in laminopathic cells causes severe heterochromatin defects , but chromatin organization and function can be recovered by treatment with mevinolin , an inhibitor of the hydromethyl–glutaryl - synthase which is indirectly impairing prelamin A farnesylation , in combination with the inhibitor of histone deacethylases trichostatin A ( Mattioli et al. , 2008 ) .
The cellular phenotypes of LMNA mutations can also be reversed through the use of farnesyl transferase inhibitors preventing the permanent farnesylation of the mutated lamin A .
This again showcases the toxicity of the constitutively farnesylated LAD50 mutant ( Meshorer and Gruenbaum , 2008 ) .
In Conclusion
Whith all of the papers written about the nuclear envelope in general and the nuclear lamina and laminopathies it seems as though we have a grasp of much of the information dealing with mutations in laminal genes and laminopathies caused by them .
But , the nuclear lamina is a complicated network that likely plays a role in DNA replication , chromatin organization , spatial arrangement of nuclear pore complexes , nuclear growth , mechanical stabilization of the nucleus , anchorage of the nuclear envelope proteins ( Wehnert and Bonne , 2002 ) , and many other things .
There is such a plethora of protein - protein interactions , protein - nucleic acid interactions , protein‑enzyme interactions , activator and supressor relationships to genes that can possibly get mutated and produce proteins that interact inderictly with almost every other organelle in the cell that finding the exact purpose and reason for every protein interaction or the molecular mechanism of disease causing for all the laminopathies will take a long time to come .
But , as long as people are suffering from degenerative laminopathic diseases , and as long as scientist continue to search for the answers to life ’s questions and people ’s problems , we will be making new discoveries about the cell , the nucleus , the nuclear envelope , the lamina , laminopathies for years to come .

Figure 3 . Schematic view of the nuclear envelope .
The nuclear envelope is composed of two lipid bilayer membranes , the nuclear pore complexes and the nuclear lamina .
The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum .
The inner nuclear membrane is separated from the outer nuclear membrane by the perinuclear space , except at the nuclear pore complexes , where the outer and the inner nuclear membrane are connected .
Underlying the inner membrane is the fibrous nuclear lamina .
It is composed of two types of lamin proteins : A - type lamins ( lamins A/C ) and B - type lamins ( B1 and B2 ) .
They interact with chromatin , BAF , and HP1 as well as with other proteins of the inner nuclear membrane as lamin B receptor LBR ) , lamina - associated proteins ( LAPs ) , emerin , MAN1 , and nurim .

The last living British World War I veteran , Harry Patch , died on July 25 , 2009 , at the ripe old age of 111 .
An unlikely tribute has been paid to Patch by Radiohead , who are offering a download of their song , “ Harry Patch ( In Memory Of ) , ” for a small fee in their official online store .
Thom Yorke was inspired to write the song after hearing an interview with Patch on the radio four years ago , and it was recorded during sessions for a new Radiohead album with regular producer Nigel Godrich .
A brief 30 - second clip of the string - laden track is available here .
All proceeds from the song go to the British Legion .
Audio on YouTube :
The lyrics for “ Harry Patch ( In Memory Of ) ” are available at Dead Air Space , and Yorke has issued the following statement about the song :

Vor einiger Zeit schrieb Bundesfamilienministerin von der Leyen an Spreeblick , andere Websperren als die kinderpornografischer Angebote seien derzeit nicht geplant .
Spreeblick kommentierte das mit einem einzigen Wort :
Derzeit .
Wie zutreffend diese Einschätzung war , zeigte sich schon kurz nach Verabschiedung des Zugangserschwerungsgesetzes .
Hinterbänkler forderten reflexartig und ohne jede Schamfrist , auch andere Seiten , zum Beispiel solche mit politischer Propaganda , zu sperren .
Auch das Stichwort Urheberrecht fiel .
Doch es gab die stille Hoffnung , dass es zumindest den Verantwortlichen klar sein würde , wie sehr sie schon mit der bloßen Einführung einer Zensurinfrastruktur das Grundgesetz und das darauf basierende Empfinden vieler Menschen strapazieren .
Und zwar gerade jener , die auf dem Boden des Grundgesetzes stehen .
Doch offensichtlich setzt sich in Politikerkreisen die Auffassung durch , dass der stimmberechtigte Deutsche in der Masse nicht viel von seinem Grundgesetz hält .
Und dass eine deutlich größere Gruppe als der Stammtisch es gut finden wird , wenn der Staat den Robocop im Internet gibt , dort mit eisernem Besen säubert – und die Meinungsfreiheit als Sondermüll entsorgt .
Denn nun spricht auch die , zumindest nach außen , treibende Kraft hinter den Internetsperren Klartext .
Dem Hamburger Abendblatt stand Familienministerin Ursula von der Leyen Rede und Antwort :
abendblatt.de : Sie argumentieren , Grundregeln unserer Gesellschaft müssten online wie offline gelten .
Warum sperren
Sie dann nicht auch Internetseiten , die Nazipropaganda verbreiten oder Gewalt gegen Frauen verherrlichen ?
Von der Leyen :
Mir geht es jetzt um den Kampf gegen die ungehinderte Verbreitung von Bildern vergewaltigter Kinder .
Der Straftatbestand Kinderpornografie ist klar abgrenzbar .
Doch wir werden weiter Diskussionen führen , wie wir Meinungsfreiheit , Demokratie und Menschenwürde im Internet im richtigen Maß erhalten .
Sonst droht das großartige Internet ein rechtsfreier Chaosraum zu werden , in dem man hemmungslos mobben , beleidigen und betrügen kann .
Wo die Würde eines anderen verletzt wird , endet die eigene Freiheit .
Welche Schritte für den Schutz dieser Grenzen notwendig sind , ist Teil einer unverzichtbaren Debatte , um die die Gesellschaft nicht herumkommt .
Mobben , beleidigen , betrügen .
All das kann man im Internet tun .
Genau so , wie man es im wirklichen Leben tun kann , zum Beispiel Angesicht zu Angesicht , per Brief , Fax oder Telefon .
Aber egal , wie man es macht – es ist strafbar und wird verfolgt .
Auch im Internet .
Ich erlebe es als Strafverteidiger Tag für Tag , wie die Polizei akribisch jeder Anzeige wegen Verletzung der persönlichen Ehre nachgeht .
Neulich hatte ich den Fall , in dem jemand das Nacktfoto einer Frau im Gästebuch deren ehemaliger Schule gepostet hat .
Die Polizei ermittelte aufwendig und überführte einen Ex -Freund als Täter .
Das Internet als rechtsfreier Raum ?
Vielleicht hat der
Täter dies zunächst so gesehen wie Frau von der Leyen – nach der Hausdurchsuchung dürfte sich sein Bild gewandelt haben .
Ein anderer , nicht ausgedachter Fall : Der geschmähte Liebhaber malt mit einer Schablone eine obszönen
Text auf die Straße , die am Arbeitsplatz der Verehrten vorüber führt .
Die Polizei ermittelt , durchsucht , findet unter anderem nicht nur die passende Farbe , sondern auch die Schablone .
Der Täter wird verurteilt .
Noch heute , Monate später , ist der derbe Spruch übrigens auf der Straße zu lesen .
Ist die Fahrbahn jetzt auch ein rechtsfreier Raum ?
Hätte sie gesperrt werden müssen , damit der unbescholtene Bürger und die Betroffene an diesem schrecklichen Anblick keinen seelischen Schaden nehmen ?
An den Beispielen sieht man , wie unredlich von der Leyens Stammtischargumente sind .
Sie nennt kriminelles Handeln , welches bereits heute unter Strafe steht und verfolgt wird .
Dann bringt sie die Menschenwürde ins Spiel und postuliert einen Handlungsauftrag des Staates , der weit über die Verhütung und Verfolgung von Straftaten hinausgeht .
Eine zugkräftige , gleichwohl aber billige Argumentation , und zwar in mehrfacher Hinsicht :
Die Menschwürde zählt , vereinfacht gesagt , zu den Grundrechten .
Sie ist ein Abwehrrecht gegen Eingriffe des Staates .
Niemand darf von staatlichen Organen zu einem bloßen Objekt staatlichen Handelns gemacht und seines Selbst beraubt werden ; sein Leben ist nicht gegen das Leben anderer abwägbar ( ausführliche Beschreibung : Wikipedia ) .
Frau von der Leyen münzt das Abwehrrecht gegen den Staat in einen Handlungsauftrag des Staates um .
Plötzlich ist die Menschenwürde ein Grund für staatliches Eingreifen – der Staat schützt die Menschenwürde seiner Bürger , indem er Dritten den Mund zuhält oder durch Stoppschilder dafür sorgt , dass sie im Internet nicht mehr gelesen , gesehen und gehört werden können .
Das entfernt sich weit vom eigentlichen Sinn und Zweck des Grundrechts auf Menschenwürde .
Wie absurd das Ganze ist , zeigt sich an von der Leyens Aussage , die Bewahrung der Menschenwürde begrenze Demokratie und Meinungsfreiheit auf das „ richtige Maß “ .
So werden aus rechtsstaatlichen Grundelementen , die sich bedingen und ergänzen , Gegensätze .
Die böse Absicht darf mittlerweile unterstellt werden .
Die Familienministerin interpretiert also die Menschenwürde um .
Von einer Pflicht , welche die äußersten Grenzen staatlichen Handelns umreißt , zum „ großen Reinigungsauftrag “ an den Staat .
Das mag fürsorglich gemeint sein .
Zu viel staatliche Fürsorge in Form der Beschneidung von Grundrechten hat jedoch bisher weder die Demokratie noch die Freiheit gefördert .
Man muss ja nicht die Weimarer Republik bemühen .
Das sicherlich ehrlich gemeinte Bonmot des Protagonisten eines vom Selbstverständnis her ebenso fürsorglichen Staates genügt ebenso .
Was hatte der Betreffende noch gleich gesagt ?
„ Ich liebe euch doch alle . “
Abgesehen vom offenkundig verfehlten Anwendungsgebiet ist die Menschenwürde kein Allzweckmittel wie ein Schweizer Taschenmesser .
Sie zeigt , wie dargelegt , die äußersten Grenzen staatlichen Handelns auf .
Die Menschenwürde taugt aber nicht als Regulativ der Freiheit .
Ich fahre jemanden auf der Straße an und verletze ihn schwer .
Das Opfer wird sein Leben behindert sein , also grausame Folgen erleiden .
Ich habe dann zwar eine fahrlässige Körperverletzung begangen ( und werde dafür bestraft ) , aber ich habe die Menschenwürde des Unfallopfers nicht angegriffen .
Eine Beleidigung ist auch nur ein Angriff auf die persönliche Ehre , aber kein Angriff auf die Menschenwürde .
Selbst extreme politische Propaganda , so sehr sie auch schmerzen und empören mag , ist in den allermeisten Fällen eben nur politische Propaganda .
Und falls nicht , haben wir dafür taugliche ( Sonder - ) Gesetze .
Sie finden sich im Strafgesetzbuch , nicht im Grundgesetz ; Gewaltverherrlichung und Volksverhetzung sind dort seit jeher unter Strafe gestellt .
Vorhin habe ich beschrieben , wie eifrig und akkurat unsere Polizei jede begründete Strafanzeige ausermittelt , sei es nun ein Gartenzaundelikt oder ein ebay - Betrug mit einem Schaden von 21,50 Euro .
Deshalb will ich erwähnen , dass gerade bei Gewaltverherrlichung und Volksverhetzung nach meiner Erfahrung ebenfalls kein rechtsfreier Raum existiert .
Neulich musste ich einem Blogger helfen , weil er auf seiner Seite einen Ausschnitt aus einem Splatterfilm gepostet hat .
Weder Polizei noch Staatsanwaltschaft wollten zur Kenntnis nehmen , dass es sich hier nicht um reine Gewaltverherrlichung im Sinne des Gesetzes handelte , sondern um die Abschlussarbeit eines kanadischen Filmstudenten .
Dessen Streifen konnte man – nach dreimaligem Würgen – durchaus künstlerische Aspekte und insbesondere eine gesellschaftspolitische Aussage abgewinnen .
Das Verfahren endete glimpflich , aber der anfänglich arglose Mandant fragt sich noch heute , in was für eine erkenntnisresistente Maschinierie er da hineingeraten ist .
Und was passiert wäre , wenn nicht zumindest die Richterin Augenmaß bewiesen hätte .
So entschieden und rustikal , die Hausdurchsuchung war natürlich inbegriffen , im beschriebenen Fall vorgegangen wurde , so wird auch wegen Volksverhetzung im Internet ermittelt .
Strafanzeige genügt , und die Maschinerie rollt .
Allerdings kommt es dann halt auch vor , dass eben nicht alles , was ein ( zufälliger ) Leser und ein Polizeibeamter für Volksverhetzung oder verbotene Propaganda jedweder Couleur halten , auch solche ist .
Mit der Folge , dass sich geschmacklose , unbequeme und für einzelne sicher auch schmerzhafte Inhalte nicht bestrafen und abschalten lassen .
Ich habe das Gefühl , von der Leyens Wunsch nach Sauberkeit zielt auf diese Inhalte .
Was mit dem Strafgesetzbuch nicht greifbar ist , aber trotzdem das Volksempfinden , repräsentiert durch Polizeikommissar Hinz und Staatsanwalt Kunz , stört , soll raus aus dem Internet .
Oder jedenfalls nicht mehr sichtbar sein .
Wenn man aber nur noch eine Meinungsfreiheit zulassen will , die geschmacklose , unbequeme und für einzelne schmerzhafte Inhalte nicht umfasst , sollte man fairerweise nicht mehr von Meinungsfreiheit sprechen .
Von Demokratie vielleicht auch nicht mehr .
Frau von der Leyen mag uns alle lieben .
Dieses Gefühl beruht aber langsam nicht mehr auf Gegenseitigkeit .
( CNN ) -- Barely an hour 's drive from the casinos of Las Vegas , a group of unassuming buildings have become as important as the trenches were to WWI .
The big difference ?
Today 's warriors are fighting without getting in harm 's way , using drones to attack targets in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Remote - controlled drones , such as the Predator , are proving increasingly popular with the U.S. military .
U.S. Air Force fighter pilot Major Morgan Andrews is one such combatant .
He kisses his wife goodbye , drives to Creech , a tiny desert air force base in Nevada , and within minutes could be killing insurgents on the other side of the world .
Andrews fights not from the seat of the F16 he joined the air force to fly but from a darkened ground control station .
He pilots a remote - controlled Predator , a UAV ( unmanned aerial vehicle ) which can spy on and attack positions and personnel without risk to its controller , shooting deadly Hellfire missiles at enemy fighters in support of fellow soldiers .
" You 're talking to them on the radios as if we were in a normal airplane flying overhead , " says Andrews .
" You see the imagery , you know what 's going on , you see what you 're looking at .
It 's very easy when something like that is happening to project yourself there and feel a part of the battle .
Like I said , your heart starts racing a little bit . "
Is remote - controlled warfare a good or a bad idea ?
Tell us what you think .
Meanwhile , intelligence analysts get to see images in real time and can identify personnel on the ground .
There are now more than 7,000 UAVs ranging from the workhorse , the Predator , and its beefier , deadlier kin the Reaper , to army drones like the tiny hand - launched Raven and the larger Shadow .
The drones are dramatically tilting the war in favor of the United States .
Predators , for example , played a key role in killing al Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al Zarqawi in 2006 .
UAVs are credited with killing more than half al Qaeda 's top 20 leaders .
World 's Untold Stories : Warfare by Remote For this month 's World 's Untold Stories Nic Robertson takes us inside the revolutionary world of robotic warfare and UAVs , better known as drones .
Thurs July 23 : 0430 ET , 1300 ET / Sat July 25 : 0430 ET , see full schedule »
Now U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates wants more UAVs .
Already he has said that the next generation of fighter planes -- the F - 35 that took decades to develop at a cost of more than half - a- billion dollars each -- will be the last manned fighter aircraft .
Lt. Gen. David Deptula , USAF , explains that the next phase will enable a single drone to provide as many as 60 simultaneous live video feeds directly to combat troops .
Some new drones will be as small as flies , others walk -- all appear destined to work with decreasing human input .
" The future of how you use these un-manned systems or remotely piloted systems is really unlimited , " says Deptula , based at the Pentagon and racing to keep pace with battlefield needs as well as Gates 's demands .
" We need to open our minds and think more about capability and impact we are going to achieve as opposed to how we 've done business in the past . "
Watch how UAVs are changing the face of warfare »
At Creech , frontline requests surged when weapons were first put on the Predator .
In Iraq and Afghanistan drones have become so indispensable that missions are cancelled if they are not available
Robotic warfare expert Peter Singer , who advised President Barack Obama 's campaign team and has authored " Wired for War , " says that remote warfare is changing mankind 's monopoly on how conflict is fought for the first time in 5,000 years .
All that limits its advance is its application , not the technology .
" The barriers of war in our society are already lowering , " he says .
" This tech may allow them to lower to the ground .
And we might already be seeing this in the strikes being carried out on Pakistan . "
He points out that raw numbers over the last year show the same number of strikes as the opening of the Kosovo war .
" But we did n't debate about it in Congress , we do n't talk about it daily in our media . "
Pakistani officials say drones are killing al Qaeda leaders who thought they were beyond U.S. reach .
But even the U.S. government admits civilians are dying in those attacks too .
Singer fears the use of drones is misunderstood as cowardice , undermining the effectiveness of attacks and ultimately losing the war UAVs are fighting .
He explains that last year one of the most popular songs in the Pakistani charts talked about America fighting without honor , adding that the U.S. is " getting better and better at targeting leaders but perhaps creating a context that gets more recruits . "
The spokesman for Taliban leader Mullah Omar recently told me that it is not afraid of drones , that it does n't fear death .
Deptula disagrees and quotes recently declassified comments between two Taliban leaders : " Tanks and armor are not a big deal , the planes are the killers . "
He says that of more than 600 Hellfires fired by Predators , over 95 percent hit their targets .
Those that failed did so generally through mechanical fault , loss of guidance or a target moving at the last instant , Deptula says .
Singer cites other instances when a computer fault has turned robotic warfare into a mass casualty event .
" Last year in South Africa an anti-aircraft had a ' software glitch ' during a training exercise , " he says .
" It was supposed to fire upwards into the sky , instead it lowered and it fired in a circle and killed nine soldiers , all because of a software glitch . "
For the U.S. military the gains more obviously outweigh the glitches .
Hundreds , possibly thousands , of service men and women have had limbs and lives saved by bomb - detecting bots .
Conservative estimates say that fighting from home and putting robots in to war has saved hundreds of millions of dollars .
At Creech the demand for Predator pilots is so intense that it is mobilizing Air National Guard and reservists .
It has also introduced an experimental training program for air force cadets from the videogame generation .
Colonel Chris Chambliss , based at Creech , explains : " If you look at younger people right now , they multitask much better than I do .
They can do a lot of things with a lot of different information , gather all that in .
That 's certainly a skill set we need . "
Cadet Greg Groves , who is in the Reserve Officers ' Training Corps , has never flown a plane before -- but is well aware of his responsibilities .
He says : " It 's pretty clear that it 's not a video game , and it is real life and that what I do directly affects someone else halfway around the world .
So I do n't think that 's going to be a big problem for me . "
Groves ' father and grandfather were both in the military : when he leaves for Creech he 'll be the first in his family to go to war without fear of dying .
Some commanders , such as Colonel Baxter Swift , based at USAF Balad in Iraq , says the future has only just begun .
He says : " It 's almost like what the hot air balloon was back in the Civil War for us .
' Hey , I can rise above and look around and see what the forces are doing on the battlefield . '
So now we are just in the pioneering stage . "
Yet if U.S. forces can have UAVs , so can other nations .
An estimated 40 or more countries also are developing drones , with an Iranian UAV already shot down over Iraq a few months ago .
Even Hezbollah -- a political movement , not a state --- has used them against Israel .
Watch how the demand for UAVs has increased »
For his part , Singer draws another historical parallel , comparing the U.S. and the UAV to the British invention of the tank in the early 20th century .
" There is no such thing as a permanent first maneuver advantage , " Singer says .
" The British came out of WWI with the most tanks , they invented the tank and yet they did n't figure out the best way to use it in the wars they would be fighting .
It was the Germans that figured that out and it was the Germans that would be fighting and would win with the tank when WWII starts . "

hadynyah Find calm with these simple techniques .
Imagine that you 're having a particularly stressful day , and everything seems to be going wrong .
You have a number of important deadlines due , several members of your team have called in sick , and you 've just found out that you have to make a presentation to the board – tomorrow .
When you have to deal with situations like these , your heart may race , your breathing may become fast and shallow , and you could even feel that you can't cope with the task at hand .
These feelings are the result of your body going through sudden changes as it prepares to deal with a perceived threat – this is the famous " fight - or - flight " response .
All of us experience this occasionally , and , for some , it can be a regular occurrence .
While a small amount of pressure can help you focus and improve your performance , too much short - term stress hinders your ability to work well .
This is why it 's useful to know some techniques that can help you relax .
You can use these techniques whenever you 're feeling stressed or tense .
For example , you can use them to relax before a presentation or performance ; you can use them to clear your mind , so that you can solve problems creatively ; or you can use them to compose yourself before a job interview .
Using these techniques regularly can help you to maintain a relaxed and calm state of mind .
In this article , we 'll look at deep breathing , progressive muscular relaxation , and centering – three physical techniques that can help you reduce muscle tension and manage the effects of your body 's fight - or - flight response .
This is particularly important if you need to think clearly and perform well when you 're under pressure .
Warning : Stress can cause severe health problems and , in extreme cases , death .
While these stress management techniques have been shown to have a positive effect on reducing stress , they are for guidance only , and readers should take the advice of suitably qualified health professionals if they have any concerns over stress - related illnesses or if stress is causing significant or persistent unhappiness .
Health professionals should also be consulted before any major change in diet or levels of exercise .
Deep Breathing
Deep breathing is a simple but effective method of relaxation .
It is a core component of yoga and Zen meditation , as well as of the common approach of taking " 10 deep breaths " to calm down .
It works well in conjunction with other relaxation techniques – such as progressive muscular relaxation , relaxation imagery , and meditation – to reduce stress .
Many people spend much of their time breathing very shallowly , filling only the upper part of their chest with air .
This shallow breathing limits the amount of oxygen that your body takes in , and it can also make you feel very anxious in times of stress .
By contrast , deep breathing can decrease stress , lower your blood pressure , and slow your heart rate .
Deep breathing – also called diaphragmatic , or belly breathing – takes place when , instead of just breathing with your ribs , you breathe so that your lower belly expands .

When you breathe in this way , your diaphragm moves downward and pulls your lungs along with it .
At the same time , it presses against your internal organs to make room for your expanding lungs .
When you breathe out , your diaphragm pushes upward , helping your lungs expel carbon dioxide .
It 's easy to start practicing deep breathing techniques .
All you need to do is sit comfortably , take a slow , deep breath in through your nose , and focus on what feels like filling your lower belly with air .
Progressive Muscular Relaxation
Progressive muscular relaxation , or PMR , is useful for relaxing your body when your muscles are tense .
The idea behind PMR is that you tense up a group of muscles , so that they 're tightly contracted .
Hold them in a state of extreme tension for a few seconds , and then relax the muscles normally .
Then , consciously relax your muscles even more .
This process of moving from intense tension to deep muscular relaxation helps interrupt your body 's fight - or - flight response when you 're experiencing fear or stress .
Here are a few examples of ways to engage in progressive muscular relaxation .
Hold each position for five seconds , and then relax .
You might also find it helpful to breathe out slowly as you relax each pose , or even to whisper the word " relax " as you release your muscles .
Raise your eyebrows as high as you can .
Close your eyes as tightly as possible and keep them shut for five seconds .
Open your mouth as wide as possible , as if you 're yawning .
Hold your arms in front of you and clench your fists as tightly as possible .
Pull your shoulder muscles up toward your ears .
Bend your arms and tense your biceps as tightly as possible .
As you sit , pull your legs together and push your thighs together , tightening the thigh muscles as you push inward .
Tighten your abdominal muscles .
Curl your toes downwards as much as possible .
What you 'll find is that when you tense your muscles first , it 's easier , then , to relax these muscles completely .
When you try to relax your muscles without tensing them , you 'll find that they do n't relax as thoroughly .
Centering
Centering was developed from the Japanese martial art of Aikido .
( Literally translated , " Aikido " means " the way of unifying life energy . " )
It 's a method that you can use to channel nervous energy , increase your concentration , and remain stable and grounded in a stressful situation ; and it combines physical and mental approaches to relaxation .
There are three basic steps that you can follow to become centered :
Be aware of your breathing .
Focus on your breathing .
Breathe deeply and slowly , using your abdomen .
Find your center .
This is your physical center of gravity , which is usually just below your waist .
Focusing on your center grounds you , and reminds you that you have balance and control when you start to feel stressed .
Once you 've found your center , focus your mind on it , and breathe deeply at least five times .
Release your negative energy .
Visualize all of your negative energy collecting in your center , and then moving up towards your eyes .
Then , picture yourself thrusting all of this negative energy away from you , leaving youself feeling calm and quiet .
It can take some practice to learn how to use centering , so it 's a good idea to become familiar with it before you need to use it .
You can find out more about it in our article on the technique .
Increasing the Effectiveness of These Techniques
As we looked at with centering , above , you can relax even more intensely by using mental techniques alongside physical ones .
In particular , you can use imagery to lower stress by imagining a peaceful , relaxing place – this works particularly well with deep breathing .
You can also use physical techniques in conjunction with affirmations ; these are positive thoughts that can help you change your thinking and attitude , and become more positive .
Lastly , regular exercise will also help you reduce your stress levels .
Try to fit exercise into your day during your lunch break , after work , or even while you 're at work .
For example , do n't sit too long at your desk ; get up and stretch , or go for a quick walk .
Move around when you 're on your lunch break , stand when you 're on the phone , or visit a colleague in person , instead of using instant messaging or email .
Any movement that you can work into your day will help to keep your energy up and your stress levels down .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia does not expect North Korea to respond to United Nations sanctions in a way that would escalate tensions , Itar - Tass news agency quoted a foreign ministry source as saying on Thursday .
The U.N. Security Council resolution may vote as early as Friday on a draft resolution which aims to punish North Korea for conducting a nuclear test last month by hitting its meager overseas finances .
“ The resolution is being adopted in order to solve the problem , and not to whip up the situation , ” the source told Itar - Tass .
“ We do n’t expect any actions to follow , including from North Korea , that would lead to an escalation of tension . ”
North Korea has previously threatened to test - fire an intercontinental ballistic missile unless the Security Council apologizes for punishing it for an April rocket launch that was widely seen as a disguised long - range missile test .

hemp FAQ .
----------------------
P A R T O N E ----------------------
WHAT'S ALL THIS FUSS ABOUT HEMP ?
1a ) What is hemp ?
For our purposes , hemp is the plant called `cannabis sativa . '
There are other plants that are called hemp , but cannabis hemp is the most useful of these plants .
In fact , `cannabis sativa ' means `useful ( sativa ) hemp ( cannabis ) ' .
` Hemp ' is any durable plant that has been used since pre-history for many purposes .
Fiber is the most well known product , and the word `hemp ' can mean the rope or twine which is made from the hemp plant , as well as just the stalk of the plant which produced it .
1 b ) What is cannabis ?
Cannabis is the most durable of the hemp plants , and it produces the toughest cloth , called `canvass . '
( Canvass was widely used as sails in the early shipping industry , as it was the only cloth which would not rot on contact with sea spray . )
The cannabis plant also produces three other very important products which the other hemp plants do not ( in usable form , that is ) : seed , pulp , and medicine .
The pulp is used as fuel , and to make paper .
The seed is suitable for both human and animal foods .
The oil from the seed can be used in as a base for paints and varnishes .
The medicine is a tincture or admixture of the sticky resin in the blossoms and leaves of the hemp plant , and is used for a variety of purposes .
1c ) Where did the word ` marijuana ' come from ?
The word `marijuana ' is a Mexican slang term which became popular in the late 1930's in America , during a series of media and government programs which we now refer to as the `Reefer Madness Movement . '
It refers specifically to the medicine part of cannabis , which Mexican soldiers used to smoke .
Today in the U.S. , hemp ( meaning the roots , stalk , and stems of the cannabis plant ) is legal to possess .
No one can arrest you for wearing a hemp shirt , or using hemp paper .
Marijuana
( The flowers , buds , or leaves of the cannabis plant ) is not legal to possess , and there are stiff fines and possible jail terms for having any marijuana in your possession .
The seeds are legal to possess and eat , but only if they are sterilized ( will not grow to maturity . )
Since it is not possible to grow the hemp plant without being in possession of marijuana , the United States does not produce any industrial hemp products , and must import them or , more often , substitute others .
( There is a way to grow hemp legally , but it involves filing an application with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the DEA very rarely ever gives its permission . )
This does not seem to have stopped people from producing and using marijuana , though .
In many of the United States , marijuana is the number one cash crop , mostly because it fetches a very high price on the black market .
2a ) How can hemp be used as a food ?
Hemp seed is a highly nutritious source of protein and essential fatty oils .
Many populations have grown hemp for its seed -- most of them eat it as `gruel ' which is a lot like oatmeal .
The leaves can be used as roughage , but not without slight psycho-active side - effects .
Hemp seeds do not contain any marijuana and they do not get you `high . '
Hemp seed protein closely resembles protein as it is found in the human blood .
It is fantastically easy to digest , and many patients who have trouble digesting food are given hemp seed by their doctors .
Hemp seed was once called `edestine ' and was used by scientists as the model for vegetable protein .
Hemp seed oil provides the human body with essential fatty acids .
Hemp seed is the only seed which contains these oils with almost no saturated fat .
As a supplement to the diet , these oils can reduce the risk of heart disease .
It is because of these oils that birds will live much longer if they eat hemp seed .
With hemp seed , a vegan or vegetarian can survive and eat virtually no saturated fats .
One handful of hemp seed per day will supply adequate protein and essential oils for an adult .
2 b ) What are the benefits of hemp compared to other food crops ?
Hemp requires little fertilizer , and grows well almost everywhere .
It also resists pests , so it uses little pesticides .
Hemp puts down deep roots , which is good for the soil , and when the leaves drop off the hemp plant , minerals and nitrogen are returned to the soil .
Hemp has been grown on the same soil for twenty years in a row without any noticeable depletion of the soil .
Using less fertilizer and agricultural chemicals is good for two reasons .
First , it costs less and requires less effort .
Second , many agricultural chemicals are dangerous and contaminate the environment -- the less we have to use , the better .
2c ) How about soy ?
Is hemp competitive as a world source of protein ?
Hemp does not produce quite as much protein as soy , but hemp seed protein is of a higher quality than soy .
Agricultural considerations may make hemp the food crop of the future .
In addition to the fact that hemp is an easy crop to grow , it also resists UV - B light , which is a kind of sunlight blocked by the ozone layer .
Soy beans do not take UV - B light very well .
If the ozone layer were to deplete by 16 % , which by some estimates is very possible , soy production would fall by 25 - 30 % .
We may have to grow hemp or starve -- and it wo n't be the first time that this has happened .
Hemp has been used to `bail out ' many populations in time of famine .
Unfortunately , because of various political factors , starving people in today 's underdeveloped countries are not taking advantage of this crop .
In some places , this is because government officials would call it `marijuana ' and pull up the crop .
In other countries , it is because the farmers are busy growing coca and poppies to produce cocaine and heroin for the local Drug Lord .
This is truly a sad state of affairs .
Hopefully someday the Peace Corps will be able to teach modern hemp seed farming techniques and end the world 's protein shortage .
3a ) How can hemp be used for cloth ?
The stalk of the hemp plant has two parts , called the bast and the hurd .
The fiber ( bast ) of the hemp plant can be woven into almost any kind of cloth .
It is very durable .
In fact , the first Levi 's blue jeans were made out of hemp for just this reason .
Compared to all the other natural fibers available , hemp is more suitable for a large number of applications .
Here is how hemp is harvested for fiber :
A field of closely spaced hemp is allowed to grow until the leaves fall off .
The hemp is then cut down and it lies in the field for some time washed by the rain .
It is turned over once to expose both sides of the stalk evenly .
During this time , the hurd softens up and many minerals are returned to the soil .
This is called `retting , ' and after this step is complete , the stalks are brought to a machine which separates the bast and the hurd .
We are lucky to have machines today -- men used to do this last part by hand with hours of back - breaking labor .
3 b ) Why is it better than cotton ?
The cloth that hemp makes may be a little less soft than cotton , ( though there are also special kinds of hemp , or ways to grow or treat hemp , that can produce a soft cloth ) but it is much stronger and longer lasting .
( It does not stretch out . )
Environmentally , hemp is a better crop to grow than cotton , especially the way cotton is grown nowadays .
In the United States , the cotton crop uses half of the total pesticides .
( Yes , you heard right , one half of the pesticides used in the entire U.S. are used on cotton . )
Cotton is a soil damaging crop and needs a lot of fertilizer .
4a ) How can hemp be used to make paper ?
Both the fiber ( bast ) and pulp ( hurd ) of the hemp plant can be used to make paper .
Fiber paper was the first kind of paper , and the first batch was made out of hemp in ancient China .
Fiber paper is thin , tough , brittle , and a bit rough .
Pulp paper is not as strong as fiber paper , but it is easier to make , softer , thicker , and preferable for most everyday purposes .
The paper we use most today is a `chemical pulp ' paper made from trees .
Hemp pulp paper can be made without chemicals from the hemp hurd .
Most hemp paper made today uses the entire hemp stalk , bast and hurd .
High - strength fiber paper can be made from the hemp baste , also without chemicals .
The problem with today 's paper is that so many chemicals are used to make it .
High strength acids are needed to make quality ( smooth , strong , and white ) paper out of trees .
These acids produce chemicals which are very dangerous to the environment .
Paper companies do their best to clean these chemicals up ( we hope . )
Hemp offers us an opportunity to make affordable and environmentally safe paper for all of our needs , since it does not need much chemical treatment .
It is up to consumers , though , to make the right choice -- these dangerous chemicals can also be used on hemp to make a slightly more attractive product .
Instead of buying the whiter , brighter role of toilet paper , we will need to think about what we are doing to the planet .
Because of the chemicals in today 's paper , it will turn yellow and fall apart as acids eat away at the pulp .
This takes several decades , but because of this publishers , libraries and archives have to order specially processed acid free paper , which is much more expensive , in order to keep records .
Paper made naturally from hemp is acid free and will last for centuries .
4 b ) Why can't we just keep using trees ?
The chemicals used to make wood chemical pulp paper today could cause us a lot of trouble tomorrow .
Environmentalists have long been concerned about the effects of dioxin and other compounds on wildlife and even people .
Beyond the chemical pollution , there are agricultural reasons why we should use cannabis hemp instead .
When trees are harvested , minerals are taken with them .
Hemp is much less damaging to the land where it is grown because it leaves these minerals behind .
A simpler answer to the above question is : Because we are running out !
It was once said that a squirrel could climb from New England to the banks of the Mississippi River without touching the ground once .
The European settler 's appetite for firewood and farmland put an end to this .
When the first wood paper became a huge industry , the United States Department of Agriculture began to worry about the `tree supply . '
That is why they went in search of plant pulp to replace wood .
Today some `conservatives ' argue that there are more forests now than there ever were .
This is neither true , realistic nor conservative : these statistics do not reflect the real world .
Once trees have been removed from a plot of land , it takes many decades before biological diversity and natural cycles return to the forest , and commercial tree farms simply do not count as forest -- they are farm land .
As just mentioned , many plant fibers were investigated by the USDA -- some , like kenaf , were even better suited than cannabis hemp for making some qualities of paper , but hemp had one huge advantage : robust vitality .
Hemp generates immense amounts of plant matter in a three month growing season .
When it came down to producing the deluge of paper used by Americans , only hemp could compete with trees .
In fact , according to the 1916 calculations of the USDA , one acre of hemp would replace an entire four acres of forest .
And , at the same time , this acre would be producing textiles and rope .
Today , only 4 % of America 's old - growth forest remains standing -- and there is talk about building roads into that for logging purposes !
Will our policy makers realize in time how easy it would be to save them ?
5a ) How can hemp be used as a fuel ?
The pulp ( hurd ) of the hemp plant can be burned as is or processed into charcoal , methanol , methane , or gasoline .
The process for doing this is called destructive distillation , or `pyrolysis . '
Fuels made out of plants like this are called `biomass ' fuels .
This charcoal may be burned in today 's coal - powered electric generators .
Methanol makes a good automobile fuel , in fact it is used in professional automobile races .
It may someday replace gasoline .
Hemp may also be used to produce ethanol ( grain alcohol . )
The United States government has developed a way to make this automobile fuel additive from cellulosic biomass .
Hemp is an excellent source of high quality cellulosic biomass .
One other way to use hemp as fuel is to use the oil from the hemp seed -- some diesel engines can run on pure pressed hemp seed oil .
However , the oil is more useful for other purposes , even if we could produce and press enough hemp seed to power many millions of cars .
5 b ) Why is it better than petroleum ?
Biomass fuels are clean and virtually free from metals and sulfur , so they do not cause nearly as much air pollution as fossil fuels .
Even more importantly , burning biomass fuels does not increase the total amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth 's atmosphere .
When petroleum products are burned , carbon that has been stored underground for millions of years is added to the air ; this may contribute to global warming through the ` Greenhouse Effect ' , ( a popular theory which says that certain gases will act like a wool blanket over the entire Earth , preventing heat from escaping into space . )
In order to make biomass fuels , this carbon dioxide has to be taken out of the air to begin with -- when they are burned it is just being put back where it started .
Another advantage over fossil fuels is that biomass fuels can be made right here in the United States , instead of buying them from other countries .
Instead of paying oil drillers , super - tanker captains , and soldiers to get our fuel to us , we could pay local farmers and delivery drivers instead .
Of course , it is possible to chop down trees and use them as biomass .
This would not be as beneficial to the environment as using hemp , especially since trees that are cut down for burning are `whole tree harvested . '
This means the entire tree is ripped up and burned , not just the wood .
Since most of the minerals which trees use are in the leaves , this practice could ruin the soil where the trees are grown .
In several places in the United States , power companies are starting to do this -- burning the trees in order to produce electricity , because that is cheaper than using coal .
They should be using hemp , like researchers in Australia started doing a few years ago .
( Besides , hemp provides a higher quality and quantity of biomass than trees do . )
6a ) How can hemp be used as a medicine ?
Marijuana has thousands of possible uses in medicine .
Marijuana ( actually cannabis extract ) was available as a medicine legally in this country until 1937 , and was sold as a nerve tonic -- but mankind has been using cannabis medicines much longer than that .
Marijuana appears in almost every known book of medicine written by ancient scholars and wise men .
It is usually ranked among the top medicines , called `panaceas ' , a word which means `cure - all ' .
The list of diseases which cannabis can be used for includes : multiple sclerosis , cancer treatment , AIDS ( and AIDS treatment ) , glaucoma , depression , epilepsy , migraine headaches , asthma , pruritis , sclerodoma , severe pain , and dystonia .
This list does not even consider the other medicines which can be made out of marijuana -- these are just some of the illnesses for which people smoke or eat whole marijuana today .
There are over 60 chemicals in marijuana which may have medical uses .
It is relatively easy to extract these into food or beverage , or into some sort of lotion , using butter , fat , oil , or alcohol .
One chemical , cannabinol , may be useful to help people who cannot sleep .
Another is taken from premature buds and is called cannabidiolic acid .
It is a powerful disinfectant .
Marijuana dissolved in rubbing alcohol helps people with the skin disease herpes control their sores , and a salve like this was one of the earliest medical uses for cannabis .
The leaves were once used in bandages and a relaxing non-psychoactive herbal tea can be made from small cannabis stems .
The most well known use of marijuana today is to control nausea and vomiting .
One of the most important things when treating cancer with chemotherapy or when treating AIDS with AZT or Foscavir , being able to eat well , makes the difference between life or death .
Patients have found marijuana to be extremely effective in fighting nausea ; in fact so many patients use it for this purpose even though it is illegal that they have formed `buyers clubs ' to help them find a steady supply .
In California , some city governments have decided to look the other way and allow these clubs to operate openly .
Marijuana is also useful for fighting two other very serious and wide - spread disabilities .
Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness , caused by uncontrollable eye pressure .
Marijuana can control the eye pressure and keep glaucoma from causing blindness .
Multiple Sclerosis is a disease where the body 's immune system attacks nerve cells .
Spasms and many other problems result from this .
Marijuana not only helps stop these spasms , but it may also keep multiple sclerosis from getting worse .
6 b ) What 's wrong with all the prescription drugs we have ?
They cost money and are hard to make .
In many cases , they do not work as well , either .
Some prescription drugs which marijuana can replace have very bad , even downright dangerous , side - effects .
Cannabis medicines are cheap , safe , and easy to make .
Many people think that the drug dronabinol should be used instead of marijuana .
Dronabinol is an exact imitation of one of the chemicals found in marijuana , and it may actually work on a lot of the above diseases , but there are some big problems with dronabinol , and most patients who have used both dronabinol and marijuana say that marijuana works better .
The first problem with Dronabinol is that it is even harder to get than marijuana .
Many doctors do not like to prescribe dronabinol , and many drug stores do not want to supply it , because a lot of paperwork has to be filed with the Drug Enforcement Administration .
Secondly , dronabinol comes in pills which are virtually useless to anyone who is throwing up , and it is hard to take just the right amount of dronabinol since it can not be smoked .
Finally , because dronabinol is only one of the many chemicals in cannabis , it just does not work for some diseases .
Many patients do not like the effects of dronabinol because it does not contain some of the more calming chemicals which are present in marijuana .
7 ) What other uses for hemp are there ?
One of the newest uses of hemp is in construction materials .
Hemp can be used in the manufacture of `press board ' or `composite board . '
This involves gluing fibrous hemp stalks together under pressure to produce a board which is many times more elastic and durable than hardwood .
Because hemp produces a long , tough fiber it is the perfect source for press - board .
Another interesting application of hemp in industry is making plastic .
Many plastics can be made from the high - cellulose hemp hurd .
Hemp seed oil has a multitude of uses in products such as varnishes and lubricants .
Using hemp to build is by no means a new idea .
French archeologists have discovered bridges built with a process that mineralizes hemp stalks into a long - lasting cement .
The process involves no synthetic chemicals and produces a material which works as a filler in building construction .
Called Isochanvre , it is gaining popularity in France .
Isochanvre can be used as drywall , insulates against heat and noise , and is very long lasting .
` Bio-plastics ' are not a new idea , either -- way back in the 1930's Henry Ford had already made a whole car body out of them -- but the processes for making them do need more research and development .
Bio-plastics can be made without much pollution .
Unfortunately , companies are not likely to explore bio-plastics if they have to either import the raw materials or break the law .
( Not to mention compete with the already established petrochemical products . )

P A R T T W O -----------------------
WELL WHY AREN'T WE USING HEMP , THEN ?
1 ) How and why was hemp made illegal ?
Tough question !
In order to explain why hemp , the most useful plant known to mankind , became illegal , we have to understand the reasons why marijuana , the drug , became illegal .
In fact , it helps to go way back to the beginning of the century and talk about two other drugs , opium ( the grandfather of heroin ) and cocaine .
Opium , a very addictive drug ( but relatively harmless by today 's standards ) was once widely used by the Chinese .
The reasons for this are a whole other story , but suffice to say that when Chinese started to immigrate to the United States , they brought opium with them .
Chinese workers used opium to induce a trance - like state which helped make boring , repetitive tasks more interesting .
It also numbs the mind to pain and exhaustion .
By using opium , the Chinese were able to pull very long hours in the sweat shops of the Industrial Revolution .
During this period of time , there was no such thing as fair wages , and the only way a worker could make a living was to produce as much as humanly possible .
Since they were such good workers , the Chinese held a lot of jobs in the highly competitive industrial work - place .
Even before the Great Depression , when millions of jobs disappeared overnight , the White Americans began to resent this , and Chinese became hated among the White working class .
Even more than today , White Americans had a very big political advantage over the Chinese -- they spoke English and had a few relatives in the government , so it was easy for them to come up with a plan to force Chinese immigrants to leave the country ( or at least keep them from inviting all their relatives to come and live in America . )
This plan depended on stirring up racist feelings , and one of the easiest things to focus these feelings on was the foreign and mysterious practice of using opium .
We can see this pattern again with cocaine , except with cocaine it was Black Americans who were the target .
Cocaine probably was not especially useful in the work - place , but the strategy against Chinese immigrants ( picking on their drug of choice ) had been so successful that it was used again .
In the case of Blacks , though , the racist feelings ran deeper , and the main thrust of the propaganda campaign was to control the Black community and keep Blacks from becoming successful .
Articles appeared in newspapers which blamed cocaine for violent crime by Blacks .
Black Americans were painted as savage , uncontrollable beasts when under the influence of cocaine -- it was said to make a single Black man as strong as four or five police officers .
( sound familiar ? )
By capitalizing on racist sentiments , a powerful political lobby banned opium and then cocaine .
Marijuana was next .
It was well known that the Mexican soldiers who fought America during the war with Spain smoked marijuana .
Poncho Villa , A Mexican general , was considered a nemesis for the behavior of his troops , who were known to be especially rowdy .
They were also known to be heavy marijuana smokers , as the original lyrics to the song `la cucaracha ' show .
( The song was originally about a Mexican soldier who refused to march until he was provided with some marijuana . )
After the war had ended and Mexicans had begun to immigrate into the South Eastern United States , there were relatively few race problems .
There were plenty of jobs in agriculture and industry and Mexicans were willing to work cheap .
Once the depression hit and jobs became scarce , however , Mexicans suddenly became a public nuisance .
It was said by politicians ( who were trying to please the White working class ) that Mexicans were responsible for a violent crime wave .
Police statistics showed nothing of the sort -- in fact Mexicans were involved in less crime than Whites .
Marijuana , of course , got the blame for this phony outbreak of crime and health problems , and so many of these states made laws against using cannabis .
( In the Northern states , marijuana was also associated with Black jazz musicians . )
Here is where things start to get complicated .
Put aside , for a moment , all the above , because there are a few other things involved in this twisted tale .
At the beginning of the Great Depression , there was a very popular movement called Prohibition , which made alcohol illegal .
This was motivated mainly by a Puritan religious ethic left over from the first European settlers .
Today we have movies and television shows such as the ``Untouchables '' which tell us what it was like to live during this period .
Since it is perhaps the world 's most popular drug , alcohol prohibition spawned a huge `black market ' where illegal alcohol was smuggled and traded at extremely high prices .
Crime got out - of - hand as criminals fought with each other over who could sell alcohol where .
Organized crime became an American institution , and hard liquor , which was easy to smuggle , took the place of beer and wine .
In order to combat the crime wave , a large police force was formed .
The number of police grew rapidly until the end of Prohibition when the government decided that the best way to deal with the situation was to just give up and allow people to use alcohol legally .
Under Prohibition the American government had essentially ( and unwittingly ) provided the military back - up for the take - over of the alcohol business by armed thugs .
Even today , the Mob still controls liquor sales in many areas .
After Prohibition the United States was left with nothing to show but a decade of political turmoil -- and a lot of unemployed police officers .
During Prohibition , being a police officer was a very nice thing -- you got a relatively decent salary , respect , partial immunity to the law , and the opportunity to take bribes ( if you were that sort of person . )
Many of these officers were not about to let this life - style slip away .
Incidentally , it was about this time when the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs was reformed , and a man named Harry J. Anslinger was appointed as its head .
( Anslinger was appointed by his uncle - in - law , Andrew Mellon , who was the Secretary of the United States Treasury . )
Anslinger campaigned tirelessly for funding in order to hire a large force of narcotics officers .
After retiring , Anslinger once mused that the FBNDD was a place where young men were given a license to steal and rape .
The FBNDD is the organization which preceded what we now call the DEA , and was responsible for enforcing the new Federal drug laws against heroin , opium , and cocaine .
One of Anslinger 's biggest concerns as head of the FBNDD was getting uniform drug laws passed in all States and the Federal legislature .
( Anslinger also had a personal dislike of jazz music and the Black musicians who made it .
He hated them so much that he spent years tracking each of them and dreamed of arresting them all in one huge , cross-country sweep . )
Anslinger frequented parent 's and teacher 's meetings giving scary speeches about the dangers of marijuana , and this period of time became known as Reefer Madness .
( The name comes from the title of a silly movie produced by a public health group . )
2 ) OK , so what the heck does all this other stuff have to do with hemp ?
To make a long story short , during the first decades of this century , opium was made illegal to kick out the Chinese immigrants who had flooded the work - force .
Cocaine was made illegal to repress and control the Black community .
And , marijuana was made illegal in order to control Mexicans in the Southeast ( and Blacks . )
All these laws were based mainly on emotional racism , without much else to back them up -- you can easily tell this by reading the hearings held in state legislatures .
Also at this time , the end of Prohibition left us with a large force of unemployed police officers , who looked for work enforcing the new drug laws .
Consequently , these same police officers needed to convince the country that their jobs were important .
They did so by scaring parents about the dangers of drugs .
All this set the stage for a law passed in the Federal legislature which put a prohibitive tax on marijuana .
This is what killed the hemp industry in 1937 , since it made business in hemp impossible .
Before the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act , the state of Kentucky was the center of a relatively large American hemp industry which produced cloth and tow ( rope for use in shipping . )
The industry would have been larger , but hemp had one major disadvantage : processing it required a lot of work .
Men had to `brake ' hemp stalks in order to separate the fiber from the woody core .
This was done on a small machine called a hand - brake , and it was a job fit for Hercules .
It was not until the 1930's that machines to do this became widely available .
Today we use paper made by a process called `chemical pulping ' .
Before this , trees were processed by `mechanical pulping ' instead , which was much more expensive .
At about the same time as machines to brake hemp appeared , the idea of using hemp hurds for making paper and plastic was proposed .
Hemp hurds were normally considered to be a worthless waste product that was thrown away after it was stripped of fiber .
New research showed that these hurds could be used instead of wood in mechanical pulping , and that this would drastically reduce the cost of making paper .
Popular Mechanics Magazine predicted that hemp would rise to become the number one crop in America .
In fact , the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act was so unexpected that Popular Mechanics had already gone to press with a cover story about hemp , published in 1938 just two months after the Tax Act took effect .
3 ) Now wait , just hold on .
You expect me to believe that they would n't have thought to pass a better law , one that banned marijuana and allowed commercial hemp , instead of throwing the baby out with the bath water ?
There 's more .
` Chemical pulping ' paper was invented at about this time by Dupont Chemicals , as part of a multi-million dollar deal with a timber holding company and newspaper chain owned by William Randolph Hearst .
This deal would provide the Hearst with a source of very cheap paper , and he would go on to be known as the tycoon of `yellow journalism ' ( so named because the new paper would turn yellow very quickly as it got older . )
Hearst knew that he could drive other papers out of competition with this new advantage .
Hemp paper threatened to ruin this whole plan .
It had to be stopped , and the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 was the way they did it .
As a drug law , the Tax Act really was not a very big step -- it did not really accomplish much at all and many historians have caught themselves wondering why the bill was even written .
Big business interests took advantage of the political climate of racism and anti-drug rhetoric to close the free market to hemp products , and _that_ , my friend , is how hemp became illegal .
( Whew ! )
For the 1930's , this business venture was one very large transaction ; it included other timber companies and a few railroads .
Dupont 's entire deal was backed by a banker named Andrew Mellon .
Do n't look up !
That 's the same Andrew Mellon who appointed his nephew - in - law Harry Anslinger to head up the FBNDD in 1931 .
The Marijuana Tax
Act was passed in a very unorthodox way , and nobody who would have objected was informed about the bill .
The American Medical Association found out about the bill only two days before the hearings , and sent a representative to object to the banning of cannabis medicines .
A hemp bird seed salesman also showed up and complained .
However , the bill was passed , partially due to the testimony of Harry J. Anslinger .
Not that Americans would have protested against this bill , even if they had known it existed most Americans did not know that cannabis hemp and marijuana is the same thing .
The separate word `marijuana ' was one of the reasons for this .
Nobody would associate the evil weed from Mexico with the stuff they tied their shoes with .
Also , this was the time when synthetic fabrics were the latest fad -- nobody was interested in natural fibers any more .
To top this all off the word `hemp ' was often wrongly used to refer to other natural fabrics , specifically jute .
The ignorance of hemp continues today , but it is even more scary .
During the 1970's ( Reefer Madness II ) all mention of the word `hemp ' was removed from high school text books here in the United States .
So much for free speech !
When Jack Herer , the world 's most beloved hemp activist , asked a curator at the Smithsonian Museum why this word had been removed from all their exhibits , the answer he got was astounding : ``Children do not need to know about hemp anymore .
It confuses them . ''
Jack
Herer went on to uncover a film made by the United States government , a film which the government did not want to admit existed .
The film ``Hemp For Victory '' details how the United States government bypassed the Tax Act during World War II , when they needed hemp for the War Effort , and ran a large hemp - growing project in Kentucky and California .
( Bravo , Jack ! )
4 ) Is there a lesson to be learned from all this ?
Several .
The first is that hate does not pay .
It is ironic that the racism of the American people would end up hurting them this way -- a sort of divine justice if you will .
Because Americans were blinded by fear , hatred , and intolerance of other races , they allowed a prosperous future to slip between their fingers .
Another thing this whole history tells us is that Americans need to take Democracy more seriously .
If they had devoted more of their time to informing themselves about the world around them , they would have known what the real issues were .
Instead they read the tabloids -- look where that has gotten us .
Finally , now that we have put marijuana prohibition into historical context , we can see clearly that it had nothing to do with public safety , or national security , or what have you .
By all rights , marijuana should not have been made illegal in the first place .
If today prohibition still has no rational basis to stand on , then let us repeal it .
One point which bears emphasizing is this : the laws which are passed in this country may not mean what they say on paper .
Historically the United States has a long record of passing laws with ulterior motives .
Even when there is no ulterior motive , though , passing laws which are not specific enough leads to abuse .
Most of our tough drug laws are like this -- enacted to fight drug kingpins , but enforced against casual drug users and small - time drug dealers .
In fact , most of these laws never even get used against a real drug kingpin , and the first people prosecuted under the statutes are not what the legislators had in mind .
If this upsets you , you should pay more attention to what goes on in your legislature .
-----------------------------
P A R T T H R E E ----------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
The next question would normally be ``Why is it _still_ not legal , '' but since we have uncovered an understanding of the history , it is time to take a little detour .
Politicians love to tell us that marijuana must remain illegal for our own good .
In the next section we will examine some of the so - called facts about marijuana so that you can decide for yourselves whether you agree or not .
Is marijuana prohibition there to protect the people , or is it just the result of decades of refusal to admit our mistakes ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
DOES IT ?
DOESN'T IT ?
IS IT TRUE THAT ?
1 ) Does n't marijuana stay in your fat cells and keep you high for months ?
No .
The part of marijuana that gets you high is called ` Delta - 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol . '
Most people just call this THC , but this is confusing : your body will change Delta - 9 - THC into more inert molecules known as `metabolites , ' which do n't get you high .
Unfortunately , these chemicals also have the word `tetrahydrocannabinol ' in them and they are also called THC -- so many people think that the metabolites get you high .
Anti-drug pamphlets say that THC gets stored in your fat cells and then leaks out later like one of those `time release capsules ' advertised on television .
They say it can keep you high all day or even longer .
This is not true , marijuana only keeps you high for a few hours , and it is not right to think that a person who fails a drug test is always high on drugs , either .
Two of these metabolites are called ` 11 - hydroxy - tetrahydrocannabinol ' and ` 11 - nor - 9 - carboxy - delta- 9-tetrahydrocannabinol ' but we will call them 11 - OH - THC and 11 - nor instead .
These are the chemicals which stay in your fatty cells .
There is almost no Delta-9 - THC left over a few hours after smoking marijuana , and scientific studies which measure the effects of marijuana agree with this fact .
2 ) But ... is n't today 's marijuana much more potent than it was in the Sixties ?
( Or , more often ... Marijuana is 10 times more powerful than it was in the Sixties ! )
GOOD !
Actually , this is not true , but if it were , it would mean that marijuana is safer to smoke today than it was in the Sixties .
( More potent cannabis means less smoking means less lung damage . )
People who use this statistic just plain do not know what they are talking about .
Sometimes they will even claim that marijuana is now twenty to thirty times stronger , which is physically impossible because it would have to be * over * 100 % Delta-9 - THC .
The truth is , marijuana has not really changed potency all that much , if at all , in the last several hundred years .
Growing potent cannabis is an ancient art which has not improved in centuries , despite all our modern technology .
Before marijuana was even made illegal , drug stores sold tinctures of cannabis which were over 40 % THC .
Even so , the point is moot because marijuana smokers engage in something called `auto - titration . '
This basically means smoking until they are satisfied and then stopping , so it does not really matter if the marijuana is more potent because they will smoke less of it .
Marijuana is not like pre-moistened towelettes or snow - cones .
There is nothing forcing marijuana smokers to smoke an entire joint .
Experienced marijuana users are accustomed to smoking marijuana from many different suppliers , and they know that if they smoke a whole joint of very potent bud they will get ` TOO STONED ' .
Since being `too stoned ' is a rather unpleasant experience , smokers quickly learn to take their time and `test the waters ' when they do not know how strong their marijuana is .
3a ) Does n't Marijuana cause brain damage ?
The short answer : No .
The long answer :
The reason why you ask this is because you probably heard or read somewhere that marijuana damages brain cells , or makes you stupid .
These claims are untrue .
The first one -- marijuana kills brain cells -- is based on research done during the second Reefer Madness Movement .
A study attempted to show that marijuana smoking damaged brain structures in monkeys .
However , the study was poorly performed and it was severely criticized by a medical review board .
Studies done afterwards failed to show any brain damage , in fact a very recent study on Rhesus monkeys used technology so sensitive that scientists could actually see the effect of learning on brain cells , and it found no damage .
But this was Reefer Madness II , and the prohibitionists were looking around for anything they could find to keep the marijuana legalization movement in check , so this study was widely used in anti-marijuana propaganda .
It was recanted later .
( To this day , the radical anti-drug groups , like P.R.I.D.E. and Dr. Gabriel Nahas , still use it --
In fact , America 's most popular drug education program , Drug Abuse Resistance Education , claims that marijuana ``can impair memory perception & judgement by destroying brain cells . ''
When police and teachers read this and believe it , our job gets really tough , since it takes a long time to explain to children how Ms. Jones and Officer Bob were wrong . )
The truth is , no study has ever demonstrated cellular damage , stupidity , mental impairment , or insanity brought on specifically by marijuana use -- even heavy marijuana use .
This is not to say that it cannot be abused , however .
3 b ) If it does n't kill brain cells , how does it get you `high ' ?
Killing brain cells is not a pre-requisite for getting `high . '
Marijuana contains a chemical which substitutes for a natural brain chemical , with a few differences .
This chemical touches special `buttons ' on brain cells called `receptors . '
Essentially , marijuana `tickles ' brain cells .
The legal drug alcohol also tickles brain cells , but it will damage and kill them by producing toxins ( poisons ) and sometimes mini-seizures .
Also , some drugs will wear out the buttons which they push , but marijuana does not .
4 ) Do n't people die from smoking pot ?
Nobody has ever overdosed .
For any given substance , there are bound to be some people who have allergic reactions .
With marijuana this is extremely rare , but it could happen with anything from apples to pop-tarts .
Not one death has ever been directly linked to marijuana itself .
In contrast , many legal drugs cause hundreds to hundreds of thousands of deaths per year , foremost among them are alcohol , nicotine , valium , aspirin , and caffiene .
The biggest danger with marijuana is that it is illegal , and someone may mix it with another drug like PCP .
Marijuana is so safe that it would be almost impossible to overdose on it .
Doctors determine how safe a drug is by measuring how much it takes to kill a person ( they call this the LD50 ) and comparing it to the amount of the drug which is usually taken ( ED50 ) .
This makes marijuana hundreds of times safer than alcohol , tobacco , or caffiene .
According to a DEA Judge ``marijuana is the safest therapeutically active substance known to mankind . ''
5 ) I forgot , does marijuana cause short - term memory impairment ?
The effect of marijuana on memory is its most dramatic and the easiest to notice .
Many inexperienced marijuana users find that they have very strange , sudden and unexpected memory lapses .
These usually take the form of completely forgetting what you were talking about when you were right in the middle of saying something important .
However , these symptoms only occur while a person is `high ' .
They do not carry over or become permanent , and examinations of extremely heavy users has not shown any memory or thinking problems .
More experienced marijuana users seem to be able to remember about as well as they do when they are not `high . '
Studies which have claimed to show short - term memory impairment have not stood up to scrutiny and have not been duplicated .
Newer studies show that marijuana does not impair simple , real - world memory processes .
Marijuana does slow reaction time slightly , and this effect has sometimes been misconstrued as a memory problem .
To put things in perspective , one group of researchers made a control group hold their breath , like marijuana smokers do .
Marijuana itself only produced about twice as many effects on test scores as breath holding .
Many people use marijuana to study .
Other people cannot , for some reason , use marijuana and do anything that involves deep thought .
Nobody knows what makes the difference .
6a ) Is marijuana going to make my boyfriend go psycho ?
Marijuana does not `cause ' psychosis .
Psychotic people can smoke marijuana and have an episode , but there is nothing in marijuana that actually initiates or increases these episodes .
Of course , if any mentally ill person is given marijuana for the first time or without their knowledge , they might get scared and `freak . '
Persons who suffer from severe psychological disorders often use marijuana as a way of coping .
Because of this , some researchers have assumed that marijuana is the cause of these problems , when it is actually a symptom .
If you have heard that marijuana makes people go crazy , this is probably why .
6 b ) Do n't users of marijuana withdraw from society ?
To some extent , yes .
That 's probably just because they are afraid of being arrested , though .
The same situation exists with socially maladjusted persons as does with the mentally ill .
Emotionally troubled individuals find marijuana to be soothing , and so they tend to use it more than your average person .
Treatment specialists see this , and assume that the marijuana is causing the problem .
This is a mistake which hurts the patient , because their doctors will pay less attention to their actual needs , and concentrate on ending their drug habit .
Sometimes the cannabis is even helping them to recover .
Cannabis can be abused , and it can make these situations worse , but psychologists should approach marijuana use with an open mind or they risk hurting their patient .
Marijuana itself does not make normal people anti-social .
In fact , a large psychological study of teenagers found that casual marijuana users are more well adjusted than `drug free ' people .
This would be very amusing , but it is a serious problem .
There are children who have emotional problems which keep them from participating in healthy , explorative behavior .
They need psychological help but instead they are skipped over .
Marijuana users who do not need help are having treatment forced on them , and in the mean - time marijuana takes the blame for the personality characteristics and problems of the people who like to use it improperly .
7 ) Is it true that marijuana makes you lazy and unmotivated ?
Not if you are a responsible adult , it does n't .
Ask the U.S. Army .
They did a study and showed no effect .
If this were true , why would many Eastern cultures , and Jamaicans , use marijuana to help them work harder ?
` Amotivational syndrome ' started as a media myth based on the racial stereotype of a lazy Mexican borracho .
The prohibitionists claimed that marijuana made people worthless and sluggish .
Since then , however , it has been scientifically researched , and a symptom resembling amotivational syndrome has actually been found .
However , it only occurs in adolescent teenagers -- adults are not affected .
When a person reaches adolescence , their willingness to work usually increases , but this does not happen for teenagers using marijuana regularly -- even just on the weekends .
The actual studies involved monkeys , not humans , and the results are not verified , but older studies which tried to show `amotivational syndrome ' usually only suceeded when they studied adolescents .
Adults are not effected .
The symptoms are not permanent , and motivation returns to normal levels several months after marijuana smoking stops .
However , a small number of people may be unusually sensitive to this effect .
One of the monkeys in the experiment was severely amotivated and did not recover .
Doctors will need to study this more before they know why .
8 ) Is n't marijuana a gateway drug ?
Does n't it lead to use of harder drugs ?
This is totally untrue .
In fact , researchers are looking into using marijuana to help crack addicts to quit .
There are 40 million people in this country ( U.S. ) who have smoked marijuana for a period of their lives -- why are n't there tens of millions of heroin users , then ?
In Amsterdam , both marijuana use and heroin use went * down * after marijuana was decriminalized -- even though there was a short rise in cannabis use right after decriminalization .
Unlike addictive drugs , marijuana causes almost no tolerance .
Some people even report a reverse tolerance .
That is , the longer they have used the less marijuana they need to get `high . '
So users of marijuana do not usually get bored and `look for something more powerful ' .
If anything , marijuana keeps people from doing harder drugs .
The idea that using marijuana will lead you to use heroin or speed is called the `gateway theory ' or the `stepping stone hypothesis . '
It has been a favorite trick of the anti-drug propaganda artists , because it casts marijuana as something insidious with hidden dangers and pitfalls .
There have never been any real statistics to back this idea up , but somehow it was the single biggest thing which the newspapers yelled about during Reefer Madness II .
( Perhaps this was because the CIA was looking for someone to blame for the increase in heroin use after Viet Nam . )
The gateway theory of drug use is no longer generally accepted by the medical community .
Prohibitionists used to point at numbers which showed that a large percentage of the hard drug users `started with marijuana . '
They had it backwards -- many hard drug users also use marijuana .
There are two reasons for this .
One is that marijuana can be used to `take the edge off ' the effects of some hard drugs .
The other is a recently discovered fact of adolescent psychology -- there is a personality type which uses drugs , basically because drugs are exciting and dangerous , a thrill .
On sociological grounds , another sort of gateway theory has been argued which claims that marijuana is the source of the drug subculture and leads to other drugs through that culture .
By the same token this is untrue -- marijuana does not create the drug subculture , the drug subculture uses marijuana .
There are many marijuana users who are not a part of the subculture .
This brings up another example of how marijuana legalization could actually reduce the use of illicit drugs .
Even though there is no magical `stepping stone ' effect , people who choose to buy marijuana often buy from dealers who deal in many different illegal drugs .
This means that they have access to illegal drugs , and might decide to try them out .
In this case it is the laws which lead to hard drug use .
If marijuana were legal , the drug markets would be separated , and less people would start using the illegal drugs .
Maybe this is why emergency room admissions for hard drugs have gone down in the states that decriminalized marijuana during the 70's .
9a ) I do n't want children ( minors ) to be able to smoke marijuana .
How can I stop this ?
Legalize it .
They can smoke it now ; it is about as easy to get as alcohol .
There would be less marijuana being sold in schools , playgrounds , and street corners , though , if it was sold legally through pharmacies -- because the dealers would not be able to compete with the prices .
If you are a parent , the choice is really up to you :
Do you want your children to sneak off with their friends and use marijuana which they bought off the street , or do you want to talk to them calmly and explain to them why they should wait until they are older ?
Your children are not going to walk up to you and tell you that they use an illegal drug , but if it was not such a big deal they might give you a chance to explain your feelings .
Besides , would you rather children use speed , cocaine , and alcohol ?
Consider , also , that children have a natural urge to do things that they are n't supposed to .
It is called curiosity .
By making such a fuss over marijuana , you make it interesting ( some call it the `forbidden fruit ' factor . )
This is made worse when children are lied to about drugs by teachers and police -- they lose respect for the school and the government .
In a lot of ways , it is the hysteria about drugs which causes the most harm .
When marijuana users do none of the horrible things they are supposed to , children may think that other more harmful drugs are OK , too .
Your children will not respect you unless you are calm and give good reasons for your rules .
The first step is for you , the parent , to learn the facts about drugs .
9 b ) Wo n't children be able to steal marijuana plants that people are growing ?
Well , if you are worried about them stealing the hemp plants from the paper - pulp farm down the road , you should know that the commercial grades of hemp do not contain much THC ( the stuff that gets you high . )
If they were to smoke it , they would probably just get a headache .
Otherwise , it should be the responsibility of the grower to take measures to prevent this .
Most ``home - grown '' marijuana is cultivated indoors anyway .
If the children in your town have nothing better to do than go around stealing marijuana to smoke , your town needs to buy a library or something .
10a ) Hey , do n't you know that marijuana drops testosterone levels in teenage boys causing [ various physical and developmental problems ] ?
Marijuana does not turn young healthy boys into lanky , girlish looking wimps , no .
This scare tactic ( call it homo - phobic if you will ) was a common device used in early anti-drug literature .
It attempts to scare boys away from marijuana by telling them , essentially , that it will turn them into a girl .
Young men probably should not use marijuana heavily ( see the section on amotivational syndrome ) , but the risks are not horrendous .
Anti-marijuana pamphlets used this claim often during Reefer Madness II , but the studies which are cited are mostly faulty or misinterpreted .
This is not to say that marijuana use does not affect childhood development at all , just that the effects are not as drastic as some people would like them to sound .
In fact they are pretty much unknown .
10 b ) Does n't heavy marijuana use lower the sperm count in males ?
Not by much , ( if at all ) and this can be a good thing .
It does not make you impotent or sterile .
( If it did -- there would be no Rastafarians left ! )
Give those testicles a rest , already !
Marijuana is certainly _not_ birth control , please do n't let your lover tell you it is .
Many people think that marijuana enhances their sex lives .
It is not an aphrodisiac , that is , it does not make people want to have sex .
What it does do for some people is make everything more sensual -- it makes food taste better and feelings and emotions more vivid .
10 c ) I heard marijuana use by teenage girls may impair hormone production , menstrual cycles , and fertility .
Is this true ?
Also unproven and unfounded , but there is no data available to tell either way , ( and it wo n't be coming from the U.S. -- current U.S. laws prohibit research on women . )
This is the female version of the boy 's ``It 'll turn you into a sissy '' tactic .
As far as anyone knows , it is only a scare tactic .
11 ) I forgot , does marijuana cause short - term memory impairment ?
Go away .
12 ) Is n't smoking marijuana worse for you than smoking cigarettes ?
There are many reasons why it is not .
You may have heard that ``one joint is equal to ten cigarrettes '' but this is exagerrated and misleading .
Marijuana does contain more tar than tobacco -- but low tar cigarettes cause just as much cancer , so what is that supposed to mean ?
Scientists have shown that smoking any plant is bad for your lungs , because it increases the number of `lesions ' in your small airways .
This usually does not threaten your life , but there is a chance it will lead to infections .
Marijuana users who are worried about this can find less harmful ways of taking marijuana like eating or vaporizing .
( Be careful -- marijuana is safe to eat -- but tobacco is not , you might overdose ! )
Marijuana does not seem to cause cancer the way tobacco does , though .
Here is a list of interesting facts about marijuana smoking and tobacco smoking : o Marijuana smokers generally do n't chain smoke , and so they smoke less .
( Marijuana is not physically addictive like tobacco . )
The more potent marijuana is , the less a smoker will use at a time .
o Tobacco contains nicotine , and marijuana does n't .
Nicotine may harden the arteries and may be responsible for much of the heart disease caused by tobacco .
New research has found that it may also cause a lot of the cancer in tobacco smokers and people who live or work where tobacco is smoked .
This is because it breaks down into a cancer causing chemical called `N Nitrosamine ' when it is burned ( and maybe even while it is inside the body as well . ) o Marijuana contains THC .
THC is a bronchial dilator , which means it works like a cough drop and opens up your lungs , which aids clearance of smoke and dirt .
Nicotine does just the opposite ; it makes your lungs bunch up and makes it harder to cough anything up .
o
There are benefits from marijuana ( besides bronchial dilation ) that you do n't get from tobacco .
Mainly , marijuana makes you relax , which improves your health and well - being .
o Scientists do not really know what it is that causes malignant lung cancer in tobacco .
Many think it may be a substance known as Lead 210 .
Of course , there are many other theories as to what does cause cancer , but if this is true , it is easy to see why NO CASE OF LUNG CANCER RESULTING FROM MARIJUANA USE ALONE HAS EVER BEEN DOCUMENTED , because tobacco contains much more of this substance than marijuana .
o Marijuana laws make it harder to use marijuana without damaging your body .
Water - pipes are illegal in many states .
Filtered cigarettes , vaporizers , and inhalers have to be mass produced , which is hard to arrange `underground . '
People do n't eat marijuana often because you need more to get as high that way , and it is n't cheap or easy to get ( which is the reason why some people will stoop to smoking leaves . )
This may sound funny to you -- but the more legal marijuana gets , the safer it is .
-------------------------
It is pretty obvious to users that marijuana prohibition laws are not ``for their own good . ''
In addition to the above , legal marijuana would be clean and free from adulturants .
Some people add other drugs to marijuana before they sell it .
Some people spray room freshener on it or soak in in chemicals like formaldehyde !
A lot of the marijuana is grown outdoors , where it may be sprayed with pesticides or contaminated with dangerous fungi .
If the government really cared about our health , they would form an agency which would make sure only quality marijuana was sold .
This would be cheaper than keeping it illegal , and it would keep people from getting hurt and going to the emergency room .
13 ) Do n't children born to pot-smoking mothers suffer from ``Fetal Marijuana Syndrome ? ''
If a fetal cannabis syndrome exists , cases are so rare that it can not be demonstrated .
Many mothers use marijuana during pregnancy -- it controls the nausea called `morning sickness ' and many say it actually increases the appetite and reduces stress .
This is especially important in less developed countries , where modern medical care is not as easily available , but even so , the benefits of responsible marijuana use may outweigh the risks even under modern medicine .
Studies conducted in Jamiaca have shown that mothers who smoke marijuana have healthier children , but this may be due to the extra income generated by marijuana dealing and other factors .
It has been a common ploy in the War on Drugs to claim that marijuana , and especially cocaine , causes birth defects or behavior problems like alcohol does .
This scares caring mothers into thinking drugs are `evil . '
The claims are not based on valid scientific research -- many of them do not even consider the life - style or living conditions of the mothers before pointing at drugs with the blame .
Obviously , pregnant mothers should not smoke as much pot as they possibly can .
If marijuana is abused , it may hurt the health of both mother and child .
Delta-9 - THC does cross the placenta and enter the fetus .
Oddly , though , the marijuana metabolite , 11 - nor - 9 - carboxy - delta-9 - THC does not , and the fetus does not break delta-9 - THC down into 11 - nor like the mother 's body does , so unborn children are not exposed to 11 - nor .
The third trimester is the time when the child is most vulnerable .
Parents should bear these facts in mind when they make decisions about using cannabis .
14 ) Does n't marijuana cause a lot of automobile accidents ?
Not really .
The marijuana using public has the same or lower rate of automobile accidents as the general public .
Studies of marijuana smoking while driving showed that it does affect reaction time , but not nearly as much as alcohol .
Also , those who drive `stoned ' have been shown to be less foolish on the road ( they demonstrate `increased risk aversion ' . )
Recent studies have emphasized that alcohol is the major problem on our highways , and that illicit drugs do not even come close to being as dangerous .
As funny as it may seem , you may be safer driving `stoned ' , as long as you are n't `totally blasted ' and seeing things -- but few users are irresponsible enough to drive in this state of mind , anyway .
Still , many people have reported making mistakes while driving because they were stoned .
There are those who think that marijuana is a major problem on the streets , because of a newspaper article or news story which they have seen which said a large number of people who were killed in driving accidents tested postive for marijuana use .
For various reasons , these studies are not reliable : o Some studies use drug tests which can only tell whether a person has used marijuana in the last month .
o
Some studies were done near colleges or other areas where drinking , marijuana use , and accidents are all very high , and they did not correct for age or alcohol use .
o
In many of the studies there were more stoned drivers killed -- but it was not their fault , and when the police ``culpability scores ' ' were factored in marijuana was not to blame for the accidents .
15 ) Are n't you afraid everyone will get hooked ?
Marijuana produces no withdrawal symptoms no matter how heavy it is used .
It is habit forming ( psychologically addictive ) , but not physically addictive .
The majority of people who quit marijuana do n't even have to think twice about it .
Comparing marijuana to addictive drugs is really quite silly .
For a drug to be physically addictive , it must be reinforcing , produce withdrawal symptoms , and produce tolerance .
Marijuana is reinforcing , because it feels good , but it does not do the other two things .
Caffeine , nicotine and alcohol are all physically addictive .
16a ) Is urine testing for marijuana use as a terms of employment a good idea ?
I want to make sure my business is run safely .
No !
Some of your most brilliant , hard working , and reliable employees are marijuana users .
When you drug test , you put all marijuana users in the same place as the abusers -- the unemployment line .
Drug testing is bad for business .
( Not to mention it is an invasion of privacy . )
If a worker has a drug problem , you can tell by testing how well he does his job .
Firing * all * the drug users who work for you will hurt your business , costs money , and will get people very mad at you -- and for what ?
There is n't even any hard evidence that marijuana users have more accidents or health problems .
Your employees will probably resent being drug tested ; drug testing allows an employer to govern the actions of an employee in his off time -- even when these actions do not effect his job performance .
( As told above , marijuana drug tests do not test whether a person is `high ' .
They test whether or not they have used in the last few weeks . )
Asking employees to urinate in a plastic cup every month is not a good way to make them feel like part of the business , or make friends , either .
There is growing concern about drug tests , sometimes because they misfire and accuse the wrong person , but mostly because they might be used to find out other confidential information about an employee .
Legal professionals are beginning to question whether they are even constitutional .
16 b ) Is n't all this worth the trouble , though , in order to reduce accident risks and health care costs ?
Everyone knows that marijuana users are bad employees , right ?
Wrong -- or at least someone forgot to tell the millions of hard working marijuana smokers that .
Drug testing companies will hand you piles of statistics which they say prove marijuana use costs you money .
The truth is there are just as many studies which show that marijuana users are more successful , use less health care , and produce more than non-users .
Before you buy into workplace drug testing , make sure you get the other side of the story .
In the 1980's , the Bush administration went to great lengths to promote drug testing .
In fact , George Bush estimated the cost of drug use at over 60 billion dollars a year , based on a study which supposedly showed that persons who had used marijuana at some time during their life were less successful .
The very same study could be used to show that current , heavy users of marijuana and other illegal drugs were actually more successful .
Something is a bit fishy here , and when you add to that the fact that several former heads of the DEA and former Drug Czars now own or work in the urinalysis industry , this whole scene begins to smell a bit funny .
17 ) Would n't it be best to just lock the users all up ?
How do you plan to pay for that ?
Already , well over five percent of the people in this country ( U.S ) are in custody ( including probation , parole , bail , etc. )
Murderers and rapists are being let out of our penatentiaries right now to make room for a few more `deadheads ' -- there are about 2,500 Grateful Dead fans in our federal prisons .
Imprisoning one person for one year costs about $ 20,000 .
The United States leads the world in imprisonment -- at any one time , 425 people out of every 100,000 are behind bars .
In the Federal Prison System , one fifth of the prisoners are drug offenders who have done nothing violent .
State laws are usually less strict , but state mandatory minumum sentences for drugs are getting more popular .
Our prisons and our courtrooms are so crowded that the American Bar Association 's annual report on the state of the Justice System is basically one long plea for an end to drug laws that imprison users .
Even the Clinton Administration recognizes that locking people up is not the solution .
This is especially true for the people who actually have drug abuse problems -- they need treatment , not mistreatment .
The Drug War put mandatory minimum jail sentences for drug crimes on the lawbooks .
If we do not take those laws ( at least ) back off , we will be in sorry shape come the end of the century .
A retroactive policy of marijuana legalization or decriminalization would go a long way in helping to solve this crisis .
Also consider this --
Once a person gets put in jail , he becomes angry with the world .
He will probably be victimized while he is there , and most likely will learn criminal behaviors from hard - core violent offenders .
There is also a very good chance that he will have caught AIDS or tuberculosis by the time he gets let back out .
By locking up drug users , you are digging yourself a very big trench to fall in -- is it worth it ?
Besides , lots of these people do n't deserve to be in jail .
Why should they serve time just because they like to get `high ' on marijuana ?
Especially when someone can drink alcohol without being arrested ... what kind of law is that ?
You have to think about what kind of a world you are making for yourself before you act .
How are the police of the future going to treat the people ?
How far are you willing to let the government go to get the drug users ?
How many of your own rights will you sacrifice by trying to jail ` the druggies ' ?
18 ) I heard that there are over 400 chemicals in marijuana ...
Wellllll ...?
True , but so what ?
There are also over 400 chemicals in many foods , ( including coffee , which contains over 800 chemicals and many rat carcinogens ) and we do n't see police arresting people in McDonald 's , or giving Driving while Eating citations .
Only THC is very psycho-active ; a few other chemicals also have very small degrees of psycho-activity .
People who use marijuana do not get sick more , or die earlier , or lose their jobs ( except to drug tests ) , or have mutant kids ... so what 's your point ?
The fact that there are over 60 unique chemicals in cannabis , called `cannabinoids , ' is something that scientists find very interesting .
Many of these cannabinoids may have valuable effects as medicine .
For example , `cannabinol ' is a cannabinoid which can help people with insomnia .
Doctors think that this chemical is why most patients prefer to use marijuana rather than pure Delta - 9 - THC pills ( called dronabinol ) -- the cannabinol takes the edge off being `high ' and calms the nerves .
Another cannabinoid , `cannabidiolic acid ' , is a very effective anti-biotic , like pennicillin .
Many of these chemicals can be extracted from marijuana without any fancy laboratory equipment .
19 ) Does n't that stuff mess up your immune system and make it easier for you catch colds ?
Marijuana ( Delta - nine - THC ) does have an `immunosuppressive effect . '
It acts on certain cells in the liver , called macrophages , in much the same way that it acts on brain cells .
Instead of stimulating the cells , though , it shuts them off .
This effect is temporary ( just like the `high ' ) and goes away quickly ; people who suffer from multiple sclerosis may actually find this effect useful in fighting the disease .
Recent research has also found that marijuana metabolites are left over in the lungs for up to seven months after the smoking has stopped .
While they are there , the immune system of the lungs may be affected ( but the macrophages do not get ``turned off ' ' like in the liver . )
The effects of smoking itself are probably worse than the effects of the THC , and last just as long .
All this said , doctors still have not decided whether marijuana users are at risk for colds or not .
With the possible exception of bronchitis , there are no numbers which suggest that marijuana users catch more colds , but ... this did not stop Carlton Turner , a United States Drug Czar , from saying many times in his public addresses that marijuana caused AIDS and homosexuality .
His claims were so ridiculus that the Washington Post and Newsweek Magazine made fun of him , and he was forced to resign .
Today , AIDS patients use marijuana to treat their symptoms without any aparrent problems .
Some studies suggest that marijuana may actually stimulate certain forms of immunity .
Researchers have tried to show major effects on the healthy human 's immune system , but if marijuana does have any substantial effects , good or bad , they are either too subtle or too small to notice .

P A R T F O U R --------------------------
WHY IS IT STILL ILLEGAL ?
1 ) Why is it STILL illegal ? :
The official answer : Because you should n't use it .
You ca n't use it because it is illegal , and it is illegal so you can't use it .
You should not use it .
It is illegal .
It is illegal so you should not use it .
The manic - depressive answer : It 'll never happen .
People are too unorganized / stupid / disempowered .
It 's just futility .
Try , but do n't expect to get anywhere .
I wo n't get my hopes up .
The paranoid - schizophrenic answer : Do n't you SEE ?!?!?
The guys at the top have it SEWN !!
They own everything .
They 'll never let it happen .
I should n't even be talking to you , but let me give you some advice !!
listen ... you should n't mess with THEM , THEY know everything .
THEY are practically psychic , see ?
And the only way to get it to happen is to become one of THEM .
You 'd better watch it , or THEY will come and take you away -- THEY do that , you know .
It 's all a CONSPIRACY !!!
The neurotic answer : Marijuana ?
Eeek !
Do n't you know that stuff is dangerous ?
People do n't make laws for no good reason , you know !
Where did you hear about marijuana ?
Wait !
Do n't tell me , I do n't want to know .
If anybody even knew you thought it should be legal -- well -- they 'd never talk to you again !
Do n't you know that marijuana this ... marijuana that ... ... ... ...
THE REAL ANSWER : Marijuana is still illegal because enough people have not yet stood up together and said : `` THIS IS STUPID !!
I WANT CANNABIS HEMP LEGAL !!!
FOR PRODUCTS ; FOR MEDICINE ; FOR FOOD ; FOR FUN ; FOR GOODNESS'S SAKE !
ISN'T THAT WHAT LIFE'S ALL ABOUT ?!''
Without large - scale grass roots support , marijuana will never be legal .
Every person that stands up for marijuana / hemp legalization makes us that much stronger , and our voices that much louder .
Believe me , we appreciate all the support we get .
Almost as importantly , it makes it that much harder for people to say ``that 's a stupid idea ' ' or ``nobody really believes that . ''
If you are n't convinced yet , Or if you are having trouble swallowing any of the answers given , I encourage you to learn more about the issues .
Try the sources listed at the end .
If you 're with us , let us know !
Let everybody know , unless it will get you canned or arrested , but most importantly , keep an eye on what 's going on , and try to lend a hand when you can .
Also , know your stuff , so if you have to , you can convince a friend or loved one that * you * are not nuts -- the rest of the world is .
2 ) What can I do to bring some sense into our marijuana laws ?
There are many things you can do .
Activists are working right now at all levels to reform marijuana laws .
If you cannot afford to be an activist , there are many ways you can help -- activists find themselves short of money , time , and occasionally even friendly company .
Get to know a hemp or marijuana legalization activists in your area , and just keep up to date on what they are planning .
Odds are you will find something that you can easily do which will help them out a whole lot .
There is a list available called the Liberty Activist 's List which will give you the phone numbers or address of groups near you .
Also , you may call the National Office of NORML ( The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ) at 1-202-483-5500 .
The most important thing you can do on your own , though , is to keep tabs on your state and local legislators , and let them know that this is an issue to be taken seriously .
Many activist groups offer `memberships . '
These usually involve a fee for joining the group , and a newsletter that keeps you up to date on the group 's activities .
This way you know when and why to write your legislators , and thought provoking information which you normally would not get is delivered to you .
If and when you need to , most importantly , you will be able to contact the group and seek or give advice .
3a ) Where can I get more information ?
Many places .
One of the best is by using electronic communications .
The Information Superhighway has been a tremendous leap forwards for our movement , and there is a lot of information available .
Start by sending e-mail to " ( {{{readme}}} ) < verdant@twain.ucs.umass.edu > " .
There is an e-mail file - server set up at this address , and just about anyone with Internet e-mail can use it .
The server contains many files about marijuana , and more importantly directories and pointers on how to get more information by WWW , GOPHER , FTP , IRC , and TELNET .
For a overview list of these resources send mail to " ({{{netlinks}}} ) < verdant@twain.ucs.umass.edu > " .
If you have trouble making this work , send a note asking for help to " verdant@twain.ucs.umass.edu "
A copy of the Liberty Activist 's List is also available through this server , by mailing to " ( {{{groups}}} ) < verdant@twain.ucs.umass.edu >. "
This will help you get in touch with activists near you .
If you are interested , there is an excellent mailing list devoted to Drug War issues .
It is called DRCnet and you may send mail to " borden@netcom.com " for information on becoming involved .
3 b ) Umm , I 'm computer illiterate , so that just went way over my head .

Tens of thousands of travellers are scrambling for alternative transportation today after VIA Rail Canada halted all train departures when its engineers officially walked off the job at noon .
Negotiations between VIA and its 340 engineeers hit an impasse early this morning .
But VIA started cancelling service in anticipation of a strike earlier this week .
" It 's now the mediator 's role to work with the parties , " said VIA spokeswoman Ashley Doyle .
Travellers like Vita Little were able to board VIA - chartered buses to their destinations yesterday .
The Toronto woman was at Union Station heading to Montreal for a birthday party .
But without a train , she did n't know how she would be coming home Sunday .
" It 's very disappointing .
The train is just a nice way to travel , " said Little .
Meantime , about 2,000 other VIA employees , members of the CAW , are expecting to be out of work within days , according to an official from their union .
About 80 per cent of those ticket agents , maintenance and on - board service workers will be out of work " imminently " with 20 per cent remaining to handle passenger refunds and put equipment away , he said .
According to Teamsters Canada Rail Conference , the union representing Via locomotive engineers and yardmasters , their members have been without a contract since Dec. 31 , 2006 .
Following a 21 - day " cooling - off " period , its members voted 91.2 per cent in favour of a strike .
Some of the outstanding issues include job security .
In a written statement released last week , the union claimed that Via has been demanding the implementation of an antiquated crew utilization procedure which , they say , creates uncertainty about when a locomotive engineer would be scheduled to work .
Wage and benefits are also a major request .
Intense negotiations have been under way for the past four days with the assistance of a federally appointed mediator .
Talks continued overnight but ended around 1 a.m. , when Via Rail said that both parties had reached deadlock .
Trains on the Sudbury - White River and Victoria - Courtenay routes will remain in service , as they are operated by third parties on Via 's behalf .
For more information , call Via at 1-888-VIA - RAIL ( 842-7245 ) .

This has been a public service announcement from Ian Stewart .
ANN ARBOR , Mich . --
An analysis of almost 20,000 patient records from the Southwest Oncology Group 's database of clinical trials finds , for the first time , that African - American breast , ovarian , and prostate cancer patients tend to die earlier than patients of other races even when they get identical medical treatment and other confounding socioeconomic factors are controlled for .
The finding points to biological or host genetic factors as the potential source of the survival gap .
" When you look at the dialogue about the issue of race and cancer survival that 's gone on over the years , " says the paper 's lead author , Kathy Albain , M.D. , a breast and lung cancer specialist at Loyola University 's Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center , " it always seems to come down to general conclusions that African - Americans may in part have poorer access to quality treatment , may be diagnosed in later stages , and may not have the same standard of care delivered as Caucasian patients , leading to a disparity in survival . "
The study , to be published online by the Journal of the National Cancer Institute ( JNCI ) on July 7 , found that when treatment was uniform and differences in tumor prognostic factors , demographics , and socioeconomic status were controlled , there was in fact no statistically significant difference in survival based on race for a number of other cancers -- lung , colon , lymphoma , leukemia , and multiple myeloma .
" The good news is that for most common cancers , " Albain says , " if you get good treatment , your survival is the same regardless of race .
But this is not the case for breast , ovarian , and prostate cancers . "
Even with good treatment by the same doctors , African - American patients with one of these three cancers faced a significantly higher risk of death than did other patients , ranging from a 21 % higher risk for those with prostate cancer to a 61 % higher risk for ovarian cancer patients .
The elimination of treatment and socioeconomic factors as the cause of this higher mortality " implicates biology , " says study co-author Dawn L. Hershman , M.D. , of the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons .
" There may be differences in genetic factors by race that alter the metabolism of chemotherapy drugs or that make cancers more resistant or more aggressive , " she adds .
Hershman published a smaller study last month that found that , at least with breast cancer , disparities in survival based on race persist even after adjusting for differences in treatment .
That study , published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology , analyzed data on 634 breast cancer patients .
" Our study of multiple cancers is distinguished from others that have looked at race - based disparities by its size and by the source of its data , " says Joseph Unger of the Southwest Oncology Group 's Statistical Center , who was statistician and co-author on the new JNCI study .
The study analyzed records from 35 clinical trials - going back as far as 1974 - that had been conducted by the Southwest Oncology Group , an NCI - sponsored cooperative group headquartered at the University of Michigan .
Using data from clinical trials , which are already controlled for a range of potentially confounding factors such as differences in diagnosis , treatment , and follow - up , helps throw the remaining factors into sharper relief , according to Frank L. Meyskens , Jr. , M.D .
" It 's because of the similar way that people are treated on clinical trials that these differences are even detectable , " he says .
Meyskens is associate chair for Cancer Control and Prevention for the Southwest Oncology Group and director of the University of California - Irvine 's Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center .
The urgency of addressing the reasons for racial disparities in outcomes - both sociological and biological - is amplified by another recent study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology .
It predicts the cancer incidence among minorities will nearly double in the coming decades , increasing 99 % by 2030 compared to an expected 31 % increase among whites .
And the American Society of Clinical Oncology , the field 's premier professional organization , recently issued a " Disparities in Cancer Care " policy statement that recommends a set of strategies for improving outcomes for minority cancer patients .
" The elimination of socioeconomic and healthcare access disparities must be a priority in the United States , " says Lisa Newman , M.D. , director of the Breast Care Center at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center .
" However , Dr. Albain 's landmark study demonstrates that further investigation of race - or ethnicity - associated differences in primary tumor biology is also important . "

John Crowley , Ph.D. , of the Southwest Oncology Group Statistical Center and Charles A. Coltman , M.D. , of the University of Texas Health Science Center were also coauthors of the study , which was funded by the National Cancer Institute .
The Southwest Oncology Group ( swog.org ) is one of the largest cancer clinical trials cooperative groups in the United States .
Funded primarily by the National Cancer Institute , the group designs and conducts clinical trials to advance the science of cancer prevention and treatment and to improve the quality of life for cancer survivors .

A County Londonderry pensioner who has lived without electricity for 27 years has been told Northern Ireland Electricity will charge him £ 67,000 to link his home to the grid .
John McCarter , 74 , has no central heating at his Downhill home and uses bottled gas and candles for light .
The company said the high cost was due to cables having to go underground in an area of special scientific interest .
Mr McCarter said his bones were " starting to feel the cold now " .
" When I wake in the morning , if it 's a good morning the thermometer on the wall will read two degrees , " he said .
" If it 's a bad morning , it 'll be below zero . "
His house on Seacoast Road is one of several properties which have been without electricity since they were built .
He said he stayed in the house because he likes the cliffs and the beach , but three years ago he decided he would make it more comfortable .
" In 2006 , I thought I 'd see about getting electricity .
" It was quite a job - I had to draw up plans of the house myself , and send all the information to Northern Ireland Electricity .
" They then came back to me and said it would cost £ 67,000 .

" I 'm on just over £ 100 a week with my pension , and I have to keep coal in two fires and feed myself , so there is n't much left over . "
But despite this setback , Mr McCarter said he has not given up hope that he will finally have electricity in his home .
" This is along the main A2 road - it 's not as if I 'm living in the sticks , " he said .
" In this day and age , it 's just not acceptable . "
A spokesperson for NIE said the company 's current charging policy was reviewed and agreed annually by the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation to ensure the most equitable arrangement for all their customers .
" In this instance Mr McCarter lives near an Area of Special Scientific Interest and NIE is restricted in the type of network which can be built .
" We would have to lay an underground cable to provide a connection and these are the costs associated with this length of undergrounding . "

The VARYAP Meridian Project , which was unveiled in Istanbul , the largest city in Turkey , recently has been described as Turkey ’s “ most green ” development .
A mixed - use , super - development which will house Istanbul ’s new financial and business district , the project is located the Atasehir district .
It ’s been designed by RMJM , based in New York and Istanbul and is considered by many as a model for future green development .
The VARYAP Meridian Project has been designed as per LEED standards and after “ carefully analysing ” the site to take advantage of the surrounding topography , context and climate , according to the developers .
The project is a 60 - storey tower comprising 1,500 residential units , a 5 - star hotel , offices , conference facilities as well as landscaped public areas and parking spaces .
The residential part of the VARYAP Meridian Project will have an array of options ranging from posh 5 - bedroom penthouse apartments to small studio apartments .
It indends to serve 20,000 people , should to cost $ 1 billion and scheduled to be completed in 2011 .
The special features of the green project include several sustainable factors such as sites for collecting rainwater , facilities to optimise water usage and cut energy consumption , cooling water pools that add to the external landscape , wind - turbines , as well as a co-generation plant that will generate electricity for the development .

Sometimes you really have to wonder what planet CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer lives on .
On his show The Situation Room , Blitzer put forth the thought that John McCain could become the new Ted Kennedy in the United States Senate .
Blitzer seemed to ignore the fact that McCain has gotten more bitter and partisan since he lost the election to Obama .
Here is the video from Media Matters :

Blitzer said , “ I was talking earlier with some friends , and I asked who might emerge as the new Ted Kennedy in the United States Senate .
You know who a lot of people think it might be ?
Someone else who sought the presidency , lost , and decided , you know what , my life ’s work will now be the Senate , and that could be Senator McCain was a very good friend , has been a very good friend of Sen. Kennedy .
We ’ll see if that becomes the passion that became the passion of Sen.
Kennedy after he lost to Jimmy Carter , the Democratic presidential nomination back in 1980 . ”
My favorite part of this clip is that you can hear someone off camera saying , “ That is kind of hard to believe . ”
Now it could have been somebody on their cell phone , or an unrelated off camera conversation , but I agree it is kind of hard to believe that McCain , who has the polar opposite temperament of Kennedy could replace him .
I think Wolf Blitzer needs to get some more intelligent “ friends . ”
No one believes that the 72 year old McCain could ever fill Ted Kennedy ’s role in the Senate .
Currently , McCain more seems more preoccupied with holding off a right wing challenger in next year ’s Republican primary for his Senate seat .
Wolf believes that McCain could replace Kennedy because they both lost presidential campaigns , and they / were old .
Blitzer is an unabashed McCain fan , but it hysterical for him to suggest that McCain could fill Kennedy ’s role , because Kennedy was a liberal , while McCain is a conservative .
John Kerry also lost a presidential campaign , so let ’s say that he can fill the Kennedy role too .
Blitzer ’s idea is just plain dumb .
I think Kennedy was unique .
I doubt that anyone will be able to fill his role , which is what makes his loss so significant .

Lawyers acting for Mohamed , who is accused of terrorism offences , say there are strong grounds for believing the UK security and intelligence services hold the evidence .
But the Government is refusing to release it .

The Obama administration is fighting on multiple fronts - in courts in San Francisco , Washington and London - to keep an official veil of secrecy over the treatment of a former prisoner who says he was tortured at Guantanamo Bay .
The administration has asked a federal appeals court in San Francisco to reconsider its ruling allowing Binyam Mohamed and four other former or current prisoners to sue a Bay Area company for allegedly flying them to overseas torture chambers for the CIA .
Obama administration lawyers also argued that Mohamed 's attorneys had violated secrecy procedures by writing a letter to President Obama , accompanied by a blacked - out document , asking him to disclose their client 's treatment .
A federal judge ordered Mohamed 's lawyers to answer contempt - of - court charges in May that were punishable by up to six months in jail , but has since dropped those charges .
Most recently , a British government lawyer told her nation 's High Court last month that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton had threatened to limit U.S. intelligence - sharing with Great Britain if the court disclosed details of Mohamed 's treatment in Guantanamo .
The British court declared in August 2008 that there was evidence Mohamed had been tortured , but deleted the details from its public version of the ruling at the Bush administration 's insistence .
The court is now considering requests from lawyers for Mohamed and the news media to make the details public in a case over alleged British participation in his mistreatment .
According to a transcript of the court 's July 29 hearing , Lord Justice John Thomas said there was " nothing in the paragraphs ( about the U.S. government 's treatment of Mohamed ) that could conceivably identify anything that is of a national security interest . "
Jeppesen sued
Mohamed , 30 , an Ethiopian refugee and British resident , was arrested in Pakistan in 2002 and turned over to U.S. authorities as a suspected terrorist and Taliban fighter .
He said he was tortured in Morocco , where guards slashed his genitals with a razor blade , and in a CIA prison in Afghanistan , where he was beaten , hung from a pole and held in darkness and isolation .
He was sent to Guantanamo in September 2004 .
He and four other men have sued Jeppesen Dataplan , a San Jose subsidiary of the Boeing Co. , for its alleged role in arranging their flights for the CIA .
A Council of Europe report in 2007 described Jeppesen as the CIA 's aviation services provider .
Suit reinstated
The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco reinstated the suit in April , rejecting arguments originally made by the Bush administration that the case posed grave risks to national security .
Obama administration lawyers endorsed those arguments at a hearing in February and have asked the court for a rehearing .
Mohamed 's lawyers , Clive Stafford Smith and Ahmad Ghappour of the British human - rights group Reprieve , were threatened with jail after drafting a letter to Obama in February urging him to release the evidence of their client 's treatment in U.S. custody or to authorize Britain to do so .
The lawyers said a Defense Department review team refused to let them provide a summary of the classified evidence to Obama , so they sent him a blacked - out sheet instead and released both documents to the press .
But government lawyers said Mohamed 's attorneys misled the review team about their plans and misled the public by accusing the team of concealing information from the president .
Contempt charges
Citing the government 's accusations , U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan of Washington ordered Mohamed 's attorneys to appear before him in May and face contempt charges , punishable by up to six months in jail , for allegedly violating terms of the agreement that allowed them to gain access to Guantanamo prisoners .
But after further arguments , Hogan said there had been misunderstandings by both sides and no violation .
The Justice Department declined comment on the case last week .
A very successful lawyer parked his brand - new Lexus in front of his office , ready to show it off to his colleagues .
As he got out , a truck passed too close and completely tore off the door on the driver 's side .
The lawyer immediately grabbed his cell phone , dialed 911 , and within minutes a policeman pulled up .
Before the officer had a chance to ask any questions , the lawyer started screaming hysterically .
His Lexus , which he had just picked up the day before , was now completely ruined and would never be the same , no matter what the body shop did to it .
When the lawyer finally wound down from his ranting and raving , the officer shook his head in disgust and disbelief ...
" I can't believe how materialistic you lawyers are , " he said .
" You are so focused on your possessions that you do n't notice anything else .
" " How can you say such a thing ? " asked the lawyer .
The cop replied , " Do n't you know that your left arm is missing from the elbow down ?
It must have been torn off when the truck hit you . "
" Oh my God ! " screamed the lawyer .
" Where 's my Rolex ? "
