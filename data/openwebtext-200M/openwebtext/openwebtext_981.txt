Six Metropolitan police officers have been suspended from duty following ­allegations they used a form of water - based torture on suspected drugs ­smugglers , it emerged last night .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) said it was investigating the conduct of officers based in Enfield , north London , during drugs raids in the borough last November .
Neither the IPCC nor Scotland Yard would comment on the nature of the ­allegations but sources said the officers were accused of pushing suspects ' heads into buckets of water .
One IPCC document is said to use the word " waterboarding " – the CIA technique condemned as torture by Barack Obama – in connection with the allegations .
The torture claims are part of an ­investigation which also includes accusations that evidence was fabricated and suspects ' property was stolen .
It has already led to the abandonment of a drug trial , it was reported last night .
The IPCC is examining the conduct of six officers connected to drug raids in ­November in which four men and a woman were arrested in Enfield and Tottenham , north London .
Police said they found a large amount of cannabis and the suspects were charged with importation of a class C drug .
The case was abandoned four months later when the Crown Prosecution Service said " it would not have been in the public interest to proceed " .
Last night the Times reported that any trial , by revealing the torture claims , would have compromised the criminal investigation into the six officers .
None of the officers under suspicion has been arrested , but the IPCC said last night : " This is an ongoing criminal investigation and as such all six officers will be criminally interviewed under caution . "
A Scotland Yard spokesman said a police employee had raised concerns about the conduct of officers during an internal investigation into allegations of mishandling of property .
He described the allegations as serious and raising real concern , saying they would be treated seriously .
" The Met does not tolerate conduct which falls below the standards that the public and the many outstanding Met officers and staff expect .
Any allegations of such behaviour are treated very seriously , as this case illustrates , and if found true the strongest possible action will be taken . "
I am somewhat uncomfortable with stereotypes of the male and female thought process , but this is a stereotype of the lumberjack thought process , and I am entirely comfortable with that .

ROME , Italy ( CNN ) -- Scientific tests prove bones housed in the Basilica of St. Paul in Rome are those of the apostle St. Paul himself , according to Pope Benedict XVI .
Pope Benedict XVI looks at the tomb of St. Paul at the Basilica of St. Paul in Rome in 2007 .
" Tiny fragments of bone " in the sarcophagus were subjected to carbon dating , showing they " belong to someone who lived in the first or second century , " the pope said in a homily carried on Italian television .
" This seems to confirm the unanimous and undisputed tradition that these are the mortal remains of the Apostle St. Paul , " Benedict said in Sunday 's announcement .
The tomb also holds " traces of a precious linen cloth , purple in color and laminated with pure gold , and a blue colored textile with linen filaments , " the pope said .
The tests were carried out by inserting a probe into a small opening in the sarcophagus , " which had not been opened for many centuries , " the pontiff said .
The probe " also revealed the presence of grains of red incense and traces of protein and limestone . "
Separately , archaeologists have uncovered an image of St. Paul which " could be considered the oldest icon of the apostle known to date , " the Vatican 's official newspaper reported Sunday .
The painting , in the St. Tecla Catacomb , is " among the oldest and best - defined figures from ancient Christianity , " according to the Pontifical Commission for Sacred Archaeology , L'Osservatore Romano reported .
St. Paul is one of the most significant figures in Christianity .
Originally a persecutor of early Christians , he became a follower of Jesus after seeing a vision on the road to Damascus , according to Christian tradition .
" Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting me ? " the vision of Jesus asks Paul , using the apostle 's birth name , in the Acts of the Apostles .
Saul then took the name Paul and became a missionary .
His letters , or epistles , to early Christian communities around the Mediterranean form a significant portion of the New Testament .
Paul was beheaded by Roman authorities sometime between 65 and 67 A.D. , according to the Catholic Church .
He was buried a few miles away , and when the Roman Empire stopped persecuting Christians some 250 years later , the Emperor Constantine had a basilica built over his grave .
It currently lies under a marble tombstone bearing the Latin inscription PAULO APOSTOLO MART ( Apostle Paul , martyr ) , according to the Web site of the basilica .
A papal altar stands over the tombstone , which is visible through a window - like opening , the Web site says .
Monday marks the end of a year of celebration in honor of the 2,000th anniversary of St. Paul 's birth .
It also happens to be the feast day of Saints Peter and Paul .

Jackie Chan may be good at kung fu , but he sometimes takes aim at the wrong targets .
Take his recent head - punch to the democratic ideals enjoyed in Hong Kong and Taiwan .
" I 'm not sure if it 's good to have freedom or not , " he told an audience at a regional economic forum in southern China Saturday .
" If you 're too free , you 're like the way Hong Kong is now .
It 's very chaotic .
Taiwan is also chaotic . "
He continued : " I 'm gradually beginning to feel that we Chinese need to be controlled .
If we 're not being controlled , we 'll just do what we want . "
Mr. Chan , a Hong - Kong born actor of " Rush Hour " fame , is n't the first to claim that Asians would rather have prosperity and stability than political freedoms .
( Think Singapore . )
This implies , wrongly , that Asians are somehow incapable of genuine self - rule and need to be " led " by their superiors .
It also ignores the vast economic gains made by free nations compared with their authoritarian counterparts .
Mr. Chan has in the past spoken out against Beijing 's massacre of democracy advocates in Tiananmen Square on June 4 , 1989 .
In recent years , however , the actor has softened his position on China 's leadership .
In 2004 , he called Taiwan 's presidential election a " joke , " although he later apologized .
Mr. Chan 's latest comments were denounced in Hong Kong and Taiwan .
" It 's really shameless , " Hong Kong legislator Leung Kwok - hung said , " his success in Hong Kong was the product of the freedom of expression [ here ] . "
In Taiwan , Bi-Khim Hsiao , international affairs director for the Democratic Progressive Party , called the comments " counterproductive to all the efforts of the many freedom fighters around the region . "
Neither government dignified Mr. Chan 's jabs with a formal response .

It seems the CPU - Z team is hard at work and planning on bringing some big updates with the 1.52 update that the plan to release sometime in the next month .
First on the list of new features is the new Graphics tab .
This will provide basic GPU information within CPU -Z , although it is already reported on the validation page .
Second is that there will now be a native 64 - bit version of the application , which many have been asking the team to release for quite some time now .
Third , the CPU - Z window has been widened a little bit to accomodate Intel 's new , slightly wider , logos .
Finally , CPU- Z will have a new Validate button at the bottom of the window .
This should make it a little easier to submit validation information .
Abdul Matin , 35 , went to Malaysia as the prospect of employment and good fortune beckoned him but he returned stony - broke and almost crippled for no fault of his own .
Matin was meted out Malaysia 's second highest form of punishment - judicial caning -- in which he was dealt out strokes with thicker rotan cane that almost damaged his spinal cord .
He was punished , as he did not have a work permit that his employer was supposed to arrange , otherwise he maintained every legal procedure to go to Malaysia .
He returned home on April 21 after 20 months of stay in Malaysia .
The strokes of rotan canes rendered him unfit for any hard work .
Moreover , his poor financial condition made the matter worse as he cannot see a doctor .
A miserable living because of non-payment and low wages for months made him a weakling .
Caning with thicker rotan causes infertility along with numbness from the waist downwards that lasts until some time after , according to Wikipedia , a free encyclopedia .
“ As I got up from bed the next morning my head was spinning ; I felt severe pain in my spinal cord and my penis hurts while urinating , ” Matin who hails from Chowddagram of Comilla told The Daily Star .
He said his wife had walked out on him , as he could not anymore eke out a living .
“ My life is in ruin for no reasons .
My parents are also not in a position to help me , ” said Matin , a father of three children .
Matin went to Malaysia through the recruiting agency Shimon Overseas -- to work in an electric company .
As he landed in Kuala Lumpur , the Malaysian outsourcing company - Sepang Nusa SDN BHD -- ' sold ' him along with 32 other Bangladeshis to a company in Johor Baru .
They were later ' sold ' twice and their monthly wage was a meager Malaysian Ringgit 200 to 300 , which was too small for a moderate living .
Moreover , the jobs were also not regular .
Besides , Matin was not provided with any work permit .
To make things worse , the outsourcing company that hired them retained their passports .
He said they repeatedly called Ohid , agent of Shimon Overseas in Kuala Lumpur , to make sure that he is provided with a work permit , but Ohid never acted positively .
After one year when the workers were ' sold ' to a Malaysian employer - Azmiri , he told Matin , after a medical test , that he and two others were not medically fit .
Fearing arrest , he went to the office of Ohid in Kuala Lumpur on November 21 last year only to be denied access to the office .
Mizan , a compatriot , sheltered him in his residence , which was near a project where several hundred workers from India , Indonesia and Bangladesh stayed .
“ It was around 1:30 pm .
Suddenly police raided that area and arrested around 300 workers including me , ” Matin said .
As arrestees were produced before a court it granted him a month remand .
After the remand he was sentenced to four months ' imprisonment and three rotan lashings .
March 21 was fixed for lashing .
There were over 150 Indian , Indonesian and Bangladeshi workers for the punishment .
Around 20 were Bangladeshis , Matin added .
“ I was tethered to a ladder - like structure ; as the first rotan hit me , it felt as if the earth shuddered beneath my feet ; a wave of pain passed through my spine ; I remained unconscious for seven hours ; I could n't feel the next two strikes , ” Matin recalled .
Scientists at the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) have developed an efficient method to detect entanglement shared among multiple parts of an optical system .
They show how entanglement , in the form of beams of light simultaneously propagating along four distinct paths , can be detected with a surprisingly small number of measurements .
Entanglement is an essential resource in quantum information science , which is the study of advanced computation and communication based on the laws of quantum mechanics .
In the May 8 issue of the journal Science , H. Jeff Kimble , the William L. Valentine Professor and professor of physics at Caltech , and his colleagues demonstrate for the first time that quantum uncertainty relations can be used to identify entangled states of light that are only available in the realm of quantum mechanics .
Their approach builds on the famous Heisenberg uncertainty principle , which places a limit on the precision with which the momentum and position of a particle can be known simultaneously .
Entanglement , which lies at the heart of quantum physics , is a state in which the parts of a composite system are more strongly correlated than is possible for any classical counterparts , regardless of the distances separating them .
Entanglement in a system with more than two parts , or multipartite entanglement , is a critical tool for diverse applications in quantum information science , such as for quantum metrology , computation , and communication .
In the future , a " quantum internet " will rely on entanglement for the teleportation of quantum states from place to place ( for a recent review see H. J. Kimble , Nature 453 , 1023 ( 2008 ) ) .
" For some time physicists have studied the entanglement of two parts — or bipartite entanglement — and techniques for classifying and detecting the entanglement between two parts of a composite system are well known , " says Scott Papp , a postdoctoral scholar and one of the authors of the paper .
" But that has n't been the case for multipartite states .
Since they contain more than two parts , their classification is much richer , but detecting their entanglement is extremely challenging . "
In the Caltech experiment , a pulse of light was generated containing a single photon — a massless bundle , with both wave - like and particle - like properties , that is the basic unit of electromagnetic radiation .
The team split the single photon to generate an entangled state of light in which the quantum amplitudes for the photon propagate among four distinct paths , all at once .
This so - called W state plays an important role in quantum information science .

To enable future applications of multipartite W states , the entanglement contained in them must be detected and characterized .
This task is complicated by the fact that entanglement in W states can be found not only among all the parts , but also among a subset of them .
To distinguish between these two cases in real - world experiments , coauthors Steven van Enk and Pavel Luogovski from the University of Oregon developed a novel approach to entanglement detection based on the uncertainty principle .
( See also the recent theoretical article by van Enk , Lougovski , and the Caltech group , " Verifying multi- partite mode entanglement of W states " at http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/0903.0851.)
The demonstration of the detection of entanglement in multipartite W states is the key breakthrough of the Caltech group 's work .
The new approach to entanglement detection makes use of non-local measurements of a photon propagating through all four paths .
The measurements indicate whether a photon is present , but give no information about which path it takes .
" The quantum uncertainty associated with these measurements has allowed us to estimate the level of correlations among the four paths through which a single photon simultaneously propagates , by comparing to the minimum uncertainty possible for any less entangled states , " says Kyung Soo Choi , a Caltech graduate student and one of the authors of the paper .
advertisement
Correlations of the paths above a certain level signify entanglement among all the pathways ; even partially entangled W states do not attain a similar level of correlation .
A key feature of this approach is that only a relatively small number of measurements must be performed .
Due to their fundamental structure , the entanglement of W states persists even in the presence of some sources of noise .
This is an important feature for real - world applications of W states in noisy environments .
The Caltech experiments have directly tested this property by disturbing the underlying correlations of the entangled state .
When the correlations are purposely weakened , there is a reduction in the number of paths of the optical system that are entangled .
And yet , as predicted by the structure of W states , the entanglement remains amongst a subset of the paths .
" Our work introduces a new protocol for detecting an important class of entanglement with single photons , " Papp explains .
" It signifies the ever - increasing degree of control we have in the laboratory to study and manipulate quantum states of light and matter . "
Next , the researchers plan to apply their technique to entangled states of atoms .
These efforts will build upon previous advances in the Caltech Quantum Optics Group , including the mapping of photonic entanglement to and from a quantum memory , and the distribution of entanglement amongst the nodes of a quantum network .
A new type of air - fuelled battery could give up to ten times the energy storage of designs currently available .
This step - change in capacity could pave the way for a new generation of electric cars , mobile phones and laptops .
The research work , funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ( EPSRC ) , is being led by researchers at the University of St Andrews with partners at Strathclyde and Newcastle .
The new design has the potential to improve the performance of portable electronic products and give a major boost to the renewable energy industry .
The batteries will enable a constant electrical output from sources such as wind or solar , which stop generating when the weather changes or night falls .
Improved capacity is thanks to the addition of a component that uses oxygen drawn from the air during discharge , replacing one chemical constituent used in rechargeable batteries today .
Not having to carry the chemicals around in the battery offers more energy for the same size battery .
Reducing the size and weight of batteries with the necessary charge capacity has been a long - running battle for developers of electric cars .
The STAIR ( St Andrews Air ) cell should be cheaper than today ’s rechargeables , too .
The new component is made of porous carbon , which is far less expensive than the lithium cobalt oxide it replaces .
This four - year research project , which reaches its halfway mark in July , builds on the discovery at the university that the carbon component ’s interaction with air can be repeated , creating a cycle of charge and discharge .
Subsequent work has more than tripled the capacity to store charge in the STAIR cell .
Principal investigator on the project , Professor Peter Bruce of the Chemistry Department at the University of St Andrews , says : “ Our target is to get a five to ten fold increase in storage capacity , which is beyond the horizon of current lithium batteries .
Our results so far are very encouraging and have far exceeded our expectations . ”
“ The key is to use oxygen in the air as a re-agent , rather than carry the necessary chemicals around inside the battery , ” says Bruce .
The oxygen , which will be drawn in through a surface of the battery exposed to air , reacts within the pores of the carbon to discharge the battery .
“ Not only is this part of the process free , the carbon component is much cheaper than current technology , ” says Bruce .
He estimates that it will be at least five years before the STAIR cell is commercially available .
The project is focused on understanding more about how the chemical reaction of the battery works and investigating how to improve it .
The research team is also working towards making a STAIR cell prototype suited , in the first instance , for small applications , such as mobile phones or MP3 players .
The property tax might be the most loathed tax in America .
During the 1970s , a number of activists — angry that their tax burdens were rising as their neighborhoods became more desirable — pushed to abolish it altogether .
President Nixon proposed significantly reducing state property taxes by implementing a federal consumption tax that would fund public education across the country .
But when this proved a lost cause , the masses sought instead to strictly limit annual property - tax increases through a series of ballot initiatives .
The result has n’t been pretty .
Chronic revenue shortfalls have crippled local governments ever since , leading to heavier reliance on punishing state income and sales taxes .
What if the problem is n’t the property tax at all but rather , well , all other taxes ?
In 1879 , Henry George , a brilliant if slightly crankish autodidact , published Progress and Poverty , a scathing polemic that blamed all economic ills on the private ownership of land .
A staunch believer in laissez - faire economics , George found it perverse that we tax productive activities like work and innovative investment while letting landowners grow rich simply because they scooped up property at the right time .
In that spirit , George called for a “ Single Tax ” on the unimproved value of land .
There ’s a certain compelling logic to the Single Tax that stands the test of time .
When you tax income , are n’t you punishing people for working hard ?
But when you tax an asset like land , you ’re simply encouraging the most valuable use of that land .
In the years since George faded from the scene , a number of economists , from Milton Friedman to Paul Romer , have found virtue in the Single Tax , not least because it creates the right incentives for government .
Simply put , the better you govern , the more valuable the property .
The more valuable the property , the more revenue you raise .

TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) --
He 's been labeled by many as the " reformist , " a man who can take Iran beyond the truculent anti-Western rhetoric of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Moussavi was not seen as a reformer during his stint as prime minister during the 1980s .

So , when Iran 's government announced over the weekend that Mir Hossein Moussavi had lost in his bid to become the country 's next president , young Iranians took to the streets by the thousands alleging ballot fraud .
Thousands of others around the globe championed the cause on social - networking Web sites and agreed to wear green on Monday in solidarity with Moussavi 's supporters .
But what is often lost in the outrage is whether Iran would look different under a Moussavi presidency .
Watch more about the vote »
Though the 67 - year old is credited for successfully navigating the Iranian economy as prime minister during a bloody eight - year war with Iraq in the 1980s , he also was a hard - liner whom the Economist described as a " firm radical . "
He , like most Iranians in power , does not believe in the existence of Israel .
He defended the taking of hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Iran in 1979 , which led to the break in ties between the countries .
He was part of a regime that regularly executed dissidents and backed the fatwa against British author Salman Rushdie .
And as late as April , he opposed suspending the country 's nuclear - enrichment program but said it would not be diverted to weapons use .
" I would n't go as far as ( call it ) a ' Velvet Revolution , ' " Trita Parsi , president of the National Iranian American Council , said of the phrase many are using to describe the rallies in Iran .
" At the end of the day , Moussavi has been more involved and been there from the very beginning of the revolution in a way that Ahmadinejad never was , " Parsi told " CNN Newsroom " on Sunday .
" Moussavi was one of the founders of the revolution . "
Moussavi was named prime minister in 1980 .
A year earlier , Iran had become an Islamic republic after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was forced into exile .
The same year , a group of students in support of the Islamic revolution took 52 Americans hostage and held them for 444 days .
In an interview with The New York Times in 1981 , Moussavi defended the hostage - taking as the beginning of " second stage of our revolution . "
" It was after this that we rediscovered our true Islamic identity , " he said .
The incident , Moussavi added , ended the " problem of pro-American circles and their following in Iran .
" After this , we felt the sense that we could look Western policy in the eye and analyze it the way they had been evaluating us for many years . "
In 1988 , author Salman Rushdie released his fourth novel , ' The Satanic Verses , ' which Iran said insulted Islam .
The country 's supreme leader called for the death of Rushdie .
And Moussavi , in a radio broadcast , said the order would be carried out .
Moussavi told the Financial Times in April that he would not halt Iran 's uranium enrichment program if he were president .
" No one in Iran would accept suspension , " he said .
Since his stint as prime minister , Moussavi has been absent from politics .
For the past 10 years , his official job has been to head the state - owned Art Center .
He is a painter .
The long " 20 years of silence , " as the Iranian media dubbed it , is working to Moussavi 's advantage .
Of Iran 's population of 70 million , almost 60 percent are younger than 28 -- too young to have lived through the 1979 revolution .
To them , Moussavi represents a sea change from Ahmadinejad .
While the president calls the Holocaust a myth , Moussavi has condemned the killing of Jews .
While Ahmadinejad has unleashed the morality police to ensure that women cover their hair in public , Moussavi has pledged his support for women 's rights .
Most importantly , the youth are unhappy about the faltering economy under Ahmadinejad , with the unemployment rate topping 30 percent by some accounts .
They are hungry for anyone who represents change , analysts have said .
" We have really an interesting moment of historic irony here , " Afshin Molavi , a fellow at the New America Foundation , said on the CNN talk show Fareed Zakaria GPS .
" Moussavi is a child of the revolution .
Moussavi was never a real reformer , either , when he was prime minister .
" And now he 's being faced with the question : Should he unleash the young people out onto the streets who supported him -- thus threatening the very system that he fought for ? "
Shahriar Etimani , an Iranian - American who was part of a demonstration Sunday in Washington , D.C. , to protest the election results , said he realizes Moussavi is part of the establishment , but he remains hopeful .
" The cynical part of me says that these guys have 30 years ' of experience of survival .
So this will be another blip on the radar ? " he said .
" The hopeful part of me says that , ' You know what ?
There needs to be a catalyst and we do n't know where that catalyst comes from .
We do n't know where that tipping point will come from . ' "
CNN 's Saeed Ahmed in Atlanta contributed to this report .

Remember that piezoelectric road prototype we saw late last year ?
Looks like someone ( besides us ) thought it was a good idea .
According to The Daily Mail , a Sainsbury 's supermarket in Gloucester , UK ( you 've never been there ) , has installed kinetic plates in the parking lot that use the weight of shopper 's cars to pump a series of hydraulic pipes , which in turn drive a generator .
The system is said to generate up to 30kw of energy an hour -- or enough to power the store 's checkouts .
And if that were n't enough , the store is also harvesting rainwater and heating it ( during the summer , at least ) with solar panels .
The next in this store 's " eco-friendly evolution ? "
Might we suggest Soylent in the deli ?
We hear the " green " stuff is particularly good .

Ho-hum .
It ’s just another GORGEOUS PICTURE OF SATURN ’S RINGS !
Holy Haleakala !
The thing is , it ’s not just another gorgeous picture .
This image — from Cassini , of course — is truly remarkable .
The first thing you should know is that Saturn ’s rings are incredibly flat .
If you scaled them down to the size of a piece of paper , they ’d actually be far thinner than a single sheet of that paper .
In fact , even though they ’re about 200,000 kilometers across , they are only at most a few dozen meters thick !
But not everywhere .
Daphnis is a teeny tiny moon , just 8 km ( 5 miles ) across .
It orbits Saturn inside the broad A ring , and it ’s carved a gap in the rings called the Keeler Gap .
The gap is about 45 km ( 25 miles ) across .
As it happens , Daphnis has an orbit that is not perfectly circular , so sometimes it ’s in the middle of the gap , and sometimes near the inner edge .
Not only that , but the orbit of the little moon is tipped a bit , so sometimes it ’s a bit above the ring plane , sometimes a bit below .
When it ’s near the inner edge and also above the ring plane , it pulls the nearby ring particles up out of the ring plane with it .
When it ’s below the plane it pulls the particles down .
When the elliptical motion of the moon is combined with the tilt , the gravitational interaction on the ring particles produces vertical ripples in the ring .
These ripples have been predicted in the past , but now Cassini has clearly imaged them for the first time .
Here ’s a closer view .
[ You can get an even tighter zoom at the Cassini CICLOPS site . ]
Right now , Saturn ’s tilt is such that the rings are almost edge - on to the Sun ( I ’ve explained this in more detail in an earlier post ) .
If you stand outside at sunset in a flat area , you can see your shadow stretching for a long way … and the same is true at Saturn .
The rings are flat , and the Sun shining almost parallel to them , so any deviation from flatness is obvious by the shadows .
And that ’s what you ’re seeing in those images .
Daphnis is the obvious white lump in the image with the long , black , triangular shadow stretching beyond it .
And you can clearly see the ripples it causes in the rings , too !
To the left of Daphnis the waves are on the edge of the rings outside the Keeler Gap , and on the right they are on the inside of the Gap .
This may seem weird — it threw me for a moment — but remember the rings are made of particles that are traveling at almost but not quite the same speed as the moon itself .
The particles in the ring outside the moon ’s orbit ( farther from Saturn ) move a bit slower , and inside the moon ’s orbit ( closer to Saturn ) move a bit faster .
So it ’s like cars on a racetrack , catching up and passing each other .
When Daphnis passes the outer edge particles it pulls on them , and as the particles on the inside edge pass Daphnis they get pulled too .
The combined motions are pretty complicated , but add together to produce the effect you see here .
And what an effect : those ripples are big , from 0.5 to 1.5 kilometers ( 1/3 to 1 mile ) high .
Even then they ’re dwarfed by the immensity of the rings , though , which only rams home the scale of these images .
Incredible .
Saturn ’s empire of moons and rings is an amazingly complex interacting system .
But the mathematics of it is predictable , since the important factors are basically gravity and the fact that the particles can collide with each other and exchange momentum .
Sophisticated computer models can be made which do predict these interactions , and that has been done .
These ripples were not only modeled , but predicted to occur with this size before they were observed !
John Weiss — Cassini astronomer and a friend– was the lead author on a paper about this :
We thought that this vertical structure was pretty neat when we first saw it in our simulations , but it ’s a million times cooler to have your theory supported by such gorgeous images .
It makes you suspect you might be doing something right .
True .
But of course , that ’s the essence of science .
Predictions are n’t terribly useful unless they ’re borne out by observations , and I agree strongly with John : it ’s even better when images this spectacular have your back .
Science !
Pleasing to the eye and the brain .

These giant rodents are among the most fantastical of beasts : " I take Caplin out in public a lot just because I like to have him with me .
It is fun to watch people 's reactions .
Most people have no idea what he is and some take that as a personal affront , angry that such an animal could even exist .
But most people are excited and enthusiastic about him , often referring to him as a giant hamster .
That usually means they like him .
Those who refer to him as a giant rat are more likely to be afraid .
He is confused with a variety of animals such as tapirs , wombats and peccaries .
One thing that amazes me is that very small children in strollers who can hardly speak a dozen words will point at him and say , " Mouse ! "
They are almost better at making that connection than adults are . "
And : " Since he weighs 100 lbs , I can only have him in my lap for a few minutes before it starts cutting off circulation in my legs . "

Thanks a lot for the tutorial , I 've been thinking for a while about model photography and this really helps , I have the camera and flash that was given to me , the room but no lighting yetjust one question though ... why use a flash instead of another softbox or reflector ?
for a noob it would be very easy to get blown highlights or not syncing the shutter with the flash right so half the image would be dark ?

I ’ve been working on the west side of town for over a year now and I ’ve eaten at Asia Express over in that mall on High Point Road on several occasions .
A couple runs it and they are both super - friendly .
The wife works out front while the husband does most of the cooking .
I am greeted when I walk in and the cook always waves to me from the kitchen when he sees me leaving .
I ’ve been in there enough that they both know I like spicy food and I am always asked if I want my meal made with extra heat .
During the week it seems that most of their lunch time customers are cube farmers like myself and their menu is pretty typical Americanized Chinese food .
The food comes in large portions , is generally above average in flavor , and you get great service to boot .

As I was leaving , I struck up a conversation with the woman behind the counter and she talked with me about the new Saturday offerings as well as the changes being made to their weekday menu and which items were more authentically Chinese .
I brought up dim sum and she said that they 've had many requests but do n't want to buy the frozen stuff .
The only option would be to make everything by hand but they do n't have the time and personnel to make it all .
But the Saturday menu looked tasty .
There was beef noodle soup , Vietnamese lemongrass chicken and pork , .
Unable to resist , I asked about the Crispy Pig Bung – was it fried pig intestine ?
Yes it was .
She offered a sample but I was too stuffed to eat any more .
However , like MacArthur , I vowed to return and eat pig intestine .
And so I did .
Yesterday .
With The Dulcinea and M in tow , I drove 17 miles to try out the Saturday menu .
We arrived around 12:30 or so and the place was packed .
Madison 's Asian community was out in force to sample food less Americanized .
There were whole families there in addition to groups of younger folk who might have been grad students at the UW .
We were the only non-Asian folks there and I the lone white person as The D and M both have African - American heritage .
" Now you know what I feel like most of the time , " The D quipped to me afterwards .
And as we were preparing to leave , two African - American women came in .
It was a pan-ethnic scene all - too infrequent here in Madison .
M got the sweet & sour shrimp while
The D ordered the lemongrass pork which they had run out of so it was lemongrass chicken for her .
While sweet & sour sauce is , in my opinion , essentially junk food , the stuff as Asia Express is better than most .
Sure , it 's syrupy sweet but it's not so bad as to instantly give you diabetes .
The lemongrass chicken came with a heaping pile of fried onion to which I was graciously given access .
They were tasty as was the chicken which was tender and lightly seasoned .
Now , here 's my order : I did n't notice but the soup was on two - for - one special and so we ended up with two bowls .
It was simple and delicious and I wish they made it during the week as it's a perfect winter meal in a bowl .
The pig bung ?
It was fantastic .
Imagine if cracklin were made like M&Ms .
You 've got the crispy shell of pig goodness on the outside and tender , creamy pig goodness on the inside .
It tastes great but I can imagine that the slimy mouthfeel and knowledge that one is eating intestine turns off most modern American palates .
If you like pork and can overcome our bias against organ meat , do try this stuff because your taste buds with thank you for it .
The dish comes with what appeared to be pickled cabbage with an option for edomome which I gladly took advantage of .
Our order slip asked for comments and I left some .
I am fairly certain that this was the first time the new Saturday menu was given a run .
Regardless , it 's still new and is , no doubt , a work in progress .
So far , so good .
I take it as a positive sign that the restaurant was bereft of the normal mall denizens .
U.S. home prices continued to fall sharply in April but are no longer doing so at a record - breaking pace , according to a widely followed index released Tuesday .
Home prices in 20 metropolitan areas were down 18 % in April compared with the same month last year , according to the S&P ; / Case - Shiller home price index .
In the Los Angeles area , which includes Orange County , April home prices fell 21 % from a year earlier .
Los Angeles and Orange county prices in April were down 42 % from their 2006 peak , the index shows .
The 20 - city index was down 33 % from its 2006 peak .

The Case - Shiller index had posted record year - over - year declines from October 2007 to January of this year .
April ’s index represented the third straight month in which the pace of price declines slowed slightly .
“ The stock market bottomed in March and measures of consumer confidence have turned upward .
This report shows that these better spirits are also appearing in the housing market , ” said David M. Blitzer , chairman of the index committee at Standard & Poor’s .
Blitzer cautioned , however , that “ it will take some time to determine if a recovery is really here . ”
Foreclosures continue to drag down home prices , and high unemployment is adding to the housing market ’s distress .

Still , the magnitude of year - to - year price declines has moderated .
In January , Los Angeles - area prices had fallen 25 % from the previous year ; the 20 - city index was down 19 % .
Charlotte , N.C. ; Chicago ; Cleveland ; New York ; Portland , Ore. ; and Seattle posted record year - over - year declines in April .
The steepest year - over - year declines in April were in Phoenix ( 35 % ) , Las Vegas ( 32 % ) and San Francisco ( 28 % ) .
Los Angeles - area price declines have varied substantially by price segments .
The lowest - priced third of homes sold in April was down 54 % in price from its peak , according to Case - Shiller ; the middle third was down 42 % ; and the most - expensive third of homes sold was down 31 % .

The lowest - priced homes in the Los Angeles area had more room to fall -- they had also shown the largest price increases during the real estate bubble , with prices in that segment inflated by subprime lending .
The Case - Shiller index compares the latest sales of detached houses with previous sales and accounts for factors such as remodeling that might affect a house ’s sale price over time .
From those data , an index score is created to show price changes .
An index score of 100 reflects January 2000 prices .
The 20 - city index in April was 139.18 ; the Los Angeles - area index for April was 159.37 .
Prime mortgages 60 days or more past due climbed to 2.9 % of such loans through March 31 from 1.1 % at the same point in 2008 , the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision said in a report Tuesday .

First - time foreclosure filings on the loans rose 22 % from the fourth quarter , the report said .

In parts of Southern California , the housing crash has upended a basic tenet of the American dream : that home values always increase over the long term .
Properties in several areas are selling for less than they did 20 years ago , and that ’s not even counting the effects of inflation .
The reversal is a bonanza for some first - time buyers .
They ’re nabbing houses for less than what their parents paid in the late 1980s , jumping into a real estate market that has become a kind of economic time machine .
To return to the past , take a stroll down Mulberry Avenue in Lancaster .
John A. Beatrice , 55 , bought his spacious two - story Spanish - style house there brand - new for $ 120,000 in 1989 .
It was a price he could comfortably afford , and he planned on staying through retirement , so he was n’t worried about price swings .
Advertisement
“ I always knew real estate goes like this , ” said the aerospace engineer , moving his hand in an undulating motion like bell curves on a graph .
But he never imagined his neighborhood would drop off the charts .
In April , a slightly larger home two doors away sold for $ 66,500 .
That ’s just over half the $ 130,000 it went for new in 1992 .
In 2005 , that house sold for $ 330,000 .
Beatrice ’s 29 - year - old daughter is now shopping for Lancaster houses priced lower than when she was a kid .
Home prices across most of Southern California have not fallen nearly as far .
The median price in the six - county area was $ 247,000 in April , about what it was in 2002 .
Advertisement
But in 14 Southland ZIP Codes , mainly desert communities in the Antelope Valley and Inland Empire , median prices have fallen below levels recorded in April 1989 , according to MDA DataQuick , a San Diego real estate information service .
That means thousands of homes in those neighborhoods -- even houses barely 20 years old and in decent shape -- have lost every dime of their appreciation , giving back not just the gains of the recent bubble but steady increases logged over a generation .
The April median price in Beatrice ’s Lancaster ZIP Code of 93535 , for example , was $ 87,000 .
That ’s down 74 % from a $ 334,500 peak price in 2007 .
Even worse was the 92410 ZIP Code in the city of San Bernardino , which covers several older neighborhoods .
Its $ 61,000 April median represents an 84 % drop from the peak of $ 370,000 in 2007 .
Prices also tumbled below 1989 levels in neighborhoods in Palmdale , Hemet , Barstow , Desert Hot Springs , Victorville , Highland , Santa Ana and Oxnard , according to DataQuick .
Several other inland communities , including parts of Moreno Valley , Banning and Rialto , had median prices that were only slightly above 1989 levels and below the April 1990 median .

The median price is the point at which half the homes sell for more and half for less .
Losing two decades ’ worth of gains in a single downturn “ has never happened , ” said UCLA economist Edward Leamer , who has studied local areas during booms and busts .
“ You ’re seeing something that ’s abnormal . ”
What ’s abnormal this time , Leamer and other analysts said , is the easy credit that pumped up demand and inflated home prices in those communities to unprecedented highs .
Armed with risky subprime mortgages and fearful of being priced out of the market forever , buyers flocked to the outer reaches of the Antelope Valley and Victor Valley .
Those distant suburbs became the only option when areas closer to job centers soared out of reach , said John Husing , an economist who specializes in the Inland Empire .
Advertisement
“ The families who were buying out there were the ones who could n’t get in anywhere else , ” Husing said .
“ They were paying stupid prices . ”
They were among the first to default when the economy crumbled , bringing real estate prices crashing down .
Demand for those far - flung houses vanished when prices dropped for homes closer to workplaces .
Riverside and San Bernardino counties have registered more defaults and foreclosures per capita during this downturn than other Southern California counties , according to ForeclosureRadar , an online seller of default data .
These foreclosures , sold at cut -rate prices by banks eager to be rid of them , represent the bulk of the sales activity in some communities .
In the 1990s housing bust , “ you had a foreclosure here , a foreclosure there .
You did not have almost entire neighborhoods being foreclosed , ” UCLA ’s Leamer said .

The fire sales have stoked demand .
In April , 237 homes sold in Beatrice ’s ZIP Code , more than in any other area in Southern California .
Most of those properties were foreclosed .
Stable homeowners such as Patricia Hynes have watched their hard - won equity rise and fall , leaving them roughly where they started a generation ago .
Hynes bought her three - bedroom home in Lancaster brand - new for $ 119,000 in 1989 , when Milli Vanilli was riding high on the charts .
The poplar , willow and ash saplings she planted in front now tower over the lawn , shading her home from the desert sun .
“ It ’s my little oasis , ” said Hynes , a 62 - year - old public health nurse .

Her home is an island in a sea of repos .
Houses on both sides have fallen into foreclosure ; one is priced $ 10,000 less than the amount she paid 20 years ago .
Nearby , a four - bedroom , 2,100 - square - foot home sold in May for $ 89,000 .
That ’s less than the construction costs of $ 100 to $ 125 a square foot , according to Patrick S. Duffy , principal of Metrointelligence Real Estate Advisors in Los Angeles .
The retro prices are attracting a new wave of speculators .
In April , investors bought nearly 1 in 5 homes purchased in Southern California , according to DataQuick .
That figure is around 30 % in some inland communities .
Mohammed Hafeez , 52 , a Culver City electrician , has bought four houses in Lancaster since January .
Advertisement
Hafeez said he paid $ 49,000 for the least expensive house and $ 70,000 for the priciest of his investments .
He ’s now renting them for $ 1,000 to $ 1,300 a month , and all four houses are occupied and generating positive cash flow , he said .
Still , he ’s holding off on more purchases .
Rents are falling along with home prices as investors like him snap up foreclosures and turn them into rentals .
“ I do n’t know how much or how far down it will go , ” he said .
He has reason to worry .
Another tsunami of foreclosures is threatening to swamp an already saturated market .
In Palmdale and Lancaster , 903 homes were sold in April , but according to ForeclosureRadar , more than 7,500 are in some stage of foreclosure .
Advertisement
Some buyers who thought they were getting bargains did n’t .
In Lancaster , Beatrice ’s eldest son , Daniel , bought a house near his father ’s for $ 175,000 in April 2008 ; comparable properties are now selling for about $ 95,000 .
To home buyer Al Rossi , timing is n’t everything .
The 59 - year - old bought his first house in February in Lancaster for $ 140,000 .
An administrator at the Los Angeles Mission downtown , he wanted a roomy place where he could live with his son - in - law and two grandsons .
His mortgage payment on the four - bedroom house is $ 1,050 , just slightly above the $ 900 a month he was paying for a one - bedroom apartment in Norwalk .
The house was in good shape when Rossi bought it , though the lawn had died .
The family will be planting new greenery soon .
They ’ve just installed a new hot tub and bought a gas barbecue grill as well .
If neighborhood property values fall further , so be it , Rossi figured .
The improvement in his quality of life is gain enough .

“ I did not buy a slot machine , ” he said .
“ I am not an investor .
“ That ’s what got us into this mess -- greed , ” he said of the housing crash .
“ Greed messed everything up . ”

( Geneva ) - Saudi Arabia made important commitments on women 's rights , on ending the juvenile death penalty and on other human rights issues during its review by the UN Human Rights Council on June 10 , 2009 and should now work to carry out these reforms rapidly , Human Rights Watch said today .
Saudi Arabia accepted a recommendation put forward by UN member states in February to take steps to end the system of male guardianship over women , to give full legal identity to Saudi women , and prohibit gender discrimination .
The government also clarified that the Shari 'a concept of male guardianship over women is not a legal requirement , and that " Islam guarantees a woman 's right to conduct her affairs and enjoy her legal capacity . "
" Saudi women have waited a long time for these changes , " said Nisha Varia , deputy director of the women 's rights division at Human Rights Watch .
" Now they need concrete action so that these commitments do not remain words on paper in Geneva , but are felt by Saudi women in their daily lives . "
Human Rights
Watch said that Saudi Arabia should establish an oversight mechanism to ensure that government agencies no longer request a guardian 's permission for a woman to work , travel , study , marry , or gain access health care or any public service .
The Universal Periodic Review of Saudi Arabia by the Human Rights Council , held in February and June , was the first such comprehensive international public scrutiny of the kingdom 's human rights record .
Saudi Arabia also accepted the recommendation to codify vague tenets of Shari 'a criminal law currently open to widely disparate interpretations .
Furthermore , the Saudi Human Rights Commission , representing the kingdom in Geneva , accepted the recommendation that only persons over 18 should be tried as adults and that there should be a moratorium on the death penalty for people who committed crimes under the age of 18 .
Saudi Arabia is one of only five countries globally that continues to execute individuals convicted for crimes committed as children .
Sultan bin Sulaiman bin Muslim al - Muwallad , a Saudi , and ' Isa bin Muhammad ' Umar Muhammad , a Chadian , each 17 years old at the time of their arrest in 2004 , were executed in mid-May .
" Saudi Arabia should implement these changes immediately , including a review of any individuals currently awaiting the death penalty , " said Varia .
" Human Rights Watch has extensively documented the inconsistent and unfair trials resulting from a lack of codified law . "
The Saudi government noted that it has drafted an ordinance on domestic workers to address their exclusion from labor laws .
In a 2008 report , Human Rights Watch showed how weak protections had left many domestic workers vulnerable to unpaid wages , exploitative working conditions , physical abuse , and forced labor .
" The draft ordinance has been discussed and debated for several years now with no concrete result , " said Varia .
" The Saudi government needs to move past verbal commitments and ensure that these desperately needed measures are put into effect within the next few months . "
Other commitments included protections against discrimination in the employment of religious minorities , a commitment to issue the kingdom's first law allowing the establishment of nongovernmental organizations , and an expression of openness to visits by international human rights experts from the United Nations and independent groups .
Chinese internet users are rebelling against an internet crackdown brought in on the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre .
Twenty years after the pro-democracy protests that claimed the lives of hundreds – or even thousands – of unarmed civilians in Beijing , a number of websites appear to be making a veiled protest at state censorship by referring to the date sarcastically as " Chinese Internet Maintenance Day " .
Earlier this week the government blocked access to a number of popular western websites , in what was widely seen as way of controlling access to information about the events at Tiananmen Square .
Among the sites that were screened out were photo - sharing website Flickr , Microsoft 's Hotmail email service and the popular online messaging site Twitter .
A number of other sites appear to have gone down over recent days , however , in a move that may be part of an ad hoc anniversary protest online .
According to Chinese media blog Danwei , the music - sharing service VeryCD has been taken down , as well as Fanfou , a local version of Twitter .
But rather than simply fail to load , which would be typical for websites blocked by the firewall , many of the sites are now carrying messages saying that they are closed for maintenance .
It is not clear whether any of the sites took down their services as a result of government pressure : most have had previous trouble with the authorities in Beijing , and reports suggest that many sites were told that they would face serious consequences if they published anything relating to the events of 4 June 1989 .
But it was also suggested that the phrasing used by some of the websites indicates a subtle attack on the government .
While deliberate government action cannot be ruled out , more than 300 Chinese sites appear to have posted increasingly blasé maintenance messages on the anniversary .
" The Fanfou server is undergoing technical maintenance .
Service is expected to resume before dawn on 6 June , " said one message .
On dictionary website WordKu.com , its owners said they had taken the site down for Chinese Internet Maintenance Day .
Blog hosting service Bullog.org , meanwhile , says it has gone " on strike " for the day , and Wuqing.org carried a message saying : " I , too , am under maintenance ! "
Internet users in China often deploy subtle methods to criticise the government without falling foul of the law .
Among the favoured techniques is repurposing internet slang to make fun of leading political figures or mock their policies .
In the past the term " grass mud horse " – a lewd pun intended as a jab at the censorship of bad language – gained currency among China 's internet - savvy crowd .
A string of empty government slogans , meanwhile , was parodied in a popular meme known as " the river crab wears three watches " .

Real Madrid are determined to conquer football markets around the world
From Puskas and Di Stefano to Zidane and Beckham , Spanish football giant Real Madrid have aspired to acquire some of the most talented and glamorous names in world football .
Now , in the latest chapter they have swooped in a matter of days for two of the biggest names in world football , Kaka and Ronaldo .
The signing strategy is being led by the returning president of the club , construction magnate Florentino Perez , who previously led the Spanish team from 2000 to 2006 - during its famous " galacticos " era .
It was under Mr Perez 's first reign that the club initially aimed at becoming the world 's richest and best known football brand .
REAL MADRID REVENUES 2007/08 Increased by 4 % to £ 290 m Driven by increased commercial revenues Commercial revenues accounted for 35 % of income Broadcasting income accounted for 37 % Matchday accounted for 28 % Source : Deloitte
But how can they afford to pay the reported £ 56 m for Kaka and offer a world - record £ 80 m for Cristiano Ronaldo - existing as they do without the deep pockets of a billionaire benefactor ?
Growing match - day revenues , increasingly shrewd and global marketing , healthy commercial income , and a ground - breaking domestic TV deal , have all catapulted the club to the peak of the Deloitte 's Football Money League this year .
They have topped it for the past four straight years , despite being overshadowed in the Champions League by their bitter rivals Barcelona .
' Remarkable growth '
According to those most recent figures , for 2007 / 08 , the club saw its revenue hit £ 290 m during that season .
Real Madrid has a history of buying the world 's best players Whilst Real Madrid's 4 % revenue growth in 2007 /08 was more modest than in preceding years , it meant that across a six year period the club had doubled its annual revenues since 2002 .
Perhaps crucially , it also gave the club a revenue lead of 41 m euros ( £ 32.5 m ) over Manchester United , in second place .
" The engine driving Real 's remarkable revenue growth , and its ascent to the top of the money league , has been the club 's ability to increase commercial revenue , " said Dan Jones , author of the Deloitte report .
Matchday revenue has also increased significantly in the past couple of years thanks to the reconfiguring of areas of the club 's stadium to increase corporate hospitality capacity and hence revenues .
Average attendances at their home ground - the 80,354 - capacity Santiago Bernabéu football stadium - are the third - highest in Europe .
Emerging markets
After the purchase of David Beckham from Manchester United in 2003 , Real Madrid cleverly projected their brand into East Asia , on the back of the England star 's appeal .
" That was all about the race by the big European clubs to crack the East Asian , Indian and other emerging markets first , and the race is still going on , " says Nigel Currie , of marketing and sponsorship giants Brand Rapport .
There will be massive TV deals coming up for them [ Real Madrid ] overseas in the next few years
Nigel Currie , Brand Rapport " However good the Premier League and Spain 's La Liga are , there is an elite breaking away , led by the likes of Real Madrid . "
He added : " What they are doing is partly a response to Barcelona 's success , but these signings are them putting down a marker to be the top club and football brand in the world . "
Mr Currie said Real were targeting the world 's best players - who were also the world 's most marketable players .
' Fickle allegiance '
That , Mr Currie added , meant that in emerging markets fans may swap allegiance , from - for example - Manchester United to Real Madrid , simply because they preferred to support star players rather than clubs .
" They are far more fickle in terms of allegiance , " he said .
" But it is not about Real looking to sell more merchandising in places like China , in fact they would not make a great deal from doing that .
Real Madrid will look to attract Kaka fans to their brand " They are looking to make money from these signings by maximising their future overseas TV rights , " says Mr Currie .
" There will be massive TV deals coming up for them overseas in the next few years , that is the big carrot .
" With the developments this week Real Madrid will already have restored their profile and status to number one in these emerging markets .
" And the team that has the most marketable players , and the most supporters , will get the best TV deals . "
' Important role '
The television money , both overseas and at home , is crucial to Real 's surge in income in recent years .
Since 1997
Spanish clubs have sold their own rights individually .
Real Madrid signed its latest deal in 2006 - for a reported record 1.1 bn euros - with Spanish film and TV company Mediapro for seven seasons of broadcast rights .
That works out at a huge 150 m euros a year .
" Spanish television rights have increased significantly in the past three years , and would no doubt play an important role in these large Real Madrid transfers , " says James Pickles , editor of industry journal TV Sports Markets .
Big name sponsors
But overseas merchandising , domestic and TV rights , and matchday earnings are not Real 's only income streams .
It also has a number of high profile sponsorship partners - Bwin.com , Adidas , Coca - Cola , Audi , and Spanish beer brand Mahou .
An image rights deal with Adidas alone in early 2007 garnered them 762 m euros .
Real Madrid president Florentino Perez ( l ) with former glamour player Alfredo Di Stefano
Another benefit , one that helps attract top name players , is the fact that tax legislation allows their foreign players to pay tax at about 23 % for the first five years that they are in the country .
It also helps that Real - from before the 1950s heyday of Di Stefano - is considered the " establishment team " and can call on close links with the government or city authorities when cash is tight .
Last but by no means least is the fact that Real , like Barcelona , are exempt from demands imposed on the majority of Spanish football clubs to become publicly listed companies .
Unlike the majority of European football clubs , Real Madrid are owned by its thousands of members , known as " socios " , who elect the president .
That leaves it free of all the ramifications for takeovers and potential debt issues that being a listed company could involve .
In its report Deloitte said it would be difficult to see anyone topping Real Madrid at the top of the money league next year , but added " it will be interesting to see how the club copes with the loss of the Brand Beckham effect . "
It appears Real are now answering that question by plugging that gap with the purchase of Kaka , and proposed purchase of Ronaldo .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States should let some big troubled banks fail rather than commit more federal funds to prop them up , two key congressional Republicans said on Sunday .
Senator Richard Shelby , top Republican on the banking committee , said the United States should not mimic Japan , which in the 1990s propped up failing banks and prolonged its economic downturn .
“ Close them down , get them out of business .
If they ’re dead , they ought to be buried , ” Shelby told ABC ’s “ This Week ” program .
“ We bury the small banks .
We ’ve got to bury some big ones and send a strong message to the market . ”
Financial authorities have been under increasing fire as hundreds of billions of dollars of loans and capital infusions into distressed institutions have failed to halt the economic downturn , which has only accelerated in recent weeks .
Senator John McCain , who remains a Republican leader after losing the 2008 White House race to President Barack Obama , criticized the new administration ’s response to the banks .
“ I do n’t think they made the hard decision and that is to let these banks fail , ” McCain told “ Fox News Sunday . ”
As the U.S. government boosts its stakes in major banks such as Citigroup Inc , talk of nationalization has stirred a debate over how far regulators will go to help the ailing financial system .
Shelby did not mention any banks by name but , when asked about Citigroup , he said : “ Citi ’s always been a problem child . ”
McCain echoed Shelby ’s criticism of U.S. banks but both senators avoided the term “ nationalization ” -- a concept typically derided by Republicans as a move toward socialism .
Asked what should be done , McCain said : “ You ’d sell off their assets and you have the -- unfortunately , the shareholders and others will take a beating . ”
Tom Donohue , president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , the nation ’s biggest business group , said it was “ not practical to talk about closing a bank that is integrated throughout the whole global economy . ”
“ It is practical to talk about buying some of those assets away from those banks and holding them in an institution that would have both public and private money , ” Donohue said on ABC ’s “ This Week . ”
On Friday , Kansas City Federal Reserve President Thomas Hoenig criticized as piecemeal the approach taken by the government in handling of the banking upheaval .
“ We understandably would prefer not to ‘ nationalize ’ these businesses but , reacting as we are , we nevertheless are drifting into a situation where institutions are being nationalized piecemeal with no resolution of the crisis , ” Hoenig said in remarks to a local group .
CALL FOR PATIENCE
A key Democratic senator called for patience as the Obama administration takes stock of the current state of ailing banks , announced last month as a series of “ stress tests . ”
The Treasury department said it would provide the 20 largest banks with sufficient capital if the exams find they need more funding to withstand a worse - than - predicted recession .
“ Once these evaluations occur , there may be some banks -- and we do n’t know which ones , and I ’m not going to name any -- that will never make it , ” Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press . ”
“ You do n’t just keep putting money in , money in , money in -- and the bank never solves it self . ”
Schumer , also on the banking committee , said there is a type of “ good nationalization ” modeled on what the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
already does when it unwinds a bank .
Good use of technology could bring the past much closer
Science fiction author Alastair Reynolds , author of Revelation Space and Century Rain , wonders if we could do a better job of looking back into history .
If there 's a silver lining to the dark cloud of CGI - dominated blockbusters that seem to infest the cinema lately , it 's this : the same digital technology that can make Spiderman or Hulk leap around the screen in a singularly unconvincing fashion , can also be used to create something infinitely more interesting : the past .
Imagine if you could actually walk around in a simulated version of a scene from history ?
Would n't that be worth an hour of anyone 's time ?
I 'm not talking about the Star Trek holodeck here .
I 'm talking about something we could have sometime next week , if the appropriate technologies were combined .
For a start , we 'd need a computer system capable of running the simulation - but in these days of super - powerful games consoles , that surely is n't too much of an ask .
Imagine fast - forwarding through entire centuries , watching buildings rise and fall , the Great Fire of London coming and going in a convulsive flash , transforming half the city
We 'd also need a display device , feeding a constantly moving three - dimensional viewpoint to the participant , something like a virtual reality headset .
We 'll call them goggles , but they do n't have to look any weirder than Bono 's last pair of wraparound shades .
You do n't want to look like a complete berk , do you ?
Actually , let 's not go with Bono 's shades .
The problem is , virtual reality is so Lawnmower Man , so 1990s .
Ca n't we go one better than that ?
Ca n't we integrate the simulation with the real world instead ?
Easily enough , as it happens .
We certainly do n't need any kind of motion capture suit or scanning rig , because that 's not how it 's going to work .
The system is n't going to track how you move ; it 's only going to track the movement of the wraparound goggles .
With differential GPS receivers embedded in the goggles , that 's all the data it needs .
You 're not going to be trapped in some windowless room somewhere , prancing around like a demented mime artist .
You 're going to be walking through your favourite city , perhaps the place where you actually live .
Simultaneously , the goggles are feeding you a one - to - one overlay derived from the computer simulation , integrated seamlessly with your view of the real world .
Wraparound shades might be all you need to see the past
The key is that the goggles do n't have to feed you the view of the present day .
They can feed you the past .
Imagine you 're walking through London .
There 's a slider on the left side of the frame ; you can reach up and adjust it as you walk .
By moving the slider , you can dial all the way back to the Blitz , or the time of Samuel Pepys , or the Londinium of 45 AD .
It would be a fascinating - not to mention disorientating - experience .
Imagine fast - forwarding through entire centuries , watching buildings rise and fall , the Great Fire of London coming and going in a convulsive flash , transforming half the city .
You 'd feel like HG Well 's time traveller , hurtling through time .
You 'd get an entirely new perspective on a familiar neighbourhood .
Of course , there 'd need to be a certain amount of fudging .
Streets and rivers re-align themselves ; what was once passable becomes impassable .
Ground levels change dramatically .
But all of that could be accommodated ; the aim would be to educate and illuminate , but that would n't mean that the simulation had to be rigorously correct at all times .
Speaking of education , it seems to me that one of the earliest applications of such a technology - if it does n't already exist in embryonic form - would be in museums , especially those dealing with the buried past .
Imagine visiting an historical site a few years down the line , something like the Roman spa in the city of Bath .
Instead of being given the option to hire a handset with a pre-recorded commentary , you get given a pair of goggles , with an associated earpiece .
They 're a bit scuffed from repeated use , but they 've been thoroughly cleaned since the last person used them .
You put them on and move into the museum proper .
The goggles are preset for 45 AD , but you can move the left - hand slider up and down to surf through the ages .
If you wish you can even skip to post Roman times and stroll around the greening ruins .
Reynolds : computer graphics could help us visualise the past Importantly , there 's a second slider on the right side of the goggles .
This one is preset to low immersion : when you first don the goggles , it displays the simulated overlay as a ghostly tracery , a bit like the vector graphics of old arcade games .
You can see where walls and floors used to be , but you 're still firmly anchored to the real world .
Turn the slider up a bit , though , and the overlays become progressively more solid , more photo - real .
Turn it up a bit more and the glasses begin selectively deleting what they do n't want you to see - the modern walls that are in the wrong place , the modern ceiling that should show the blue sky and clouds of Roman Britain instead .
What 's more , the slider goes even further up the scale .
There 's no reason why the software can't drop in a few authentic - looking Roman citizens , going about their business .
As you walk past them , your earpiece picks up snatches of murmured conversation in Latin .
A subtitle tells you what they 're really saying .
While you 're at it , why not have the option of deleting some of your fellow visitors ?
You came to see Roman ruins , not a gaggle of exchange students ticking off another item on the itinerary .
Depending on the software , the goggles could overlay a " Roman " over each visitor , or render them entirely invisible until they came within a certain collision volume .
At which point , they could be progressively de-erased , or perhaps flagged with a graphical outline .
It would be up to you how far you adjusted the slider .
I do n't know .
I think this would be pretty fantastic , but who knows ?
Perhaps it would be yet another reason not to exercise the imagination ; yet another reason not to have to think too hard .
After all , you have to think to make sense of schematic diagrams and dioramas , the usual stuff of museums .
You have to work at it a bit .
And maybe that 's a good thing .
But I definitely would n't mind finding out

Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - MN ) has been relatively quiet , until today when she bragged in a radio interview that she will be breaking the law by not participating in the census next year .
Bachmann claimed that ACORN is involved in the census , and that are going to collect personal information to use to stuff ballot boxes .
Here is the audio courtesy of Think Progress :
Advertisements
Bachmann said , “ The motherload of all data information will be from the Census . …
Unfortunately , the Census data has become very intricate , very personal , a lot of the questions that are asked .
I know for my family , the only question we will be answering is how many people are in our home .
We wo n’t be answering any information beyond that , because the Constitution does n’t require any information beyond that . ”
She also launched into her latest ACORN conspiracy , “ This is what ACORN will do .
They will get multiple fraudulent voter registration forms , stuff the registrar ’s office with them , in hopes that maybe not all fraudulent registrations will find people at the polls voting .
But there may be some people who get through .
And sometimes you do n’t often need many in order to sway an election one way or another .
I come from Minnesota .
We ’re still in a recount with our U.S. Senate race between Sen. Norm Coleman and the challenger Al Franken .
Sen. Coleman won the race on Election Day , but that was challenged repeatedly , over and over , with what we feel may be fraudulent vote [ sic ] , and we ’re very concerned about what comes forward . ”
The problem with Bachmann ’s conspiracy theory is that the 2010 form does not collect Social Security numbers , and a Social Security number is required to vote .
The form asks for name , date of birth , relationship to the resident , race , and whether the residents reside elsewhere during the year .
The government already has this information if you fill out a tax form .
ACORN will not be taking the Census , but the right wing is worried because the group might help recruit some of the 1.4 million census takers .
This is another bizarre right wing conspiracy theory that has captured the imagination of the right wing .
Maybe if Bachmann gets arrested the people in her district will stop voting for this loony tune , but I doubt it .
Canada 's leading payday lender has agreed to pay $ 100 million to Ontario clients who complained they were ripped off by usurious interest rates .
" It 's been a long road , " said Ron Oriet , 36 , of Windsor .
" I 'm glad it 's over .
It 's been six years . "
A laid - off project manager who had borrowed from Money Mart to pay off student loans and car payments , Oriet was part of a class - action lawsuit filed in 2003 on behalf of 264,000 borrowers .
Once the proposed settlement – it includes $ 27.5 million in cash , $ 43 million in forgiven debt and $ 30 million in credits – is approved by the court , the average payout will be about $ 380 .
" We think it 's fair and reasonable and in the best interest of the class members , " lawyer Harvey Strosberg said yesterday .
From the Berwyn , Pa. headquarters of Money Mart 's parent company – Dollar Financial Corp . – CEO Jeff Weiss said in a statement : " While we admit no wrongdoing ... this settlement will allow us to avoid the continuing substantial litigation expense that would be expected . "
In 2004 , a Toronto Star investigation revealed payday loans carried annualized interest rates ranging from 390 to 891 per cent .
In 2007 , the federal government amended the law to allow the provinces and territories to regulate the payday loan industry and place limits on the cost of borrowing .
In March , Ontario established a maximum rate of $ 21 in fees per $ 100 borrowed making what was alleged to be an illegal practice legal , Strosberg explained .
" That 's a political decision the government has made , and the government having made that decision , I can't say it 's illegal that people should n't take advantage of that , that 's why the credits became an option where they would n't have been an option before , we never could have talked about settling the case with credits while it 's illegal , " he said .
The class action , which had sought $ 224 million plus interest , alleged the financial services company had charged " illegal " interest rates on 4.5 million short - term loans from 1997 to 2007 .
The lawsuit said borrowers had paid an average of $ 850 in loan charges .
The case went to trial in Toronto in April but was adjourned with two weeks remaining after both sides agreed to mediation with former Supreme Court Justice Frank Iacobucci , Strosberg said .
Strosberg said there was a " practical side " to reaching a settlement since Money Mart owes $ 320 million ( U.S. ) on secured debt .
Ontario Superior Court Justice Paul Perell will review the settlement and if he does n't approve it , " we 're back in the saddle again , " Strosberg said .
Back in Windsor , Oriet was relishing the apparent victory , recalling how the Money Mart outlet seemed like a saviour because he could walk out with cash in hand .

" But then you 're in a vicious trap , a vicious cycle , " he said .
" Your next pay is down that chunk of money so you 've almost got to get your butt back in there for another one . "
Joe Doucet , 41 and his wife , Kim Elliott , 40 , also fell victim to the lure of easy payday loans when Doucet was laid off as a factory worker .
" We had up to five payday loans at the same time .
The problem was the interest weekly ended up being $ 300 or $ 400 . "
The prime minister endorsed the creation of a Palestinian state that would exist alongside Israel for the first time on Sunday .
Two and a half months after taking office and following considerable pressure from Washington , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu finally uttered the coveted term in his policy speech at the Begin - Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar Ilan University .
However , Netanyahu repeatedly stressed , any such entity would have to be demilitarized .
" The territory under Palestinian control must be demilitarized with ironclad security provisions for Israel , " the prime
Opinion
All eyes on Netanyahu Eitan Haber PM will make grave error if he tries to appease everyone with his speech All eyes on Netanyahu
minister said .
" If we receive this guarantee regarding demilitarization and Israel ’s security needs , and if the Palestinians recognize Israel as the State of the Jewish people , then we will be ready in a future peace agreement to reach a solution where a demilitarized Palestinian state exists alongside the Jewish state , " he said .
Vowing to speak in plain terms about the complicated issues at hand , Netanyahu spoke firmly on the demand that Israel make more territorial concessions .
" Many good people have told us that withdrawal from territories is the key to peace with the Palestinians .
Well , we withdrew .
But the fact is that every withdrawal was met with massive waves of terror , by suicide bombers and thousands of missiles ...
The claim that territorial withdrawals will bring peace with the Palestinians , or at least advance peace , has up till now not stood the test of reality .
" Those who think that the continued enmity toward Israel is a product of our presence in Judea , Samaria and Gaza , is confusing cause and consequence .
The attacks against us began in the 1920s , escalated into a comprehensive attack in 1948 with the declaration of Israel ’s independence , continued with the fedayeen attacks in the 1950s , and climaxed in 1967 .
All this occurred during the fifty years before a single Israeli soldier ever set foot in Judea and Samaria . "
' I will go to Damascus , to Beirut '
On the issue of settlements and outposts in the West Bank the prime minister touched on only briefly , saying that Israel has no intention of expropriating land to build new settlements but that there is a need to allow settlers to live " normal lives " - alluding to the demand of ' natural growth ' within the existing settlements .
Answering US President Obama 's statement in Cairo that Israel was built as a result of the Holocaust , Netanyahu said - " The right of the Jewish people to a state in the land of Israel does not derive from the catastrophes that have plagued our people .
There are those who say that if the Holocaust had not occurred , the state of Israel would never have been established .
But I say that if the state of Israel would have been established earlier , the Holocaust would not have occurred .
" This tragic history of powerlessness explains why the Jewish people need a sovereign power of self - defense .
But our right to build our sovereign state here , in the land of Israel , arises from one simple fact : this is the homeland of the Jewish people , this is where our identity was forged .
However , Netanyahu also said that Israel must recognize that millions of Palestinians live in the heart of the West Bank , and continued control over these people is undesirable .
" In my vision , there are two free peoples living side by side each with each other , each with its own flag and national anthem , " he said .
The prime minister declared that the solution of the Palestinian refugee problem must be " outside Israel , " and drew a parallel to the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Jews from their native Arab nations with the creation of Israel and their subsequent absorption in Israel .
" The Palestinian refugee problem must be resolved outside the borders of the state of Israel .
On this , there is a broad international consensus , " Netanyahu said , adding that with international investment this " humanitarian problem " can be solved .
Netanyahu also called for Arab leaders to meet him and contribute to Palestinian economic development .
" I support the idea of regional peace that is being led by ( US President ) Obama , " Netanyahu said .
" I appeal , from here this evening , to the leaders of the Arab states and say : Let 's meet .
Let 's talk peace .
Let 's make peace .
I am willing to meet with you any time , any place - in Damascus , in Riyadh , in Beirut . "
Activists from both sides of the political spectrum gathered at the Bar Ilan campus Sunday evening in anticipation of Netanyahu 's speech .
Some of the protestors were demanding a halt to all settlement activity while others demanded its expansion .
Right - wing activists , including Itamar Ben-Gvir , condemned US President Barack Obama and some carried signs saying : " Barack Hussein Obama – an anti-Semite and hater of Jews " .
They also called for more settlements in the West Bank .

Australians in Melbourne protest Israel ’s assault on the Gaza Strip that killed more than 1,400 Palestinians , January 2009 .
( Takver )
Rudd , who leads the Labor Party , formally congratulated Israel in the Parliament on reaching 60 years of statehood in 2008 .
He forgot to mention the fact that Palestinians lost 78 percent of their land in 1948 , millions have been refugees for the 60 years since and the rest live under Israel ’s military occupation .
Gillard excused Israel ’s massive attack on the Gaza Strip last January by pointing to the rockets Hamas had fired into Israel , killing fewer than 10 Israelis .
She forgot to mention the fact that Israel , the US , the EU and the UN had decided to respond to Hamas ’ democratic election victory as the Palestinians ’ government by imposing a siege on the whole population , depriving them of fuel for cars , hospitals and heating and cutting back on food supplies .
And she ignored the fact , Australia unlike even the British government , watched without complaint as Israel went on to slaughter 1,400 Palestinian civilians , including 400 children .
And now Gillard is in Israel leading a bevy of Australian business , media , political and cultural leaders to Israel in an official “ cultural exchange ! ”
I thought she ran the twin , heavyweight portfolios of industrial relations and education , not arts ?
What ’s happening , and why ?
Well , Australia is sucking up to Israel once again , just like former prime ministers John Howard ( Liberal ) and Bob Hawke ( Labor ) did .
Certainly , this one - sided policy is not represented in Labor platform policy which is much more even - handed , committing the party to a two - state solution .
Although , it ’s interesting that in the last four years of the Rudd ascendancy all reference to the original UN resolutions that defined Labor policy since 1948 — guaranteeing an end to the 1967 occupation and right of return of the 1948 refugees or compensation — have been quietly deleted .
But the last prime minister to ever have an even - handed policy on this issue was Gough Whitlam ( 1972 - 75 ) , a fact that annoyed the local Israeli lobby to no end when the 1973 Arab - Israeli war occurred .
So why the one - sidedness , ignoring the platform and the Gough legacy ?
To find out one possible answer , the little Sydney - based pro-Palestine lobby group which I chair called Coalition for Justice and Peace in Palestine decided we would commission a high class , well - known , opinion poll company to test whether the Labor machine or politicians knew something we did n’t — for example , that their one - sidedness reflected “ the will of the people . ”
Were Palestine and Palestinians so on the nose — as Muslims , as Arabs , as “ terrorists , ” pick your nightmare — that showing government sympathy towards them would hurt you electorally ?
We chose the Roy Morgan Research company and they agreed to do an arm ’s length national , representative survey asking five crucial questions about awareness and knowledge , about overall sympathies , about the Gaza military action in January and about perceptions of the Rudd government ’s attitudes .
The results were a big surprise .
They are the epitome of even - handedness , with a bit of a tilt in overall sympathies toward the Palestinians .
And on Gaza , many more Australians found the Israeli military action in Gaza unjustified ( 42 percent ) than justified ( 29 percent ) .
So Labor ’s cuddle - up to Israel does not fit with Australians ’ views .
Interestingly , the survey also found that many Australians do n’t in fact see the Rudd government as one - sided ( 42 percent ) though of the 20 percent who do , 19 percent think it is tilted towards Israel .
There are two other points to make .
First , if you break the national figures down in to Sydney figures , a bias towards the Palestinians comes through clearer .
This could be a result of the big Australian Arab and Muslim populations in Sydney .
But , in any case , the sympathy towards Palestine is stronger and the condemnation of the Gaza war much stronger ( 49 percent thought it was unjustified , only 24 percent justified ) .
So Sydney is a pro-Palestine bastion .
Second , Morgan asked respondents whether they felt they knew “ a lot , ” “ a fair amount , ” “ not very much , ” “ nothing at all ” or “ ca n’t say ” about what happened in Gaza .
If you group “ a lot ” and “ fair amount ” — in other words , those who felt they knew at least a fair amount or more about what happened — and break them down into their sympathies for the Israelis or the Palestinians , the bias towards the Palestinians is quite marked ( 29.7 percent for Israelis , 44.5 for Palestinians ) .
I take from that , that the more you know about the Israel - Palestine situation , the more your sympathies lie with the Palestinians .
Where does this leave the Labor Party ?
Or the opposition Liberals for that matter ?
It means they have to re-align themselves with their electorates .
It means the National Australian Labor Party Conference next month should ignore Kevin Rudd ’s obsequious attitude to everything Israeli — did he really say “ Israel is in my DNA ! ” at a Jewish community function ? — and get on with strengthening its adherence to peace and justice in the region .
Julia Gillard should also cancel her tour of Israel — how many days is she spending in the Occupied Palestinian Territories with Palestinian guides ? — and plead “ pressure of work . ”
Or a more believable reason would be : do as Obama says and end settlement - building and I ’ll come and see you .
That ’s the kind of relationship the United States is forging right now with Israel .
Maybe Rudd and Gillard , who seem to have trouble listening to what their own electorate thinks of Israel , need to pick up the phone to Obama for instructions .

Spreading the underlying truth about P2P on both sides of the argument , from Neuron to Neuron
Articles : Announcing your plans makes you less motivated to accomplish them 2009-06 - 16
Should n’t you announce your goals , so friends can support you ?
Is n’t it good networking to tell people about your upcoming projects ?
Does n’t the “ law of attraction ” mean you should state your intention , and visualize the goal as already yours ?
Nope .
Tests done since 1933 show that people who talk about their intentions are less likely to make them happen .
Announcing your plans to others satisfies your self - identity just enough that you ’re less motivated to do the hard work needed .
In 1933 , W . Mahler found that if a person announced the solution to a problem , and was acknowledged by others , it was now in the brain as a “ social reality ” , even if the solution had n’t actually been achieved .
NYU psychology professor Peter Gollwitzer has been studying this since his 1982 book “ Symbolic Self - Completion ” ( pdf article here ) — and recently published results of new tests in a research article , “ When Intentions Go Public : Does Social Reality Widen the Intention - Behavior Gap ? ”
Four different tests of 63 people found that those who kept their intentions private were more likely to achieve them than those who made them public and were acknowledged by others .
Once you ’ve told people of your intentions , it gives you a “ premature sense of completeness . ”
You have “ identity symbols ” in your brain that make your self - image .
Since both actions and talk create symbols in your brain , talking satisfies the brain enough that it “ neglects the pursuit of further symbols . ”
A related test found that success on one sub - goal ( like eating healthy meals ) reduced efforts on other important sub - goals ( like going to the gym ) for the same reason .
It may seem unnatural to keep your intentions and plans private , but try it .
If you do tell a friend , make sure not to say it as a satisfaction ( “ I ’m going to run a marathon ! ” ) , but as dissatisfaction ( “ I want to lose 20 pounds , so kick my ass if I do n’t , OK ? ” )
Thanks to Wray Herbert ’s article about this .

Miss California Carrie Prejean wants to put a lid on those nude photos that have been posted on the Internet -- stat .
We 've obtained a cease and desist letter fired off from Carrie 's lawyer to thedirty.com , demanding that the site take down two photos , showing a topless Carrie posing for the cam .
In the letter , her lawyer says , " One of the displayed images of Ms. Prejean was illegally taken under false pretenses when she was a 17 - year - old minor and unable to consent to its creation . "
The letter goes on : " The other image depicts Ms. Prejean 's likeness but is not an actual photograph .
It is an electronic manipulation [ " photoshopped ' ] of her image created without her consent . "
The response from thedirty.com : " Your client 's publicity rights are substantially inferior to the right of the public to consider , discuss , agree and / or disagree with Ms. Prejean 's actions and views .

Roger Friedman discovered “ just what Rupert Murdoch means by ‘ zero tolerance ’ when it comes to movie piracy , ” said Brooks Barnes in The New York Times .
The Foxnews.com entertainment columnist was fired over the weekend for his recent review of a leaked , unfinished version of X - Men Origins : Wolverine , the upcoming film by 20th Century Fox , which is owned by Murdoch .
What was Friedman thinking ?
said Bruce Simmons in Screen Rant .
Not only was it foolish for him to review the movie , but then he “ bragged ” about how easy it was to find and download the pirated version .
“ When you work for the bank , you should not brag that you stole their money ! ”
But this raises an even bigger issue , said Josh Tyler in Cinema Blend .
It “ illustrates how flat - out impossible it is to stop people from downloading movies . ”
If Fox ca n’t even prevent “ their own people from engaging in illegal downloading , what good is the ongoing war against the ever - growing number of domestic and international downloaders going to do ? ”
Arrays and Lists in SQL Server
The Long Version
An SQL text by Erland Sommarskog , SQL Server MVP .
Latest revision : 2018 -08 - 26 .
Copyright applies to this text .
See here for font conventions used in this article .
Introduction
If you were referred to this article in answer to your question in an SQL Server forum , you should read the short version of this article first and chances are very good that the short version is all you need for the moment .
This article covers the topic in depth , and you would read it if you have an " advanced " scenario or you are more the geeky sort of person .
Even if you intend to read this article in full , read the short version as an introduction first , because I will not repeat it all here .
A problem that has been popular over the years with SQL Server is how to handle a list of values .
In the majority of the cases , people have a comma-separated list , because this format is produced by commonly used tools like multi-choice controls in .NET , Reporting Services and other places .
When I say that the problem is popular , I do n't only mean that the questions are commonplace – but so are solutions .
You can find no end of blog posts etc that presents string - splitting functions , including performance tests of such functions and there are function that are known to be the fastest etc .
The aim of this article is two - fold : 1 ) Give a general discussion of how to design string - splitting functions .
2 ) Present and discuss each method from the angles I bring up in the general discussion .
This includes performance , but not only .
To back up my discussion on performance , I have run extensive performance tests , although it was a while ago now , and they do n't cover the new possibilities that were added in SQL 2016 .
I have published the results from these tests in two appendixes .
The first is from 2006 when I originally published the article for SQL 2005 , and the second is from 2009 ( and updated with some new findings for XML in 2010 ) .
As you might sense , this article is of some age – I published the first version for SQL 2000 already in 2003 and I updated it several times for several years with the last major update in 2010 .
What I find surprising as I write this new introduction in 2016 is that the topic still is current .
After all , it was already SQL 2008 that gave us what I thought would be the ultimate solution : table - valued parameters .
I still think that table - valued parameters is the best way to do it , and I have written an article Using Table - Valued Parameters in SQL Server and .NET to demonstrate how to use them .
Nevertheless , questions on how to handle CSVs keep coming up in the forums , and partly this is to blame on the sad fact that not all environments support table - valued parameters .
So what you have here is the 2016 version of this article .
( With some minor later admentments . )
I have moved the material for beginners to the short version .
I 've rewritten this new introduction and added material on string_split and OPENJSON , new features in SQL 2016 .
I have also conducted a some general overhaul of the contents in general to modernise it a bit .
( For instance , it was time to stop talking about features added in SQL 2005 as new features ! )
Another topic I touch in this article is how to insert many rows efficiently .
While this is something that is best done with table - valued parameters , some form of bulk load or SSIS , some of the methods in this text are interesting from this perspective as well .
Note : all samples in this article refer to the Northwind database .
You can download the script to install it from Microsoft 's web site .
Overview of the Methods
As I 've already hinted there are quite a few methods to unpack a list into table .
Here I will just give a quick overview of the methods , before I move on to the general considerations .
General Considerations
Interface
Most of the methods I present are packaged into functions that take an input parameter which is a list of values and returns a table , like this :
CREATE FUNCTION list_to_table ( @list nvarchar ( MAX ) ) RETURNS @tbl TABLE ( number int NOT NULL ) AS
The reason the methods are packaged in functions is obvious : this permits you to easily reuse the function in many queries .
Here I will discuss some considerations about the interface of such functions .
The Input Parameters
In this article , as far as the input parameter is a string , it is always of the data type nvarchar ( MAX ) which can fit up to 2 GB of data .
I made this choice , because I wanted to make the functions as generally applicable as possible .
By using nvarchar , the functions can handle Unicode input , and with MAX the functions permit unlimited input .
With nvarchar ( 4000 ) , they would silently yield incorrect results with longer input , which is very bad in my book .
Nevertheless , there is a performance cost for these choices .
If you use an SQL collation , you should know that varchar gives you better performance ( more on that in a minute ) .
And generally , there is an overhead for using the MAX types over strings that have an upper limit in size .
The latter live in memory only , while the MAX strings can spill to disk and that incurs an overhead , even if there is no actual spill .
Thus , the fastest methods you can find , typically have varchar ( 8000 ) as a parameter , but in my opinion that is an accident waiting to happen .
And , it can be questioned how much the performance of a string - split function matters for strings of that relatively short size – very likely the cost for splitting the string is dwarfed by the cost of running the rest of the query .
If you have lists that are so long that performance of the splitting matters , much likely they will exceed 8000 characters in size every now and then .
See however the section Unpacking Lists in a Table , Take Two at the end of the article .
Some of the functions take a second parameter to permit you to specify the delimiter , or , in case of fixed - length , the element length .
In some functions I have opted to hard - code the delimiter , but for all methods that use a delimiter ( save dynamic SQL ) , you can always add such a parameter .
To keep things simple , I have consistently used one - character delimiters .
If you need multi-character delimiters , most methods can be extended to handle this .
The Output Table
The output from all functions is a table .
For all methods , I 've included one function for returning a table of strings , and for some methods also a function that returns a table of integers .
( Which is likely to be the most common data type in this context . )
If you have a list of integers and a function that returns strings , you can use it like this :
SELECT ... FROM tbl t JOIN list_to_table ( @list ) l ON t.id = convert ( int , t.str )
Similar applies to other data types .
You can easily clone a version of the function that has the conversion built - in .
( However , check the Robustness section for some things to look out for . )
The data type that requires most consideration is strings .
Return nvarchar or varchar ?
Obviously when you work with Unicode data , you need to get nvarchar strings back .
It may be tempting to always return nvarchar , but for reasons that I will return to in the performance section , you should make sure that you have a varchar string when you join with a varchar column .
For some of the functions in this article , I have added both a varchar and an nvarchar column to the return table .
In some functions , I also return the position in the list for the elements .
This can be handy when you have two or more lists that are horizontal slices of the same source , so you can say things like :
INSERT tbl ( id , col2 , col3 ) SELECT a.number , b.str , c.str FROM intlist_to_table(@list1 ) a JOIN charlist_to_table(@list2 ) b ON a.listpos = b.listpos JOIN charlist_to_table( @list3 ) c ON a.listpos = c.listpos
That is , this is a way to insert many rows in one go , although it 's not really the best one .
Sometimes this can be OK if you only have two or three columns per row to insert , but as the number of parallel lists grows , it gets out of hand , and you should consider using a table - valued parameter instead or at least XML .
The particular danger with the approach above is that if the lists get out of sync with each other , you will insert inconsistent data .
Knowing the list position is essential in situations when the list also implies the sorting for the output .
Say that you get a list of US states like this : CA , TX , NY , FL , IL and the user wants the data to be sorted in that order .
Without information about the list position , this is impossible .
For some methods , the list position can easily be derived from the method itself , for others ( but not all ) you can use the row_number ( ) function .
Robustness
It can't be denied that parsing strings is a bit risky .
As long as the input plays by the rules everything goes fine , but what happens if it does n't ?
A good list - to - table function can protect you from some accidents , but not all .
Here are a couple of situations to watch out for .
Delimiter in the Input
Say that you have a couple of city names like this : Berlin , Barcelona , Frankfurt ( Main ) , Birmingham , København .
From this you want to compose a comma-separated list that you pass to list - to - table function .
With the names listed above , that works fine , but then some joker enters Dallas , TX .
Oh-oh .
There are several ways to deal with this problem .
One is to use a delimiter that is unlikely to appear in the input data , for instance a control character .
Many programs put strings into quotes , so the above list would read " Berlin " , " Barcelona " etc .
This latter format is not supported by any of the functions I present , but you could tweak some of them a bit to get there .
Sometimes you cannot really make any assumption about the delimiter at all , for instance if the source is user input or data on the wire .
In such case you will need to use a method with a general escape mechanism , of which I present two , to wit XML and JSON .
Or you can avoid the delimiter business entirely by using fixed - length strings .
When you work with lists of integers , it is unlikely that the delimiter would appear in the data itself .
Extra Spacing
If you have an input list that goes :
ALFKI , VINET , BERGS , FRANK
Do you want those extra spaces to be included in the data returned by the list - to - table function ?
Probably not .
All functions in this article ( but one ! ) strip trailing and leading spaces from list elements .
However , there are some methods , where this is not possible .
( Or more precisely , they are not able to handle inconsistent spacing . )
Illegal Input
Say that you have a function that accepts a list of integers , and the input is 9 , 12 , a , 23 , 12 .
What should happen ?
With no particular coding , SQL Server will give you a conversion error , and the batch will be aborted .
If you prefer , you can add checks to your function so that the illegal value is ignored or replaced with NULL .
This is also very easy to achieve in SQL 2012 and later thanks to try_convert .
To focus on the main theme , I have not added such checks to the functions in this article .
Empty Elements
What if a function that accepts a list of integers is fed the input : 9 , 12 , , 23 , 12 .
How should that double comma be interpreted ?
If you just do a simple - minded convert , you will get a 0 back , which is not really good .
It would be better to return NULL or just leave out the element .
( Raise an error ?
You can not raise errors in functions . )
One approach I have taken in some functions in this article is to avoid the problem altogether by using space as delimiter .
But since T‑SQL does not provide a function to collapse internal spacing , the approach is not without problems .
For methods that build on logic of traditional programming , you can easily handle multiple spaces , but for methods that uses a combination of charindex and set - based logic , you would still have to filter out empty elements in the WHERE clause .
( Something I have not done in this article . )
Then again , if your function accepts a list of strings , you may simply consider the empty string to be like any other value and you want your function to retain it . .
Performance Considerations
While I have conducted performance tests and devoted long appendixes to them , a very important performance aspect is not with the methods themselves , but how you use them and how they are packaged .
In this section I will look into some important issues .
varchar vs. nvarchar
As I discussed in the Interface section , it appears to be a good choice for a function that unpacks a list of strings to have an nvarchar column in its return table , so it can work with both Unicode and 8 - bit data .
Functionally , it 's sound .
Performance - wise it can be a disaster .
Say that you have :
SELECT ... FROM tbl t JOIN list_to_table ( @list ) l ON t.indexedvarcharcol = l.nvarcharcol
Why is this bad ?
Recall that SQL Server has a strict data - type precedence , which says that if two values of different data types meet , the one with lower precedence is converted to the higher type .
varchar has lower precedence than nvarchar .
( Quite naturally , since the set of possible values for varchar is a subset of the possible values for nvarchar . )
Thus , in the query above indexedvarcharcol will be converted to nvarchar .
The cost for this depends on the collation of the column .
If the column has a Windows collation , SQL Server is still able to use the index , because in a Windows collation the 255 possible varchar values make up a true subset of all possible values for nvarchar .
This permits SQL Server to do something known a range seek .
My tests indicate a doubling or tripling of the execution time for the seek , which of course is reason enough to avoid the conversion .
But to be fair : in many cases you would not notice .
On the other hand , with an SQL collation it is very likely that you would .
Because in this case the index is completely useless , since in an SQL collation the rules for varchar and nvarchar are different and you will get a scan of some sort and for a large table it may take minutes to run the query when it would have taken milliseconds with an index seek .
Thus , it is instrumental that you have separate functions to return varchar and nvarchar data .
Or do as I have done in some functions in this article : have two return columns , one for varchar and one for nvarchar .
You can also always try to remember to convert the output column to the appropriate data type – but it 's human to forget .
You can find out the collation of a column with sp_help .
There is one more thing to say on this theme , which I will come back to in a minute .
Inline , Multi-Statement and Temp Tables
While for longer the lists the performance of the method as such has some significance , a much important question is the overall performance of the full query where the list appears .
Consider just this fairly simple query :
SELECT ... FROM tbl JOIN list_to_tbl( @list ) l ON tbl.indexedcol = l.value
The index on indexedcol is a non-clustered index .
If @list hits just a few rows in the table , you want an Index Seek + Key Lookup .
But if @list hits many rows , a Clusterted Index Scan ( or a Table Scan in case of a heap ) is much more efficient .
There are two reasons that @list can hit many rows : 1 ) there are many values in the list .
2 ) there is a skew with one or two of the value in @list accounting for 40 % of the values in indexedcol .
Depending on the method you use , the optimizer may or may not be able do perform a good work in this regard .
Another aspect is how much @list varies from call to call .
A plan that is put into cache is based on how @list looked at the first call , so called parameter sniffing .
In many cases , this works fine , but if the lists vary widely in length from each other or if there is a data skew , you may not want a cached plan to be reused .
( For a much longer discussion on parameter sniffing , see my article Slow in the Application , Fast in SSMS ?.)
To understand this a little more , let us look at the kind of " functions " we can use .
( " Functions " in quotes , because not all methods we will look at use a function per se . )
We can identify four main models :
Direct SQL .
Methods without any function at all , but you compose a complete query out of the data .
Either because you already have the data in a table , as in the case of table - valued parameters , or you skip the table entirely as you do with dynamic SQL or when you use many parameters .
.

Either because you already have the data in a table , as in the case of table - valued parameters , or you skip the table entirely as you do with dynamic SQL or when you use many parameters .
Intermediate Storage .
For some methods you need to materialise the table shaped from the list somewhere , and for most other methods this is an option .
Obviously this incurs an overhead , but as we shall see there may be other advantages .
This alternative falls into three sub-categories : Multi-statement function .
A multi-statement function has a body that is compiled and executed on its own .
Thus , execution plan of the function is not part of the plan for the query where the function is called .
The result is returned in a table variable .
Bouncing data over a table variable .
Rather than joining with the function directly , you insert the data into a table variable which you then join with your target table .
Bouncing data over a temp table .
Instead of a table variable , you insert the data into a temp table which you use in your main query .
.
For some methods you need to materialise the table shaped from the list somewhere , and for most other methods this is an option .
Obviously this incurs an overhead , but as we shall see there may be other advantages .
This alternative falls into three sub-categories : T‑SQL Inline Function .
An inline table - function in T‑SQL is only a function by name ; in reality it is a parameterised view .
SQL Server expands the function into the query as if it was a macro , and the optimizer works with the expanded query text .
Thus , there is no overhead for intermediate storage in this case .

Thus , there is no overhead for intermediate storage in this case .
Opaque Inline .
Non-SQL methods such as the CLR or XML fall in between the two T‑SQL function types and I would also count string_split to this group .
Like a multi-statement function , the function call is just an operator in the plan , but there is no intermediate storage , but the results of the operations are streamed into the query , so they are inline in that sense .
Let 's now look at how these models works with the simple query above .
I will jump a little bit forth and back in the list above .
A quick glance may give you the idea that Direct SQL is to prefer .
And indeed , with both dynamic SQL and using many parameters you can get a plan that fits the query very well , both with regards to list length and skew .
Unfortunately , these methods have other shortcomings , which rarely , if ever , make them good choices .
Table - valued parameters on the other hand is a very good pick .
Table - valued parameters do not have distribution statistics , which means that the optimizer will not be able to handle skew correctly .
However , the optimizer knows the cardinality , that is , how many rows there are in the table , and this is the most important fact about the list .
As long as the data has a reasonably even distribution , this piece of information is enough to determine whether to seek the non-clustered in the example query or to scan the table .
But keep in mind that the note on parameter sniffing applies .
If you pass a lot more or fewer values in the TVP next time , this will not trigger recompilation , and the plan may not be optimal for this call .
You can force recompilation yourself , though , with the hint OPTION ( RECOMPILE ) that you put at the end of the query .
If you bounce the data over a local table variable , it is a different matter .
When compiling the procedure in whole , the optimizer will assume one row .
This is what I here refer to as a blind assumption .
As long as your lists are short , this will not matter much , but the more elements your lists have the less likely it would be that you get a good plan .
However , as with a TVP you can trigger recompilation with OPTION ( RECOMPILE ) , and in this case , the optimizer will use the actual cardinality .
Since a multi-statement function returns data in a table variable , it may seem that it would be the same as in the previous paragraph , but it is not really so .
The exact behaviour depends on the version of SQL Server , or more precisely , the compatibility level :
Up to compatibility level 110 ( which corresponds to SQL 2012 ) : a blind assumption of one row .
Compatibility levels 120 and 130 ( SQL 2014 and SQL 2016 ) : a blind assumption of 100 rows .
Compatibility level 140 and up ( SQL 2017 and later ) : the optimizer applies something known as interleaved execution .
That is , the optimizer calls the function before compiling the rest of the query to see how many rows it returns , and it then uses that value when compiling the query .
This means that the presumptions are the same as with a table - valued parameter .
That is , the plan is accurate with regards to the list length , but not with regards to data skew , and parameter sniffing may work against you .
If we look at the group Opaque Inline , the optimizer makes blind assumptions for all of them , and the blind assumption is different depending on the method .
What is important to observe is that interleaved execution is not employed for any of them , not even the built - in string_split .
That is , you may or may not get the plan that fits you best , but it will not depend on your actual input .
OPTION ( RECOMPILE ) is not going to help you , but on SQL 2017 and later , it may actually make sense to wrap the method in a multi-statement function to take benefit of interleaved execution .
With inline SQL , the optimizer has the full story not and just a table with an unknown number of rows coming back , so you may expect that you get a more accurate plan , but it is not really so .
The logic for cracking the list is nothing the optimizer is able look through , and in practice what you get is another blind assumption .
But there are more choices for the plan and I have seen cases where inline functions gave unexpected good performance , because the optimizer came up with a parallel plan .
However , it cuts both ways .
Here is an extract from a mail that I received in response to my old article for SQL 2000 :
After reading your article ' Arrays and list in SQL server ' I tried to use the Fixed - Length Array Elements method in my application .
Everything worked fine until I moved the code from a client batch to a stored procedure .
When I looked at the query execution plan , I saw that the number of rows retrieved from the Numbers table was over 61 millions !
Instead of starting by joining the Numbers table with the source table to filter out the 500 rows included in the array , it processes the GROUP BY clause on the entire table ( 121 000 rows ) and then it uses a nested loop to match each entry with the Number table .
And this is not unique .
In my performance tests I saw several example of where the optimizer outsmarted itself , and I got completely crazy execution times .
I will return to this theme in the section JOIN vs. EXISTS below .
I suggested my correspondent that he should try a multi-statement function instead , and that resolved his issue .
Let 's finally look at temp tables , which addresses all the problems we have discussed so far :
Optimizer knows the cardinality .
A temp table has distribution statistics , so the optimizer also have a chance to produce the best plan if there is a skew in the data .
And since changes in statistics trigger recompilation , you can get different plans depending on the input .
There is however a caveat with last point .
To be sure that the optimizer has correct information for the current execution , you need to add UPDATE STATISTICS for your temp table .
You may think that autostats will set it in , but that does not always happen , and if you trigger a recompile by some other method , the plan may be compiled with the statistics from the previous execution !
This puzzling behaviour is something that SQL Server MVP Paul White discusses in a lot more detail in his blog post Temporary Tables in Stored Procedures .
Here is an overview of which strategies that are possible with which methods :
Direct SQL T‑SQL Inline Opaque Inline Multi-Statement Table Variable Temp Table Table - valued Parameters Yes No No No Yes Yes string_split No No Yes Wrapper Yes Yes Iterative Method No No No Yes Yes Yes CLR No No Yes Wrapper Yes Yes XML and JSON No No Yes Wrapper Yes Yes Table of Numbers No Yes No Yes Yes Yes Fixed - Length No Yes No Yes Yes Yes Function of Numbers No Yes No Yes Yes Yes Recursive CTE No Yes No Yes Yes Yes Dynamic SQL Yes No No No No No Many Parameters Yes No No No Yes Yes List to SELECT No No No No Yes Yes Real Slow Yes No No No No No
MAX Types vs. Regular ( n) varchar
In a previous section I discussed the problems with joining nvarchar and varchar .
When I ran my performance tests and investigated some unexpected results ; I discovered a second problem of a similar kind .
Consider this :
SELECT ... FROM tbl t JOIN list_to_table ( @list ) l ON t.indexednvarcharcol = l.nvarcharmaxcol
The list - to - table function is here written in such a way that its return type is nvarchar ( MAX ) .
This too leads to an implicit conversion of the indexed column .
It may not be apparent that it has to be that way at first sight , but when SQL Server evaluates an expression , it always works with the same data type for all operands .
And nvarchar (n ) is a different data type from nvarchar ( MAX ) .
The result of the implicit conversion is not fatal .
The optimizer applies a range - seek operator and is still able to use the index , but nevertheless there is an overhead .
When I initially ran my tests , I had not observed this issue , and my inline functions returned nvarchar ( MAX ) ( of the simple reason that the input string was nvarchar ( MAX ) ) .
As a consequence , my tests in some cases seemed to indicate that inline functions performed worse than the corresponding multi-statement solutions .
Presumably , most of the time when you use list - to - table functions for a list of strings , the list elements are short , just a few characters long .
Therefore , there is all reason to make sure that your list - to - table function returns a regular varchar or nvarchar .
Particularly , this means that for inline functions , you should make sure that the return value is explicitly converted to regular ( n) varchar .
You will see this in all inline functions in this article .
But if you use the built - in string_split function , this is something you need to keep in mind yourself .
Collations
All functions in this article uses nvarchar both for parameters , output and internal variables .
If you never work with Unicode data , you may think that you should rewrite the functions to use varchar instead , assuming that 8 - bit characters are faster for SQL Server to work with than the 16 - bit Unicode characters .
This may or may not be the case , depending on which collation you are using .
As I discussed above under varchar vs. nvarchar , there are two sorts of collations : Windows collations and SQL collations .
If you use a Windows collation , you get a slight reduction in performance if you use varchar rather than nvarchar .
This is due to that with a Windows collation the Unicode rules and routines are always employed internally , so all that varchar buys you is extra conversion to and from Unicode .
On the other hand , with an SQL collation you can get some 30 % improvement in execution time with using varchar instead .
This is because for SQL collations there are separate internal routines for string handling that work only on 8 - bit character data , and these 8 - bit routines are far simpler than those for Unicode .
( If you have an SQL collation and use nvarchar , you are in fact using a Windows collation under the cover . )
Note here that the exact gain depends on the type of operation .
30 % is what you can expect from a plain equality test .
There are situations where the difference between varchar and nvarchar in an SQL collation can be as much as a factor of 7 .
We will look at such case in the section on really slow methods .
If you have to use nvarchar , there is still a way to evade the overhead of the Unicode routines : use a binary collation .
Now , if you opt to use a binary collation throughout your database , you will have to accept that all comparisons are case - insensitive and that sorting is funky , not the least for other languages than English .
So for most applications , using a binary collation is not a viable option .
However , there exists a second possibility : force the collation for a certain expression .
I have employed this throughout this article where it makes sense .
You will see a lot of things like :
charindex ( @delimiter COLLATE Slovenian_BIN2 , @list , @pos + 1 )
Since @delimiter is cast to an explicit collation , this also happens with @list .
( This is discussed in Books Online in the topic Collation Precedence . )
When using charindex to find a delimiter , odds are good that you are looking for the exact delimiter and you have no need for case - or accent - insensitive searches .
Thus , using a binary collation in this situation does not lead to any loss in functionality .
When I tested this for the iterative method , I got some 10 % improvement in execution time .
( Why Slovenian ?
And why BIN2 ?
Well , I had to pick something , but which binary collation you chose does not matter .
I used Slovenian because my test data happens to be a list of Slovenian words from a spelling dictionary .
And I selected BIN2 , since these newer binary collations resolve some oddities of the older BIN collations .
But as I said , all that matters in this case is that you select a binary collation . )
Scalability in a Multithread Environment
When I discuss performance in this article , I 'm mainly concerned with the method as such , since this is mainly what I have tested .
But if you believe that you will have many users concurrently submitting comma-separated lists or similar , you will also be interested in how these methods scale .
In my suite of performance tests in 2009 , I did a feeble attempt to test this , but the tests were not very conclusive .
You can read about my observations in the second performance appendix , but I only comment on it in a few places in this article .
How to Use These Functions – JOIN vs. EXISTS
Once you have such a function , how would you use it ?
One way is to use a join :
SELECT P.ProductName , P.ProductID FROM Northwind .. Products P JOIN intlist_to_tbl( @ids ) i ON P. ProductID = i.number
But you could also write the query as :
SELECT P.ProductName , P.ProductID FROM Northwind ..
Products P WHERE P.ProductID IN ( SELECT i.number FROM intlist_to_tbl( @ids ) i)
Or :
SELECT P.ProductName , P.ProductID FROM Northwind ..
Products P WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT * FROM intlist_to_tbl( @ids ) i WHERE P.ProductID = i.number )
In this article I almost exclusively use the first model , using joins .
Does this mean that this is the best way to write such queries ?
It turns out that this is a more delicate question that it may seem at first glance .
Before I start , let me first say that there is no practical difference between IN and EXISTS , but they will always generate the same plan .
So it is only a question on whether to use join on the one hand or IN / EXISTS on the other .
Next thing to note is that if you want to get the list position , you need to write a join , because then you are using the table function for more than just checking existence .
But if we overlook that part , we can see that the join query above has a potential problem that the other two do not have .
To wit , what if there are duplicates in the input list ?
Now , obviously , it could be the case that the business rules are such that if 27 appears multiple times in the list , Schoggi Schokolade should appear multiple times in the output .
And in such case , the join is the only reasonable option .
But in most cases , you do n't want duplicates in the output , and this means that if you use a join query , you need to eliminate duplicates with the DISTINCT keyword .
And this means that SQL Server needs to put in extra work to sort ( or hash ) the data to get rid of the duplicates .
With IN or EXISTS , you do n't need DISTINCT , because you are only selecting rows from one table .
Thus , EXISTS is leaner ?
Nah , not really .
If you look at the IN / EXISTS queries above , they are in practice very similar to a join + DISTINCT , because that is how SQL Server will implement them .
So it does n't matter which we use then ?
Maybe in some cases .
The more complicated the query gets , the more likely there will be differences .
If you use DISTINCT + JOIN , DISTINCT applies to the entire result set which may yield a different result than using IN or EXISTS .
If the latter case , SQL Server knows that it only has to eliminate duplicates from the table - function .
And the query plan may for other reasons include a hash or sort operator that can perform elimination of duplicates , so that there is no real extra cost .
Beside all the performance - ponderings there is the purist view : you should express your intent clearly , and if you mean to include the table function only to check for existence , you should state so in the query .
After all this rambling , it seems that I have arrived at the conclusion that IN / EXISTS are better than joins .
So why do I use joins then in the article ?
There are two reasons .
One is kind of shameful : when I first wrote the article for SQL 2000 many years ago my brain was an auto - pilot , and I just used what first came into my mind .
The other reason is more heavy - duty : when I ran my performance tests in 2009 I added tests with EXISTS queries , and for all T‑SQL inline functions without exception this resulted in disastrous query plans .
The execution time for an EXISTS query with a list of 20 elements ranged from 25 to 40 seconds .
The corresponding execution time for the join queries were a few milliseconds in the very most cases .
This abysmal performance was far less common with join queries .
As I discussed above in the section Inline , Multi-Statement and Temp Tables , inline T‑SQL functions give the optimizer a degree of freedom which is not really good for its health .
I like to stress that my tests do not prove that SQL Server always freaks out on T‑SQL inline functions when EXISTS is involved .
But nevertheless , it happened eight times out of eight in my tests , and while some functions are similar to each other , there are also some that are entirely different in nature .
So for this reason , I have retained the queries in the article as join queries .
I have not added DISTINCT to them .
After all , in many cases , you probably have control over how the lists are constructed , and you can be reasonably sure that they do n't have duplicates .
At the end of the article there is a section of concluding performance remarks , where I further discuss this topic .
The Iterative Method
I will now describe the various methods to unpack lists into a table , one by one in detail .
I 've opted to start with the iterative method .
Together with using a recursive CTE , the iterative method needs the least amount of preparations .
Just create the function and you are on the air .
Most other methods require some extra step .
Another advantage is that the code for the iterative method is very easy to understand , not the least if you have a background with traditional programming languages .
This makes things simple if you need to adapt the code to a special input format .
The method is far from the fastest in the bunch , but as long as you mainly work with lists of reasonable length , you will find performance acceptable .
If you often work with lists of several thousand elements , you should probably investigate some of the faster methods .
List - of - integers
You have already seen an example of the iterative method in introductory short version , but I repeat it here ( with a different name , as all functions in this article has a name which includes the method used . )
CREATE FUNCTION iter$simple_intlist_to_tbl ( @list nvarchar ( MAX ) ) RETURNS @tbl TABLE ( number int NOT NULL ) AS BEGIN DECLARE @pos int , @nextpos int , @valuelen int SELECT @pos = 0 , @nextpos = 1 WHILE @nextpos > 0 BEGIN SELECT @nextpos = charindex ( ' , ' , @list , @pos + 1 ) SELECT @valuelen = CASE WHEN @nextpos > 0 THEN @nextpos ELSE len( @list ) + 1 END - @pos - 1 INSERT @tbl ( number ) VALUES ( convert ( int , substring ( @list , @pos + 1 , @valuelen ) ) ) SELECT @pos = @nextpos END RETURN END
The idea is simple .
We iterate over the string , look for commas , and then extract the values between the commas .
Note the use of the third parameter to charindex , this specifies the position where to start searching for the next comma .
The computation of @valuelen includes the only complexity : we must cater for the fact that charindex will return 0 when there are no more commas in the list .
However , this function is slower than it has to be .
Recall what I said in the interface section above about there being an overhead for MAX types because need to be able to spill to disk .
Originally , when I implemented the iterative method for SQL 2000 , writing it like above was not possible , because there was no nvarchar ( MAX ) only the old ntext which was not fully supported by charindex .
Therefore I had to implement a solution where I broke up the string into chunks of nvarchar ( 4000 ) .
When I ran my performance tests , I found that chunking was also a meaningful thing to do on SQL 2005 and later as this improves performance by 20 - 30 % .
There is a second problem with iter$ simple_intlist_to_tbl : if you for some reason feed it two consecutive commas , this will result in a 0 in the output , which is n't really good .
While you can easily address this by adding some extra logic to the function , my preference is to avoid the problem by using space as a separator .
The comma does not really fill any purpose for a list of integers .
Or so was my thought when I wrote the function many years ago .
Little did I know that there are controls in .NET and SSRS that generate integer lists with comma as separator .
So obviously a method that can handle comma is desirable .
( And quite obviously it is reasonable to expect a list generated programmatically to obey the format and not have multiple consecutive commas . )
Nevertheless , I present the function as I originally wrote , as that is what I tested in my performance tests .
Tweaking it to handle comma or any other separator is left as an exercise to the reader .
So here it is :
CREATE FUNCTION iter_intlist_to_tbl ( @list nvarchar ( MAX ) ) RETURNS @tbl TABLE ( listpos int IDENTITY ( 1 , 1 ) NOT NULL , number int NOT NULL ) AS BEGIN DECLARE @startpos int , @endpos int , @textpos int , @chunklen smallint , @str nvarchar ( 4000 ) , @tmpstr nvarchar ( 4000 ) , @leftover nvarchar ( 4000 ) SET @textpos = 1 SET @leftover = '' WHILE @textpos < = datalength ( @list ) / 2 BEGIN SET @chunklen = 4000 - datalength( @leftover ) / 2 SET @tmpstr = ltrim( @leftover + substring ( @list , @textpos , @chunklen ) ) SET @textpos = @textpos + @chunklen SET @startpos = 0 SET @endpos = charindex ( ' ' COLLATE Slovenian_BIN2 , @tmpstr ) WHILE @endpos >
0 BEGIN SET @str = substring ( @tmpstr , @startpos + 1 , @endpos - @startpos - 1 ) IF @str <> '' INSERT @tbl ( number ) VALUES ( convert ( int , @str ) ) SET @startpos = @endpos SET @endpos = charindex ( ' ' COLLATE Slovenian_BIN2 , @tmpstr , @startpos +
1 ) END SET @leftover = right ( @tmpstr , datalength( @tmpstr ) / 2 - @startpos ) END IF ltrim ( rtrim( @leftover ) ) <> '' INSERT @tbl ( number ) VALUES ( convert ( int , @leftover ) ) RETURN END
Here is an example on how you would use this function :
CREATE PROCEDURE get_product_names_iter @ids varchar ( 50 ) AS SELECT P.ProductName , P.ProductID FROM Northwind .. Products P JOIN iter_intlist_to_tbl(@ids ) i ON P.ProductID = i.number go EXEC get_product_names_iter ' 9 12 27 37 '
This function has two loops .
One which creates the chunks , and one that iterates over the chunks .
The first chunk is always 4 000 characters ( provided that the input is that long , that is ) .
As we come to end of a chunk , we are likely to be in the middle of an element , which we save in @leftover .
We bring @leftover with us to the next chunk , and for this reason we may grab fewer than 4 000 characters from @list this time .
When we have come to the last chunk , @leftover is simply the last list element .
Multiple spaces are handled by simply ignoring @str if it 's blank .
There are two things from the general considerations that I have added to this function that was not in iter$simple_intlist_to_tbl :
The output table includes the list position .
I use the COLLATE clause to force a binary collation to gain some further performance .
Before I close this section , I need to credit Sam Saffron who pointed out a performance flaw in my original implementation where I kept reallocating the string rather than using the third parameter of charindex .
List - of - strings
Here is a similar function , but that returns a table of strings .
CREATE FUNCTION iter_charlist_to_tbl ( @list nvarchar ( MAX ) , @delimiter nchar ( 1 ) = N' , ') RETURNS @tbl TABLE ( listpos int IDENTITY ( 1 , 1 ) NOT NULL , str varchar ( 4000 ) NOT NULL , nstr nvarchar ( 2000 ) NOT NULL ) AS BEGIN DECLARE @endpos int , @startpos int , @textpos int , @chunklen smallint , @tmpstr nvarchar ( 4000 ) , @leftover nvarchar ( 4000 ) , @tmpval nvarchar ( 4000 ) SET @textpos = 1 SET @leftover = '' WHILE @textpos < = datalength ( @list ) / 2 BEGIN SET @chunklen = 4000 - datalength( @leftover ) / 2 SET @tmpstr = @leftover + substring ( @list , @textpos , @chunklen ) SET @textpos = @textpos + @chunklen SET @startpos = 0 SET @endpos = charindex( @delimiter COLLATE Slovenian_BIN2 , @tmpstr ) WHILE @endpos >
0 BEGIN SET @tmpval = ltrim ( rtrim ( substring ( @tmpstr , @startpos + 1 , @endpos - @startpos - 1 ) ) ) INSERT @tbl ( str , nstr ) VALUES ( @tmpval , @tmpval ) SET @startpos = @endpos SET @endpos = charindex ( @delimiter COLLATE Slovenian_BIN2 , @tmpstr , @startpos + 1 ) END SET @leftover = right ( @tmpstr , datalength ( @tmpstr ) / 2 - @startpos ) END INSERT @tbl(str , nstr ) VALUES ( ltrim ( rtrim ( @leftover ) ) , ltrim ( rtrim ( @leftover ) ) ) RETURN END
An example on how you would use this function :
CREATE PROCEDURE get_company_names_iter @customers nvarchar ( 2000 ) AS SELECT C.CustomerID , C.CompanyName FROM Northwind ..
Customers C JOIN iter_charlist_to_tbl(@customers , DEFAULT ) s ON C.CustomerID = s.nstr go EXEC get_company_names_iter ' ALFKI , BONAP , CACTU , FRANK '
There are a few differences to iter_intlist_to_tbl .
I 've added a parameter to specify the delimiter , since you may need to use different delimiters depending on the data .
Note that if you want to use the default of a table - valued function , you cannot leave out the parameter , but you have to specify the keyword DEFAULT to use the default value .
Another addition is that I trim off space that appears directly adjacent to the delimiters , but space within the list elements is retained .
I like to give attention to the use of datalength .
There are two system functions in T‑SQL to return the length of a string : len returns the number of characters , and does not count trailing space .
datalength returns the number of bytes ( whence all these / 2 ) , and includes trailing spaces .
I 'm using datalength here , since there is no reason to ignore trailing spaces in the chunks – they could be in the middle of a list element .
Using the CLR
Introducing the CLR
We will now look at what is the fastest method if you are dead set on using a delimited list and do n't want to use a table - valued parameter or change to a fixed - length format .
This means that you write a stored procedure in C # or any other language that supported by .NET and the Common Language Runtime .
CLR has never caught on as one of those widely used features in SQL Server , but it is a very handy tool for doing things in SQL Server for which T‑SQL is not well equipped for and a list - to - table function is a prime example this .
There is no data access , but it is all matter of parsing a string for which .NET offers a much richer set of operations .
Furthermore , the CLR code is compiled in contrast to the interpreted T‑SQL , which is the main reason why the CLR give such a good performance .
In the realm of table - valued functions there is another factor that improves performance : the output from a table - valued CLR function is not written into any intermediate storage , but the rows are fed into the rest of the query as soon as they are produced .
So in that sense they are inline functions , but in difference to T‑SQL 's own inline functions , the optimizer has no idea what they will produce , which is why I refer to them as opaque inline .
Unfortunately , this method is the one that is the most difficult to get started with .
There was always a small hurdle , but not more than I felt that I could explain all steps in an article like this .
However , with the introduction of CLR Strict Security in SQL 2017 , the hurdle has become considerably higher to the extent that it is difficult to recommend this method to someone who has never used the CLR before .
Not the least since the builtin string_split is likely to offer at least equally good performance , if less flexibility .
Thus , I see two scenarios you would go for this method :
You are already using the CLR , and you already know how to make an assembly trusted on server level and thus you are past the hurdle .
You have a real high - end scenario with long lists where you find that string_split does meet your requirements .
Despite this , I have written the chapter , so that you can try the examples even if you are new to the CLR .
However , I will be fairly brief on the proper ways to work with assemblies with CLR Strict Security enabled , and I have deferred that material to the last sectrion in this chapter .
To be able run the examples on your server , you need enable the CLR , as user - written CLR is disabled by default .
You do this by running this script from a query window :
EXEC sp_configure clr enabled ' , 1 RECONFIGURE
Furthermore , if you are on SQL 2017 , you will have to deal with CLR Strict Security .
If you use your own private development server , there is an easy way out , to wit , turn it off :
EXEC sp_configure ' show advanced options ' , 1 RECONFIGURE EXEC sp_configure ' clr strict security ' , 0 RECONFIGURE
However , this is certainly not best practice on a shared server , even less a production server .
But to keep the main body of this chapter simple , I will tacitly assume that you have disabled CLR Strict Security .
CLR Functions Using Split
We will look at two ways of implementing a list - to - table function in the CLR .
The first one , with very little of our own code , serves as an introduction to CLR table functions rather than as an example of a function you actually should use .
In the second alternative , we will roll our own , which opens for a higher degree of flexibility and also better scalability .
The Code
A complete C# file that implements two list - to - table functions , one for strings and one for integer has to be no longer than this :
using System .
Collections ; using System.Data.SqlTypes ; using Microsoft.SqlServer .
Server ; public class CLR_split { [ SqlFunction ( FillRowMethodName= " CharlistFillRow " ) ] public static IEnumerable CLR_charlist_split( SqlString str , SqlString delimiter ) { return str.Value.Split(delimiter.Value.ToCharArray(0 , 1 ) ) ; } public static void CharlistFillRow ( object row , out string str ) { str = ( string ) row ; str = str. Trim ( ) ; } [ SqlFunction ( FillRowMethodName= " IntlistFillRow " ) ] public static IEnumerable CLR_intlist_split( SqlString str ) { return str.Value .Split(( char[ ] ) null , System.StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries ) ; } public static void IntlistFillRow ( object row , out int n ) { n = System .
Convert . ToInt32 (( string ) row ) ; } }
Compile and Install
To compile this , open a command - prompt window and make sure that you have C : \Windows \Microsoft.NET \Framework\v4.0.30319 or corresponding in your path .
Assuming that the name of the file is CLR_split.cs , the command is :
csc /target: library CLR_split.cs
This gives you CLR_split.dll .
If your SQL Server is not on your local machine , you will have to copy the DLL to the server box , or make the DLL visible from the server in some way .
Then run from a query window :
CREATE ASSEMBLY CLR_split FROM 'C:\somewhere\CLR_split.dll ' go CREATE FUNCTION CLR_charlist_split( @list nvarchar ( MAX ) , @delim nchar ( 1 ) = N' , ') RETURNS TABLE ( str nvarchar ( 4000 ) ) AS EXTERNAL NAME CLR_split.CLR_split.CLR_charlist_split go CREATE FUNCTION CLR_intlist_split( @list nvarchar ( MAX ) ) RETURNS TABLE ( number int ) AS EXTERNAL NAME CLR_split.CLR_split.CLR_intlist_split go
( Note : it is also possible to deploy the functions from Visual Studio , but I 'm not showing you that , because I do n't know how to do it myself .
Visual Studio leaves me in a maze , and at the same time I find the command - line very simple to use .
What I have been told is that VS may require you to add extra attributes to the functions if you want to deploy the functions that way . )
You have now created the functions and can use them from T‑SQL .
Here is an example for both :
CREATE PROCEDURE get_company_names_clr @customers nvarchar ( 2000 ) AS SELECT C.CustomerID , C.CompanyName FROM Northwind ..
Customers C JOIN CLR_charlist_split( @customers , DEFAULT ) s ON C.CustomerID = s.str go EXEC get_company_names_clr ' ALFKI , BONAP , CACTU , FRANK '
CREATE PROCEDURE get_product_names_clr @ids varchar( 50 ) AS SELECT P.ProductName , P.ProductID FROM Northwind .. Products P JOIN CLR_intlist_split( @ids ) i ON P.ProductID = i.number go EXEC get_product_names_clr ' 9 12 27 37 '
As with iter_intlist_to_tbl , CLR_intlist_split takes a space - separated list of integers .
What 's Going On ?
If you have never worked with CLR table functions before , you may at this point wonder how this all works , and I will try to explain .
CREATE ASSEMBLY loads the DLL into SQL Server .
Note that it does not merely save a pointer to the file ; the DLL as such is stored in the database .
Since CREATE ASSEMBLY operates from SQL Server , the file path refers to the drives on the server , not on your local machine .
( If you are loading the assembly from a network share , it 's better to specify the location by \\servername name than by drive letter . )
It is also possible to load an assembly as a hex - string .
The CREATE FUNCTION statements look just like the statements for creating multi-statement functions .
That is , you specify the parameter list and the return table .
But instead of a body , AS is followed by EXTERNAL NAME where you specify the CLR method to use .
This is a three - part name where the first part is the assembly , the second part is a class within the assembly , and the last part is the name of the method itself .
In this example , I 'm using the same name for the assembly in SQL Server as I do for the class .
In the return table the SQL Server data types must match the CLR data types .
Since the CLR only has Unicode strings , you can never use varchar in the return table , but you must use nvarchar .
This means that when you work with a list of strings that you must always be careful to remember to convert the output to varchar when you join with varchar columns in tables , as I discussed in the section varchar vs. nvarchar .
There is one more small detail on the return table :
For a multi-statement function you can specify that a column is nullable , you can define CHECK and DEFAULT constraints and define a PRIMARY KEY .
This is not possible for CLR functions .
If we turn to the C# code , the table - valued function is implemented through two C# methods .
The first method is the one that we point to in the CREATE FUNCTION statement .
The second method is specified through the attribute that comes first in the definition of the CLR_charlist_split method .
That is , this line :
[ SqlFunction ( FillRowMethodName= " CharlistFillRow " ) ]
This line specifies that the method is a table - valued function and points to the second method of the function .
CLR_charlist_split is the entry point and is called once .
The entry point must return a collection or an enumerator , and the CLR will call the method specified in FillRowMethodName once for every element in the collection / enumerator , and each invocation produces a row in the output table of the function .
So this is what happens when you call CLR_charlist_split from T‑SQL .
The C# method calls the String method Split which splits the string into a collection over a delimiter .
( For full details on Split , I refer you to the MSDN documentation . )
Since you get a collection , you need do no more .
The CLR calls CharlistFillRow for each element in the collection .
And as I noted above , as soon as a row is produced , it can be consumed in the outer query , without waiting for the table function to complete .
What about parameters ?
As you may guess , the parameter list of the entry method must agree with the parameter list in the CREATE FUNCTION statement .
The exact rules for mapping SQL data types to those of the CLR are beyond the scope of this text , please refer to Books Online for the full details .
The first parameter of the fill method ( CharlistFillRow ) is of the type object .
This is the current element in the collection / ​enumeration and to use it , you will need to cast it to the actual data type .
The remaining parameters to the fill method are all output parameters , and they map to the columns in the output table in the CREATE FUNCTION statement .
One more thing calls for attention : the return type of the entry function .
In this example it is IEnumerable , since Split returns a collection .
The only other alternative is IEnumerator , which we will look at shortly .
Back on Track
After this excursion into CLR , let 's get back to the topic of list - to - table functions .
What are the characteristics of the list - to - table functions that use Split ?
As you can see , we do n't return the list position .
As far as I know , you cannot get the list position this way , but I will have to admit that I have not dug into it .
Overall , Split puts you quite much into a straight - jacket .
You can be as flexible as Split is .
That includes specifying an alternate string delimiter , which can be multi-character , and you can specify that empty elements should not be returned ( which I make use of in the function for integers ) .
But that 's it .
There is another thing that is problematic with Split .
As I said , it splits up the entire string into a collection , and that collection takes up memory .
Of course , if you send in an occasional string with 10 elements that is not an issue .
But if you have a busy website with 10 000 concurrent users ?
SQL Server MVPs Paul Nielsen and Adam Machanic have both reported they have tried to use CLR functions based on Split with disastrous results .
If SQL Server comes under memory pressure , the AppDomain may be unloaded , which may cause a CLR function based on Split to crash .
Or at least the AppDomain will have to be reloaded , which takes a couple of seconds .
( If you are not acquainted with the term AppDomain , I will have to admit that it is a bit of mumbo - jumbo to me as well , but it is something that hosts the CLR execution .
I kindly refer you to Books Online and the .NET documentation for details . )
But in short : methods based on Split can lead to scalability and stability issues on a busy system .
Rolling Our Own in the CLR
Instead of relying on Split , we can do the work ourselves .
The advantage with this is that we win flexibility and we also avoid the stability issues with Split .
Here is a C# file that is longer than the previous one :
using System ; using System .
Collections ; using System.Data.SqlTypes ; using Microsoft.SqlServer .
Server ; public class CLR_iter { private class stringiter : IEnumerator { string _str ; char delim ; int _start_ix ; int _end_ix ; int _listpos ; public string str { get { return this .
_str ; } } public int start_ix { get { return this .
_start_ix ; } } public int end_ix { get { return this .
_end_ix ; } } public int listpos { get { return this .
_listpos ; } } public stringiter ( SqlString str , SqlString delimiter ) { this .
_str = str.IsNull ? " " : str.Value ; this .
delim = delimiter .
IsNull ? ' \ 0 ' : delimiter.Value.ToCharArray(0 , 1 ) [ 0 ] ; Reset ( ) ; } public bool MoveNext ( ) { this .
_start_ix = this ._end_ix + 1 ; if ( delim == ' ') { while ( this._start_ix < this._str.Length && this.str[this._start_ix ] == ' ') { this .
_start_ix ++ ; } } if ( this._start_ix >= this._str.Length ) { return false ; } this ._end_ix = this.str.IndexOf(this.delim , this ._start_ix ) ; this ._listpos ++ ; if ( this.end_ix == - 1 ) { this .
_end_ix = this ._str.
Length ; } return true ; } public Object Current { get { return this ; } } public void Reset ( ) { this .
_start_ix = - 1 ; this ._end_ix = - 1 ; this ._listpos = 0 ; } } [ SqlFunction ( FillRowMethodName= " CharlistFillRow " ) ] public static IEnumerator CLR_charlist_iter ( SqlString str , SqlString delimiter ) { return new stringiter ( str , delimiter ) ; } public static void CharlistFillRow ( object obj , out int listpos , out string str ) { stringiter iter = ( stringiter ) obj ; listpos = iter.listpos ; str = iter.str.Substring(iter.start_ix , iter.end_ix - iter.start_ix ) ; str = str. Trim ( ) ; } [ SqlFunction ( FillRowMethodName= " IntlistFillRow " ) ] public static IEnumerator CLR_intlist_iter ( SqlString str , SqlString delimiter ) { return new stringiter ( str , delimiter ) ; } public static void IntlistFillRow ( object obj , out int listpos , out int number ) { stringiter iter = ( stringiter ) obj ; listpos = iter.listpos ; string str = iter.str.Substring(iter.start_ix , iter.end_ix - iter.start_ix ) ; number = System .
Convert . ToInt32( str ) ; } }
The key is the internal class stringiter .
First note the class declaration itself :
private class stringiter : IEnumerator
This means that the class implements the IEnumerator interface which is a requirement for a table - valued function .
( That or IEnumerable . )
Next follows internal class variables , and property methods to read these values from outside the class .
Next piece of interest is the constructor :
public stringiter ( SqlString str , SqlString delimiter ) {
This method creates an instance of the stringiter class .
This constructor is called from the entry - point method of the table - valued function .
Next follow MoveNext , Current and Reset .
These are the methods that implement IEnumerator , and they must have precisely the names and signatures that you see above .
( For more details on IEnumerator , see MSDN . )
The interesting action goes on in MoveNext .
It is here we look for the next list element and it is here we determine whether we are at the end of the list .
As long as MoveNext returns true , the fill method of the table function will be called .
That is , MoveNext should not return false when it finds the last element , but the next time round .
What is interesting from a list - to - table perspective is that MoveNext handles space as the separator in a special way : multiple spaces are collapsed into one .
This does not happen with other delimiters .
After the code for the stringiter class come two entry - point methods with accompanying fill methods , one for strings and one for integers .
In difference to the previous example with Split , the entry - points here return IEnumerator , since we implement IEnumerator ourselves .
But similar to the Split example , all the entry - points do is to create a stringiter object .
The fill methods , finally , extracts the data from current stringiter object .
I grab hold of the list position , so it can appear in the output table .
For completeness , here is the SQL declaration of the functions :
CREATE FUNCTION CLR_charlist_iter( @list nvarchar ( MAX ) , @delim nchar ( 1 ) = ' , ') RETURNS TABLE ( listpos int , str nvarchar ( 4000 ) ) AS EXTERNAL NAME CLR_iter.CLR_iter.CLR_charlist_iter go CREATE FUNCTION CLR_intlist_iter( @list nvarchar ( MAX ) , @delim nchar ( 1 ) = ' ') RETURNS TABLE ( listpos int , number int ) AS EXTERNAL NAME CLR_iter.CLR_iter.CLR_intlist_iter
go
At first glance , it may seem that these functions do not give you that much more than Split .
You get the list position , and the intlist function has a delimiter parameter , but most of all you seem to get a lot more code .
But there is more than meet the eye .
The above gives you a framework to work with if you need to handle more complex list formats or some other functionality not supported by the functions as given .
Here , I have used the same enumerator class for strings and integers , but the fancier you want to be , it 's probably better to use different classes .
What About Performance ?
Overall , using a CLR function is one of the fastest methods around .
Of the methods presented in this article , it is generally only the fixed - length method that we will look at later that can compete .
To that comes table - valued parameters which I discuss in a separate article .
Since the CLR is fast , it 's no wonder that there is on - going battle in the bloggosphere about finding the very fastest function .
SQL Server MVP Adam Machanic presented what he thinks is the best so far in this blog post .
Instead of using the String class and the IndexOf method he loops over a Char array and looks for the delimiters himself .
However , when I have run my performance tests , the performance of the different CLR functions I have tested have been virtually identical .
I tested the two functions above , Adam's and one more which takes fixed - length input rather than a list of values ( more about this format later in the article ) .
Only at extremely long input , 50 000 list elements , I can sense a small advantage for the CLR_iter solution above , and with Adam 's solution tending to be the slowest .
But the difference is very small , maybe 20 milliseconds when the total execution time is half a second or more .
I should immediately qualify this .
Adam 's function handles multi-character delimiters , and mine does n't .
And to be able to handle multi-character delimiters Adam does the right thing .
If you would take my functions above and just change the definition , you would also lose some performance directly .
This is because when you pass IndexOf a Char parameter for the delimiter it is culture - insensitive .
( Which I assume is . NET - speak for binary . )
But if you instead pass the delimiter as a String – which you would need to for a multi-character delimiter – you will invoke an overload of IndexOf that is culture - sensitive , that is , you get the full Unicode overhead , which as I discussed above comes with a cost in performance .
There is nevertheless one performance flaw in Adam 's function as posted : he only provides a function that returns strings , so if you have a list of integers , you need to apply convert in your T‑SQL code .
When testing , I found that there was a small performance benefit of having the conversion done in the C# code than in the T‑SQL code .
( This is not covered in the performance appendixes , because by the time I made that particular test , I had already compiled the results . )
As I have mentioned , in the later of my suite of tests , I included a multi - thread test to see how the various methods scale in a multi-user environment .
I did not have the opportunity to run these tests on server - class hardware , and I have limited faith in the accuracy and the relevance of the results .
However , the CLR methods emerged as clear winners : they were consistently among the methods that scaled the best .
( Observer here that due to an issue in my test setup , I was not able to include table - valued parameters in the multithread tests . )
Interesting enough , the functions based on Split performed well in my tests even when I ran with 100 parallel threads and I did not see the issues that Adam and Paul have reported .
I have a theory that these crashes were more likely to appear on 32 - bit SQL Server where the full memory space beyond 2 GB was available only to the buffer cache , and the rest have to be shoehorned into the lower 2 GB .
But that is mere speculation on my part .
In any case , today 32 - bit SQL Server is much a thing of the past .
CLR Strict Security
Background
The original model when the CLR was introduced was that an assembly could be labelled as SAFE , EXTERNAL_ACCESS or UNSAFE .
A feature in .NET known as Code Access Security ( CAS ) guaranteed that a safe assembly operated only in the .NET realm and therefore could not affect the SQL Server engine or its environment .
To create a safe assembly , you only needed database permissions , whereas unsafe and external - access assemblies required blessing on server level in any of the ways described below .
CAS ceased to be a security boundary in .NET with the release of .NET 4 which has been in use in SQL Server since SQL 2012 .
Thus , since this release it has been theoretically possible that an attacker could create an assembly which passes the checks for a safe assembly , but nevertheless performs unsafe operations which could threaten server stability or permit the attacker to run code with sysadmin permission .
Nevertheless , it was not until 2017 that the SQL Server team reacted and introduced CLR Strict Security .
When this setting is in force , all assemblies are considered unsafe and require blessing on server level .
CLR Strict Security was backported to SQL 2012 , SQL 2014 and SQL 2016 ( see KB article 4018930 for an exact list on in which builds it was added ) .
In these versions , it is enabled by trace flag 6545 ( which must be specified at startup ; it cannot be controlled by DBCC TRACEON / TRACEOFF ) .
On SQL 2017 there is a proper configuration option clr strict security as I have already showed you .
This setting is on by default ( unless the instance was upgraded from a previous version of SQL Server ) .
Keep in mind that if you are on a lower version of SQL Server than SQL 2017 , CLR Strict Security may not affect you today , but most likely you will sooner or later upgrade to SQL 2017 or a later version and find that CLR Strict Security is in force .
Thus , you should keep this in mind if you start using the CLR .
Loading an Unsafe Assembly
To load an unsafe assembly ( which includes safe assemblies when CLR Strict Security is in force ) , there are three possible ways :
Compute a SHA_512 hash for the assembly and add this assembly as trusted with the system procedure sp_add_trusted_assembly .
This procedure is only available in SQL 2017 or later .
One way to do this is to load the DLL into SQL Server with OPENROWSET ( BULK ) and then use the hash_bytes function .
I describe a procedure that performs this in the chapter Loading CLR Objects in the appendix to my article Packaging Permissions in Stored Procedures .
( I should warn you that this chapter is by no means directed to the CLR beginner and also assumes that you have read the better part of the main article . )
You can also compute the hash outside SQL Server .
Sign the assembly with an asymmetric key and then load that key into the master database .
Then you create a login for that key and grant that login the permission UNSAFE ASSEMBLY .
The easiest way to sign the assembly is when you compile it : SN -k keypair.snk csc / target: library /keyfile:keypair.snk CLR_iter.cs
To create the asymmetric key and grant permission , you run in master : CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY CLR_iter_key FROM FILE = 'C:\SomePath\keypair.snk '
ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = ' VeEeeRRy $ tr0gn P@s$wörd ' CREATE LOGIN CLR_iter_key_login FROM ASYMMETRIC KEY CLR_iter_key GRANT UNSAFE ASSEMBLY TO CLR_iter_key_login
Note that this login is a special type of login which cannot actually log in .
The database is marked as TRUSTWORTHY and the database owner has been granted the permission UNSAFE ASSEMBLY .
( Which it has in the far too common case that sa owns the database ) .
This is a setting I strongly recommend against , unless you understand the exact implications of TRUSTWORTHY and you have concluded that they do not apply to your environment .
Casual use of TRUSTWORTHY can permit users with permissions to create users or assemblies in a database to elevate to sysadmin .
I discuss this in more detail in my aritcle Packaging Permissions in Stored Procedures .
string_split – the Built - in Solution
SQL 2016 introduced a new built - in function , string_split which saves you from writing your own list - to - table function .
This is certainly convenient , not the least if you are in the unfortunate situation that you cannot add your own user - defined functions to the database , but you have work with that is there .
However , string_split is not that simple to use , not the least if you want to avoid performance surprises .
Generally , I would say the function feels half - baked to me .
Here is an example of how to use it for an integer list :
CREATE PROCEDURE get_product_names_builtin @ids varchar( 50 ) AS SELECT P.ProductName , P.ProductID FROM Northwind .. Products P JOIN string_split( @ids , ' , ' ) s ON P.ProductID = convert ( int , s.value ) go EXEC get_product_names_builtin ' 9 , 12 , 27 , 37 '
Because string_split always return character data , you need to cast the return value to int ( or some other numeric data type ) .
It is true that some of the functions in the article also are of this kind , but given that numeric lists are so common , I think that when they added a built - in , they could have added a second one for numbers .
As you see from the example , you can specify a delimiter – in fact this is mandatory .
Again , given how common comma-separated lists are , one like to think that this could have been made the default .
The input string can be of any varchar and nvarchar length , including MAX , so from that point of view , nothing is missing .
On the other hand , the delimiter can only be char ( 1 ) or nchar ( 1 ) .
That is , there is no support for multi-character delimiters .
( Nor does any of the other functions described in this article support multi-character delimiter , but you can easily modify them if you have the need .
But you cannot modify string_split . )
Here is an example with using string_split to crack a list of strings :
CREATE PROCEDURE get_company_names_builtin @customers nvarchar( MAX ) AS SELECT C.CustomerID , C.CompanyName FROM Northwind .. Customers C JOIN string_split( @customers , ' , ' ) s ON C.CustomerID = convert ( char ( 5 ) , ltrim ( s.value ) ) go EXEC get_company_names_builtin ' ALFKI , BONAP , CACTU , FRANK '
You may be surprised by the appearance of ltrim .
and the explicit convert to char ( 5 ) .
The call to ltrim is necessary here , because string_split does not trim leading or trailing spaces , but goes blindly by the delimiter .
So without ltrim I would not get BONAP , but BONA with a leading space .
( I do n't use rtrim here , since trailing spaces are ignored in string comparison in SQL anyway . )
Many of the other functions in this article , performs the trimming for you .
Why convert then ?
The return type of the column value the same as the type for the input list .
This choice is not illogical , since in theory the list could be a single element and there should be no truncation .
But this means that if the input is ( n) varchar ( MAX ) the type of value is also MAX , and as I discussed in the section MAX Types vs. Regular ( n) varchar this introduces an implicit conversion of the table column which impairs performance .
Whence , we need to use convert to prevent this from happening .
Since it is not very common that you want to extract elements as long as 4000 characters , I think it would have been a better choice to limit the return type to never be more than 8000 bytes , no matter the input .
Another shortcoming of string_split is that it returns this single column value .
That is , you can not get the list position .
There are many situations where you do n't need this , but certainly often enough to find this lamentable .
What 's the point with a built - in function that you can only use sometimes ?
When it comes to performance , the optimizer estimates string_split to always return 50 elements .
That is , it does not consider the length of the input string , nor is string_split subject to interleaved execution in SQL 2017 like multi-statement table - valued functions are .
( See the section Inline , Multi -Statement and Temp Tables above for a furhter discussion . )
I have not run any performance tests with this function , so I cannot say how well it fares , but I would expect it to do well , since there is no T‑SQL overhead .
However , it has a go - slower button pressed .
To wit , the delimiter is handled according to the current collation , which means that with a Windows collation you drag in the full Unicode comparison rules and the overhead that comes with them .
You can avoid this by forcing a binary collation yourself , but then you are likely to get a collation conflict with the column you are comparing to .
So to get the best performance you end up with :
CREATE PROCEDURE get_company_names_builtin @customers nvarchar( MAX ) AS SELECT C.CustomerID , C.CompanyName FROM Northwind ..
Customers C JOIN string_split( @customers , ' , ' COLLATE Slovenian_BIN2 ) s ON C.CustomerID = convert ( char ( 5 ) , ltrim ( s.value ) ) COLLATE DATABASE_DEFAULT go EXEC get_company_names_builtin ' ALFKI , BONAP , CACTU , FRANK '
Note here that DATABASE_DEFAULT assumes that the C.CustomerID actually follows the database collation .
That is , you must make sure that you use the collation of the column you are comparing to .
If you force any other collation , any index on the column is dead and you may be in a performance disaster because of the scan .
( The reason you would prefer DATABASE_DEFAULT over the actual collation is of course to avoid any hard - coding . )
By now the usage of string_split is so complex , that the benefit of that the function is built - in is almost lost .
Then again , you could wrap it in your own functions to overcome most of the problems I have discussed here :
CREATE FUNCTION string_split_wrapper ( @list nvarchar ( MAX ) ) RETURNS @t TABLE ( value nvarchar ( 4000 ) NOT NULL ) AS BEGIN INSERT @t ( value ) SELECT convert( nvarchar ( 4000 ) , ltrim ( rtrim ( value ) ) ) FROM string_split( @list , ' , ' COLLATE Slovenian_BIN2 ) RETURN END go CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE get_company_names_wrapper @customers nvarchar( MAX ) AS SELECT C.CustomerID , C.CompanyName FROM Northwind ..
Customers C JOIN dbo.string_split_wrapper(@customers ) s ON C.CustomerID = s.value go EXEC get_company_names_wrapper
' ALFKI , BONAP , CACTU , FRANK '
You would do a similar function for numeric lists .
You get then benefits of interleaved execution in SQL 2017 , and functionally it is in par with many of the functions in this aritcle , and I would expect it to perform better than most of them .
You would still not be able to get the list position .
If you are the brave sort of person you could add an IDENTITY column to the return table or something like
row_number ( ) OVER ( ORDER BY ( SELECT ( NULL ) )
but if it would seem to work , it would only be by chance , and there would be no guarantees .
XML and JSON
Rather than passing a comma-separated list , you can create an XML document to pass your list of values .
Undeniably , this is more complex , so in most cases you may not find it worth the trouble as long it 's only a list of single values .
Where XML really shines is when you need to insert many rows .
You transform your data to an XML document in the client , and then you unpack it into your tables with the xml type methods .
Until table - valued parameters made the scene in SQL 2008 , XML was the best method to pass a set of data from an application .
If you are on SQL 2016 or later , you can instead use JSON , which I will discuss very briefly here .
Using XML for a List of Values
Let 's go straight to the matter .
Here are our get_company_names and get_product_names using XML .
CREATE PROCEDURE get_company_names_xml @customers xml AS SELECT C.CustomerID , C.CompanyName FROM Northwind .. Customers C JOIN @customers.nodes ('/ Root / Customer ') AS T( Item ) ON C.CustomerID = T.Item.value ('@custid [ 1 ] ' , ' nchar ( 5 ) ' ) go EXEC get_company_names_xml N'< Root >< Customer custid= " ALFKI " /> < Customer custid= " BONAP " /> < Customer custid= " CACTU " /> < Customer custid= " FRANK " /> </ Root >' go CREATE PROCEDURE get_product_names_xml @ids xml AS SELECT P.ProductName , P.ProductID FROM Northwind .. Products P JOIN @ids.nodes ('/ Root / Num ' ) AS T( Item ) ON P.ProductID = T.Item.value ( '@num [ 1 ] ' , 'int ' ) go EXEC get_product_names_xml N' < Root >< Num num = " 9 " />< Num num = " 12 " /> < Num num = " 27 " />< Num num = " 37 " /></ Root >'
The two xml type methods we use are nodes and value .
nodes is a rowset function that returns a one - column table where each row is an XML fragment for the given path .
That is , in the two examples , you get one row for each Customer or Num node .
As with derived tables , you must specify an alias for the return table .
You must also specify a name for the column that nodes produces .
( You can name columns in derived tables in this way too , but it 's not that common to do so . )
The sole operation you can perform on T.Item is to employ any of the four xml type methods : exists , query , nodes and value .
Of interest to us here is value .
This method extracts a single value from the XML fragment .
value takes two parameters :
The first is a node specification for a single element or attribute .
In this case we want an attribute – custid and num respectively – which is why we specify with @ in front .
( Without the @ it would be an element specification . )
As for the meaning of [ 1 ] , I will come back that .
The second argument to value is the T‑SQL data type for the return value .
Creating the XML Document
Normally , you create the XML document client side using some suitable library for the purpose , for instance the XmlWriter class in .NET .
You should never attempt to create XML documents by just concatenating strings , since many characters needs to be encoded when you put them in XML .
For instance , the ampersand character ( & ) is encoded as & in XML .
That said , for a list of numbers there are not really many things that can go wrong .
So here is a procedure that receives a comma-separated list and transforms it into XML and then shreds the XML to get the values :
CREATE PROCEDURE get_product_names_xmlcsv @csv varchar( 100 ) AS DECLARE @xml xml = '< Root >< Num num= " ' + replace ( convert ( varchar ( MAX ) , @csv ) , ' , ' COLLATE Slovenian_BIN2 , ' " />< Num num= " ' ) + '"/></Root >'
SELECT P.ProductName , P.ProductID FROM Northwind .. Products P JOIN @xml.nodes ('/ Root / Num ' ) AS T( Item ) ON P.ProductID = T.Item.value ( '@num [ 1 ] ' , 'int ' ) go EXEC get_product_names_xmlcsv ' 9 , 12 , 27 , 37 '
At first glance , this may seem more cute than useful , but if you are in the dire situation that you cannot create functions in the database , this is not a bad solution at all .
After all , it is quite compact .
The reason I cast @csv to varchar ( MAX ) is that if @csv is regular varchar , so is the return type from replace .
If the input is close to 8000 characters , truncation could occur .
But please do n't ever do this for a list of strings – this is bound to end in tears the day when there are XML special characters in the data .
Performance
Just like with the CLR , the data from nodes streams into the rest of the query , so XML is also an inline method .
But since parsing XML is more complex than parsing comma-separated lists , it 's slower .
In my tests , the execution times for XML are 40 - 60 % higher than for the CLR , but it is twice as fast as the iterative method .
In fact , XML is the fastest method that does not require any preparations in the server : you do n't have to activate the CLR and create a function , nor do you need to define a table type for a table - valued parameter .
You may guess that there is a higher performance cost for passing an XML document , and indeed there is .
In my tests I measured this to be 20 - 25 ms for 10 000 list elements , to compare with 5 - 7 ms for most other methods .
It 's hardly a cause for alarm .
Note : these observations applies to case when the XML document is passed from the client .
I have not run any performance tests with the pattern in get_product_names_xmlcsv , since I added that example in the revision in 2016 .
But the only extra cost is the cost for replace , which I 've tried to minimize with forcing a binary collation .
That said , it shall not be denied that there are certainly problems with performance with the xml type methods and XQuery in SQL Server .
When the optimizer gets it right , performance is often very good .
But if the optimizer gets it wrong , performance can be very bad .
From one point of view , this is not entirely surprising : the optimizer has very little idea of what is in that XML document , and rather than using estimates based on data , it relies on standard assumptions .
Unfortunately , one cannot escape the feeling that the optimization of XML queries is an unfinished chapter in SQL Server .
Sometimes , seemingly meaningless changes can have a big impact on performance .
Above I wrote the expression to extract a number from the XML document as :
T.Item.value ( '@num [ 1 ] ' , ' int ' )
But I did not say what [ 1 ] means .
The answer is that it means – nothing !
@num and @num [ 1 ] means the same thing : retrieve the attribute num in the current context node .
Unfortunately , SQL Server does not seem to understand this , and will generate different query plans depending on [ 1 ] is there or not .
In many cases the plan with only @num will be a teeny - weeny more efficient , because it has fewer operators .
But because of its misperception of what @num implies , the optimizer sometimes produces a really bad plan .
This is less likely to happen if you add [ 1 ] .
Thus , my recommendation is that you always add [ 1 ] to address attributes , although there is no logical reason why you should have to .
( And do n't be surprised if you find queries where removing [ 1 ] gives you a vast performance improvement .
Query plans when XQuery is involved sometimes feel very much like a lottery . )
One practical conclusion of this is that you should be restrictive to entangle the shredding of the XML document with the rest of your data .
It may be better to keep it simple and insert the data into a temp table and take benefit of that temp tables have statistics .
List Position
I thought for a long time that you cannot the retrieve list position from an XML document , as there is no xml type method that returns this information .
Then SQL Server MVP Alejandro Mesa reminded me that you can try :
row_number ( ) OVER ( ORDER BY T.c )
That is , you order by the XML fragment produced by the nodes method .
Digging into the query plan , and looking at the Sort operator , I find that it sorts by this expression :
[ XML Reader with XPath filter ] .
id
Looks good , does n't it ?
But beware !
This is not documented , and this could be something that works only by chance .
( That would not be the first time in the history of SQL Server when it comes to ordering . )
If you look at it from a logical view what would ordering by an XML fragment mean ?
That is just nonsense !
Furthermore , if you try :
SELECT ... ORDER BY T.c
you will be told that this is not legal .
I suspect the reason that it is accepted in the OVER ( ) clause is due to an oversight .
Thus , my recommendation is that you stay away from numbering by the context node .
Thankfully , there is a fully supported alternative , and again credit goes to Alejandro Mesa for finding a clever solution .
But to explain it , we need to dig a little deeper into XPath , XQuery and the xml type methods .
We also need another device that I will introduce in the next chapter .
So I will return to the numbering of XML documents in the section XML Revisited , later in this article .
Inserting Many Rows
I said that where XML is really good is when you need to insert many rows .
So how would you do that ?
In fact you have already seen the basics .
You use nodes and value .
Here is an example where I unpack a document with orders and order details :
DECLARE @x xml SELECT @x = N'< Orders > < Order OrderID =" 13000 " CustomerID=" ALFKI " OrderDate = " 2006-09 -20 Z " EmployeeID= " 2 " > < OrderDetails ProductID = " 76 " Price = " 123 " Qty = " 10 " /> < OrderDetails ProductID =" 16 " Price = " 3.23 " Qty = " 20 " / > </ Order > < Order OrderID =" 13001 " CustomerID=" VINET " OrderDate = " 2006-09 -20 Z " EmployeeID= " 1 " > < OrderDetails ProductID =" 12 " Price = " 12.23 " Qty = " 1 " / > </ Order > </ Orders >' SELECT OrderID = T.Item.value('@OrderID [ 1 ] ' , 'int ' ) , CustomerID = T.Item.value('@CustomerID [ 1 ] ' , ' nchar ( 5 ) ' ) , OrderDate = T.Item.value ('@OrderDate [ 1 ] ' , ' datetime ' ) , EmployeeId = T.Item.value('@EmployeeID [ 1 ] ' , ' smallint ' ) FROM @x.nodes ('/ Orders / Order ') AS T( Item )
SELECT OrderID = A.Item.value('@OrderID [ 1 ] ' , 'int ' ) , ProductID = B.Item.value('@ProductID [ 1 ] ' , ' smallint ' ) , Price = B.Item.value ('@ Price [ 1 ] ' , ' decimal ( 10,2 ) ' ) , Qty = B.Item.value ( '@Qty [ 1 ] ' , 'int ' ) FROM @x.nodes ('/ Orders / Order ') AS A ( Item ) CROSS APPLY A.Item.nodes ( ' OrderDetails ') AS B ( Item )
As you see , the document can include data for several tables , and extracting the order - header information is straight - forward .
We use nodes to get data from that level , and then we pick the attributes with value .
Extracting the details rows is a little more interesting , because beside the information about product , quantity and price , we also need to get the order ID which is in the node above .
The way to approach this is to first run nodes on the Order level , and use the CROSS APPLY operator to run nodes on the details for each order .
( Recall that CROSS APPLY is like a JOIN , but which can take arguments from the left side in difference to a normal join . )
This latter may sound a little inefficient , so you may be tempted to try this instead :
SELECT OrderID = T.Item.value ( '../ @OrderID [ 1 ] ' , 'int ' ) , ProductID = T.Item.value('@ProductID [ 1 ] ' , ' smallint ' ) , Price = T.Item.value ('@ Price [ 1 ] ' , ' decimal ( 10,2 ) ' ) , Qty = T.Item.value ( '@Qty [ 1 ] ' , 'int ' ) FROM @x.nodes ('/ Orders / Order/ OrderDetails ') AS T ( Item )
That is , you use the parent - axis notation to retrieve the order ID .
But as I mentioned , XQuery optimizing is not always the best in SQL Server , and parent access is a sore area .
When I have tested , the above has worked well , but only if I included that [ 1 ] which does not mean anything .
With only ../ @OrderID , I got a very bad query plan ; in a test I ran , it took 10 - 30 seconds to extract 2155 details rows from 830 orders , whereas when written as a above , execution time was subsecond .
I have reported the poor performance in this feedback item .
Microsoft 's response is that they recommend against using parent - axis notation , in favour of CROSS APPLY .
And even if I was able to get good performance when I added the [ 1 ] , I cannot guarantee that you will get a good query plan .
The solution with CROSS APPLY seems to be more stable , which is why you should stick with it .
Element - centric XML
What you have seen above is attribute - centric XML .
You can also use element - centric XML , where the XML document for product IDs would look like this :
< Root >< Num>9</Num >< Num>12</Num >< Num>27</Num>< Num>37</Num></Root >
For the first parameter to value you could give a single period to denote the current element to extract the values :
SELECT P.ProductName , P.ProductID FROM Northwind .. Products P JOIN @ids.nodes ('/ Root / Num ' ) AS T( Item ) ON P.ProductID = T.Item.value ('.' , ' int ' )
That looks really simple , but as you might guess from the fact I 've put it red , you should not use this .
When this works well , you can count on an overhead of 30 % compared to the query for attribute - centric XML .
But it can also work really badly , particularly if the SELECT is part of an INSERT statement .
I have experienced that it could take four minutes to unpack a document with 10 000 numbers .
This may have been a bug that has been fixed , as I am no longer able to repro the problem .
Nevertheless , there is a way to get better and more predictable performance from element - centred XML that I learnt from SQL Server MVP Alejandro Mesa :
SELECT P.ProductName , P.ProductID FROM Northwind .. Products P JOIN @ids.nodes ('/ Root / Num ' ) AS T( Item ) ON P.ProductID = T.Item.value ('(./ text ( ) ) [ 1 ] ' , 'int ' )
It sure is a strain on the eye , but this more complex expression has three advantages :
1 ) It is not subject to the bug that can cause bad query plans .
2 ) Execution time is in par with attribute - centric XML , or even somewhat better .
3 ) Empty elements are interpreted as NULL .
You may ask what that text ( ) does , and if it has a real meaning , or if it something equally silly like that [ 1 ] .
The answer is that text ( ) is for real .
Consider this little batch :
DECLARE @x xml = '< Root >< Sub > One < Subsub > Two </ Subsub > Three < Subsub > Four </ Subsub ></ Sub ></Root >'
SELECT T.c.value ('.' , ' nvarchar ( 20 ) ' ) AS Dot , T.c.value ( '(./ text ( ) ) [ 1 ] ' , ' nvarchar ( 20 ) ' ) AS Text FROM @x.nodes ( ' Root / Sub ' ) AS T(c )
The output is :
Dot Text
-------------------- --------------------
OneTwoThreeFour One
That is , with '. ' you get all text that is in the Sub node , including the Subsub nodes .
With text ( ) , which is not a function but said to be a node test , you only get the text outside the Subsub nodes .
Furthermore , you are compelled to specify which of texts you want ; that is , [ ] is compulsory .
You can use [ 2 ] in place of [ 1 ] in which case you get back Three , the second data value in the Sub element .
Certainly , this XML document is a bit wretched , and for most XML documents in this world there is no practical difference between a mere '.' and the complex '(./ text ( ) ) [ 1 ] ' , but SQL Server has to assume the worst about the XML document you feed it , and this is why using only '. ' will always be slower .
This example also displays the difference between attributes and elements .
An attribute can only appear once within a node , and it cannot contain other elements or attributes , which is why attributes are quite a simpler affair .
But it seems that SQL Server does not realise this , but the query plans for attributes are very similar for those for element - centric XML .
Presumably this explains why it may matter to add [ 1 ] to attributes .
Above I said that an advantage with text ( ) is that empty elements are interpreted as NULL .
In case you wonder what I mean , consider :
DECLARE @x xml SELECT @x = '< Root >< Value ></ Value ></Root >'
SELECT T.c.value ('.' , ' int ' ) AS " without " , T.c.value ( '(./ text ( ) ) [ 1 ] ' , ' int ' ) AS " with text " FROM @x.nodes ( '/ Root / Value ' ) AS T(c )
The output from this is :
without with text -----------
----------- 0 NULL
That is , if an element is present , but have no actual text , you get a non -NULL value if you only use '.' , which can yield unexpected results as demonstrated in this example , whereas with '(./ text ( ) ) [ 1 ] ' you get back NULL which is more likely to be what you want .
Inserting Many Rows from Element - centric Documents
In the examples with a list of values , the element - centric document is considerably simpler and shorter .
But that is an exception .
Normally , element - centric documents are far more verbose than the corresponding attribute - centric document .
Here is an element - centric version of the order document above :
< Orders > < Order > < OrderID>13000</OrderID > < CustomerID>ALFKI</CustomerID>
< OrderDate >2006-09-20Z</OrderDate > < EmployeeID>2</EmployeeID > < OrderDetails > < ProductID>76</ProductID >
< Price > 123</Price > < Qty >10</Qty > </ OrderDetails > < OrderDetails > < ProductID>16</ProductID > < Price > 3.23</Price > < Qty>20</Qty > </ OrderDetails > </ Order > < Order > < OrderID>13001</OrderID > < CustomerID>VINET</CustomerID>
< OrderDate >2006-09-20Z</OrderDate > < EmployeeID>1</EmployeeID > < OrderDetails > < ProductID>12</ProductID >
< Price > 12.23</Price > < Qty>1</Qty > </ OrderDetails > </ Order > </ Orders >
Here is how you would unpack it :
SELECT OrderID = T.Item.value ('( OrderID / text ( ) ) [ 1 ] ' , 'int ' ) , CustomerID = T.Item.value ('( CustomerID /text ( ) ) [ 1 ] ' , ' nchar ( 5 ) ' ) , OrderDate = T.Item.value ('( OrderDate / text ( ) ) [ 1 ] ' , ' datetime ' ) , Employee Id = T.Item.value ('( EmployeeID/text ( ) ) [ 1 ] ' , ' smallint ' ) FROM @x.nodes ( ' Orders / Order ' ) AS T( Item ) SELECT OrderID = O.n.value ( '( OrderID / text ( ) ) [ 1 ] ' , 'int ' ) , ProductID = D.n.value ( '( ProductID / text ( ) ) [ 1 ] ' , 'int ' ) , Price = D.n.value ( '( Price / text ( ) ) [ 1 ] ' , ' decimal ( 10,2 ) ' ) , Qty = D.n.value ( '( Qty / text ( ) ) [ 1 ] ' , ' int ' ) FROM @x.nodes ('/ Orders / Order ') AS O(n ) CROSS APPLY O.n.nodes ( ' OrderDetails ') AS D(n )
In this case , too , you need to use text ( ) to get best performance .
As with attribute - centric XML , the best way to get the order ID together with the details rows , is to first run nodes on Order level , and then descend to the details level for each order .
Using parent - notation as in ../ OrderID can easily yield very poor performance with Microsoft 's unfinished XQuery implementation .
Typed XML
So far we have only looked at untyped XML , but it is possible to define an XML schema with the command CREATE XML SCHEMA COLLECTION .
When you define a variable or column , you can say xml( mycollection ) rather than just xml .
SQL Server will then validate that the document adheres to that schema .
This is known as typed XML .
Using typed XML can have some positive impact on performance , since the schema informs the optimizer that some things cannot occur .
For instance , this statement defines how the XML document with a list of values could look like :
CREATE XML SCHEMA COLLECTION elemnum AS '< ?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " utf - 8 " ?> < xs:schema attributeFormDefault=" unqualified " elementFormDefault=" qualified " xmlns:xs= " http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema " > < xs:element name= " Root " > < xs:complexType > < xs:sequence > < xs:element maxOccurs=" unbounded " name = " Num " type = " xs:int " /> </xs:sequence > </xs:complexType > </xs:element > </xs:schema >'
( I 'm afraid it 's completely outside the scope of this article to explain this .
Unfortunately Books
Online does not really describe this either , but XSD is a standard defined by W3C . )
Using this schema , we can write :
DECLARE @x( elemnum ) SELECT @x = N'< Root >< Num>9</ Num >< Num>12</Num >< Num>27</Num>< Num>37</Num></Root >'
SELECT P.ProductName , P.ProductID FROM Northwind .. Products P JOIN @ids.nodes ('/ Root / Num ' ) AS T( Item ) ON P.ProductID = T.Item.value ('.' , ' int ' )
You may note that this time I did not put the use of '. ' in red this time .
The XML schema states that a Num node includes one single number and that 's all , so SQL Server does not need to consider the situation with text and subnodes interleaved , as in the example above .
For this reason text ( ) is not needed – in fact text ( ) is not even permitted with typed XML .
This performs well , and in some tests I was able to achieve significantly better performance than with untyped XML .
But most of the time the schema appears to incur an overhead , and not the least the validation to pass data to a typed XML parameter is quite expensive : 130 - 170 ms for 10 000 integers in my tests .
Or about the same time it takes for the fastest methods to process that many elements at all .
( And when I used typed element - centric XML in an EXISTS query , the result was a disaster – more than two minutes to find 20 items in my test table .
This beats all those inline functions with a wide margin . )
Thus , I would not consider using typed XML for a a list of scalar values to be a serious option .
What the schema buys you is protection against errors like misspelling an element or attribute name .
But for a list of values you will probably find such errors quickly anyway .
On the other hand , if you are using XML to pass more complex data sets around , using a schema can be worthwhile , not the least if different teams are involved .
OPENXML
Already in SQL 2000 you could use XML thanks to the OPENXML function .
OPENXML is still around in SQL 2017 , but about the only reason to use it would be that you still need to support SQL 2000 .
OPENXML is bulkier to use , and performance is nowhere near nodes .
In fact , in my tests it 's 30 - 50 % slower than the iterative method .
One possible advantage with OPENXML , though , is that the query plan is simpler .
Query plans for XQuery mixes XML operators with relational operators , whereas OPENXML results in one single Remote Scan .
This reduces the risk for the query - plan disasters you sometimes get with XQuery .
If you want to see an example of OPENXML , please refer to the SQL 2000 version of this article .
JSON
Before we leave this chapter , a little about JSON .
Support for JSON was added in SQL 2016 on , as they say , popular request .
There is no JSON data type , but there is an OPENJSON and a few more JSON functions as well as a FOR JSON operator .
Just like you can transform your comma-separated list of numbers to XML , you can transform it to JSON .
There is one noticeable difference : it is a lot simpler .
Here is an example :
CREATE PROCEDURE get_product_names_json @csv varchar( 100 ) AS SELECT P.ProductName , P.ProductID FROM Northwind .. Products P JOIN OPENJSON ( '[ ' + @csv + ' ] ' ) j ON convert ( int , j.value ) = P. ProductID go EXEC get_product_names_json ' 9 , 12 , 27 , 37 '
All you need to do is wrap the list in brackets .
Well , since the column value always is of the type nvarchar ( MAX ) , you need to cast it back to int .
I would not recommend doing this for list of strings , as I assume that there could be accidents if there are characters special to JSON in the data , but I do n't know JSON myself to really say this with authority .
It is worth noting that the result set from OPENJSON includes a column key , which for a list above returns the list position starting on 0 .
Just beware that the datatype of key is nvarchar ( 4000 ) not int , as with other JSON documents it can hold string data .
I have not tested OPENJSON for performance , but I note that the estimate appears to always be 50 rows .
Since a JSON document just like XML can include data for several fields and records and they can be nested , it lends itself for inserting many rows .
You probably would not create a JSON document out of another data source , not the least when you can use a table - valued parameter .
On the other hand , if you already have the data as JSON , it makes sense to pass it to SQL Server as -is .
Using a Table of Numbers
The Concept
This is the fastest way to unpack a comma-separated list of numbers in pure T‑SQL .
That is , this is the section for you who want a fast function , but feel the CLR is not for you and nor do you want to change the format of the string .
The trick is to use an auxiliary table of numbers : a one - column table with numbers from 1 and up .
Here is how you can create a table with numbers from 1 to 999 999 :
CREATE TABLE Numbers ( Number int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY ) ; WITH digits ( d) AS ( SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4 UNION SELECT 5 UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8 UNION SELECT 9 UNION SELECT 0 ) INSERT Numbers ( Number ) SELECT Number FROM ( SELECT i.d + ii.d * 10 + iii.d * 100 + iv.d * 1000 + v.d * 10000 + vi.d * 100000 AS
Number FROM digits i CROSS JOIN digits ii CROSS JOIN digits iii CROSS JOIN digits iv CROSS JOIN digits v CROSS JOIN digits vi ) AS Numbers WHERE Number > 0
First I set up a CTE to define a virtual table that has all digits from 0 to 9 , and then I create a Cartesian product for as many powers of ten I want numbers in my table .
Before I go on and show how to use this table to unpack a comma-separated list , I like to point out that this sort of table has a much wider usage .
Just to give you a taste of it , I will quickly two show examples .
Say you have a long string where you want to count the frequency of the various characters .
You can use Numbers to " loop " over the string to get the characters in tabular format :
DECLARE @str nvarchar ( MAX ) SELECT @str =
' Insert your favourite novel here . '
SELECT substring ( @str , Number , 1 ) AS ch , COUNT (*) FROM Numbers WHERE Number <= len( @str ) GROUP BY substring ( @str , Number , 1 ) ORDER BY ch
If this example is little on the esoteric side , the next is definitely a common one .
You need to return the number of orders per day for a period , say a month .
If there are days without any orders they should be included in the output , showing a zero for the count .
To achieve this , you need something that spans the entire period for you , and then left join the period with the Orders table .
This is exactly what Num
If there 's one thing that many techies have in common , it 's some form of insomnia .
Whether it 's because you can't fall asleep easily , you wake up too early , or you keep waking up throughout the night , not getting a good night 's sleep can seriously affect your health and productivity .
From a personal perspective , staff members here at Ars ( myself included ) have had trouble sleeping for many years .
We run the gamut from full - on CPAP machine users , to over - the - counter and prescription medicators , to new - agey meditators , and more .
And now , some of us have become gadget experimenters .
Aside from the obvious advice — " go see a doctor , you freaking tool , " as forum - goers would say — we would n't be geeks if we did n't investigate the various technological solutions that claim to help improve our sleep cycles .
Some only track the quality of your sleep , while others actually try to make it better , but we thought we'd give a rundown of what 's available to try and hack a good night 's sleep .
Tracking
There are a number of gadgets available that help you track how well ( or poorly , as the case may be ) you sleep at night .
They all generally follow the same methods — you usually have to attach something to your wrist or clothing that will track the frequency and severity of your movements throughout the night .
Then , you can see how many times you 're waking up and attempt to adjust other things in hopes of fixing the problem .
The fitbit does n't just track your sleep — it also tracks your physical activity .
It 's a tiny clip about the size of a third - gen iPod shuffle that clips onto your clothing and , if you 're using it to follow your sleep patterns , will record how often you move during the night .
The company claims on its FAQ page that " sleep data from the Tracker correlates very strongly with results from polysomnograms found in sleep labs , " and the device will transmit your data wirelessly to both a Mac or PC .
( Unfortunately , the fitbit 's official release has been pushed back several times and it's not yet available . )
Similarly , sleep monitoring watches such as the SleepTracker Pro follow your nocturnal movements in the same way .
However , this watch ( and many others like it ) also has an added feature : it will wake you up in the morning at what it considers to be the most optimal time in your sleep cycle .
It determines this by the frequency of your waking periods towards the end of your sleep and determining a window of time when you should wake up , based around a " no later than this " time that you set .
The most expensive of these options , the aXbo " sleep phase alarm clock " does exactly the same thing as the other two combined , but does so wirelessly and can track two people at once .
Both individuals ( or just one if you 're flying solo ) must wear a soft armband that will transmit signals to the alarm clock across the room .
The clock can gather data over a period of days and you can download it to your Mac or PC via USB .
From there , you can view your individual sleep graphs .
And , like the sleep monitoring watch , the aXbo lets you set a time to wake up and then wakes you up at the most optimal time for you within that window .
I have used the aXbo myself , but found it to be somewhat of a let - down .
The alarm clock itself is very difficult to use without the help of its manual ( and even with the manual , it was n't exactly easy ) .
It did , however , track my sleep movements very well .
The feature that wakes you up at the " appropriate " time is easy to game , though — when you know it 'll wake you up within a certain window if you 're moving around too much , you learn to stay incredibly still to avoid setting the alarm off .
Your mileage may vary .
Improving
So you already know you sleep like crap — what can you do to make it better ?
Again , there are a number of things you can try , but beware that without a doctor 's diagnosis , there 's no guarantee that all of them ( or any of them , for that matter ) will work for you .
If you 're looking for excuses to try out new gadgets and software , however , we suppose there 's no better excuse than your sleep health .
One of the most well - known ( non-medicated , anyway ) methods of improving sleep is to use pzizz , a piece of software for both Mac and Windows that takes the concept of a " relaxation CD " to the next level .
It pieces together unique audio soundtracks that help you to nap during the day or get to sleep at night with a mixture of voice , music , and other sound effects for every single time you use it .
Theoretically , this means that your brain will never get used to the same sounds over and over .
But that 's not all pzizz does — the soundtracks contain inaudible " binaural beats " that supposedly stimulate a particular range of brainwave frequency to be more conducive to sleep .
If it all sounds a bit new - agey to you , you can try out pzizz for free before laying down any cash .
I gave pzizz a try for roughly a week , testing out the sleep files ( I do n't take naps , so I did n't try the nap ones ) .
The software is easy to use and , if you 're on a Mac anyway , the files will import directly into iTunes so they can sync with your iPod .
I found the audio files to indeed be soothing and falling asleep was very easy — then again , staying asleep tends to be my problem moreso than falling asleep .
When you 're creating the file on your computer , you can make it almost any length of time , though a minimum of 20 minutes is recommended .
If you have trouble falling asleep , it 's definitely worth a shot .
Another way to relieve stress and fall asleep is to try an acupressure band , like the Sleeping Aid Dreamate .
Bands like this claim to massage acupoints — such as the " sleeping Golden Triangle " — in your wrists .
Supposedly , this will enable to you to relax to the point of getting deeper and longer sleep without having to rely on medication .
Finally , you could try the DaVinci sleep schedule ( also known as polyphasic sleep ) .
This is n't so much a gadget as it is a method that involves sleeping in 10 - or 20 - minute bursts throughout the entire day .
Supposedly , building up to a schedule like this allows people to sleep between two and five hours a day — much less than the typical person — and feel energized for longer .
Proponents of polyphasic sleep say that this pattern mimics the sleeping pattern of infants and the body 's natural sleep rhythms .
Of course , the downsides to this are that you have to actually be able to nap frequently throughout the day , it practically destroys your social life , it 's difficult to adjust to , and you can screw up your entire schedule by missing even one nap .
However , if you 're desperate to stay awake for almost 22 hours a day and try something new , have at it .
Are these things enough to turn you from an insomniac to a well - rested person ?
Maybe , and maybe not .
Some of us at the Orbiting HQ have severe enough sleep issues that a sleep study and a CPAP machine are the only solutions ( and believe us , if you have sleep apnea , it definitely helps ) .
But if you have some time on your hands and some cash to burn , these solutions could be worth a little experimentation .
Who are these ' responsible ' homeowners ?

President Obama 's housing plan is designed to save " responsible " homeowners from foreclosure by having taxpayers subsidize their mortgage payments .
The problem is , how do you define " responsible ? "
In his speech , Obama said his plan " will not help speculators who took risky bets on a rising market and bought homes not to live in but to sell .
And it will not reward folks who bought homes they knew from the beginning they would never be able to afford . "
It should be fairly easy to identify speculators who bought homes to rent or flip .
But how do you prove someone bought a home they knew they could n't afford ?
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
I 've spoken with many people who can't pay their mortgages and are desperate for help .
All bought homes they thought they could afford and in many cases really could afford .
Most got into trouble by refinancing their homes - often more than once - and extracting every possible dollar of equity .
The money went toward granite countertops , stainless steel appliances , credit cards , student loans , vacations , weddings , cars , etc .
Then came a job loss or a divorce or the roommate moved out , and suddenly they could n't make the payment .
They tried to sell or refinance but could n't because the home 's value had dropped below the loan balance .
Responsible or reckless ?
Who 's to say ?
Obama announced two new plans for " responsible " homeowners who want to reduce their mortgage payments .
Neither excludes people who cashed out their equity .
Both are open only to people whose mortgages are owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which essentially have become arms of the government .
The first will help homeowners who want to refinance at a lower rate but can't because they owe more than 80 percent of the home 's current value .
The plan will let them refinance through Fannie or Freddie as long as the loan does not exceed 105 percent of the market value .
To qualify , homeowners must be current on their mortgage payments .
Obama said this program 's cost to taxpayers " would be roughly zero .
While Fannie and Freddie would receive less money in payments , this would be balanced out by a reduction in defaults and foreclosures . "
The second plan posses a far greater cost to taxpayers .
It will use $ 75 billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( renamed the Financial Stability Plan ) to modify loans for " households at risk of imminent default despite being current on their mortgage payments . "
I 'm not sure what that means .
Some of the money will go to loan servicers who get customers in modification plans .
Some will go directly to homeowners in the form of mortgage subsidies and rewards for continued payment .
Borrowers who stay current can get a bonus of up to $ 1,000 a year for five years .
Who qualifies for this windfall ?
The details are still being worked out .
Ken Rosen , chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate at UC Berkeley , says it should exclude people who lied on their loan applications .
And in assessing the borrower 's ability to pay , the government should look at assets , not just income - the same way it does when people apply for welfare or college aid .
Past mortgage - modification plans have not had an asset test .
A homeowner could have a Lexus in the driveway and a half - million in retirement accounts and still qualify if his income was low enough .
The White House says all homeowners will benefit from the plan because without it , the average home price would fall an additional $ 6,000 .
How does that benefit people who pay taxes but do n't own a home ?
And how about all those renters who refused to buy an overpriced home with an exploding loan ?
The percentage of households that could afford an entry - level home in California soared to 59 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with 33 percent the same period a year ago , the California Association of Realtors said Wednesday .
In the Bay Area , the index jumped to 47 percent from 23 percent , thanks largely to a drop in home prices .
Although the stimulus plan provides a tax credit for first - time home buyers , some might like to see prices come down even more .
F# was supposed to free us of the tyranny of the unchecked null .
Alas not only does it not do that , it introduces several more kinds of null .
First consider this all too common problem in C# code .
int GetLength ( string value ) { return value .
Length ; }
Unless you have code analysis turned on and the function is publically available , you do n’t get so much as a warning that this function may throw a NullReferenceException .
Now let ’s consider the F# equivalent .
let GetLength ( value : string ) = a .
Length
Just like the C# version , this will throw a NullReferenceException if you accidentally pass a null to it .
But unlike C# , you do n’t even get so much as a warning .
Next up are nullable structures .
Our test code in C# is followed by the F# equivalent .
static public bool IsPositive ( int? value ) { return value .
Value > 0 ; }
let IsPositive ( value : Nullable < int > ) = value .
Value > 0
Again , both versions are susceptible to throwing exceptions .
In this case an InvalidOperationException .
Now that we established that using traditional types are just as dangerous as every , we turn to the new option types .
First we will recode GetLength using an “ option ” instead of a normal string .
let GetLength2 ( value : option < int > ) = value .
Value .
Length
Now we have the possibility for two different exceptions .
If you pass “ None ” to the function you will get an InvalidOperationException .
If you pass a “ Some ( null ) ” to the function , you will get a NullReferenceException .
And again , there are no compiler warnings telling you that your code can fail .
F# also adds the concept of triple nulls .
Since you can nest options inside options , you can write the downright silly functions such as :
let GetLength3 ( value : option < string >) = value .
Value .
Value .
Length
let IsPositive ( value : option < int >) = value .
Value .
Value > 0
When using F# types instead of normal CLS types , things are somewhat better .
Classes defined in F# can not be assigned the value null .
However , they can still be wrapped in an option type , throwing away the null - safety and bringing us back to the problem of no decent compiler warnings .
Rule 3 of Steve Souders ’
YSlow suggests that websites should Add a far future Expires header to the components .
Components with a cache header could be static files such as those with extensions .css , .js , .jpg , .png , .gif etc .
This gives a huge boost in client side performance of users with a primed cache .
In apache this is done via mod_expires and an example configuration would be :
ExpiresActive On ExpiresByType image / x-icon " access plus 1 month " ExpiresByType text / css " access plus 1 month " ExpiresByType application / javascript " access plus 1 month " ExpiresByType image / gif " access plus 1 month " ExpiresByType image / jpeg " access plus 1 month " ExpiresByType image / png " access plus 1 month "
All this works well until you need to update a cached static file .
The users with the primed cache will either have to wait 1 month to get the new file , or explicitly invalidate their cache .
Some people will even ask their users to do a hard refresh but this obviously does not scale and it ’s not very robust .
Since you cannot send an automatic signal to the browsers to reload those files all you can do is change the URL of those files ( explicit invalidation ) .
You could simply rename all those files , but an easier way to achieve the same effect is by adding a fake ( unused – dummy ) parameter at the end of the resource URL :
<img src=" logo.jpg?2 " />
The next logical step would be to automate this into the build system and have every production release feature new cache killer tokens .
It seems that many well known sites do that already :
href="//s.fsdn.com/sd/idlecore-tidied.css?T_2_5_0_254a " src="//s.fsdn.com/sd/all-minified.js?T_2_5_0_254a "
href= " / content/all.css?v=3184 " src= " / content/js/master.js?v=3141 "
@import " /css/189/global.css " ; src= " http://media.digg.com/js/loader/187/dialog|digg|shouts "
@import ' http://wwwimg.bbc.co.uk/home/release-29-7/style/homepage.min.css ' ; src= "

What happens with images referenced from within css files ?
You could rewrite the css files automatically as part of your production build process with Ant .
< tstamp > < format property=" cacheKill " pattern="yyyyMMddhhmm " locale= " en , UK " / > </tstamp > < target name = " rewrite-css " > < replace dir= " ${build.web.dir} " value=" css ?${cacheKill} " ) " >< include name="css/**/*.css "/>< include name= " scripts/**/*.css "/><replacetoken>css " ) </ replacetoken ></replace > < replace dir= " ${build.web.dir} " value= " png ?${cacheKill} " ) " >< include name="css/**/*.css "/>< include name= " scripts/**/*.css "/><replacetoken>png " ) </ replacetoken ></replace > < replace dir= " ${build.web.dir} " value= " gif? ${cacheKill} " ) " >< include name="css/**/*.css "/>< include name= " scripts/**/*.css "/><replacetoken>gif " ) </ replacetoken ></ replace > < replace dir= " ${build.web.dir} " value= " jpg?${cacheKill} " ) " >< include name="css/**/*.css "/>< include name= " scripts/**/*.css "/><replacetoken>jpg " ) </ replacetoken ></replace > < replace dir= " ${build.web.dir} " value=" css ?${cacheKill} ' ) " >< include name="css/**/*.css "/>< include name= " scripts/**/*.css "/><replacetoken>css ')</ replacetoken ></replace > < replace dir= " ${build.web.dir} " value= " png ? $ {cacheKill} ' ) " >< include name="css/**/*.css "/>< include name= " scripts/**/*.css "/><replacetoken>png ')</ replacetoken ></replace > < replace dir= " ${build.web.dir} " value= " gif?${cacheKill} ' ) " >< include name="css/**/*.css "/>< include name= " scripts/**/*.css "/><replacetoken>gif')</replacetoken></replace > < replace dir= " ${build.web.dir} " value= " jpg?${cacheKill} ' ) " >< include name="css/**/*.css "/>< include name= " scripts/**/*.css "/><replacetoken> jpg')</ replacetoken></replace > < replace dir= " ${build.web.dir} " value=" css ?${cacheKill} ) " >< include name="css/**/*.css "/>< include name= " scripts/**/*.css "/><replacetoken>css )</replacetoken></replace > < replace dir= " ${build.web.dir} " value= " png ?${cacheKill} ) " >< include name="css/**/*.css "/>< include name= " scripts/**/*.css "/><replacetoken>png )</replacetoken></replace > < replace dir= " ${build.web.dir} " value= " gif?${cacheKill} ) " >< include name="css/**/*.css "/>< include name= " scripts/**/*.css "/><replacetoken>gif )</replacetoken></replace > < replace dir= " ${build.web.dir} " value= " jpg?${cacheKill} ) " >< include name="css/**/*.css "/>< include name= " scripts/**/*.css "/><replacetoken>jpg)</replacetoken></replace > </ target >
This will take care of the following background image reference styles for css , png , gif and jpg files :
... background - image : url ( " images/ed-bg.gif " ) ; ... background - image : url ( ' images/ed-bg.gif ' ) ; ... background - image : url( images/ed-bg.gif ) ;
and convert them to :
... background - image : url ( " images/ed-bg.gif?200905031126 " ) ; ... background - image : url ( ' images/ed-bg.gif?200905031126 ' ) ; ... background - image : url( images/ed-bg.gif?200905031126 ) ;
Good luck !
3 - D Rapid Prototyping Your Future Replacement Organ
Organ donation would be a lot less variable if they could be grown in the lab and a more effective way to build plastic scaffolds on which new tissues and even whole organs might be grown in the laboratory is being developed by an international collaboration between teams in Portugal and the UK .
The researchers say rapid prototyping , or three - dimensional ( 3 - D ) ' printing ' , could enable tissue engineering that replicates the porous and hierarchical structures of natural tissues at an unprecedented level .
Scaffold structures for tissue engineering that allow researchers to grow cells , whether skin , muscle , or even kidney , in a three - dimensional could allow medical science to create natural artificial organs .
Such scaffolds are increasingly important for the future direction of regenerative medicine .
However , conventional techniques have several limitations .
In particular , current scaffold construction lacks full control of the often microscopic pores and their architecture .
Tissue engineering usually involves cellular implantation .
Cells might be derived from the patient or a donor .
They are combined in the laboratory with a degradable scaffold that can then be implanted to replace damaged tissues .
The presence of the structure scaffold also triggers the body to rebuild damaged tissue .
Ceramics are usually used to help rebuild bone , while polymers might be used to rebuild soft body tissues .
Paulo Bártolo and Henrique Almeida of the Institute for Polymers and Composites , at Leiria Polytechnic Institute , and Tahar Laoui of the Department of Manufacturing and Systems at the University of Wolverhampton , are borrowing a technique from more conventional manufacturing to solve this problem .
In rapid prototyping , a computer controls a laser that cures a vat of polymer resin layer by layer and building up a solid object .
It allows designers and manufacturers to rapidly produce a prototype component created on a CAD machine from anywhere in the world .
But , it is the precision with which a material can be constructed that could be crucial to developing rapid prototyping as a tissue engineering technique .
The researchers suggest that rapid prototyping overcomes many of the limitations of conventional scaffold techniques , such as stereolithography , which etches a block of material into shape .
Rapid prototyping might one day allow kidney , liver and muscle tissues to be constructed in the laboratory from a patient 's own cells with close - to - natural detail ready for transplantation .

The Windows 7 logo
After discovery by a blogger , Microsoft has announced that on their next operating system , Windows 7 , users will have the ability to remove Internet Explorer and other select Microsoft programs .
Microsoft has been accused of forcing users to run their own software while competitor products get pushed out of the market because of this .
On the Microsoft blog they wrote " In Windows 7 we are expanding the number of features you have control over in this regard , giving customers more control , flexibility and choice in managing the features available in this version of Windows . "
It goes on to list a number of common Microsoft add - ons including : Internet Explorer 8 , Windows Media Player and Microsoft Search .
If a user chooses to turn off a feature in Windows 7 , it will remove the executable from the user ’s computer but the rest of the program will still be installed .
In Europe , Microsoft was charged for abusing the market by having Internet Explorer and Windows bundled together .
According to Net Applications , Internet Explorer currently has 67 % of the web browser market , with Firefox trailing a distant second with 21 % of the market .

The bishop , who chairs the Church 's Department of Evangelisation and Catechesis , said that Catholics were " getting tired " of the sensational stories and plot lines contained in Brown 's novels and subsequent film adaptations .
" I do n't think that Catholics will be interested in seeing this as it's so far removed from the truth , " he added .
Design student Karin Johansson has come up with an interesting working concept for a spinning - globe style Dynamic Lamp , that transforms kinetic energy from the spinning motion into light ( video below ) .
All the magic behind the Dynamic Lamp is performed by a dynamo hidden presumably in the base , which powers the lamp without assistance from batteries or mains power .
It does require a little effort on your part though , as the light will only stay on as long as the globe is spinning .
The Dynamic Lamp looks like a clever and easy to use form of emergency lighting or for use when camping , but it ’s not entirely practical for day - to - day use unless the spin duration can be dramatically improved .
As it stands , a solid spin seems to get only 30 seconds of light .
Check out the video below to see the Dynamic Lamp in action .

Scott Morse sent me a copy THE ANCIENT BOOK OF SEX AND SCI­ENCE , but I 've been too busy scooping my brain off the floor for the last 45 minutes to write about it .
This collection of mid-century styled paintings and other works of art by four obscenely talented Pixar animation designers — Nate Wragg , Scott Morse , Lou Romano , and Don Shank — hearkens back to the days of the Golden science books ( Like Biology , Mathematics , and Chemistry Experiments ) , and the How and Why Wonder Books , but the theme this time is sex and robots , sex and aliens , and sex and math .
( It 's not really explicit — most of the images are G- rated , and a couple are PG - 13 . )
Their previous art book , THE ANCIENT BOOK OF MYTH AND WAR , is sold out , and I 'm sure this one will sell out even more quickly .

Attorney General Says Craigslist Agrees to End Erotic
Ads Illinois attorney general says
Web site will get rid of ads for erotic services .
May 13 , 2009  --
Under pressure from law enforcement officials , the popular Web site Craigslist plans to get rid of its controversial " erotic services " section , the company said today .
The " erotic services " section will be removed within seven days and will be replaced with a new " adult services " category .
Posts in that new section will be " manually reviewed " by Craigslist employees , the company said .
Nude or graphic photos will also be banned from the new adult services section , according to Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan .
" It 's clear to everyone that Craigslist 's erotic services section was nothing more than an Internet brothel , " Madigan said in a statement .
" I 'm encouraged that Craigslist has agreed to fundamentally change how they operate and monitor their site .
The steps they 're taking are the only effective way to prevent the exploitation of women and children . "
Craigslist has come under increasing scrutiny because of several high - profile alleged crimes that have involved the Web site , most recently those of the so - called " Craigslist Killer " who police say targeted women who advertised exotic services on the site .
Madigan , Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal and Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster met with Craigslist lawyers last week , demanding that the site remove ads they contend are advertisements for illegal sexual activities .
The South Carolina attorney general last week also threatened a criminal investigation of Craigslist officials if the site did not remove postings he said were pornographic or encouraged prostitution .
Blumenthal said that Craigslist informed him of the changes Tuesday night .
Both Blumenthal 's and Madigan 's offices said they would continue to monitor the site to make sure ads for prostitution do n't migrate to other sections of the site .
" We will be monitoring closely to make sure that this measure is more than a name change from erotic to adult and that the manual blocking is tough and effective to scrub prostitution and pornography , " Blumenthal said in a statement .
Not everyone was impressed with the changes .
" Several weeks ago , we informed Craigslist of an impending criminal case that implicated its website .
Rather than work with this office to prevent further abuses , in the middle of the night , Craigslist took unilateral action which we suspect will prove to be half - baked , " New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said in a statement .
Cuomo's statement did not make the nature of the pending case clear , but sources close to the investigation said the attorney general 's office approached Craigslist several weeks ago to notify the company of investigations into a number of areas , including prostitution rings that advertised on the site .
Cuomo's office , sources said , asked Craiglist not to take down the questionable ads , because they believed the sex for sale services would move to another area .
Instead , the office made suggestions to Craigslist on how to track IP addresses and telephone numbers connected to questionable ads and how to monitor repeated use of addresses , phone numbers and credit card accounts by advertisers who used a variety of names , the sources said .
Craigslist has repeatedly defended itself , saying relatively little crime takes place through the site .
In a statement released Wednesday , Craigslist said , " Unsurprisingly , but completely contrary to some of the sensationalistic journalism we 've seen these past few weeks , the record is clear that use of Craigslist classifieds is associated with far lower rates of violent crime than print classifieds , let alone rates of violent crime pertaining to American society as a whole . "
Craigslist signed an agreement in November with more than 40 attorneys general in which Craigslist said it would take a number of steps to combat online prostitution , including charging people who post ads in the " erotic services " section $ 5 to $ 10 and requiring them to submit a working phone number to use the site .
The information can be used by law enforcement to investigate suspected illegal activity .
The attorneys general have argued that the company was not living up to its end of the bargain and was not doing enough to keep pornography and prostitution off the site .
' Craigslist Killer ' Prompts Scrutiny of Site
The company came under pressure from law enforcement after several high - profile alleged crimes appeared to stem from advertisements on the site .
Philip Markoff , 23 , is suspected of using Craigslist to lure three women to upscale hotels , where he allegedly robbed them and killed one of them .
Investigators believe Markoff contacted the women through Craigslist ads in which they offered erotic massages .
Markoff , who has been dubbed the " Craigslist Killer " by the media , has pleaded not guilty .
Earlier this month , Michael John Anderson , 20 , of Savage , Minn. , was sentenced to life in prison for killing Katherine Ann Olson , who had responded to an ad for a nanny that Anderson placed on the site .
And New York radio reporter George Weber was stabbed 50 times in his Brooklyn apartment earlier this year , allegedly murdered by a man who answered Weber 's ad on Craigslist , offering $ 60 for " rough sex . "
Craigslist Changes Course on ' Erotic Services '
In an interview last month with ABC News , Craigslist founder Craig Newmark denied that the site " facilitates " prostitution and said he has no plans to change the " erotic services " section .
Buckmaster told " Nightline " that the Craigslist community -- about 50 million people use the site a month -- has a low incidence of crime .
" Now , the risk is not zero , and no occurrence of violent crime is acceptable , " Buckmaster said .
" I'm very proud that our site is composed of people who are overwhelmingly trustworthy and good .
I am very proud that there is very little crime on our site , proportionately , " Newmark said .
" Compare that to any other American community .
Look at the numbers . "

Ubuntu 9.10 , codenamed Karmic Koala , is the next major release of the popular Ubuntu Linux distribution .
Karmic is scheduled to arrive in October , but developers can get an early look by testing the latest alpha release , which was made available for download last week .
Although Karmic is still at a very early stage of development , several major features have already arrived .
I tested the alpha release myself in VirtualBox on my main desktop computer .
I was able to install and run alpha 2 without encountering any difficulties .
The installation went smoothly and the new version of GRUB ( GNU 's GRUB bootloader ) is working fine .
The roadmap for Ubuntu 9.10 was originally announced in February .
Canonical CEO
Mark Shuttleworth declared that some of the prominent features will include extensive support for cloud computing and netbook compatibility improvements .
During the recent Ubuntu Developer Summit in Barcelona , the developers also discussed some other experimental features that are tentatively planned for the Karmic release .
These include support for running Android applications , integration of social networking software , improved development tools , the inclusion of Firefox 3.5 , and usability enhancements .
Ubuntu will also begin taking major steps towards reducing boot time so that the developers ' ambitious ten - second startup goal can be achieved in 10.04 , the next major release after Karmic .
The latest packages have been synchronized from Debian unstable , as is customary at the start of each Ubuntu development cycle .
It includes GNOME 2.27 , a development version that will be replaced by 2.28 in the final Ubuntu 9.10 release .
Karmic alpha 2 also ships with version 2.6.30 of the Linux kernel .
There are several major changes under the hood that users can look forward to in Karmic .
Ext4 , a new version of the standard Linux filesystem , is used by default for new installations .
This is a step forward from Ubuntu 9.04 , which only made Ext4 available as an option .
Previous versions of Ext4 suffered from a controversial data corruption flaw and was not considered reliable enough for default use until now .
The bootloader is another major component that has been rolled over to the next generation in Karmic .
The alpha 2 release ships with GRUB 2 , the next - generation of GNU 's GRUB bootloader .
It has been rewritten from scratch to deliver significantly greater flexibility and important features like localization support .
There are still some aspects of GRUB 2 that are not yet working properly in this alpha release , the most notable of which is support for booting other operating systems .
Users with multiboot configurations are encouraged to wait for alpha 3 or use a workaround to install GRUB 1 .
The Ubuntu developers are seeking help from the community to test the new version of GRUB on a wide range of hardware configurations .
Testing instructions and a growing list of results can be found at the Ubuntu wiki .
If you want to test alpha 2 yourself , you can download a CD image from the Ubuntu website .
Many of Madoff 's victims have already demanded that he should never be released - but his lawyers are hoping for a sentence of 12 years
Bernard Madoff's was handed 150 years in prison for his $ 65 bn ( £ 39.5 bn ) fraud .
The hearing in New York started at 10 am local time ( 3 pm BST ) and up to 11 victims told the court how they have been hurt by the sudden , unexpected loss of their savings .
Many of these victims have already demanded that Madoff should never be released .
Assistant US attorney , Marc Litt , has backed that view , arguing that the " scope , duration and nature " of Madoff 's activities mean the disgraced 71 - year - old should receive the maximum sentence of 150 years .
Madoff pleaded guilty in March to a range of charges , including securities fraud , money laundering and perjury .
Over 13,000 people lost money through the collapse of Madoff Securities – famous victims include actor Zsa Zsa Gabor and film director Steven Spielberg .
Before sentencing , the court heard victim impact statements .
Over 100 people wrote to Chin to explain how they have suffered from the fraud .
Many lost all the money they put aside for retirement , or to pay college fees .
Although some were already wealthy , meeting Madoff on the New York social circuit , others were of more modest means and sometimes were not even aware their money had been invested with Madoff .
The tone of today 's hearing was set by victims such as Jesse Cohen , who called Madoff " a thief and a monster " .
Another victim , Ronnie Sue Ambrosino , wrote that " the birds that had been chirping stopped singing .
The sun stopped shining " after she and her husband learned they had lost their life savings .
Madoff claimed for decades that he delivered market - beating returns through canny investments in shares and bonds .
But in reality , his empire was a Ponzi scheme in which money was moved around the world to give the impression of successful trading , and money from new clients was used to pay off old ones .
Detectives are now investigating Madoff 's wife , Ruth , and the couple 's children Andrew and Mark .
Both sons worked for Madoff , but claimed they had no knowledge of the fraud .
But once today 's court hearing is completed , prosecutors are expected to intensify their efforts .
" In a case as complex as this , we are taking one step at a time , " a source close to the US attorney 's office told the Observer .
" When Madoff is sentenced , that will be one major step completed which will free up resources for the investigation to shift to others . "
Industry opinion
The last month has seen substantial media coverage of the latest row that has erupted between BT Retail and a number of content providers including the BBC .
However , we think a fundamental issue is being missed .
Instead of BT Retail focusing attention on the BBC et al to contribute to its increasing costs , it should instead be tackling its wholesale provider to reduce the price of bandwidth .
Here I explain why this has a wider significance to ISPs and the industry as a whole .
June 2009 proved to be a turbulent month for two of the UK ’s industry giants , BT and the BBC .
The month began with reports that BT was throttling its option 1 customers ’ connections to the BBC ’s iPlayer service ( and other bandwidth hungry services including YouTube ) during peak times , reducing speeds to less than 1 Mbps on the advertised up to 8 M bps service .
This , according to the BBC , notably affected the iPlayer ’s service quality .
The argument escalated when the BBC claimed that BT ’s advertising of its option 1 package shied away from detailing this level of throttling .
Instead it states that the package is capable of 25 hours of iPlayer streaming and only refers to the throttling in its FUP .
By mid-June the plot thickened with a request from BT for content providers to pay towards the cost of delivering customers to their sites , claiming that the “ free ride for content providers was over ” .
“ We ca n’t give the content providers a completely free ride and continue to give customers the [ service ] they want at the price they expect , ” said John Petter , managing director of BT Retail ’s consumer business .
Petter continued to explain that the BBC iPlayer was just one of the services involved in this and that the issue was much wider reaching .
He continued to explain that an increasing number of content providers were developing profitable business models that are delivered across BT ’s network and that they should therefore be prepared to contribute to the costs they were generating for BT Retail .
Missing the point
We disagree .
Surely the duty of delivering traffic to such sites falls to the network provider and therefore so should the costs .
We think that instead of attempting to consume a chunk of these highly successful business models ’ profits , BT Retail should instead concentrate on re-developing its own business models to more effectively satisfy customers ’ increasing demand for bandwidth .
If its current packages fail to profitably satisfy existing bandwidth demand now , how does it expect to cope as demand inevitably increases ?
As technology develops further ; as access becomes more widespread ( especially with the introduction of the USC , or universal service commitment , mandating 100 per cent UK broadband coverage with speeds of at least 2 M bps by 2012 ) ; and as demand for such services grows , ISPs are finding it more difficult to deliver products that are competitive .
Therefore we believe the argument between BT Retail and the BBC is missing the point .
We think the real issue lies with the wholesale provider .
Instead of focusing its attention on the content providers we think BT Retail and other affected ISPs should be turning their attention to their wholesale provider , the primary one being BT Wholesale ( BTW ) .
As demand for bandwidth inevitably continues to grow , surely it is time for BTW to rethink its existing wholesale bandwidth pricing strategies which appear to be stifling the current market .
Basic economics teaches us that , when demand is high and growing , providing bandwidth at lower prices will allow it to generate profit while enabling ISPs to meet customers ’ needs at a competitive price ..
Surely given its position in the market , BT Retail is best placed to challenge BTW to reduce its bandwidth pricing .
By late June the war of words had received substantial coverage and Out - law.com became involved , launching an investigation into the legal standing of ISPs blocking access to content providers ’ sites .
The findings were surprising - there is very little protection in the UK to stop this practice .
Basically , as long as the network operator covers the practice in its terms and conditions little can be done to stop them .
This worrying prospect could spell the end for net neutrality .
Net neutrality is a fundamental principal of the Internet that keeps the Internet uncensored and provides an equal experience to all users .
By enabling network providers to block access , in this case to content providers ( such as BBC iPlayer ) that refuse to pay towards the delivery of the traffic to their site , that particular ISP ’s customers ( BT Retail customers ) could find that they are unable to access that service .
If this path is taken a lack of net neutrality could lead to a highly censored Internet and a tiered approach to access i.e. the more you pay the more you can do .
The impact of the BBC ’s iPlayer on ISPs ’ networks has been raging since the service was launched .
In fact BT Retail is just the latest to join a number of other providers that have already complained that the service is having a negative effect on their network .
Even the call for content providers to foot the bill is not new or unique to BT Retail - just yesterday media coverage shows Tiscali have decided to make a similar announcement .
Reports suggest that in reality , the iPlayer accounts for approximately seven per cent of peak UK Internet usage and there are many other applications delivering much larger amounts of bandwidth demand .
But even if it was higher and the networks were struggling to cope as they suggest , surely the solution is not to punish the development of innovative and popular new services .
If ISPs insist on retaining their existing packages which are often based on outdated usage habits is it so surprising that they are struggling to accommodate the additional costs ?
Now is the time to adapt and evolve .
To develop new broadband packages that cater for the inevitably increasing demand for bandwidth as our usage habits evolve to encompass the new technologies available .
And that needs to apply to BTW too .
In the absence of a shift in strategy from the wholesaler , pressure will only increase on the ISPs to raise prices to End Users as bandwidth consumption climbs .
We fully support the development of enterprising new technologies regardless of their supposed effect on ISPs ’ networks and we firmly believe the responsibility for the network and the costs it incurs lies with the network operator .
We fear by adopting BT Retail ’s suggested approach , net neutrality would inevitably be compromised and tiered Internet access would ensue .
BTW needs to look closely at its existing business models and investigate how it can redevelop its pricing strategies to encompass this increasing demand for bandwidth to make it easier for its ISP partners to satisfy their customers ’ demands profitably .

Monsanto is a corporation reviled for its genetic tampering and attempts to seize control of agriculture around the world .
While trying to change its public persona into one of benevolence towards the public , the history of Monsanto is littered with continuous efforts to not only seize control of food production , but also supply .
Monsanto's history also includes lives destroyed either financially and / or physically as the result of its activities .
goon squads routinely trespass onto privately owned land , take samples of privately owned crops and then claim Monsanto 's frankenseed crops are being grown illegally ... their patents have been violated .
According to Monsanto , these are " unauthorized seeds . "
Those two words are a harbinger of things to come and should give you an idea where all of this is headed .
Here in the US , Monsantoroutinely trespass onto privately owned land , take samples of privately owned crops and then claim Monsanto 's frankenseed crops are being grown illegally ... their patents have been violated .
According to Monsanto , these are " unauthorized seeds . "
Those two words are a harbinger of things to come and should give you an idea where all of this is headed .
Courts have ruled that if Monsanto 's seeds sprout in a ditch near the uncontaminated natural crops of a farmer who refuses to grow GMO , the crop belongs to Monsanto along with fines and penalties .
Monsanto attempts to minimize their harassment of non-participating farmers by saying that out of about 250,000 farmers they have only sued about 120 .
Monsanto goes on to say that farmers will report other farmers who save seed , and that many of the tips they get about seed saving are from other farmers in the community .
I think the probability of this actually happening is slight and would tend to think more along the lines of the Goon Squads illegally trespassing and reporting ; after all , that 's what they get paid for .
On top of this , Monsanto came up with a new in - house rule after the fact , claiming they had not sold the seeds to the farmers but had merely leased the seeds to the farmer .
This was a de facto legal maneuver .
After all , if you SELL something , how it is used is no longer your business , it does n't belong to you .
If you lease the same product , you now have continued interest in the use .
Monsanto knows that genetic traits can be passed between grains or other plants either during handling and processing or as a result of pollination and that GMO transfers more readily than traditional seed .
As a result , they also know that genetic traits and makeup indicating the purity of any seed at this point in time is not achievable as a result of the contamination of traditional crops resulting from genetically altered crops being totally uncontrolled and uncontrollable .
Knowing that wind drift , bird droppings and other natural happenings would by necessity cause the contamination and cross pollination of natural crops with the genetically modified crops , Monsanto continued to push its malignant creations onto farmers who believed the hype that Monsanto's " authorized seeds " would increase productivity and increase profits .
The passing of time and the analysis of these claims tells a different story .
soybeans
In the case of
Roundup Ready
Soybeans use two to five times more herbicides than non-GE Varieties .
When you add royalties , fees and other costs the resulting profit for the farmer is $ 0 .
The increase in production is negligible and usually less than a traditional crop .
These crops also require 2 to 3 times more water to grow .
( Excerpted from the original article at Global Research ) :
Then there 's that problem with cotton
The cotton 's agronomic performance is also erratic .
When Monsanto's GM cotton varieties were first introduced in the US , tens of thousands of acres suffered deformed roots and other unexpected problems .
Monsanto paid out millions in settlements .
[ 4 ]
When
Bt cotton was tested in Indonesia , widespread pest infestation and drought damage forced withdrawal of the crop , despite the fact that Monsanto had been bribing at least 140 individuals for years , trying to gain approval .
These are just two of the crops being devastated by genetic tampering and the attempts to lay claim to crops traditionally grown successfully without patents , tampering or alteration .
Wherever Monsanto has inserted itself in agriculture , food supplies dwindle , become unaffordable or have devastating affects on human health .
Traditional and proven seed stocks are destroyed or forever contaminated with genetically altered material that can include everything from human DNA to that of numerous animals or many times unidentified genetic material .
Artic Seed Vault
And about that ... as I asked before , if what Monsanto produces is so beneficial , if it in fact is far superior to traditional seeds , why was none of their mutated stock included in the Vault ?
Maybe because it is n't fit for human consumption ?

WHEN the going gets tough , the solvent get buying .
That , roughly , was the philosophy of the titans of the oil industry last time the price of their product plummeted , in the late 1990s .
Hunting for oil had become less profitable thanks to the falling price , whereas preying on rivals had become easier , thanks to plunging share prices .
Thus Exxon Mobil , Chevron Texaco , BP Amoco and TotalFinaElf were born .
So when Suncor and Petro - Canada , two big Canadian oil firms , announced a C$ 19.3 billion ( $ 15.8 billion ) merger on March 23rd , the industry 's biggest since 2006 , speculation mounted that another wave of deals might be imminent .
Suncor and Petro-Canada say the merger will help them withstand the trying times .
The bosses of the two firms think they can save C$ 300 m a year on operating costs and C$ 1 billion a year in capital expenditure .
These savings are possible thanks chiefly to the two firms ' complementary investments in Canada 's tar sands , where oil is found in a particularly impure and viscous form , requiring a lot of expensive processing .
The two firms plan to share pipelines and other infrastructure at existing facilities and future ones .
The two companies also hope their merger will help reduce inflation in the oil - sands region , which took off amid a mad rush to develop new projects when the oil price was high .
Petro-Canada recently delayed a development called Fort Hills after the projected cost rose from C$ 14 billion to C$ 25 billion in just over a year .
It believes the merger will help reduce the bill again by dampening competition for scarce labour and equipment .
Tar - sands operations are a natural focus for consolidation .
They are expensive to run and so are more exposed to the falling oil price .
At the very least , tar - sands firms will struggle to finance expansions with the oil price so low .
But Canada 's tar sands remain an attractive investment because they provide long - lived reserves in a stable country — a rarity in the oil business these days .
That is why Total ( as it is now known ) recently offered to buy UTS Energy , a tiddler that is one of Petro - Canada 's partners in the Fort Hills project .
Much the same logic applies to takeovers of coal - bed methane firms , which extract natural gas from coal deposits .
BG , a British gas firm , has just succeeded in buying an Australian coal - bed methane firm , Pure Energy Resources , for A $ 1 billion ( $ 729 m ) .
Last year it spent A$ 6 billion on another , Queensland Gas .
ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch
Shell have also made recent investments in coal - bed methane .
Indeed , over 40 % of takeovers in the oil and gas business last year involved “ unconventional ” resources such as tar sands and coal - bed methane , according to Chris Sheehan of IHS Herold , a research firm .
He expects more such deals this year , as the industry 's giants snap up unconventional reserves that their smaller , cash - strapped owners cannot afford to develop .
But Mr Sheehan does not expect the giants of the industry to snap one another up , as they did in the blockbusting deals of the 1990s .
For one thing , they are already so big that further mergers would raise competition concerns .
Moreover , with the exception of Exxon Mobil , which has tens of billions stashed away , they would struggle to raise the money .
Instead , middling firms are likely to be the main targets .
Rumours are rife , for example , of an imminent bid for Santos , an Australian firm with several liquefied natural gas projects in the works .
And the Western oil majors are not the only buyers on the prowl : in recent years state - owned oil firms from countries such as China and India have become much more acquisitive .
The last surviving passenger on the Titanic has died at the age of 97 .
At just nine weeks old , Milvina Dean was the youngest passenger on board the liner when it sank in 1912 .
She died early yesterday after being cared for at a Southampton nursing home .
Elizabeth Gladys Dean , known to friends as Milvina , was born on 2 February 2 , 1912 , and boarded the ship as a third - class passenger with her parents Bertram Frank and Georgette Eva and her elder brother Bertam .
Her family were emigrating to Kansas , where her father had hoped to open a tobacconist ’s shop .
He died in the disaster but Milvina ’s mother and brother survived and returned to the UK .
A new group has emerged with a plan to put a second National Hockey League team in the Greater Toronto Area .
This group – which claims to have $ 1 billion in financing and would donate a portion of the team 's profits to charity – will announce details of its vision for an NHL expansion franchise tomorrow in Toronto .
The trio speaking at that event include Herbert Carnegie , 89 , an Order of Canada recipient and described in a biography on the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame Web site as " one of the best ever players to never play pro-league hockey . "
The three will unveil how the team will honour " Canadian heroes while supporting cancer research , national scholarships and children 's charities . "
Appearing with Carnegie tomorrow will be Paul Pelligrini of the Sussex Strategy Government Relations , an aide to former Toronto mayor and Liberal cabinet minister Art Eggleton ; and Andrew Lopez of Toronto Legacy Group .
None would be owners and NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said today he has not talked to the group .
" It will take two to three years at minimum to build an arena , " Lopez said in an interview .
" The earliest we would look at an expansion franchise is 2012 . "
Tomorrow , the group will talk about its financing , donations , an economic impact review and also unveil the name of a team , arena , jersey , site plan and architect renderings .
The biography of Carnegie says the son of Jamaican immigrants to Canada starred in Quebec senior hockey leagues in the 1940s and ' 50s where he was MVP for three consecutive years .
He went on to establish the Future Aces Hockey School for kids aged 12 - 14 .
The hockey school led to the Future Aces Foundation which provides 25 annual bursaries to young people , enabling them to pursue post - secondary education .
In 2003 , he was named a Member , Order of Canada and in 2005 North York Centennial Arena was renamed the Herbert H. Carnegie Centennial Centre in honour of his community activities .
It was not immediately clear whether this group had any links to a group fronted by former Toronto Maple Leaf Kevin Maguire , who recently met with the NHL to discuss his group 's plans in placing a team in Vaughan .

Let ’s say you own a big building full of valuable stuff .
How do you make sure that the night watchman patrolling your factory floor or museum galleries after closing time actually makes his rounds ?
How do you know he ’s inspecting every hallway , floor , and stairwell in the facility ?
How do you know he ( or she ) is not just spending every night sleeping at his desk ?
If you ’re a technology designer , you might suggest using surveillance cameras or even GPS to track his location each night , right ?
But let ’s make this interesting .
Let ’s go a century back in time to , say , around 1900 .
What could you possibly do in 1900 to be absolutely sure a night watchman was making his full patrol ?
An elegant solution , designed and patented in 1901 by the German engineer A.A. Newman , is called the “ watchclock ” .
It ’s an ingenious mechanical device , slung over the shoulder like a canteen and powered by a simple wind - up spring mechanism .
It precisely tracks and records a night watchman ’s position in both space and time for the duration of every evening .
It also generates a detailed , permanent , and verifiable record of each night ’s patrol .
What ’s so interesting to me about the watchclock is that it ’s an early example of interaction design used to explicitly control user behavior .
The “ user ” of the watchclock device is obliged to behave in a strictly delimited fashion .
But before I go into the interaction theory at work here , let ’s look at how the watchclock system works in a little more detail .
The fundamental innovation — the trick , if you will — is that the device itself is only one part of a larger , external system .
The Key is the System
The key , literally , to the watchclock system is that the watchman is required to “ clock in ” at a series of perhaps a dozen or more checkpoints Â throughout the premises .
Positioned at each checkpoint is a unique , coded key nestled in a little steel box and secured by a small chain .
Each keybox is permanently and discreetly installed in strategically - placed nooks and crannies throughout the building , for example in a broom closet or behind a stairway .
The watchman makes his patrol .
He visits every checkpoint and clicks each unique key into the watchclock .
Within the device , the clockwork marks the exact time and key - location code to a paper disk or strip .
If the watchman visits all checkpoints in order , they will have completed their required patrol route .
The watchman ’s supervisor can subsequently unlock the device itself ( the watchman himself cannot open the watchclock ) and review the paper records to confirm if the watchman was or was not doing their job .
This is an idea with long legs .
The watchclock is built like a revolver , of good old fashioned brass and steel and encased in a thick leather holster .
It requires no batteries and almost no maintenance .
The “ guard tour patrol system ” concept , too , has a timeless elegance .
The mechanism itself has barely changed for a century : although some more recent models incorporate GPS and other technologies , the mechanical key - based watchclock system is still in wide usage , with many buildings still employing the same keys and the same clockwork devices they ’ve used since the 1940s .
It ’s a genuine example of an “ if it aint broke , do n’t fix it ” kind of technology .
From a behavioral perspective , I find the watchclock fascinating not simply because it ’s a kind of steampunk GPS , a wind - up mechanical location - awareness technology .
I ’m further fascinated at how this holistic system of watchclocks , keys , guards , and supervisors succeeded so completely in creating a method of behavioral control such that a human being ’s movements can be precisely planned and executed , hour after hour and night after night , with such a high degree of reliability that almost a century goes by before anyone thinks of ways of improving the system as originally conceived .
The watchclock is a primitive form of technology - mediated interaction design and narrowly - focused social engineering :
The “ interface ” is the whole system :
The watchclock , keys , and paper records .
Designing for Control
Many in the interaction design field (s ) argue that user experience design most definitely is not about behavioral control , or at least it should n’t be .
Dan Saffer entitled his excellent book “ Designing for Interaction “ , the “ for ” being a nod to the idea that users do n’t need to interact with systems in exactly the way the interaction designer intended or envisioned .
Interactive systems — whether social networks , desktop apps , or multiplayer online games — often shine best when users break the rules .
Systems that explicitly and deliberately give users the freedom to interact in creative and unforeseen ways are some of the most interesting and powerful kinds of interaction design .
But the watchclock is another kind of interaction design , one whose function corrals the user into a single , linear , constrained sort of behavior .
The night watchman has a fundamental social constraint — the desire to not get fired from their job .
This constraint allows the watchclock patrol system to work so effectively ( some would say insidiously ) as an interaction design instrument of control .
As a former game designer , I think it ’s important to recognize that a really fun user experience will often exist somewhere between these poles of freedom and control .
The player can kill the bad guys in whatever clever way she wishes , but she ’s got to collect the three crystals to operate the teleporter — there ’s no other way off the ship , and no other way to get to the next level .
( I wonder if it ’s more than a coincidence that so many systems of controlled - play in games involve the use of keys , just like the watchclock . )
Giving a user freedom to interact however they wish seems admirable in principle , but requiring the user to jump through precisely the hoops you , the designer , want them to jump through is also a powerful way to create an emotionally and intellectually compelling experience .
In a practical sense , it ’s also a way to make sure that the user does n’t get frustrated or even fail to do what they really need to do .
The watchclock ’s user experience is n’t compelling or stimulating , to be sure , but in my mind it is truly an archetype of the “ behavioral control ” side of interaction design .
Today we have some news from Chernobyl , the place of the Soviet Nuclear disaster .
The first one is about giang fishes nowadays can be found in the rivers of Chernobyl .
Lately people all the time witness them , and Chernobyl travel trips now include special bus stops on the bridges to make photos of those puppies .
They have been reported to reach 3 - 4 meteres long ( 10 - 13 feet ) .
Many stories now being told about the military diver that lost his hand thanks to one of those and some other horrifying tales .
People say that the bottom mud is still radioactive in Chernobyl rivers which allows these fish get that size .
Here is another video , bit less quality , but still can be seen the contours to guess their size .
The “ food ” they get from the spectators is usually the big pieces of loaf , so the real size of the fish can be understood in comparison .
The next story is about new giant dome being constructed above the central point of the Chernobyl site – the reactor .
The dome would be assembled at side , in order not to risk lifes of the construction workers participating , and then would be moved on rails like a rolling door to seal this friend forever .
They tell it would be really huge , 108 meteres ( 300 ft ) tall and would be taller than Liberty Statue .
Some Russian people make jokes that this nuclear shield is looking nice above the Liberty Statue , meaning that the atomic disaster in New York might have a chance too .
They say it would weigh 20,000 tons .
And that ’s how the place and the reactor looks like , while the Big Shield project is not yet carried out .
They say the radiation is pretty considerable in that place even now .
One can hear the sound of crick - cracking monitors turned on .
As you can see this place is pretty popular among tourists , some companies specialize on such kind of tourism .

The US administration asks an appeals court to stop the release of prisoner abuse images , showing that Obama has fully backtracked on his promise of transparency .
In a motion filed Thursday in a New York federal appeals court , the Obama administration said that it did not want the photos to be available to the public , arguing that they could lead to violence against US troops in Iraq , Afghanistan and even Pakistan .
“ [ Distributing the photos poses ] a clear and grave risk of inciting violence and riots against American and coalition forces , as well as civilian personnel , serving in Iraq and Afghanistan , ” the motion said .
The court filing also included two semi-classified statements by the top US commander in Iraq , General Raymond Odierno , and the head of US Central Command General David Petraeus , who leads US military activities in the Middle East and Central Asia .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
“ [ The release of the images ] would … further endanger the lives of US soldiers , Marines , airmen , sailors , civilians and contractors , ” said Petraeus .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Odierno also claimed that Iraqi officials had told him the release of the photos , which are believed to number in the thousands , could disrupt democratic progress in Iraq before the national elections .
Last month , Obama ’s administration said that it would comply with a court order , which was issued following a lengthy Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union .
The order said the pictures must be released by May 28 .
Earlier in May , however , Barack Obama reversed his position , saying that he did not feel comfortable with his previous decision .
The new US administration ’s U - turn on the issue drew a heavy backlash from the ACLU , which expressed outrage and said the decision “ makes a mockery ” of Obama ’s campaign promise of transparency .
While Amnesty International said that it was disappointed , other US human rights groups also accused Obama of following in the footsteps of former president George W. Bush .
News of the US government ’s official stance came as Press TV released some images of the maltreatment of prisoners by US soldiers , confirming an earlier Daily Telegraph report , which revealed the photos of abuse at Iraqi jails include images of rape and sexual assault .
Washington - based investigative journalist Wayne Madsen emailed the horrific images to Press TV , rejecting allegations by neoconservative media that they were fake .
Madsen said when some of the disputed photos were randomly published by the Boston Globe in 2004 , neoconservatives made the same accusations against the paper .
The Daily Telegraph report focused on information provided by Major General Antonio Taguba , a former army officer who published a report in 2004 into the abuse scandal at the Abu Ghraib prison .
Contradicting an Obama administration claim that photos did not include pictures of sexual abuse , Taguba said the images showed mistreatment , torture , and rape .
A Canadian court has ordered a cinema to pay $ 10,000 damages after staff searched a family 's bags looking for camming equipment , but ended up breaching their privacy .
The search by staff also turned up something embarrassing in older daughter 's bag .
Mom had no idea .
Not impressed .
A little while ago we reported on a case in the UK where a woman went to the cinema and claimed she was “ treated like a criminal . ”
Searching for movie camming equipment , staff instead found some candy .
Because she would n’t hand it over , they called security to deal with her and the whole thing descended into farce .
Well , it seems the Canadians have been at it too .
These days cinemas believe that all paying movie - goers are potential Scene pirates , so when a woman took her two daughters to Cinema Guzzo in Montreal to watch Shrek the Third in 2007 , they were searched for camming kit .
Big trouble ensued .
Finding a stash of illicit smuggled snacks , staff ordered them returned to their vehicle , to be locked securely away so it would be impossible to consume them while watching the movie .
The trio complied .
The search of the bags continued and then , jackpot !
Although staff did n’t find the latest DV camera , they did find some birth control pills in the older daughter ’s bag , an event that did n’t go unnoticed by her mother .
Until this point , she had absolutely no idea her child took them .
Understandably angry , the mother sued the cinema for invasion of privacy , demanding $ 60,000 CAD .
Last week a judge ruled that the staff did indeed breach the privacy of the family and ordered the cinema to pay $ 10,000 CAD ( $ 9,000 USD ) .
Signs at the point of ticket purchase must clearly state that there is a bag search in place and staff must not put their hands inside people ’s bags .
Cinema Guzzo failed on both counts , not to mention causing sensitive problems within a family and guaranteeing that they never , ever come back as customers .
Fail all round then .

The retirement plans of many Americans went out the window in the past year due to the economic downturn , a new survey finds .
A lot of folks now are looking at Plan B , and Plan B means working more and working later in life .
It 's not unlike what our great - great grandparents planned for , back before the concept of retirement came into vogue .
However , working beyond age 65 does n't have to be dismal , experts say , especially if you change your expectations and push yourself to pursue work in a field that you love .
Just keep working
First , here are the survey results :
No surprise , but about three - quarters of adults in the so - called threshold generation ( ages 50 - 64 ) have seen the value of their investments — mutual funds , individual stocks or retirement accounts such as 401 ( k ) s — decline in the past year , according to the national survey of 2,417 Americans conducted Feb. 23 to March 23 by the Pew Research Center 's Social & Demographic Trends Project .
About half of all working adults in this age group say they may delay their retirement , and 16 percent say they expect to never stop working , the survey found .
Overall , some 37 percent of all full - time working adults of all ages say they have thought in the past year about postponing their retirement .
Women are more likely to feel this way ( 46 percent ) than men ( 31 percent ) .
And whites have thought about delayed retirement ( 40 percent ) more than blacks ( 32 percent ) and Hispanics ( 34 percent ) , the Pew survey found .
Investment advisor Art Dinkin sees this trend , too .
His clients at retirement age are not retiring .
" No one says it 's their ideal solution , " said Dinkin , CFP® , an investment advisor representative of Ameritas Investment Corp. , member FINRA / SIPC .
" We 've all bought into this dream of retire at 65 , get your gold watch and then living the life of leisure .
But the dream is n't as strong as we thought it was . "
Wobbly 3 - legged stool
Retirement is a relatively new concept in the United States .
It arose only in the late 19th century and early 20th century .
Until then , people worked until they were physically unable to continue , and then their communities supported them .
Around the turn of the last century , some big employer - supported pensions started up , but with the Depression , it was clear that businesses could n't be counted on to support retirees during economic bad times .
So social security was initiated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the mid-1930s as a government solution .
Nowadays , workers hang on like a dog to a bone to the concept of retirement .
Meanwhile , each of the three legs of the retirement stool — pensions and / or 401 ( k ) s , social security and personal savings — are getting wobbly .
In fact , the only true security for a retiree today is their own savings and investments , Dinkin said .
Neither the government nor corporate pensions can be relied upon as the foundation of a stable retirement , he adds .
3 solutions
The No. 1 most important thing that people can do right now to plan in a time of recession for retirement is to make a valid assessment of their tolerance for financial risk , as well as when and how they plan to use their retirement funds , he said .
" There are three and only three solutions to solving retirement problems , " said Dinkin , whose practice is based in West Des Moines , Iowa .
" First — delay retirement by working a little longer .
Second — retire at a lower standard of living than we had originally planned .
And third — put more aside before retirement .
There is no magic bullet . "
He added : " The reality is that very few people try to retire more modestly , but they are willing to delay it . "
So that means more work , but maybe not in your previous career .
Some of Dinkin 's clients are leaving their primary profession to pursue lower pay doing something for which they have a passion , such as fishing .
Dinkin also recommends " The New Retirementality " ( Wiley , 2008 ) , in which author Mitch Anthony encourages workers to get paid to do what they love from the get - go , rather than trudging for decades to jobs they hate and expecting some illusionary pay - off .
That way , when retirement age comes and the potential for retirement income is shaky , people actually prefer to keep working anyhow .
ANN ARBOR , Mich. , April 22 ( UPI ) -- U.S. scientists say they have developed a concrete material that can heal itself when it cracks with only water and carbon dioxide needed .
University of Michigan researchers said all that is necessary to mend a damaged bridge would be a few drizzly days .
They said the self - healing is possible because the concrete material is designed to bend and crack in narrow hairlines , rather than break and split in wide gaps , as does traditional concrete .

Professor Victor Li , who led the research , said self - healed specimens recovered most , if not all , of their original strength after researchers subjected them to a 3 percent tensile strain .
That means they stretched the specimens to 3 percent beyond their initial size -- the equivalent of stretching a 100 - foot piece an extra three feet -- enough strain to severely deform metal or catastrophically fracture traditional concrete .
" We found , to our happy surprise , that when we load it again after it heals , it behaves just like new , with practically the same stiffness and strength , " Li said .
" The material can be damaged and still remain safe to load . "
The research is available online , ahead of print , in the journal Cement and Concrete Research .
Li will also present the research in Chicago during June 's International Conference on Self - Healing Materials .

When most people think of Google , search comes to mind – and rightly so !
Hundreds of millions of people have come to know and love Google.com as their starting point for searching the Internet .
About 2 years ago , we introduced Google Desktop to extend Google search capabilities to your Mac and , earlier this year , we launched a developer preview of the next evolution of search outside the browser .
Today , we 're officially releasing this technology to all users as the Google Quick Search Box ( or QSB for short ) .
With Google Quick Search
Box you can search for information from just about anywhere .
As you type , suggestions will appear that match your query , ranging from applications and local files on your computer , to web search and navigational suggestions , to items from your browser history and contacts - and the types of results you can get will only grow over time !
Check out the screenshot below for an example of the types of blended results you might see .
Once you 've found the result you want , we wanted you to be able to DO something with it .
To find out what you can do , select a result and press the tab key or the right arrow on the keyboard .
Some examples of actions include instant messaging friends , playing a song , or emailing a URL .
Just like the data you can search over , the list of actions you can perform will grow over time !
The quickest way to launch the Google Quick Search Box is by pushing Control + spacebar at the same time ( Google Desktop devotees will still be able to press Command twice to summon the box ) .
If you prefer another keyboard shortcut to summon the Google QSB , you can change it in the Preferences panel .
As you use the Google Quick Search Box more , it will learn which results you are likely to want .
The goal here is that we get you to what you 're looking for as quickly as possible .
In the above example , if you chose Google Calendar , the next time you search for " cal " , Google QSB will reorder the results so that you do n't have to arrow down to your desired choice .
Instead , you can just type " cal " and press enter .
Last , but definitely not least , the Google Quick Search Box is extensible .
This means that anyone can create a plug - in that enables the QSB to search over additional data or perform more actions on results .
As an example , we really enjoy the Twitter plug - in .
After enabling that bad boy , we can send tweets right from the QSB and then do a Google search right after !
The Google QSB has allowed us to do our daily tasks faster .
If you want to give it a try to see it speed up your day , visit www.google.com/quicksearchbox/
If you 're a Google Desktop user and you want to gain this functionality , you can learn more about Google QSB and see how to upgrade in this help center article
And please , let us know what you think

Far below the Black Hills of South Dakota , crews are building the world ’s deepest underground science lab at a depth equivalent to more than six Empire State buildings – a place uniquely suited to scientists ’ quest for mysterious particles known as dark matter .
Scientists , politicians and other officials gathered Monday for a groundbreaking of sorts at a lab 4,850 foot below the surface of an old gold mine that was once the site of Nobel Prize - winning physics research .
The site is ideal for experiments because its location is largely shielded from cosmic rays that could interfere with efforts to prove the existence of dark matter , which is thought to make up nearly a quarter of the mass of the universe .
The deepest reaches of the mine plunge to 8,000 feet below the surface .
Some early geology and hydrology experiments are already under way at 4,850 feet .
Researchers also hope to build two deeper labs that are still awaiting funding from Congress .
“ The fact that we ’re going to be in the Davis Cavern just tickles us pink , ” said Tom Shutt of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , referring to a portion of the mine named after scientist Ray Davis Jr. , who used it in the 1960s to demonstrate the existence of particles called solar neutrinos .
Davis and a colleague named John Bahcall won a share of the 2002 Nobel Prize for physics for their work .
The old Homestake Gold Mine in a community called Lead ( pronounced LEED ) was shut down in 2001 after 125 years .
Pumps that kept the mine dry were turned off years ago , so workers have been drying it out to prepare for the new research .
Before the labs are built , crews must also stabilize the tunnels and install new infrastructure .
The lab at 4,850 feet is not much to look at yet .
A rusty orange film covers the walls , floors , ceilings and debris left behind by miners .
The first dark matter experiment will be the Large Underground Xenon detector experiment – or LUX – a project to detect weakly interacting particles that could give scientists greater insight into the Big Bang explosion believed to have formed the universe .
Shutt , along with Brown University ’s Rick Gaitskell and nearly a dozen collaborators will work at the site to search for dark matter , which does not emit detectable light or radiation .
But scientists say its presence can be inferred from gravitational effects on visible matter .
Scientists believe most of the dark matter in the universe contains no atoms and does not interact with ordinary matter through electromagnetic forces .
They are trying to discover exactly what it is , how much exists and what effect it may have on the future of the universe .
Physicists have said that without dark matter , galaxies might never have formed .
By learning more about dark matter , they hope to understand better whether the universe is expanding or contracting .
The research team will try to catch the ghostly particles in a 300 - kilogram tank of liquid xenon , a cold substance that is three times heavier than water .
If they tried to detect dark matter above ground , the highly sensitive detector would be bombarded by cosmic radiation .
Scientists hope to start construction on the two deepest labs by 2012 and open them by 2016 .
The projects are expected to cost $ 550 million .

( REAL SIMPLE ) --
The summers of my youth were filled with the kinds of activities that were common to every kid in the 80s but are considered almost death - defying these days : tree climbing , bike riding without a helmet , and daylong road trips spent in the backseat of the family car , where we bounced around like Super Balls , nary a seat belt in sight .
Kate Simonson and her dad , Mike Fieseler , at her home in Iowa .
Still , my mother was safety - obsessed about some things , like swimming lessons .
Year after year , she forced me to take them at our local pool in Iowa City .
Having to go against my will seemed all the more unfair to me , since my mother could not swim and was actually afraid of the water .
But my mother reasoned that if water came between her children and their safety , she would be helpless .
" I can't save you , " she would calmly state in answer to my pleas to bow out of the lessons .
" So I 'm going to do everything in my power to make sure you can save yourself . "
Real Simple : Mother - daughter relationships
It 's no wonder she embraced this philosophy of self - reliance .
She knew how unexpectedly life can rob you of someone you care about .
My parents adopted me as an infant and went on to have a biological child -- my brother , Jason -- a couple of years later .
My dad was an electrician , and he died in an accident on the job when I was three .
After his death , my mother had to raise us alone , and she was acutely aware that she was truly on her own , with no backup plan .
She was fiercely strong and yet constantly fearful .
I have almost no memories of my father .
Instead I remember Mike Fieseler .
He was a former industrial - arts teacher whom my mother dated off and on for much of my childhood .
Jason and I were n't his biggest fans .
He was a man of strict rules , while my mom's approach could be more properly deemed overindulgent leniency .
iReport.com : Share your bonding with dad memories
We resented having to share the spotlight with him -- a sentiment that was particularly strong every Christmas morning , when we had to wait for him to arrive before we could open gifts .
( There is little a man can do to endear himself to children less than delaying Christmas - morning gratification . )
And when they stopped dating , when I was 15 , I was n't unhappy to see him go .
Real Simple : Small , helpful gestures with big impact
Then , on February 18 , 1991 , when I was 17 , my mother suddenly died of a brain aneurysm .
One minute she was laughing with friends , enjoying an evening out ; the next , she was unconscious on the floor .
She never woke up .
Just 19 hours later , she was dead , leaving my 15 - year - old brother and me orphans .
In the moments of shock and horror that followed , my relatives all gathered in the hospital , and I went home with only a close friend for company ( Jason followed a while later ) .
We spent that night on our own .
I was numb ; it had all happened so fast .
I could barely think beyond the immediate moment .
The next morning , my grandfather , aunts , and uncles were still immersed in their own mourning .
Shell - shocked as I was , I knew I had to let people know what had happened .
I saw my mother 's address book lying where she had set it only days before and started dialing .
One of the phone numbers I found was Mike's .
Even though he lived about an hour away , it felt like he was there in an instant .
As soon as he walked in , he took charge -- and took care of Jason and me .
Among other small kindnesses , he gave me a credit card and said , " Why do n't you buy something to wear to the funeral ? "
He gave me permission to be a 17 - year - old -- to focus on the more mundane issue of what I was going to wear instead of weighty adult concerns .
Real Simple : Father 's Day gift ideas
Generally , when children are orphaned , a family member comes forward to take them in .
This did n't happen in our case .
Everyone had a good reason , I suppose .
My mom 's father was too old to assume responsibility for us ; my mother 's sister and her husband had three kids of their own and were n't able to take in any others ; her other two siblings were both single and worked long hours .
The guardian named in my mother 's will was a babysitter that none of us had seen in 15 years .
But I can tell you this : Abandonment , even for very good reasons , feels awful .
It was heartbreaking and terrifying to have lost the person we loved most and then to be set adrift .
Months passed and it felt like our relatives could offer no reassurances .
The only news we got was that if Jason and I remained without a guardian , we would have to enter foster care .
Our mother was gone , and there was nothing we could do to save ourselves .
And , once again , there was Mike .
After the funeral , he was a constant presence .
He made sure that food filled the cupboards , the bills were paid , and the lawn was mowed .
( Mike 's adult daughter , Linda , pitched in and took care of his house . )
He made sure I went back to school even when it was the last thing I wanted to do .
His overbearing personality -- the trait I had hated the most -- is what comforted me the most and got me through those difficult days .
Mike says that Linda came up with the idea to make his role with Jason and me official -- he could become our guardian .
He was on board right away .
Mike still says he never considered not doing it ; caring for us was simply the right thing to do .
One day he made us his offer .
In a moment where the grief of loss and the pain of being unwanted threatened to capture my very breath , this man , whose only tie to us was having dated my mother , said he would be honored to take us in .
From that moment on , everything was different .
His girlfriend , Patty , threw us a " guardian party " when the paperwork became official .
It was just a small gathering , but it made us feel special .
I received a key chain with my initials , and I remember thinking that the idea behind it was so lovely .
Over the years ,
Mike has become not merely a legal guardian but a real father to me .
When I fell into depression in college , unable to get past thoughts of my mother and all I had lost , he was there to listen .
When my husband , Eric , and I bought our first house , Mike spent weekends installing insulation and repairing our gutters .
He never wrote me off as a good , mature kid who could handle everything herself .
He walked the line between trusting me and recognizing when I might need help .
And what more could you want from a father than that ?
His was an unconventional path to parenthood , to say the least .
It is not by birth or adoption that I consider this man to be my father ; it is n't even through his presence in my childhood .
It is rather by sheer good luck on my part .
Before he made that generous offer , I felt as though I had lost my mooring and the waters were flooding in ; afterward , I simply felt rescued .
If my mother had taught me to be strong and depend on myself , Mike imparted his own lesson -- that the world will provide for you , even when you least expect it .
Eight years after Mike stepped forward , he walked me down the aisle .
Four years after that , I gave birth to his first granddaughter , Emily Michl Simonson .
( Mike 's legal name is Michl . )
The name is a reminder of my saved past and a promise for the future , and I hope one day Emily will see that as well .
Because as much as I plan to teach her to swim ( indeed , she 's now six and enrolled in lessons ) , I also want her to know this :
No matter how fast the waters rise , no matter how hard it may be to keep her head above the waves , someone will throw her a line .

Chiropractor Richard Brown argues that the criticism of his profession is wide of the mark ( Image : Jay Lee Studio / Rex Features )
SINCE the British Chiropractic Association ( BCA ) decided to sue science writer Simon Singh for libel , scientists and journalists have unleashed a torrent of criticism against chiropractic .
Much of this is misinformed and needs to be corrected .
Many critics – including Edzard Ernst ( New Scientist , 30 May , p 22 ) – hark back to the origins of chiropractic .
This has the clear intention of suggesting that modern chiropractors cling to the 19th century idea that spinal misalignments are responsible for …

Update :
This post was updated to include ratings information .
Given cable 's long history of exorbitant rate increases and atrocious customer service ( it 's routinely ranked one of the very worst industries in the US ) , it 's hard to blame people for being skeptical about cable 's moves to start capping broadband access — especially when costs are dropping and revenues are rising .
But the head of cable 's Washington lobbying effort tells
Ars that cable is n't out to price - gouge its way to massive profit margins .
Instead , the industry seeks to provide Internet access in a way " that 's best for the consumer . "
And everyone who has already decided that it's " flat rate pricing or bust ! " needs to pipe down , adopt the scientific method , and wait until all the data is in .
Running the experiments
Kyle McSlarrow heads up the National Cable & Telecommunications Association ( NCTA ) , a post that often finds him glad - handing legislators , testifying at Congressional briefings , or signing off on documents for the FCC .
He has been on the job since 2005 , having come over to the private sector from the Department of Energy , where he served as a deputy secretary .
McSlarrow has an impeccable Republican pedigree — he was the national chairman for Dan Quayle 's 2000 presidential bid and has worked for both Bob Dole and Trent Lott — but he also spent enough time outside of government to do an Internet startup called Grassroots.com .
He 's now putting the best face possible on the cable business , and he sat down with Ars during a recent trip to Chicago to talk metered broadband , the illusory death of cable TV , and cable 's terrible customer satisfaction numbers .
We 'll bring you more from those conversations in future posts .
According to McSlarrow , there 's no particular rush to pick one business model , and the industry has no " grand plan " hashed out by cigar - smoking executives in clubby back rooms .
In the wake of Time Warner Cable 's failed attempt to expand its capped Internet offerings , though , Internet pricing models are now on everyone 's collective mind .
Is metered and / or capped Internet the future ?
Plenty of critics say that it's not , that it represents nothing more than a cash grab that will have huge negative effects on how Americans use the Internet .
McSlarrow does n't defend any model ; he 's not even partial to metering , having happily lived under flat - rate plans himself for many years .
He also wo n't defend particular business plans , like those advanced by Time Warner Cable .
But what he will defend is cable 's right to experiment .
" I 've lived under a flat rate plan , " he said , " but I do n't assume ... that 's it 's necessarily impossible to believe that you could have a different model in the future . "
That means experimentation , and lots of it , done in the most transparent way , with full input from consumers .
Without even doing the tests , McSlarrow says there 's simply no way to know whether certain business models will work better than others .
He uses a thought experiment to take on those who object , a priori , to all data caps .
" Well , OK , " he says .
" Always ?
At any cap ?
What about the fact that it 's clear , and there 's probably 100 years of economic literature on this , that in flat - rate pricing plans low - end users are essentially subsidizing high - end users ?
Is that necessarily fair ?
Is that fair in a world where those low - end users are actually 95 percent of the customers ? "
ISP data shows that most users transfer only a few gigabytes of data a month .
The argument is that these users might be better served by a cheap plan with a low cap , while heavier users pay more .
It has a certain logic to it , but even McSlarrow admits that Internet pricing does n't exist in some simple relationship with " amount of data transferred in a month " or " number of users . "
But the premise of such an arrangement is that the low - cap plans would be dirt - cheap , something that consumers clearly did n't think applied to the Time Warner Cable plans .
According to McSlarrow , there 's no particular rush to pick one business model , and the industry has no " grand plan " hashed out by cigar - smoking executives in clubby back rooms .
In his view , though , cable needs to do the experiments to make sure that the Internet survives the coming bandwidth apocalypse .
" As demand goes in a certain direction , " he says , " someone 's going to have to build a network " to deal with " not just instantaneous peak but , more importantly , average peak usage .
The whole point is to do it in a way , and to serve your customers in a way , that they have a great experience .
If you fail on the network side to do that , particularly with our shared network , that 's a real problem . "
This future , robust , consumer - friendly network will take plenty of cash to build , and McSlarrow says that observers simply can't look at current costs in order to criticize the experiments .
But in our conversation , it 's never quite clear why everything in the future is about to get so much more expensive , when all the current cost numbers are trending the other way even as traffic surges and DOCSIS 3.0 upgrades are cheap .
In any event , cable is certainly well - placed to deliver the Internet .
A cable company with reasonably upgraded 750MHz plant can deliver about 5 Gbps across all channels ( nearly 40 M bps per channel ) .
But how to charge for it ?
McSlarrow says that we need to trust the market 's wisdom .
( And yes , before you ask , he does argue that cable companies face real competition . )
With the iPhone 3G S news now in the wild , the discussion digressed from the announcement of the 3G S itself to AT&T , the iPhone 's exclusive carrier in the U.S. ( at the moment ) .
Without a doubt , this relationship is where Apple 's weaknesses lie .
The S is ( Supposed to Be ) for Speed
Over the last couple of years , many iPhone customers have complained about AT&T 's signal coverage quality across the country , including those in some densely populated areas .
And while the carrier plans to improve its network over the coming years , by then , this would be the iPhone 3G S's ( or any follow - up device 's ) soft point .
The iPhone 3G S can work on the much faster HSDPA network , with speeds up to 7.2 Mbps , but AT&T will start rolling this network technology only later this year and will complete the transition is 2011 .
This means that nationwide , two more iPhone generations will have to bear lower speeds on their devices .
MMS and Tethering on Standby
As my colleague Ginny Mies points out , MMS and tethering ( iPhone as a modem ) have been on the top of iPhone users ' wish lists for quite a while now .
And with the arrival of the 3.0 software update and the 3G S itself , these long - awaited features are finally there .
Somehow there , that is .
U.S. customers wo n't have the benefit of MMS until late summer because AT&T is still " finalizing internal system upgrades . "
Tethering is not on the list either until later this year , because the carrier is reportedly working on some sort of data plan mash - up between data and tethering for around $ 60 to $ 70 per month .
And , no , this price does n't include texts .
A Hefty Price for an Early Upgrade
The carrier announced that only new and upgrade - eligible customers will be able to pick up a 3G S for the advertised prices of $ 199 ( 16GB ) and $ 299 ( 32GB ) , or even an iPhone 3G for $ 99 ( 8GB ) .
Existing iPhone 3G customers , who endured those long queues last July , will have to shell out $ 599 for a new 16GB 3G S and respectively $ 699 for the 32 GB model .
Alternative upgrade pricing comes at $ 399 and $ 499 .
If you plan on taking on a different route to paying the upgrade prices , AT&T will charge you around $ 175 to cancel your current contract and only 90 days later ( after losing your phone number ) you can sign up again for a new iPhone contract .
Crippling iPhone Apps Development
Besides Apple 's iron fist on good taste within its App Store , AT&T plays a crucial role in the feature set of certain apps .
This year we have seen two major apps getting crippled by AT&T 's terms of service : Skype and SlingPlayer .
Both Skype and SlingPlayer for iPhone work only via Wi -Fi , although theoretically these tasks could be performed over a strong 3G network as well .
But that would have a put a much larger strain on AT&T 's network , which was already shook up at the South by South West Festival just a couple of months ago .
Nick Clegg said a new Trident was not affordable Nick Clegg has called for the Trident nuclear deterrent to be scrapped , saying it is too expensive and no longer meets the UK 's defence needs .
The Lib Dem leader is the most senior politician to say Trident should not be renewed when it expires in 2024 .
The UK still needed a deterrent , he told the BBC , but a " like for like " replacement was out of the question .
Labour and the Conservatives back Trident renewal , estimated to cost £ 20bn , but many Labour MPs oppose it .
Changed view When Tony Blair agreed to renew the submarine - based missile system in 2007 , 97 Labour MPs opposed the move .
Although long sceptical about the cost of replacing Trident , the Lib Dems had , up to now , adopted a wait - and - see policy arguing that decision on renewal could be postponed .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
In the leadership contest of 2007 , Mr Clegg clashed with his rival Chris Huhne - a firm opponent of Trident - over the subject .
Mr Clegg told the BBC he had " changed his mind " over the issue and he believed that , 20 years after the end of the Cold War , Trident was now clearly outmoded .
He now says a decision cannot be delayed any longer , given the desperate state of the UK 's public finances .
" We have to be realistic and candid about what we can and can't afford as a nation , " he said .
" If we do n't move with the times , if we do n't accept circumstances have changed , if we do n't accept our capacity to pay for everything we 're paying for at the moment is going to be more limited in the future then I think we 're not being candid with the British people , we 're not being candid with ourselves . "
Cheaper alternative
While hoping that the UK will eventually be able to scrap its nuclear weapons as part of a multilateral agreement , he has asked former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell to look at cheaper , alternatives to Trident in the meantime .
Not since the 1980s has an argument about nuclear weapons divided the major political parties
Nick Robinson on the comments Gordon Brown says Trident is necessary to protect the UK in a volatile world where nuclear proliferation is a major threat to international stability .
The Tories have long supported Trident renewal but are currently reviewing all their spending commitments and say all programmes will be considered in a strategic defence review if they win the next election .
The BBC's Political Editor Nick Robinson said the nuclear issue was now back on the frontline of British politics and would be a factor in the general election for the first time in decades .

" Air on the Dirac Strings " explores the rotation of objects connected by a belt or by strings to a fixed background .
Such an object plus its connections to the background will be entangled by a 360 degree rotation , yet returned fully to its original configuration after a 720 degree rotation .
This combination of topology and geometry has applications to the physics of an electron .
The geometry / topology of the Dirac string trick is intimately connected with the quaternions .
The patterns of rotation of an object that is connected to a background are described directly by the quaternion algebra .
The quaternions are also useful for representing rotations in the usual sense , and they were used in this way to program the graphics in this movie .
This motion has been incorporated into the Philippine wine dance where a dancer rotates a wine glass 720 degrees without spilling a drop .

In the latest episode of the Canadian tech podcast Search Engine , Peter Van Loan , the new Public Safety minister , attempts to explain the Conservative government 's approach to privacy on the internet .
It 's a remarkable piece of audio .
It goes a little like this :
Search Engine :
Here 's some audio of your predecessor promising , on behalf of your party and your government , never to ever allow the police to wiretap the Internet without a warrant .
Minister ( as though he had been off on another planet ) :
We never promised not to do that .
Search Engine :
What about all the personal information that you guys are now proposing to give to the cops without a warrant ?
Minister ( tragically unclear on the subject ) :
We 're not requiring ISPs to give out any personal information without a warrant , just your real name , your home address , your IP address , your home and cell number …
Search Engine : Huh .
Well there 's this really critical , high profile court ruling that calls all that stuff private information ?
Minister ( pretending he did n't hear ) :
The courts have ruled that this is n't private information .
Canadians have no legitimate expectation of privacy when they use the Internet , not when it comes to your name , address , cell phone number , etc
Search Engine :
Do the cops really need to get this information without a warrant ?
Minister : Oh yes .
There are MONSTROUS BABY - EATING CHILD PORNOGRAPHERS WHO ADVERTISE THAT THEY ARE ABOUT TO SEXUALLY ASSAULT A LIVE CHILD IN TEN MINUTES and we need to be able to run down their IPs without talking to a judge first .
Search Engine :
But when a child is endangered , the law already allows you to get this information without a warrant , right ?
Minister :
Why are you still asking questions ?
Did n't you hear me ?
BABY - EATING CHILD PORNOGRAPHERS !
Surely that settles the matter .
Search Engine : Uh , I guess .
Thanks anyway .

Ineffective disaster management systems , poor funding and lack of relevant data for planning risk - reduction activities have taken their toll on sub-Saharan African countries , specialists said .
" Despite high economic growth in some countries , disasters are continuing to affect the continent 's ability to build wealth for its people , " Margareta Wahlström , UN Assistant Secretary - General for Disaster Risk Reduction ( DRR ) , said .
" We often looked at disasters as events that happen , then we go back to normal life ... this is no longer possible due to the high cost of disasters , " Wahlström told the Second Africa Regional meeting on DRR in Nairobi on 5 May .
" It is difficult convincing ministries of finance to allocate funding ... but is reducing risk through better planning expensive ?
Not necessarily , " she added .
" If you plan to build a house and the local people tell you that the area is flood - prone , you save money by looking for a safer place . "
Kenyan government records estimate the cost of response to the 1999 –2001 drought at US $ 340 million .
It would , however , have cost half that had there been an effective disaster management system in place , according to Ali Mohamed , permanent secretary in the government ’s special programmes ministry .
Kenya also grapples with internal and cross - border conflicts .
Experts said the country 's level of emergency preparedness was tested by massive displacement in the 2008 post-election violence .
Achim Steiner , Executive Director of the UN Environmental Programme , said Kenya loses an equivalent of 5.5 percent of its gross domestic product every seven years to recurrent floods and drought .
At present , an estimated 10 million people are affected by drought .
The lack of disaster preparedness is , however , not only a developing - country problem , as exemplified by Hurricane Katrina , which hit New Orleans in 2005 .
" Our state of preparedness in woefully inadequate , " Steiner said .
" Climate change is the most stark truth , perhaps , that we have to start to manage as a planet .
The sea level in Bangladesh is predicted to rise 60 cm this century ... about 20 to 30 million people will have to look for a place to live . "

Lack of climate data , for example , had reduced the ability of countries to correctly make climate predications , according to Charles Akol of the UN Economic Commission for Africa .
" There is limited capacity [ for ]
African countries to carry out loss assessments after disasters , " he said .
Davies Okoko , disaster preparedness manager at the Kenya Red Cross Society , said disaster responders needed retraining to tackle emerging threats and emergency services needed equipment to tackle rapid onset disasters .
" There are few resources committed to deal with such disasters , " he said .
Rapid urbanisation was cited as one cause of increasing risks and costs of disaster , as the global urban population surpasses the rural one .
Youcef Aitchellouche , disaster management coordinator of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies , called for capacity building at local level , and improved coordination between development and humanitarian aid for sustainable disaster risk management .
In Mozambique , for example , disaster management agencies were working with local communities , said Pedro Tomo , director of the national institute for disaster management .
Agricultural technology centres had also been set up in remote areas to teach farmers to counter the effects of recurrent drought and flooding .
Wahlström said weather events such as the 2004 tsunami had showed that disasters have no borders .
" We have to learn to be opportunistic , to take advantage of the triggers as people tend to forget disaster events , " she said .
The conference , which closes on 7 May with recommendations , is being held under the Hyogo Framework for Action , a global blueprint to promote a strategic and systematic approach to reducing vulnerabilities and risks to hazards and cut disaster losses by 2015 .

An international group of scientists has developed a polymer - based solar cell with an ability not yet seen in similar cells : almost every single photon it absorbs is converted into a pair of electric - charge carriers , and every one of those pairs is collected at the cell 's electrodes .
The overall efficiency of the cell is six percent , meaning a total of six percent of the absorbed energy is converted into usable electricity when illuminated in the lab with similated solar light .
This may seem low , but polymer solar cells to date have not yielded efficiencies better than five percent .
“ These characteristics make our polymer solar cell the best of its kind produced so far , ” said the study 's corresponding scientist , Alan Heeger of the University of California at Santa Barbara and the Heeger Center for Advanced Materials at the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology , in South Korea .
Heeger collaborated with colleagues from UC Santa Barbara , the Heeger Center , and the University of Laval in Quebec , Canada .
The group 's work is a good sign that it is possible to produce polymer solar cells with efficiencies good enough for commercial production .
As alternative - energy media , polymer solar cells are already promising because they would be much cheaper to produce and far more lightweight than conventional solar cells or cells made using other materials .
They would also be highly portable and physically flexible , making it possible to place them in locations that standard solar cells cannot go .
The solar cell is made of a “ copolymer , ” a polymer consisting of two different alternating polymer chains .
Its role is to release electrons when hit by sunlight ; the electrons are accepted by a fullerene derivative , a material based on a form of carbon that tends to form large spherical molecules known as fullerenes .
When the two materials are combined into a composite “ active layer , ” regions form that separating the positive and negative charge - the positively charged “ holes ” left by electrons as they leave the copolymer and , of course , the electrons themselves .
The regions are known as bulk heterojunctions , or BHJs .
Historically , increasing the photocurrent produced in BHJ solar cells has proven difficult .
Simply increasing the thickness of the copolymer - fullerene layer so that it absorbs more light and thus releases more charge carriers does n't work because charge carriers do n't travel far within the material .
Heeger and his colleagues tried an approach that would retain a typical active layer thickness , about 80 nanometers , yet maximize the photocurrent .
They added another layer to the cell , a sheet of titanium - oxide sandwiched between the copolymer and the top electrode , which has two roles .
First , it redirects the intensity of the light such that it is maximized in the active layer .
With higher intensity light reaching the active layer , the photocurrent increases .
Second , it acts as a “ hole blocker , ” helping to keep the photo - generated electrons from recombining with holes .
The group discovered that at a copolymer - to - fullerene ratio of 1:4 , the internal quantum efficiency , the number of electrons produced per absorbed photon , is remarkably high - close to 100 percent for light with a wavelength of 450 nanometers ( violet - blue light ) and above 90 percent for all other wavelengths in the absorbed spectrum .
When illuminated by monochromatic green light , a wavelength of 532 nanometers , the group measured an overall efficiency - the efficiency that measures how much usable current is produced - of 17 percent .
This is very high for a solar cell .
“ Although , in practice , a solar cell would never be used under a light source that emitted only green light , this shows that it should be possible to achieve efficiencies of 10 to 15 percent in bulk heterojunction solar cells , ” says Heeger .

On the BT website , it suggests that its Option 1 broadband package is " fast & reliable … cheap broadband at high speeds " , and that among other things you can use it for " streaming up to 25 hours of iPlayer every month . "
It 's not true .
As the BBC has discovered , Option 1 customers who use iPlayer in peak times - that is , between 5 pm and midnight - can't really use iPlayer .
Even if your connection speed is close to the advertised " up to 8 Mbps " , BT throttles video streaming in the evenings so the fastest speed you 'll get is 896 Kbps .
In the BBC 's experience the actual speed was lower still : 700 Kbps , which is completely inadequate for an iPlayer session .
If you are n't unemployed or self - employed , BT is choking your connection at the very times you 're most likely to use it .
On the subject of iPlayer 's bandwidth demands BT says " We believe there is a real issue that content owners like the BBC need to address . "
Maybe there is , but there 's an issue BT needs to address right now .
Its advertising specifically says you can use Option 1 for iPlayer , and you can't .
Not just BT
BT is n't the only ISP who does this .
Many ISPs use throttling to limit demands on their network , and while we understand the reasons for it - services such as iPlayer use massive amounts of bandwidth , and bandwidth costs money - we do n't like the way many of them go about it .
What we need here is a little honesty .
We have no problem with ISPs choking bandwidth on their budget offerings to keep the prices low , but we do have a problem with them burying any mention of such throttling in the tedious Fair Use Policy documents that nobody reads - especially when the throttling affects the very services the sales bumph is banging on about .
ISPs will argue - quite rightly - that broadband services are not all the same , and you should n't expect the same performance from a seven quid service as you 'd get from a thirty quid one .
So perhaps they should stop advertising seven quid services as if they were as good as thirty quid ones .
If the ad says iPlayer , you should be able to get iPlayer .
No ifs .
No buts .
And no speed bumps .

His profit - making film company , Participant Media , is known for producing movies like “ An Inconvenient Truth ” and “ The Kite Runner , ” which aim to bring greater public awareness to social issues , while his investment firm , Capricorn Investments , puts money into things like waterless urinals and developing sustainable seafood products .
The Skoll Foundation underwrites the work of social entrepreneurs like Connie K. Duckworth , who founded an organization , Arzu Inc. , that provides health care and higher - than - market - rate compensation to Afghan women making rugs in exchange for their pledge to send their children to school and attend literacy classes themselves .
“ What I ’ve been aiming at all these years is to try and address these big social issues in the world , ” Mr. Skoll said , “ but in the last five years or so , certain issues have emerged very clearly that , if we do n’t get ahead of them soon , all of the other things we ’re trying to do , whether improving the lives of women or preservation of species or girls ’ education , wo n’t really matter . ”
Dr. Brilliant , who has given up his latest job as Google ’s Chief Philanthropy Evangelist , said he hoped to leverage the work of the other organizations Mr. Skoll has supported in pursuing solutions to some of the most complex threats to humanity .
“ They are tools in the tool kit , ” he said .
“ We may be using the films and creative talent of Participant , or the social entrepreneurs whose lives and work can inform our work . ”
Fourteen years after the execution of the Nigerian author and activist Ken Saro - Wiwa by Nigeria ’s former military regime , Royal Dutch Shell will appear before a federal court in New York to answer charges of crimes against humanity in connection with his death .
The trial , scheduled to begin on Wednesday , will examine allegations that Shell sought the aid of the former Nigerian regime in silencing Mr. Saro - Wiwa , a vociferous critic , in addition to paying soldiers who carried out human rights abuses in the oil - rich but impoverished Niger Delta where it operated .
Shell strongly denies the charges .
But the trial is the latest in a series of cases aimed at some of the world ’s biggest oil companies , asserting misdeeds in developing countries where they were once seen as unassailable .
Oil companies are being sued on charges of environmental damage , collusion with repressive governments and contributing to human rights abuses , among others .
Chevron , for example , could face up to $ 27 billion in liability in Ecuador for pollution of the jungle .
' I 'm better off dead .
I 'm done ' : Michael Jackson 's fateful prediction just a week before his death
Genetic condition had ruined his lungs and left him unable to sing
He became so skeletal , doctors believed he was anorexic
He had nightmares about being murdered – and wanted to die
He used swine flu as an excuse to avoid coming to England
He thought he was agreeing to 10 concerts – it was 50
Whatever the final autopsy results reveal , it was greed that killed Michael Jackson .
Had he not been driven – by a cabal of bankers , agents , doctors and advisers – to commit to the gruelling 50 concerts in London ’s O2 Arena , I believe he would still be alive today .
During the last weeks and months of his life , Jackson made desperate attempts to prepare for the concert series scheduled for next month – a series that would have earned millions for the singer and his entourage , but which he could never have completed , not mentally , and not physically .
Ailing : Michael Jackson may have worn a mask in public to protect his diseased lungs
Michael knew it and his advisers knew it .
Anyone who caught even a fleeting glimpse of the frail old man hiding beneath the costumes and cosmetics would have understood that the London tour was madness .
For Michael Jackson , it was fatal .
I had more than a glimpse of the real Michael ; as an award - winning freelance journalist and film - maker , I spent more than five years inside his ‘ camp ’ .
Many in his entourage spoke frankly to me – and that made it possible for me to write authoritatively last December that Michael had six months to live , a claim that , at the time , his official spokesman , Dr Tohme Tohme , called a ‘ complete fabrication ’ .
The singer , he told the world , was in ‘ fine health ’ .
Six months and one day later , Jackson was dead .
Some liked to snigger at his public image , and it is true that flamboyant clothes and bizarre make - up made for a comic grotesque ; yet without them , his appearance was distressing ; with skin blemishes , thinning hair and discoloured fingernails .
I had established beyond doubt , for example , that Jackson relied on an extensive collection of wigs to hide his greying hair .
Shorn of their luxuriance , the Peter Pan of Neverland cut a skeletal figure .
It was clear that he was in no condition to do a single concert , let alone 50 .
He could no longer sing , for a start .
On some days he could barely talk .
He could no longer dance .
Disaster was looming in London and , in the opinion of his closest confidantes , he was feeling suicidal .
To understand why a singer of Jackson ’s fragility would even think about travelling to London , we need to go back to June 13 , 2005 , when my involvement in his story began .
As a breaking news alert flashed on CNN announcing that the jury had reached a verdict in Jackson ’s trial for allegedly molesting 13 - year - old Gavin Arvizo at his Neverland Ranch in California , I knew that history had been made but that Michael Jackson had been broken – irrevocably so , as it proved .
Nor was it the first time that Michael had been accused of impropriety with young boys .
Little more than a decade earlier , another 13 - year - old , Jordan Chandler , made similar accusations in a case that was eventually settled before trial – but not before the damage had been done to Jackson ’s reputation .
Frail :
In a wheelchair last year , Michael Jackson looked in no state to perform 50 tough gigs
Michael had not helped his case .
Appearing in a documentary with British broadcaster Martin Bashir , he not only admitted that he liked to share a bed with teenagers , mainly boys , in pyjamas , but showed no sign of understanding why anyone might be legitimately concerned .
I had started my investigation convinced that Jackson was guilty .
By the end , I no longer believed that .
I could not find a single shred of evidence suggesting that Jackson had molested a child .
But I found significant evidence demonstrating that most , if not all , of his accusers lacked credibility and were motivated primarily by money .
Jackson also deserved much of the blame , of course .
Continuing to share a bed with children even after the suspicions surfaced bordered on criminal stupidity .
He was also playing a truly dangerous game .
It is clear to me that Michael was homosexual and that his taste was for young men , albeit not as young as Jordan Chandler or Gavin Arvizo .
In the course of my investigations , I spoke to two of his gay lovers , one a Hollywood waiter , the other an aspiring actor .
The waiter had remained friends , perhaps more , with the singer until his death last week .
He had served Jackson at a restaurant , Jackson made his interest plain and the two slept together the following night .
According to the waiter , Jackson fell in love .
The actor , who has been given solid but uninspiring film parts , saw Jackson in the middle of 2007 .
He told me they had spent nearly every night together during their affair – an easy claim to make , you might think .
But this lover produced corroboration in the form of photographs of the two of them together , and a witness .
Other witnesses speak of strings of young men visiting his house at all hours , even in the period of his decline .
Some stayed overnight .
When Jackson lived in Las Vegas , one of his closest aides told how he would sneak off to a ‘ grungy , rat - infested ’ motel – often dressed as a woman to disguise his identity – to meet a male construction worker he had fallen in love with .
Jackson was acquitted in the Arvizo case , dramatically so , but the effect on his mental state was ruinous .
Sources close to him suggest he was close to complete nervous breakdown .
Death scene :
The rented home in Bel Air where Michael Jackson passed away
The ordeal had left him physically shattered , too .
One of my sources suggested that he might already have had a genetic condition I had never previously come across , called Alpha - 1 antitrypsin deficiency – the lack of a protein that can help protect the lungs .
Although up to 100,000 Americans are severely affected by it , it is an under - recognised condition .
Michael was receiving regular injections of Alpha - 1 antitrypsin derived from human plasma .
The treatment is said to be remarkably effective and can enable the sufferer to lead a normal life .
But the disease can cause respiratory problems and , in severe cases , emphysema .
Could this be why Jackson had for years been wearing a surgical mask in public , to protect his lungs from the ravages of the disease ?
Or why , from time to time , he resorted to a wheelchair ?
When I returned to my source inside the Jackson camp for confirmation , he said : ‘ Yeah , that ’s what he ’s got .
He ’s in bad shape .
They ’re worried that he might need a lung transplant but he may be too weak .
‘ Some days he can hardly see and he ’s having a lot of trouble walking . ’
Even Michael Jackson ’s legendary wealth was in sharp decline .
Just a few days before he announced his 50 - concert comeback at the O2 Arena , one of my sources told me Jackson had been offered £ 1.8 million to perform at a party for a Russian billionaire on the Black Sea .
‘ Is he up to it ? ’ I had asked .
‘ He has no choice .
He needs the money .
His people are pushing him hard , ’ said the source .
Could he even stand on a stage for an hour concert ?
‘ He can stand .
The treatments have been successful .
He can even dance once he gets in better shape .
He just ca n’t sing , ’ said the aide , adding that Jackson would have to lip - synch to get through the performance .
‘ Nobody will care , as long as he shows up and moonwalks . ’
He also revealed Jackson had been offered well over £ 60 million to play Las Vegas for six months .
‘ He said no , but his people are trying to force it on him .
He ’s that close to losing everything , ’ said the source .
Forced : Michael Jackson thought he was agreeing to 10 concerts at London 's O2 Arena not 50
Indeed , by all accounts Jackson ’s finances were in a shambles .
The Arvizo trial itself was a relative bargain , costing a little more than £ 18 million in legal bills .
But the damage to his career , already in trouble before the charges , was incalculable .
After the Arvizo trial , a Bahraini sheikh allowed Jackson to stay in his palace , underwriting his lavish lifestyle .
But a few years later , the prince sued his former guest , demanding repayment for his hospitality .
Jackson claimed he thought it had been a gift .
Roger Friedman , a TV journalist , said : ‘ For one year , the prince underwrote Jackson ’s life in Bahrain – everything including accommodation , guests , security and transportation .
And what did Jackson do ?
He left for Japan and then Ireland .
He took the money and moonwalked right out the door .
This is the real Michael Jackson .
He has never returned a phone call from the prince since he left Bahrain . ’
Although Jackson settled with the sheikh on the eve of the trial that would have aired his financial dirty laundry , the settlement only put him that much deeper into the hole .
A hole that kept getting bigger , but that was guaranteed by Jackson ’s half ownership of the copyrights to The Beatles catalogue .
He owned them in a joint venture with record company Sony , which have kept him from bankruptcy .
‘ Jackson is in hock to Sony for hundreds of millions , ’ a source told me a couple of months ago .
‘ No bank will give him any money so Sony have been paying his bills .
‘ The trouble is that he has n’t been meeting his obligations .
Sony have been in a position for more than a year where it can repossess Michael ’s share of the [ Beatles ] catalogue .
That ’s always been Sony ’s dream scenario , full ownership .
‘ But they do n’t want to do it as they ’re afraid of a backlash from his fans .
Their nightmare is an organised ' boycott Sony ' movement worldwide , which could prove hugely costly .
It is the only thing standing between Michael and bankruptcy . ’
Legacy : Michael Jackson wanted to ensure the future of his children by leaving them 200 unpublished songs
The source aid at the time that the scheduled London concerts would n’t clear Jackson ’s debts – estimated at almost £ 242 million – but they would allow him to get them under control and get him out of default with Sony .
According to two sources in Jackson ’s camp , the singer put in place a contingency plan to ensure his children would be well taken care of in the event of bankruptcy .
‘ He has as many as 200 unpublished songs that he is planning to leave behind for his children when he dies .
They ca n’t be touched by the creditors , but they could be worth as much as £ 60 million that will ensure his kids a comfortable existence no matter what happens , ’ one of his collaborators revealed .
But for the circle of handlers who surrounded Jackson during his final years , their golden goose could not be allowed to run dry .
Bankruptcy was not an option .
These , after all , were not the handlers who had seen him through the aftermath of the Arvizo trial and who had been protecting his fragile emotional health to the best of their ability .
They were gone , and a new set of advisers was in place .
The clearout had apparently been engineered by his children ’s nanny , Grace Rwaramba , who was gaining considerable influence over Jackson and his affairs and has been described as the ‘ queen bee ’ by those around Jackson .
Rwaramba had ties to the black militant organisation , the Nation of Islam , and its controversial leader , Louis Farrakhan , whom she enlisted for help in running Jackson ’s affairs .
Before long , the Nation was supplying Jackson ’s security detail and Farrakhan ’s son- in - law , Leonard Muhammad , was appointed as Jackson ’s business manager , though his role has lessened significantly in recent years .
In late 2008 , a shadowy figure who called himself Dr Tohme Tohme suddenly emerged as Jackson ’s ‘ official spokesman ’ .
Tohme has been alternately described as a Saudi Arabian billionaire and an orthopaedic surgeon , but he is actually a Lebanese businessman who does not have a medical licence .
At one point , Tohme claimed he was an ambassador at large for Senegal , but the Senegalese embassy said they had never heard of him .
Misguided : Michael Jackson showed no sign of understanding why anyone might be legitimately concerned about him sharing a bed with young boys
Tohme ’s own ties to the Nation of Islam came to light in March 2009 , when New York auctioneer Darren Julien was conducting an auction of Michael Jackson memorabilia .
Julien filed an affidavit in Los Angeles Superior Court that month in which he described a meeting he had with Tohme ’s business partner , James R. Weller .
According to Julien ’s account , ‘ Weller said if we refused to postpone [ the auction ] , we would be in danger from ' Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam ; those people are very protective of Michael ' .
He told us that Dr Tohme and Michael Jackson wanted to give the message to us that ' our lives are at stake and there will be bloodshed ' . ’
A month after these alleged threats , Tohme accompanied Jackson to a meeting at a Las Vegas hotel with Randy Phillips , chief executive of the AEG Group , to finalise plans for Jackson ’s return to the concert stage .
Jackson ’s handlers had twice before said no to Phillips .
This time , with Tohme acting as his confidant , Jackson left the room agreeing to perform ten concerts at the O2 .
Before long , however , ten concerts had turned into 50 and the potential revenues had skyrocketed .
‘ The vultures who were pulling his strings somehow managed to put this concert extravaganza together behind his back , then presented it to him as a fait accompli , ’ said one aide .
‘ The money was just unbelievable and all his financial people were telling him he was facing bankruptcy .
But Michael still resisted .
He did n’t think he could pull it off . ’
Eventually , they wore him down , the aide explained , but not with the money argument .
‘ They told him that this would be the greatest comeback the world had ever known .
That ’s what convinced him .
He thought if he could emerge triumphantly from the success of these concerts , he could be the King again . ’
The financial details of the O2 concerts are still murky , though various sources have revealed that Jackson was paid as much as £ 10 million in advance , most of which went to the middlemen .
But Jackson could have received as much as £ 100 million had the concerts gone ahead .
It is worth noting that the O2 Arena has the most sophisticated lip synching technology in the world – a particular attraction for a singer who can no longer sing .
Had , by some miracle , the concerts gone ahead , Jackson ’s personal contribution could have been limited to just 13 minutes for each performance .
The rest was to have been choreography and lights .
‘ We knew it was a disaster waiting to happen , ’ said one aide .
‘ I do n’t think anybody predicted it would actually kill him but nobody believed he would end up performing . ’
Their doubts were underscored when Jackson collapsed during only his second rehearsal .
Hidden life :
It was ' clear Michael Jackson was gay ' but he married twice , firstly to Lisa Marie Presley , above
‘ Collapse might be overstating it , ’ said the aide .
‘ He needed medical attention and could n’t go on .
I ’m not sure what caused it . ’
Meanwhile , everybody around him noticed that Jackson had lost an astonishing amount of weight in recent months .
His medical team even believed he was anorexic .
‘ He goes days at a time hardly eating a thing and at one point his doctor was asking people if he had been throwing up after meals , ’ one staff member told me in May .
‘ He suspected bulimia but when we said he hardly eats any meals , the doc thought it was probably anorexia .
He seemed alarmed and at one point said , ' People die from that all the time .
You ’ve got to get him to eat . '’
Indeed , one known consequence of anorexia is cardiac arrest .
After spotting him leave one rehearsal , Fox News reported that ‘ Michael Jackson ’s skeletal physique is so bad that he might not be able to moonwalk any more ’ .
On May 20 this year , AEG suddenly announced that the first London shows had been delayed for five days while the remainder had been pushed back until March 2010 .
At the time , they denied that the postponements were health - related , explaining that they needed more time to mount the technically complex production , though scepticism immediately erupted .
It was well placed .
Behind the scenes , Jackson was in rapid decline .
According to a member of his staff , he was ‘ terrified ’ at the prospect of the London concerts .
‘ He was n’t eating , he was n’t sleeping and , when he did sleep , he had nightmares that he was going to be murdered .
He was deeply worried that he was going to disappoint his fans .
He even said something that made me briefly think he was suicidal .
He said he thought he ’d die before doing the London concerts .
‘ He said he was worried that he was going to end up like Elvis .
He was always comparing himself to Elvis , but there was something in his tone that made me think that he wanted to die , he was tired of life .
He gave up .
His voice and dance moves were n’t there any more .
I think maybe he wanted to die rather than embarrass himself on stage . ’
The most obvious comparison between the King of Pop and the King of Rock ’n ’
Roll was their prescription drug habits , which in Jackson ’s case had significantly intensified in his final months .
‘ He is surrounded by enablers , ’ said one aide .
‘ We should be stopping him before he kills himself , but we just sit by and watch him medicate himself into oblivion . ’
Jackson could count on an array of doctors to write him prescriptions without asking too many questions if he complained of ‘ pain ’ .
He was particularly fond of OxyContin , nicknamed ‘ Hillbilly heroin ’ , which gave an instant high , although he did not take it on a daily basis .
According to the aide , painkillers are not the only drugs Jackson took .
Performer : Michael Jackson was unable to dance and sing like he once could due to his illnesses
‘ He pops Demerol and morphine , sure , apparently going back to the time in 1984 when he burned himself during the Pepsi commercial , but there ’s also some kind of psychiatric medication .
One of his brothers once told me he was diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was younger , so it may be to treat that . ’
His aides were n’t the only ones who recognised that a 50 - concert run was foolhardy .
In May , Jackson himself reportedly addressed fans as he left his Burbank rehearsal studio .
‘ Thank you for your love and support , ’ he told them .
‘ I want you guys to know I love you very much .
' I do n’t know how I ’m going to do 50 shows .
I ’m not a big eater .
I need to put some weight on .
I ’m really angry with them booking me up to do 50 shows .
I only wanted to do ten . ’
One of his former employees was particularly struck by Jackson ’s wording that day .
‘ The way he was talking , it ’s like he ’s not in control over his own life any more , ’ she told me earlier this month .
‘ It sounds like somebody else is pulling his strings and telling him what to do .
Someone wants him dead .
' They keep feeding him pills like candy .
They are trying to push him over the edge .
He needs serious help .
The people around him will kill him . ’
As the London concerts approached , something was clearly wrong .
Jackson had vowed to travel to England at least eight weeks before his first shows , but he kept putting it off .
‘ To be honest , I never thought Michael would set foot on a concert stage ever again , ’ said one aide , choking back tears on the evening of his death .
‘ This was not only predictable , this was inevitable . ’
On June 21 , Jackson told my contact that he wanted to die .
He said that he did n’t have what it would take to perform any more because he had lost his voice and dance moves .
‘ It ’s not working out , ’ Jackson said .
‘ I ’m better off dead .
I do n’t have anywhere left to turn .
I ’m done . ’
Michael ’s closest confidante told me just two hours after he died that ‘ Michael was tired of living .
He was a complete wreck for years and now he can finally be in a better place .
People around him fed him drugs to keep him on their side .
They should be held accountable . ’
Michael Jackson was undoubtedly a deeply troubled and lonely man .
Throughout my investigation , I was torn between compassion and anger , sorrow and empathy .
Even his legacy is problematic .
As I have already revealed , he has bequeathed up to 200 original songs to his three children , Prince Michael , aged 12 , Paris Katherine , 11 , and Prince Michael II ( also known as Blanket ) , seven .
It is a wonderful gift .
Yet I can reveal that his will , not as yet made public , demands that the three of them remain with Jackson ’s 79 - year - old mother Katherine in California .
It promises an ugly row .
Ex-wife Deborah
Rowe , the mother of the eldest two , has already made it clear to her legal team that she wants her children in her custody , immediately .
The mother of the third child has never been identified .
I fully expect that it will emerge that the children had a ‘ test tube ’ conception , a claim already made by Deborah Rowe .
Michael Jackson may very well have been the most talented performer of his generation , but for 15 years that fact has been lost to a generation who may remember him only as a grotesque caricature who liked to share his bed with little boys .
Now that he ’s gone , maybe it ’s time to shelve the suspicions and appreciate the music .
There is an old saying that two heads are better than one .
This saying received empirical support in social psychology in the 1920s , when a series of studies showed that groups were more accurate than their individual members .
In an early demonstration of the phenomenon , for example , Columbia University ’s Hazel Knight asked students to estimate the temperature in a classroom .
When the estimates were averaged together , the resulting group answer was more accurate than the estimate of a typical member .
Early authors found this surprising and attributed it to some mysterious group property .
Eventually , however , it was recognized as a product of statistics :
Using a large sample of imperfect estimates tends to cancel out extreme errors and converge on the truth .
Subsequent research in forecasting demonstrated the power of averaging compared to more sophisticated statistical methods of combination .
The power and simplicity of averaging was summed up in the title of James Surowiecki ’s 2004 best - selling book , “ The Wisdom of Crowds . ”
In a fascinating new article in Psychological Science , Stefan Herzog and Ralph Hertwig turned the old aphorism on its head :
One head can be nearly as good as two .
Herzog and Hertwig had participants make estimates about quantitative values they did not know with certainty — specifically , dates in history .
They then had participants make second estimates .
Could this “ crowd in the mind ” help improve judgments ?
The answer is yes , and the literature on the wisdom of crowds helps us understand why .
Crowds , of course , are not always wise .
They are more likely to be wise when two principles are followed .
The first principle is that groups should be composed of people with knowledge relevant to a topic .
The second principle is that the group needs to hold diverse perspectives and bring different knowledge to bear on a topic .
Valuing diversity has become a truism , but it is interesting to consider exactly how diversity improves decision making .
People inevitably make errors .
The question is whether people make similar errors , in which case individuals are interchangeable and there is little benefit gained from a crowd ; or whether people make different errors , in which case their errors will often cancel out .
Differences in perspective are created both through who is in the group — when people have different experiences , training , and judgment models — and through process — when ideas are formed and expressed independently from the ideas of others .
Interestingly , the benefits of diversity are so strong that one can choose group members that differ pretty widely in their ability and still gain — as long as there is added diversity .
Herzog and Hertwig used the insights of the “ wisdom of crowd ” perspective to make one head nearly as good as two .
After participants made their first guesses at the dates of historical events , they then made a second estimate using one of two methods .
In one condition , participants simply gave a second estimate .
This condition did little to increase either knowledge or diversity .
In the second condition , participants were given detailed directions for making their follow - up guess : “ First , assume that your first estimate is off the mark .
Second , think about a few reasons why that could be .
Which assumptions and considerations could have been wrong ?
Third , what do these new considerations imply ?...
Fourth , based on this new perspective , make a second , alternative estimate . ”
When the participants used the more involved method , the average was significantly more accurate than the first estimate .
The “ crowd within ” achieved about half the accuracy gains that would have been achieved by averaging with a second person .
Herzog and Hertwig called their more involved process “ dialectical bootstrapping . ”
You can pull yourself up by your own proverbial bootstraps by assuming that you are wrong , providing a second estimate based on a search for new evidence , and then averaging the two estimates .
( Interestingly , in Herzog and Hertwig 's studies , bootstrapping did not lead to second estimates that were more accurate than the first .
The benefit of dialectical bootstrapping was only realized when the first and second estimates were averaged together .
Compared to simply providing a second judgment , dialectical bootstrapping creates diversity — it leads to estimates that are more likely to have offsetting errors . )
Although we each have the ability to generate multiple perspectives , we typically become enamored of only one way of approaching a problem — with its accompanying embrace of the truth and error .
We tend to stop on the first pass .
Dialectical bootstrapping allows us to tap more perspectives that are already inside our own heads .
A key insight from Herzog and Hertwig ’s study is that we each carry around our own crowd , our own diverse board of advisors , but we gain their wisdom only if we run a good board meeting .
A good board meeting makes sure that there is diversity at the table and that different perspectives are not just voiced , but incorporated into a final decision .
Herzog and Hertwig have designed a process for a good board meeting — in the privacy of your own mind .

An IBM researcher has solved a complicated mathematical problem that has confounded scientists since the invention of public - key encryption several decades ago .
The breakthrough , called " privacy homomorphism , " or " fully homomorphic encryption , " makes possible the deep and unlimited analysis of encrypted information -- data that has been intentionally scrambled -- without sacrificing confidentiality .
Craig Gentry uses a mathematical object called an " ideal lattice " to let people fully interact with encrypted data in ways previously thought impossible .
With the breakthrough , computer vendors storing the confidential , electronic data of others will be able to fully analyze data on their clients ' behalf without expensive interaction with the client , and without seeing any of the private data .
With Gentry 's technique , the analysis of encrypted information can yield the same detailed results as if the original data was fully visible to all .
Potential applications include enabling filters to identify spam , even in encrypted email , or protecting information contained in electronic medical records .
The breakthrough might also one day enable computer users to retrieve information from a search engine with more confidentiality .
" Fully homomorphic encryption is a bit like enabling a layperson to perform flawless neurosurgery while blindfolded , and without later remembering the episode , " says IBM Research 's Charles Lickel .
" We believe this breakthrough will enable businesses to make more informed decisions , based on more studied analysis , without compromising privacy .
We also think that the lattice approach holds potential for helping to solve additional cryptography challenges in the future . "
Ron Rivest and Leonard Adleman , along with Michael Dertouzos , introduced and struggled with the notion of fully homomorphic encryption approximately 30 years ago .
Although advances through the years offered partial solutions to this problem , a full solution that achieves all the desired properties of homomorphic encryption did not exist until now .

How a dead serious novel became the nightmare satire of Strangelove
There seemed to be a tacit agreement the story would not be at all funny .
Not now .
— Peter George , Two Hours to Doom ( aka Red Alert )
Dated November 4 , 1961 , the letter addressed to the novelist Peter George seemed decidedly odd coming from a man who had already directed the likes of Laurence Olivier , Kirk Douglas , and James Mason .
It was handwritten , for starters — no secretary had typed it up — and it evinced , in the words of George ’s son , a certain “ touching modesty ” : “ First off let me tell you who I am , ” it began .
“ I am a film director ( ‘ Paths of Glory , ’ ‘ Spartacus , ’ ‘ Lolita ’ ) .
I ’ve been in England for over a year and returned to New York only last week expecting to contact you here . ”
Stanley Kubrick then went on to explain that he had become interested in “ the nuclear situation ” and was searching for the right material to adapt for a film : “ I am earnestly looking for a story in those areas and your book came VERY CLOSE , ” he told George .
Being Kubrick , however , he also could n’t help offering some criticisms of the book that he felt made it “ unusable . ”
One of these , ironically , was George ’s plot point about a cluster of Russian “ hydrogen devices ” hidden in the Urals , designed to automatically detonate should the USSR become the victim of a nuclear attack — what would so memorably become “ the Doomsday Device ” in Kubrick ’s 1964 masterpiece , Dr. Strangelove or : How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb .
Less than two months after that letter , George and Kubrick were working on the screenplay for a film .
It is by now a legendary anecdote : Stanley Kubrick began adapting George ’s dead - serious nuclear thriller Two Hours to Doom ( released as Red Alert in the U.S. ) and , suddenly struck by the ridiculousness of it all , transformed it into his seminal nightmare satire .
So it may come as a surprise to anyone reading George ’s novel today to discover just how much it actually resembles Dr. Strangelove — how much of the structure , incident , and character of the book has survived in the film .
The similarities — and , naturally , the differences — offer a telling look at why Strangelove , currently playing ( in a restored print ) at Film Forum in New York , refuses to age , why its ability to provoke simultaneous laughter and terror remains undiminished , 45 years after its initial release .
Kubrick ’s film closely follows George ’s intercutting between the Pentagon , the Air Force base where the fighters originated , and the one plane that manages to finally make it through the Soviet defenses .
In the novel , Brigadier General Quinten ( Jack D. Ripper in the film ) , claiming that the U.S. is in a “ shooting war , ” seals off the Sonora Strategic Air Command base and orders his bombers to their targets in the USSR .
In the Pentagon , the commander of SAC , General Franklin ( Col. Buck Turgidson in the film ) , humiliated by this unexplained decision by one of his officers , has to confront the president about what has happened .
As he does so , however , the other generals begin to think that the best course of action may be to follow up Quinten ’s offensive with full force .
The president , worried both about the morality of this action and the fact that the Soviets may have a Doomsday Device , decides to invite the Russian ambassador into the War Room and to get the Soviet premier on the phone , to try and convince him that the attack was unintentional , and to work together to either recall or shoot down the incoming U.S. planes .
Back at Sonora , Quinten ’s exec , Major Paul Howard ( Mandrake in the film ) , confronts Quinten over his actions and tries to get the recall code ( which is later revealed , as in the film , to be a combination of the first letters of “ Peace On Earth " ) to stop the fighters — as the U.S. military attacks the base .
Meanwhile , the crew of the Alabama Angel ( Leper Colony in the film ) , convinced that the U.S. has been the victim of a horrifying nuclear attack , go about the business of getting past Russian air defenses to deliver their grim payload .
Needless to say , the novel does n’t end with Dr. Strangelove passionately talking about filling up mineshafts with desirable females to help re-populate the earth , nor does it feature a cowboy riding a nuke .
Instead , the badly damaged Alabama Angel misses its target and winds up bombing an uninhabited stretch of land , but not before the president offers up Atlantic City as a sacrificial lamb to the Soviets to make up for the presumed loss of life on the other side .
The acute tension of the novel is almost unbearable , and Kubrick knew good story structure when he saw it .
But while George , himself a former RAF officer , presents a military apparatus that is functioning relatively smoothly , Kubrick seems interested in the exact opposite , highlighting the ways in which communication breaks down and causes chaos .
Much of the humor of Strangelove is built around nearly abortive phone calls — from the one that informs Turgidson of Ripper ’s nuclear offensive during a bathroom break to President Muffley ’s disastrous attempts to talk to a drunken Russian premier ( “ Hello , Dmitri ?
Listen , I can't hear too well , do you suppose you could turn the music down just a little ? ” ) to Mandrake ’s inability to find some loose change for a frantic , planet - saving call to the White House .
As Robert Kolker has observed in his study of American film , A Cinema of Loneliness :
There is no interrelationship between these locations , no communication .
Each operates on its own .
Even within these areas , no one speaks to another , only to himself .
No one listens , no one responds …
In fact [ Strangelove ] is a film about language that creates its own destruction , its own death , and the death of the world .
Kubrick had always been fascinated by communication breakdown ( his next film , 2001 : A Space Odyssey , would explore it further ) .
But he was also fascinated by the paradoxes of language itself .
Indeed , it was in part the language of modern warfare that prompted him to take the comedic route in his film .
“ Almost Impossible to Take It Seriously ”
After their initial drafts , Kubrick and his producing partner James B. Harris , with whom he had made The Killing , Paths of Glory , and Lolita , workshopped the script ( then called The Delicate Balance of Terror ) in New York .
“ They ’d stay up late into the night cracking up over it , overcome by their impulse towards gallows humor , ” says Mick Broderick , the author of Nuclear Movies and an extensive forthcoming study of Strangelove .
Harris would soon leave to forge his own directorial career ( his admirably tense 1965 directorial debut , The Bedford Incident , concerns a confrontation between an American destroyer and a Soviet submarine ) .
But when Kubrick later called his former partner to tell him that he had decided to turn Delicate Balance into an actual comedy , Harris was skeptical , to say the least .
“ He thought , ‘ The kid ’s gonna destroy his career ! ’ ” says Broderick .
The absurd hilarity of the situation had never quite stopped haunting the director , as he and George continued to work on the film .
It was n’t so much the premise of the Red Alert story as everything Kubrick was learning about the thinking behind thermonuclear strategy .
The director , even then notorious for thorough research , had become friendly with a number of scientists and thinkers on the subject , some with George ’s help , including the notorious RAND strategist Herman Kahn , who would talk with a straight face about “ megadeaths , ” a word he had coined in the 1950s to describe one million deaths .
As Kubrick told Joseph Heller :
Incongruity is certainly one of the sources of laughter — the incongruity of sitting in a room talking to somebody who has a big chart on the wall that says “ tragic but distinguishable postwar environments ” and that says “ one to ten million killed . ”
… There is something so absurd and unreal about what you ’re talking about that it ’s almost impossible to take it seriously .
But perhaps Terry Southern put it best .
In a never published article he wrote for Esquire at the time , the American novelist who would become Kubrick ’s next collaborator on the project wrote :
Sophisticated nuclear strategists also speak a language all their own .
They are gradually evolving a terminology which is free of moral , or even human , connotation .
They do not , for example , use any form of the word attack , but use instead the term preempt — which of course sounds like something in a bridge game rather than what it is .
A pioneer of New Journalism and an inspiration for the Beats , Southern was an expert in the alienating ways of language .
( A memoir of the Strangelove production he wrote for Grand Street in 1994 is full of hilarious instances of communication breakdown , most notably in its portrait of a newly arrived Slim Pickens and the film ’s British production manager Victor Lyndon being unable to understand each other . )
He was also familiar with the dialogue required in all of the film ’s various environments :
As a native - born Texan , he could write for Pickens ’s character Captain “ King ” Kong ; as a veteran of WWII , he understood not only military - speak , but also the curious interservice rivalries in the U.S. armed forces .
He could even write some spot - on stiff - upper - lip RAF dialogue , thanks to his familiarity with the world of British intellectuals .
“ The film had become all about employing paradoxes , inconsistencies about postures and rhetoric , ” Broderick says .
“ It was Kubrick ’s genius to take that leap of faith , but neither he nor Peter George had the craft to make it work .
They had to take something that was moderately amusing into side - splitting hilarity .
That ’s where Terry Southern came in . ”
Southern was hired when the cameras were already rolling , and worked on the script for a relatively brief period ( he was technically employed only from November 16 to December 28 , 1962 ) , often working in the back of Kubrick ’s Bentley , which had been outfitted with fold - out writing desks and lamps , during the hourlong drive to the film ’s Shepperton Studios set .
His contributions turned what had been a blunt - edged comedy into something far more polished and specific .
“ Terry had a refined sense of humor , ” recalls his son , Nile Southern .
“ He was well practiced at playing it straight .
… He understood that in comedy , you had to keep things credible , otherwise the whole thing falls apart . ”
“ The See - Saw of Emotion ”
Indeed , on the page , Strangelove ’s humor is surprisingly subtle .
Throughout the first half of the film , most scenes dance teasingly on the edge of comedy , with overtly funny elements only appearing briefly .
Amazingly , one can see the embryonic hints of this approach even in Red Alert itself .
Consider this scene , when Howard , having heard normal local broadcasting on the radio and become convinced that the attack on the USSR is not a retaliatory strike , marches into the office of Quinten , who has just launched World War III :
“ We ’ve learned a lot about Communism and its adherents [ Quinten says ] .
We also know we are liable to be attacked at any time .
Alright , suppose a sudden attack knocked out all our bases except for this one .
Suppose someone in high places knows the general code group of the day .
Someone who is a Communist , or a fellow traveler . ”
“ That is n’t even a possibility , ” Howard said angrily .
“ You ’re wrong , Paul .
It is a possibility .
In a world which can construct an H - bomb and put up its own artificial moons , even contemplate a break - out into space , nothing is impossible .
Nothing .
Oh , I agree the possibility is very slight , but it exists .
Anyway , suppose things happened as I said . ”
There ’s a natural opportunity for comedy there at the end — one that George certainly does not take .
He almost takes it two pages later , when Howard tells Quinten that “ morally , we ’re already in the wrong , ” and his superior interrupts , “ I ’d argue that .
But let it go for the moment . ”
Such pivots were exactly what Kubrick was looking for : brief , subtle instances of humor that could send a scene spinning in a different direction .
In his jettisoned Esquire article , Southern offers a quote from Kubrick that is quite telling as to how the director wanted the humor deployed throughout his film : “ I think that surprise … whether it occurs in love , war , business , or what have you , produces the greatest effect of any single element .
It gives the added momentum to the sort of see - saw of emotion from one position to another , and you get this extra push of thrill and discovery .
… People do n’t like to be told anything — I mean I do n’t think they even like to be told their pants are open . ”
What also helped was that Kubrick never quite abandoned the idea of making a political thriller .
Strangelove stands poised between two impulses that were emerging during the late ’ 50s and ’60s .
“ American society was starting to become more self critically aware , ” says Broderick .
“ The satirical impulse had begun to emerge , through the work of Jules Feiffer , MAD magazine , and other mainstream comics lampooning Eisenhower . ”
At the same time , however , political dramas and thrillers had begun confronting the nation ’s sacred political institutions , in particular the military - industrial complex : Strangelove may be a comedy , but it also stands with works like Seven Days in May , The Manchurian Candidate , The Best Man , and Fail - Safe ( its curious dramatic doppelgänger , based on a novel whose authors were sued by George and Kubrick for its almost absurd similarities to Red Alert ) .
It could be argued that Red Alert never really went away .
It ’s still there , hiding within the comedy of Strangelove — one could probably remove most of the comic bits from the first half of Kubrick ’s film and still be left with a suspenseful drama about the nuclear age .
Maybe that ’s because , even as he was laughing at the nuclear age , Kubrick held on to his fears .
Broderick discovered that throughout 1961 and 1962 , the director , convinced that war was inevitable , had begun making plans to move his family and his work to Australia : a real - life version of Strangelove and his mineshafts .
“ He would cite the Jews who saw the Holocaust coming and did n’t move out of Germany , ” says Broderick .
“ He honestly felt that he’d be able to move to Australia and continue making films there in the aftermath of a nuclear war . ”
After living through the Cuban Missile Crisis , however , he changed his mind , deciding that Strangelove would become his response to the absurd horrors of nuclear war .
Maybe , put another way , Kubrick finally found a way to stop worrying and love the bomb .
Civil unions for both heterosexual and same - sex couples would be an equal system , but this compromise appears unlikely at the current time .
Few heterosexual couples would give up their current civil marriage for a civil union .
While some states would recognize civil unions for all , others would not , causing legal problems for New York couples .
Advocates of same - sex marriage do n’t seem in favor of such a compromise either .
According to the last census , there are an estimated 50,000 households headed by same - sex couples in New York , many who were married in other states .
Those marriages are recognized by New York courts as valid .
As a result , we have same - sex marriage for some in New York ( albeit performed out of state ) and no marriage at all for other same - sex couples .
Any change in the New York law can , and must , balance equality while making sure that religious institutions remain free to choose whether to marry same - sex couples .
By following the example of Connecticut and Vermont , which included protections for religious institutions when they recently legalized same - sex marriage , we can ensure that churches are not forced to consecrate marriages they do not endorse .
This will require a strong liberty clause allowing religious institutions to opt out of solemnizing same - sex marriage , which also applies to the provision of services and programs at religiously affiliated institutions .
Many civil marriages are not considered “ holy matrimony ” by religious institutions because they do not conform to the rules of the religious institution .
Those marriages have not challenged religious liberty .
We must see that civil marriage , which has always been separate from religious marriage , will remain so .
But most important , gays and lesbians have suffered too long from legal discrimination , social marginalization and even violence .
They are entitled to clear recognition of their equal status as citizens of a country that is founded on the principle that we are all inherently worthy .
By delivering a clear message that same - sex couples can no longer be treated as separate and unequal in New York , we will also reduce discrimination in everyday life .
We will all be better for that .

1 ASIMO : the humanoid robot
ASIMO is a humanoid robot created by Honda .
Standing at 130 centimeters and weighing 54 kilograms , the robot resembles a small astronaut wearing a backpack , and can walk on two feet in a manner resembling human locomotion at up to 6 km/h ( 3.7 mph ) .
ASIMO was created at Honda ’s Research & Development Wako Fundamental Technical Research Center in Japan .
It is the current model in a line of eleven which began in 1986 with E0 .
Officially , the name is an acronym for “ Advanced Step in Innovative MObility ” .
As of 2002 , there were 20 ASIMO units in existence .
Each one costs $ 1 million to manufacture , and some units are available to be hired out for $ 150,000 per month .
With 2000 ’s ASIMO model Honda added many features , labelled “ Intelligence Technology ” , that enable ASIMO to interact better with humans .
These features fall under 5 categories :
Recognition of moving objects
Using the visual information captured by the camera mounted in its head , ASIMO can detect the movements of multiple objects , assessing distance and direction .
Common applications this feature would serve include : the ability to follow the movements of people with its camera , to follow a person , or greet a person when he or she approaches .

Common applications this feature would serve include : the ability to follow the movements of people with its camera , to follow a person , or greet a person when he or she approaches .
Recognition of postures and gestures
ASIMO can also interpret the positioning and movement of a hand , recognizing postures and gestures .
Because of this ASIMO can react and be directed not only to voice commands , but also to the natural movements of human beings .
This enables it to , for example , recognize when a handshake is offered or when a person waves and respond accordingly .
It can also recognize movement directions such as pointing .

Environment recognition
ASIMO can recognize the objects and terrain of its environment and act in a way that is safe for both itself and nearby humans .
For example , recognizing potential hazards such as stairs , and by stopping and starting to avoid hitting humans or other moving objects .

Distinguishing sounds
ASIMO ’s ability to identify the source of sounds has been improved , and it can distinguish between voices and other sounds .
It can respond to its name , face people when being spoken to , and recognize sudden , unusual sounds such as that of a falling object or a collision , and face in that direction .

Facial recognition
ASIMO has the ability to recognize faces , even when ASIMO or the human being is moving .
It can individually recognize approximately 10 different faces .
Once they are registered it can address them by name .
2 Albert Hubo : an “ Einstein ” Robot
Albert HUBO is an android robot .
It is composed of a head , which takes after Dr. Albert Einstein , and HUBO ’s body .
The development period took about 3 months , and it had been finished at November , 2005 .
The head part was developed by Hanson - Robotics .
Its skin is a special metarial , Frubber , which oftenly be used at Hollywood .
The head has 35 joints , so it can impersonate various facial expressions using independent movements of eyes and lips .
It has 2 CCD cameras to do vision recognition .
Also , the body of Albert HUBO can perform all the HUBO ’s performances , so it is possible to express more natural feature and movements .
In the body , there are lithium polymer batteries wich can get about 2 and half hours of the operating time .
By using remote network , it is possible to access the Albert HUBO from an external computer .
Albert HUBO was announced first at 2005 APEC Summit in Pusan , Korea .
It was praised from many World leaders , such as the USA president , the Japanese Prime Minister and so on .
3 Stanley : the autonomous vehicle
Stanley is an autonomous vehicle created by Stanford University ’s Stanford Racing Team .
It is a standard Volkswagen Touareg ( an SUV ) modified to be driven by onboard computers .
It competed in , and won , the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge , earning the Stanford Racing Team the 2 million dollar prize , the largest prize money in robotic history .
The sensors used by Stanley include five LIDAR laser - ranging units , a pair of RADAR units , a stereo camera , and a single - lens camera .
Position sensing was provided by a GPS receiver , a GPS compass , an inertial guidance system , and wheel odometry information provided by the Touareg ’s internal CAN bus .
Computing was provided by six low - power Intel Pentium M based computers running various incarnations of the Linux operating system .
Stanley was characterized by a machine learning based approach to obstacle detection .
Data from the LIDARs was fused with images from the vision system to perform more distant look - ahead .
If a path of drivable terrain could not be detected for at least 40 meters in front of the vehicle , speed was decreased and the LIDARs used to locate a safe passage .
Also , Stanley drove by recording how a human drove the car through the desert , then assigning an accuracy value to each bit of data generated by its slew of sensors .
After this modification was made , it began to speed at 45 mph down roads which were crisscrossed by shadows of trees .
Before it started assigning accuracy values to its data , it would have shied away from the road – it would have been perceived as being crisscrossed with ditches , not shadows .
4 BigDog : the robotic mule
BigDog is a quadruped robot created in 2005 by Boston Dynamics .
BigDog is funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in the hopes that it will be able to serve as a robotic pack mule to accompany soldiers in terrain too rough for vehicles .
BigDog is a meter long , 0.7 meters tall , and weighs 75 kilograms .
It is currently capable of traversing difficult terrain at 5.3 kilometers per hour , carry a 54 kilogram load , and climb a 35 degree incline .
5 RiSE : the climbing robot
RiSE is a small six - legged robot that climbs vertical terrain such as walls , trees and fences .
RiSE ’s feet have claws , micro-claws or sticky material , depending on the climbing surface .
RiSE changes posture to conform to the curvature of the climbing surface and a fixed tail helps RiSE balance on steep ascents .
RiSE is about 0.25 m long , weighs 2 kg , and travels 0.3 m/s .
Each of RiSE ’s six legs is powered by two electric motors .
An onboard computer controls leg motion , manages communications , and services a variety of sensors .
The sensors include an inertial measurement unit , joint position sensors for each leg , leg strain sensors and foot contact sensors .
Future versions of RiSE will use dry adhesion to climb sheer vertical surfaces such as glass and metal .
RiSE is being developed in conjunction with researchers at University of Pennsylvania , Carnegie Mellon , Berkeley , Stanford , and Lewis and Clark University .
RiSE is funded by the DARPA Defense Sciences Office .
6 QRIO : the dancing robot
QRIO ( “ Quest for cuRIOsity ” ) is a bipedal humanoid entertainment robot marketed and sold by Sony to follow up on the success of its AIBO toy .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- General Motors filed for bankruptcy protection early Monday , a move once viewed as unthinkable that became inevitable after years of losses and market share declines capped by a dramatic plunge in sales in recent months .
The bankruptcy is likely to lead to major changes and job cuts at the battered automaker .
But President Obama and GM CEO Fritz Henderson both promised that a more viable GM will emerge from bankruptcy .
In the end , even $ 19.4 billion in federal help was n't enough to keep the nation 's largest automaker out of bankruptcy .
The government will pour another $ 30 billion into GM to fund operations during its reorganization .
U.S. Judge Robert Gerber , the bankruptcy judge will oversee GM 's bankruptcy , ruled Monday that GM will have access to $ 15 billion in government funds immediately .
He will make a final ruling on bankruptcy financing approval on June 25 .
Taxpayers will end up with a 60 % stake in GM , with the union , its creditors and federal and provincial governments in Canada owning the remainder of the company .
Owners of GM cars should see little change as a result of the bankruptcy since warranties will still be honored .
But there will be plenty of pain caused by the bankruptcy and the company 's efforts to stem losses .
GM will shed its Pontiac , Saturn , Hummer and Saab brands and cut loose more than 2,000 of its 6,000 U.S. dealerships by next year .
That could result in more than 100,000 additional job losses if those dealerships are forced to close .
A dozen facilities were identified for closure .
Those plants employ most of the more than 20,000 U.S. workers GM intends to cut by the end of next year .
Assembly lines at a plant in Pontiac , Mich. , which make full - size pickup trucks , will be closed later this year .
A Wilmington , Del. - based facility that makes roadsters for the Pontiac and Saturn brands will also close later this year .
Three parts distribution warehouses are set to close at the end of this year , while five engine plants and a stamping plant are due to close in 2010 .
An additional stamping plant is set to close in 2011 .
Three more plants .
including assembly lines in Spring Hill , Tenn. , and Orion , Mich . , are set to be idled and put on stand by status in hopes for a rebound in sales that may never come .
Pain for retirees , investors
More than 650,000 retirees and their family members who depend on the company for health insurance will experience cutbacks in their coverage , although their pension benefits are unaffected for now .
Investors in $ 27 billion worth of GM bonds , including mutual funds and thousands of individual investors , will end up with new stock in a reorganized GM worth a fraction of their original investment .
Owners of current GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) shares , which closed at just 75 cents a share on Friday , will have their investments essentially wiped out .
Officials from the Obama administration and the United Auto Workers union both have said they hope to sell their stakes in GM as soon as possible , but it is likely that shares of the new GM will not be publicly traded for at least a year or two .
The bankruptcy filing led the New York Stock Exchange to announce it would no longer list GM shares after Monday .
It will also lead to the removal of GM as of June 8 from the Dow Jones industrial average , a distinction it has held since 1925 .
The company will be replaced in the Dow by technology giant Cisco Systems ( CSCO , Fortune 500 ) , Dow Jones said .
President Obama said Monday he was confident that the additional federal help was justified by the changes being made at GM .
" GM and its stakeholders have produced a viable , achievable plan that will give this iconic American company a chance to rise again , " he said .
" But GM ca n't put this plan into effect on its own .
Executing this plan will require a substantial amount of money that only a government can provide . "
Henderson , who took over for former CEO Rick Wagoner on March 30 , will continue running the company .
Henderson thanked Obama as well as the unions and creditors who had agreed to changes .
He vowed the company will not need additional help from the government beyond what it will receive during the bankruptcy process and added that the part of GM that emerges from bankruptcy will not be at risk of failure in the future .
" We understand there are no second chances , " he said .
" We wo n't need one . "
GM and the Treasury Department were able to get key concessions from the unions and major bondholders in the past two weeks .
Those deals paved the way for a cleaner bankruptcy process , one that a senior administration official said Sunday could allow GM to emerge from the bankruptcy process in only two to three months .
GM faced a deadline from the Treasury Department to come up with a plan to turnaround the company or file for bankruptcy by June 1 .
The company also owed its bondholders $ 1 billion in interest payments on June 1 , money it did not have available to pay .
According to GM 's bankruptcy filing , the company has assets of $ 82.3 billion , and liabilities of $ 172.8 billion .
That would make GM the fourth largest U.S. bankruptcy on record , according to Bankruptcydata.com , just behind the 2002 bankruptcy of telecom WorldCom .
Three of the largest bankruptcies in history - GM , Wall Street investment bank Lehman Brothers and savings and loan Washington Mutual , have occurred in the last nine months .
Plans for a ' new ' GM
GM will use the trip into bankruptcy court to shed plants , dealerships , debt and other liabilities it can no longer afford .
Emerging out of bankruptcy quickly will be a " new GM , " made up of the four brands that GM will keep in the U.S. market -- Chevrolet , Cadillac , GMC and Buick -- as well as many of its more successful overseas operations .
This is the same process that Chrysler LLC used in its bankruptcy process .
Chrysler filed for bankruptcy April 30 , and the judge in that case approved the creation of a new company that will be run by Italian automaker Fiat in a ruling Sunday .
GM , being a larger , more complicated and global company than Chrysler , is not expected to have its valuable units exit bankruptcy quite as quickly , though .
The new GM will have only $ 17 billion in debt , rather than the $ 54.4 billion it owed as of March 31 .
The unions ' new contracts with the company and GM 's underfunded pension funds will stay with the new company .
But for the turnaround to be successful , both outside experts and company officials agree there needs to be improvement in U.S. auto sales , which have fallen to a 26 - year low this year .
Sales plunge the final blow
GM has been hit harder than most of its competitors during the sales slump .
The company 's U.S. sales through April were down 45 % from a year ago , compared to a 37 % decline for the overall industry .
GM also faces tough competition from Toyota Motor ( TM ) and Ford Motor ( F , Fortune 500 ) , which are both in much stronger financial condition .
Even though Ford has reported years of losses as well , it had far more cash on hand than GM or Chrysler going into this crisis .
The same is true for Toyota , which reported a loss in its recently completed fiscal year .
GM 's decision to shed its weaker brands and dealers is expected to lead to further market share losses , which could result in the company giving up its long - time position as the largest automaker in terms of U.S. sales .
The company already lost the global sales title to Toyota last year , and it could soon fall behind Toyota and possibly Ford in the U.S. as well .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The White House on Tuesday dashed hopes that the federal government would help California overcome a mammoth budget crisis that has brought the state dangerously close to an economic meltdown , saying the state will have to solve the problem on its own .
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs during a press briefing at the White House , February 3 , 2009 .

“ It ’s obviously not an easy time for the state of California , ” White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told a briefing when asked if the administration would provide emergency financing for the state .
“ We ’ll continue to monitor the challenges that they have , but this budgetary problem unfortunately is one that they ’re going to have to solve , ” Gibbs said .
California ’s revenues are plunging amid recession , rising unemployment and the prolonged housing crisis , and the state is unable to borrow its way out of its immediate financial trouble by issuing debt because of its budget gap .
It will run out of cash within weeks if it does not balance its books , according to State Controller John Chiang , who estimated last week California was “ less than 50 days away from a meltdown of state government . ”
One potential rescuer has been the federal government , and for nearly a year California Treasurer Bill Lockyer has pressured the U.S. Congress and the president to help the state with debt markets .
While U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said this spring the administration was looking into assisting California and other states , it has yet to offer any help beyond that included for all states in the $ 787 billion economic stimulus plan passed in February .
“ Obviously many states throughout the country because of the slowdown in our economy find themselves with severe budgetary constraints , ” Gibbs said .
“ The president believed and addressed part of this in the recovery and reinvestment plan by ensuring the largest amount of fiscal relief that we ’ve seen move to states in the history of our country . ”
Gibbs said he did n’t “ know the degree to which we ’ve analyzed each of California ’s individual ( budget ) cuts . ”
This is not the first time a U.S. president has closed the federal wallet to a struggling state or city .
In 1975 the New York Daily News ran the headline “ Ford to city : drop dead , ” when then President Gerald Ford denied assistance to New York City that would have allowed the U.S. financial capital to sidestep filing for bankruptcy .
WASHINGTON’S REBUFF ADDS TO DEBT MARKET WOES
Standard & Poor ’s ratings agency on Monday put $ 67.1 billion of California ’s debt on alert for a possible ratings cut because the state may run out of cash by the end of July .
Dick Larkin , director of credit analysis at Herbert J. Sims & Co Inc in Iselin , New Jersey , predicted a downgrade .
“ To say they ’ve got big problems is an understatement .
The budget problems are too large for the rating agencies to be comfortable with single - A ratings on the state . ”
Washington ’s view toward California is one more reason to not hold the state ’s debt , said Tom Tarabicos , a financial adviser at Wells Fargo Financial Advisors Network in Roswell , Georgia .
“ We ’re selling every California bond we can , ” Tarabicos said .
“ We do n’t like them . ”
Instead , Tarabicos said he may buy into California ’s general obligation debt next year should its yields rise to reflect inflation and continued risk to the state ’s finances from ongoing economic weakness .
“ Sometime next year you ’ll be able to buy California GOs somewhere around 7 percent or 8 percent , ” Tarabicos said , referring to general obligation bonds , adding :
“ Nothing is going to change in that state , fiscally , over the next two or three years .
I just do n’t see anything positive coming out of there .
It ’s going to be dead for quite a while . ”

Bungie ’s president , Harold Ryan , and the writer and creative director for Halo 3 : ODST , Joseph Staten , talked about several things with the Seattle Times .
They covered Halo 3 : ODST , of course , but did n’t say much that we did n’t already know .
They did mention some interesting things about moving the studio’s offices and * gasp * Project Natal , though .
Bungie ’s current home in Kirkland , Washington , dubbed “ the Bunker ” , was renovated from a large hardware store , but the developer , with its 163 employees , has outgrown the space .
They ’ve even had to move some employees over to secondary offices as they ’ve grown .
Ryan says he ’s looking to relocate to a former Galleria multiplex theater in Bellevue .
The new building covers 80,000 square feet with 30 foot ceilings .
“ We ’re looking to hire as many great people as we can hire … we ’re increasing our capacity to do great games , ” Ryan explained .
He also commented on an early look Bungie had at Microsoft ’s Project Natal , a new motion - sensing camera for the Xbox 360 .
Ryan expressed excitement for the new product and the possibility of it being used in future Bungie games , like Halo : Reach , the Halo prequel slated for a Fall 2010 release .
He said , “ I absolutely think ‘ Reach ’ could be enabled with it . ”
It ’s far from a solid confirmation but it is exciting to think that the next full Halo title might take advantage of the Project Natal camera .

I have been playing music since I was 6 years old .
I started with classical piano , followed by bass and guitar .
Needless to say , my intense interest in music determined the kind of people I surrounded myself with .
Since I was born in Argentina and came to the States after highschool , I left a good bunch of musicians back there .
Good friends of mine .
For a good couple of years , the myth of Absolom took shape among us .
Partially influenced by heavy / death metal music , and genius intellects such as EA Poe and HP Lovecraft ; we created the entity Absolom ( a borrowed , distorted name )
The whole idea was to reach Absolom by means of jamming , as it was our belief that this entity could be brought among us with a musical search .
Last new years ( 2001/2002 ) I had the chance to go on vacation to Argentina .
As soon as I let them know that I was coming over , they started preparing a big party for New Year 's Eve .
I brought a couple of bottles of DXM ( Agent Lemon ) and some mushrooms .
My friend Max brought a bottle of GHB in liquid form .
We arrived at the party at my friend´s loft in the harbor area of Buenos Aires at around 1900 hours ( 7 pm ) .
There were lot of hugs and happiness as I reunited with my musical friends and I introduced my American friend Max to them .
The celebrations got started immediately with a good monster bong round with 50 hydro 50 hash .
The setting was fantastic and everybody was having a great time .
My friend J ( the host ) started serving chilled sangria for everyone .
We talked while people kept arriving and the crowd got bigger .
This of course was no problem since this loft is HUGE .
At around 9 pm , after 2 and a half glasses of sangria and a couple of more bowls , my friend L invited us with a nice hit of double stacked pink ecstasy ( tested as MDMA ) .
Around 15 minutes after poppin , Max proposed that we engaged in Roboflippin ( MDMA + DXM ) .
After measuring our doses carefully according to body weight ( we were shooting for a middle second plateau ) we ingested the agent lemon and proceeded to smoke another bowl in order to ease our anxiety .
After more or less half an hour ( that is T + 2:30 from baseline , and around 30 minutes after taking the MDMA and 15 minutes after the DXM ) I started feeling the beginning of the trip .
All the lights were expanded and the colors were brutally vivid .
I usually feel these on DXM much more than on XTC .
After an hour of hitting the X , I started feeling the ' vacuum ' sensation I always get on DXM , a lack of perception of ones insides or body .
I became very introverted but without feeling bad at all , just a reflective state of contemplation .
T + 3:00 - I found myself in a corner watching people interact with each other .
I started feeling more connected with them and I was glad that everybody was having a great time .
Suddenly my friend L came over and said that he wanted to walk , I joined him .
It was 10 pm .
Lights in the harbor were insane , everything was slightly undulating and my mind was at total peace .
As we walked more I felt extremely privileged to be were I was and with the people I was with .
We stared at nature for a while , and at the city skyline .
In Argentina there is always an abundance of firecrackers and fireworks during the holidays .
Every time I heard one of these I saw a cloud of ever evolving colors that covered my field of vision and then gradually vanished .
It was very powerful when these explosions followed each other consecutively , blues followed by greens followed by reds ... you get the idea .
T + 4:30 : - L and I head back to the loft and re join the party .
It was now 11:30 pm and we wanted to receive the new year with the rest of the crowd .
As the coming of the new year approached , I found my friend Max , who was hooking up with a beautiful blue eyed blond .
He gave me a bottle of champagne laced with GHB and told me to be careful and spread it around while warning everyone of its contents .
He had written '+ GHB ' with a magic marker on the label , I recommend that firmly .
The Santana live album playing in the background was making me float and move softly and gracefully .
I drank about 8 oz worth of the champagne + GHB until the countdown started .
At the count of ' ZEROOOO HAPPY NEWW YEEEEAR !' a smoke machine was turned on and several colored lights and even a strobe were put to work in conjunction with the Superman theme by John Williams .
I felt as I had drifted unintentionally into another dimension .
Sound became muted , opaque , as it happened to me before on DXM very high 2nd plateau doses or low 3rd plateau doses ( 7.5 - 8 mg/kg )
I felt intense happiness and I understood the mechanics of smoke ( forgot now , sorry ) .
T + 6:00 - I realize the GHB has seriously interfered with the enjoyment of my robofliping .
My vision is distorted and I ´m having trouble concentrating and communicating .
I feel drained and exhausted and I ´m deeply concerned about what´s to come .
My friend J approaches me with a bowl of marihuana and takes me out of the loft for another walk around the harbor .
The fresh air brings a little life to my body and after around 15 minutes of walking I puke violently .
I stay puking / dry heaving for a little while .
The alcohol / GHB purge immediately pays off and I feel much better .
Me and J smoke a bowl and relax looking at the River Plate , the widest river in the world .
At this point I am deeply relaxed and rather tired .
I feel now like in a normal second plateau trip but a little more drained .
It ´s almost 2 am when we head back to the loft .
T + 7:00 - A couple of people clap their hands when they see me come back in , which lifts my mood a little bit .
After sitting around for a little while my friend J gives a small speech thanking everyone for coming and announces he has a surprise .
He walks over to an unlit area , turns on a small light and moves a curtain - type separation he has .
Behind it was a circle of cushions and several instruments laying around !
There was two guitars , several tambourines and bongoes , a flute , a violin and an upright piano .
The acoustic guitars were even plugged to nice amps .
That´s when J announced that we were going to attempt to find Absolom again .
T + 7:30 : People slowly moved and sat in the circle , there was around 30 people left , others had crashed or left to attend other parties .
Candles were lit and the idea was to figure out the musical way to bring Absolom into our celebration .
The basic idea behind this is of course to unite musically , we were not expecting an entity to actually materialize in the middle of us , but it was more like we were to unite musically to the point of becoming the entity ourselves , a unity .
Before starting the actual jam , I snorted 2 lines of cocaine in order to bring myself up , and increase my concentration .
I had to give myself 15 minutes before I was able to pull myself together .
Let the music begin .
T + 9:00 - I remember looking at the time while sitting silently .
The rest of the group was indulged in a clapping + vocal + percussive moment that had no room for the piano or guitar which are my instruments of preference .
It was around 4 am .
I ate half an 8th of shrooms a very beautiful girl gave me , and smoked a 50/50 dro/hash bowl to await the onset .
I got really involved with the rhythmic quality of the moment , and I was still feeling the effects of the substances I had consumed earlier .
There was an absolut sense of unity now .
The music we were listening to was a unity that was only possible with this group of people on this day .
It was us , united , that were achieving this wonderful concentration .
Somebody came in with the flute ( not a metal one , but the wooden ones )
The sound was bizarre .
It was as if this person ( the instrument 's owner as I later found out ) was trying to chase after a train by using a bicycle .
T + 10:00 - The flute was now totally interwoven with the percussion .
My closed eye hallucinations were incredible .
They were all group related , groups of dots , groups of lights , groups of people .
My thoughts dwelled in the group theme as well .
How every individual was supposed to fill a gap and function in their own little roll fundamental in order for the total to work .
Suddenly I came across the question :
If everyone is supposed to play a part , what is mine ?
I remember that prior to the shrooms I had attempted to fill in with guitars and piano , but without feeling it .
Abruptly I felt an energy ray blast through my body .
I understood the meaning of my meeting with these people , and what our function in general was .
I understood how we always end up giving in to our capricious ego and forget that we only exist for others and because of others .
I felt united and empathic with EVERYONE , but I was calm .
I got up and sat on the piano .
As soon as I hit the first intense and rhythmic chords my spine shuddered .
I felt a couple of ' wow 's and ' ooh 's as I incorporated my music into the groups .
I was searching for my part in the whole , and I was getting there .
The only way to describe this music is as maybe tribal / jazzy .
Everybody was feeling the same thing , as comparisons during the next day cleared , there was an objective to be reached and when everybody played their part to perfection we would be able to see the product .
The feeling was like a perpetual roller coaster that runs in a straight line , but the angle of the drop becomes sharper and sharper as people realize their roll .
After what seemed like a short and monstrous ride we all felt overwhelmed at the sight of the product that surfaced , and the music stopped in a matter of 4 seconds ( 20 people playing stopping all within a 4 second margin without any cues )
There was a brief silence and then we all applauded ourselves and hugged for a couple of minutes .
It was now 5:30 in the morning .
T + 11:30 - It was now almost broad daylight ( summer in Argentina during new years )
The sunrise was the most beautiful ever .
There was clear traces and insane colors everywhere , the hallucinated ones competed with the real ones .
It was appalling .
I sat there with J for a couple of hours just talking about our friendship and the night that had just passed .
Calmly I began to feel tired .
T + 19:00 - 7 am , I went to bed .
I woke up around 4:30 pm but was only able to leave bed half an hour later .
I felt like a stampede of buffalo had just run me over .
But my mind was very happy and content .
I found it was severely difficult to walk , my leg muscles hurt badly .
This is something that happens to me often when I do shrooms , but it was obviously grotesquely worst this time .
I puked once more around noon , but felt pretty good after that , considering .
The of substances was way too much and hence the physical toll was tremendous .
The fact of the matter is I stopped doing drugs ( except for some weed , but not even hash ) altogether for 2 months .
I would say I regret doing the GHB and the coke .
They definitely served no purpose whatsoever and they definitely did not combine well with the rest .
The roboflipin was very interesting ( had done it before ) but I would say it 's a little short lived if you want to party all night , it drained a lot of energy out of me and when I added the GHB it definitely short circuited .
I did n't mention this during the detailed account because the experience was very valuable to me as a whole , but there were two points during the night that I felt really horrible , like I was losing control .
The fact of the matter is that if I had n't done all these substances separately as much as I have I would have lost it for sure , and it was very close regardless .
The first time was when I puked , obviously .
I was retching very violently and since my mind was altered I thought I was actually convulsing for a second .
I even had a CEV of myself convulsing and snapping my spine , not pretty at all .
Luckily I had the right mindset and I was able to control myself .
The second time was after the coke .
I felt very dizzy and the room was spinning and I thought I had maybe overdosed or inhaled something else instead ( a la Pulp Fiction , although I knew this was n't anything else at all , but the mind altering played a big part in this momentary delusion ) .
I could n't play the piano at all , and I sat down on a cushion ready to puke and freak out .
This time , a very gentle person talked to me softly and took care of me until I got a grip and was able to understand what was going on .
I 'm grateful regardless of the short lived effect that insuflated cocaine has , because if I had to stay like that for another 45 minutes I would have definitely lost it .
It was without a doubt an incredible experience nonetheless , I am now much more tolerant to others and I tend to serve others generously because I understood the meaning of our unity .
I do n't think all of these substances were necessary to achieve this glorious state of unity and clarity , that 's just the way the night worked out .
This experience reminded me how important setting and people around you are when experimenting , it was these factors that prevented things from getting VERY ugly .
I have seriously achieved a new outlook on substances in general , and I now know I will rarely be combining anymore ( with the exception of candyflipin , aaahh the magic ) .
The most important thing by far was my realization that we are all of us in this ride called life together , and the mentality and attitude you project is given back to you .
That night we found unity and brotherhood .
I finally realized what it was that we were looking for all this time .
We found Absolom .

This peculiar countdown is a celebration of all things uniquely bizarre ....
The report is a crowd - filtered ranking based on TrendHunter.com monthly traffic ( roughly 10 million monthly views ) and our bizarre trend database , which now has more than 4,284 bizarre trends .
Enjoy freaking yourself out with this article ...-
The reason why people enjoy strange , bizarre news or innovations is a mystery to many .
The effect of oddities such as these is similar to that of a bad car crash : you want to look away but you just can't .
The appeal consists of one part shock and another fascination , as consumers get a kick out of seeing other people do things they themselves would never dare to .
Downward revisions to official statistics show output fell 2.4 % in the first three months of the year and the recession started three months earlier than thought
The recession facing Britain is even deeper than had been thought and started more than a year ago , it was revealed today .
National income fell in the first quarter of this year by 2.4 % , the biggest drop since 1958 , as the Office for National Statistics revised its initial estimate of 1.9 % .
The figures are much worse than expected .
Extended to the whole year , the drop in output in the January to March period is now equal to 4.9 % – the worst since records began in 1948 .
" We hope the recovery comes as soon as possible but sadly we now know this recession has been longer and deeper than we had thought , " said shadow chancellor George Osborne .
" This also means that in the future unemployment will be higher and Labour 's debt crisis will be even worse . "
Although GDP fell 2.4 % in the third quarter of 1979 and first quarter of 1974 , statisticians said these were rounded from 2.36 % or 2.37 % .
The figure for this year was exactly 2.4 % .
The revision is one of the biggest ever made by the ONS and it said the reasons were changes to its estimate of the construction and services sectors .
The ONS also revised down its figure for the second quarter of last year to - 0.1 % from zero , meaning the recession started earlier than previously thought .
And the fourth quarter of 2008 figure was revised down to a fall of 1.8 % .
" The recession , which now begins in the second quarter of 2008 rather than the third , is now thought to be quite a bit deeper than previously thought , and is looking ominously like the early 1980s vintage , " said Danny Gabay of Fathom Consulting .
Critics of the Bank of England who called for big interest rate cuts in the first half of last year , will feel justified by the data , since the Bank 's monetary policy committee argued into last autumn that there was little likelihood of a recession occurring and delayed rate cuts until October .
In fact , the economy had entered one last spring .
Separately , the Trades Union Congress said that while there were signs of " green shoots " in the economy , this was more to do with an easing of the pace of the fall in output rather than that a big recovery was under way .
" This recession is already worse than the 1990s one and is likely to be worse than that of the 1980s , " said Richard Excel , TUC labour market expert .
" It has been very severe and we are probably only half way through .
It will be quite some time until employment and growth return to pre-recession levels . "
Paul Gregg , labour market expert from Bristol University , noted that unemployment had started rising earlier in this recession than in previous ones and was " encouraged " that monthly rises in the claimant count appeared to be slowing down .
Online banking has changed the way people pay bills and move money from one bank to another .
In the past , if you wanted to transfer money from your account to another account at a different institution , you typically wrote and mailed a check .
Now you can complete those transactions in just a few minutes online .
Transactions typically take from 1 to 3 days to complete .
Gather Required Information
To transfer money from one bank to another , you 'll need the following information :
An online banking account with your bank
The name of the recipient
The bank routing number for the receiving institution AND
The bank account number of the recipient OR
The mobile phone number of the recipient OR
The email address of the recipient
The fastest way to make a transfer to another person 's bank account is by using the recipient 's banking information , including the routing number of the financial institution and the individual 's account number .
However , if she does not want to share that information with you , your bank may be able to transfer funds using the recipient 's mobile phone number or email .
In this case , the recipient will receive a text message or email from your bank , alerting him that you 've initiated a transfer .
She then will follow the instructions to direct the money into her bank account .
Once she follows bank 's transfer instructions , the recipient receives her money within 1 to 3 days .
If she fails to complete instructions within 10 days , the transaction is cancelled .
Sign into Your Bank's Online Banking Site
To complete an online transfer , you 'll need to enroll in your bank 's online banking program , if you have n't done so already .
Log onto your bank 's website and follow the instructions to enroll .
Tips
Most banks offer mobile online banking -- you can complete transactions such as transfers from your mobile phone or device .
Choose the Correct Transfer Service
Click on the link provided to transfer money from your account to another bank .
Your bank may have a specific name for this feature .
For instance , Wells Fargo 's transfer program is called Wells Fargo Surepay .
At U.S. Bank , the service is called Pay a Person .
Provide Required Information and Details
Choose the bank account from which you 'd like the money transferred .
Most banks will transfer from a checking , savings or money market account .
Provide the required information about the recipient and her receiving institution .
Choose the date you 'd like the transfer to occur ; some banks allow you to schedule transfers many days in advance .
Once you 've entered the amount and date , carefully double check to ensure that you 've entered the information correctly .
Warnings
If you 're providing the recipient 's bank account number , check it carefully .
A one - digit typo could result in your money going into a stranger 's account .
Check for Fees and Complete the Transfer
Some banks charge fees for online bank transfers ; others do n't .
After you 've entered all requested information , any applicable fees should be noted before you complete the transaction ; speak to a customer service representative at your bank if you have any questions .
Double - check the information you 've entered one final time to ensure it 's correct , then complete the transaction to transfer money .

When Cisco announced it would start selling server systems in March , the company acknowledged that H - P and IBM , which combine to resell about $ 2 billion worth of Cisco networking gear each year , may be less inclined to push Cisco products .
The first such decrease may have just shown up in the one market segment .
The category is the $ 1 billion a year market for high - end SANs , or storage area networks , the gear that connects servers to storage devices .
Its a business that Cisco entered early in the decade , one where the company ...
[ California's ]
A2 rating is just five notches above speculative status and Moody 's raised the potential for the rating to tumble toward " junk " status if lawmakers fail to quickly produce a budget for Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to sign .
" If the legislature does not take action quickly , the state 's cash situation will deteriorate to the point where the controller will have to delay most non-priority payments in July , " Moody 's said in a statement .
" Lack of action could result in a multi - notch downgrade , " Moody 's added .
A downgrade could push California 's borrowing costs up at time when state officials expect to issue up to $ 9 billion in revenue anticipation notes as soon as possible after a budget agreement is notched -- a deal whose timing is in doubt .
Moody 's said California 's leasing debt and other state - related debt are also on review , affecting a total of $ 72 billion of debt .
Moody 's cited California 's expected massive budget gap for fiscal 2010 of more than 20 percent of its general fund budget ; warnings by the state controller that without budget solutions the state will not be able to meet all its financial obligations in July ; continued political stalemate , and the limited options .
In what is sure to blow Barney Frank 's lid wide open , Moody 's ( never one too far behind competitor S&P , except when it comes to TALF ratings ) announced earlier it was preparing a major , multi - notch rating downgrade of the state if it does not produce a budget any time soon .
As the latter is a pipe dream , California better prepare for its CDS to hit its recent all time wides
All in all , a complete disaster , and as Obama made clear recently , the Governator can not rely on bailout funding .
Do you see what happens Arnie , when you do n't have one million UAW pensioners living in your state , ordering Viagra , and never issuing recall notices on gas guzzling ( stainless ? ) steel tinderboxes .
A downgrade of Cali would set off a chain of events , that will not only trash the ratings of virtually all other states , resulting in a skyrocketing of the MCDX , and major pain for associated index arbs , but also impair insurance companies directly and indirectly , with a final outcome likely being comparable to the Lehman blow up , however more protracted and , ultimately , more pronounced .
And instead of confronting the problem head on and possibly finding way to resolve the state funding crisis before it is too late , the administration , day in and day out , keeps its head in the sand , pretending that things are getting better when in fact the economy is collapsing .
In three months , when California " pays " all its vendors with IOUs and state refunds are indefinitely delayed into the next decade , any mention of ' green shoots ' with just come from Dick Bove , who will likely issue a Strong Buy rating on Sacramento despite " horrific " mass hysteria and bands of roving Mad Max copycats coasting along I - 5 at 120 mph in nitrous - retrofitted China - made Hummers .

WASHINGTON ( CNNMoney.com ) -- President Obama on Wednesday unveiled his long - anticipated plan to restructure how banks and other firms are regulated in the hope of preventing another financial collapse .
The far - reaching effort would reorder the roles of some key agencies to try to tighten government supervision of the financial sector .
It would also toughen up standards for big financial firms and create a new agency dedicated to consumer protection .
" We did not choose how this crisis began .
But we do have a choice in the legacy this crisis leaves behind , " Obama said .
" So today , my administration is proposing a sweeping overhaul of the financial regulatory system , a transformation on a scale not seen since the reforms that followed the Great Depression . "
On Thursday , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner will head to Capitol Hill to detail the Obama proposals and answer questions .
Most of the administration 's plans will require legislation to gain force .
One of Obama 's more drastic moves would be to abolish the embattled Office of Thrift Supervision and merge it with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency .
The OTS has been on the hot seat for months for its role as the overseer of American International Group ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) and failed lenders IndyMac and Washington Mutual .
The comptroller 's office is a Treasury Department bureau that regulates national banks .
Geithner said OTS is the only agency on the chopping block because of its past role in regulatory " arbitrage . "
Current rules allow some banks to effectively pick their regulator , and OTS is an agency many firms gravitated to when they sought to evade tougher regulators .
" Those problems were at the center of many of the things that went wrong with our system , and we have an obligation to fix that , " Geithner said .
Two regulators would get expanded powers under the Obama proposal : Treasury and the Federal Reserve .
Obama called for the creation of a council of regulators chaired by the Treasury secretary to work alongside the Fed to monitor system - wide risk .
However , the Fed would have most of the power for systemic risk , Geithner said .
Top administration officials decided to give the Fed more power after looking at other nations with regulatory councils .
Treasury would also get veto power over Fed decisions to make emergency loans to companies teetering on the verge of collapse .
Over the past year , the Treasury has been signing off on such loans .
But Geithner said the power should be formalized , since Treasury plays an important role safeguarding taxpayer spending .
" It 's the taxpayers that have to live with the moral hazards " of such emergency loans , he said .
In addition , Obama proposed the establishment of a new watchdog agency aimed at protecting consumers from deceptive or dangerous mortgages , credit cards and other financial products .
The new consumer agency would take on some powers that currently reside with other regulators like the Fed .
It will also have the power to enact rules and inspect firms .
" This crisis was not just the result of decisions made by the mightiest of financial firms ; it was also the result of decisions made by ordinary Americans to open credit cards , take out home loans and take on other financial obligations , " Obama said .
The new agency would lay out new rules for mortgage lending , " so that the bad practices that led to the home mortgage crisis will be stamped out , " according to Obama .
The president acknowledged that his proposal will likely spur controversy .
" There has always been a tension between those who place their faith in the invisible hand of the marketplace -- and those who place more trust in the guiding hand of the government , " Obama said .
" That tension is n't a bad thing . "
" We are called upon to recognize that the free market is the most powerful generative force for our prosperity -- but it is not a free license to ignore the consequences of our actions . "
Mixed bag for banking industry
Lawmakers have already begun hearings on the issue of regulatory reform .
Final passage on the Obama proposal could take months , but White House officials hope to get the regulatory reforms passed by winter , insiders say .
One sticking point may be new powers the proposal would grant the Fed to force big financial firms , including those that are n't banks , to keep a certain amount of money aside in reserves .
Some in the banking industry said the new capital requirements appear to be tougher than they had expected .
Jaret Seiberg , a policy analyst with Concept Capital 's Washington Research Group , called the proposal " worse for the financial sector than was expected . "
He points out that regulators can require banks to shore up their capital levels even if Congress balks at that piece of the proposal .
Obama defended his plan to empower the Fed to hold banks and large financial firms more accountable , saying that " if you can pose a great risk , that means you have a great responsibility . "
A lot of banks and trade associations oppose the new consumer protection agency -- especially the idea of giving it power to curb financial products if they 're found to be deceptive or unfair .
" We have a concern creating another regulatory burden , and wonder how they plan on paying for the agency , " said Dan Berger , head lobbyist for the National Association of Federal Credit Unions , which otherwise supports the reform plan .
But most of the banking industry expected -- and some even called for -- giving the Federal Reserve more powers to monitor systemic risk and setting up a new way to unwind big financial firms .
Scott Talbott of the Financial Services Roundtable said banks " won , tied and lost " in the proposal , pointing out aspects they supported , opposed and could accept .
And the Financial Services Forum , which represents 17 chief executives , said the proposal overall appears " comprehensive " and " reasonable , " said president Rob Nichols .
" I think this is a great start of the dialogue for what 's going to take place on the Hill over the next six months , " Nichols said .
Securities and derivatives also on agenda
The White House also aims to tighten up supervision of the securitization markets , requiring firms that originate a security to keep 5 % of the " securitized exposure . "
That means whoever created the financial product would still hold a piece of it , even as it got resold , and would have some interest in its ultimate performance .
The proposal calls for the regulation of all over - the - counter derivatives , including the kind of credit default swaps that led to the collapse of AIG .
In addition , officials want to make sure that such products are n't marketed to " unsophisticated " investors .
The Obama plan would address the conflicts of interest that occur when financial firms work with rating agencies to get a golden seal of approval on a financial product .
Rating agencies have been blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis by giving top ratings to bad financial products .
The official speaking Tuesday did not offer details as to how rating agency oversight might be toughened .
Finally , the White House plans to build on the role of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , now charged with taking over bad banks , and give it and other regulators more power to take over and unwind other kinds of troubled financial companies beyond banks .
" The FDIC is at the center of that model , and we 're going to adapt that model to make it work for large complex financial institutions , " Geithner said .
" The FDIC will play a central role . "
American intelligence agencies have been accused of spying on the emails of millions of Americans , including those of former president Bill Clinton .
In the latest in a series of intelligence scandals to hit Washington , details of a secretive email surveillance scheme are beginning to come to light - with fresh allegations reported in the New York Times .
The Times quotes one anonymous NSA analyst who claims that electronic messages sent to and from American citizens , and says that the former president - whose wife is now the country 's secretary of state - was among those targeted by the sweep .
The database system , called Pinwale , is used by America 's National Security Agency to intercept and examine huge volumes of email passing through American telecommunications networks .
The NSA has confirmed that Pinwale exists , although it will not comment on the latest allegations or give further details on how the system operates .
The head of the Senate Intelligence Committee , which has been investigating the unauthorised surveillance claims for several years , reacted to the news of Pinwale system by suggesting that nothing illegal had taken place .
The news is just the latest in a long series of revelations about the extent to which America 's security agencies are keeping track of ordinary people , including the controversy over warrantless wiretaps .
However Californian Senator Dianne Feinstein , a Democrat , said she had previously investigated Pinwale and believed it did not violate the law .
" We asked the questions .
We were assured it was not correct , " Feinstein told a Judiciary Committee hearing .
" I 've gone over this chapter and verse .
I do not believe that any content is reviewed in this program . "
That stance is a sharp contrast with four years ago , when Feinstein told the Senate said that she had a " very heavy heart " after learning that intelligence services had acted in contravention of laws that she had helped pass .
In 2005 it emerged that President Bush had bypassed the usual process of court approval for wiretaps , encouraging NSA officials to conduct wiretaps at his command .
Accused of abusing his powers , Bush later claimed it was his " constitutional responsibility " - but while Congress strongly objected , the controversy ended last year with a compromise that effectively approved his actions and gave immunity to American telecoms companies for their role in aiding the NSA .
" Ordinary Americans ' most private emails have been and still are being intercepted in bulk and then stored in secret NSA databases , without probable cause , " said Kevin Bankston , a lawyer with the campaign group Electronic Frontier Foundation .
The organisation , which is suing the government over the illegal interception of communications , said systems like Pinwale were exactly what it intended to stop .
" One of the remedies we 're asking for in that case is the destruction of the domestic communications and records that the NSA has been illegally hoarding in databases like Pinwale . "
While some of the most high - profile episodes of covert government surveillance have taken place in America , it is far from alone in monitoring the activities of its citizens .
Indeed , the prevalence of internet communication has encouraged governments and intelligence agencies around the world to focus .
In the last week China has been forced to drop plans to make it mandatory to install surveillance software on every PC in the country , while the Iranian authorities have clamped down on internet communications in the wake of its disputed elections .
The UK government , meanwhile , intends to create a series of databases keeping track of every phone call , email and text message in Britain .
Earlier this year eavesdropping agency GCHQ denied that it is building its own equivalent to Pinwale , after reports that the agency had already been allocated £ 1bn to build a system to monitor all internet use in the UK .
The news in America , however , comes just weeks after President Obama said he would create a new office for cybersecurity - closely linked to the NSA - while vowing not to endanger people 's privacy .
" Our pursuit of cybersecurity will not - I repeat , will not include - monitoring private sector networks or Internet traffic , " he said .
" We will preserve and protect the personal privacy and civil liberties that we cherish as Americans . "
Testing people for heart disease might be just a finger prick away thanks to a new credit card - sized device created by a team of researchers from Harvard and Northeastern universities in Boston .
In a research report published online in The FASEB Journal ( http://www. fasebj. org ) , they describe how this device can measure and collect a type of cells needed to build vascular tissue , called endothelial progenitor cells , using only 200 microliters of blood .
The development is also significant because it allows scientists to collect these cells much more easily than current techniques allow , bringing laboratory - created tissue for vascular bypass surgeries another step closer to reality .
" This simple device is a promising tool for the pediatric and adult population in detecting , diagnosing , monitoring , and providing the option of treating cardiovascular disease by utilizing a small quantity of blood , " said lead researcher Shashi K. Murthy of the Department of Chemical Engineering at Northeastern University in Boston .
To collect the cells , the device works similar to Velcro™ or a magnet .
Specifically , the inside is coated with antibodies that only bind to endothelial progenitor cells .
Blood flows through the device through a funnel - like opening ( except the blood enters through the narrow end and exits through the wide end ) , passes over the antibodies , and endothelial progenitor cells are " picked up " in the process .
In addition to allowing researchers to collect cells from a very small amount of blood , the device 's design also provides researchers with a new model to study the effects that blood flow in the body has on cell binding ( like clots form in arteries ) .
" Most immediately , this is could be a new tool to assess cardiovascular health that cuts the amount of blood needed down to a pin prick .
Its compact size might make it an excellent tool for use in developing countries where access to medical laboratories does not exist , " said Gerald Weissmann , M.D. , Editor - in - Chief of The FASEB Journal .
" In addition , this moves much closer to a future where new blood vessels , veins and arteries for transplants no longer need to be grafted from patient 's bodies .
The amount of pain and recovery times for bypass surgeries would be reduced significantly . "

Note :
This article is really old .
It is here for posterity only .
You should really find a more current tutorial .
I ’ve been a little frustrated by the lack of Android tutorials .
I got a Hello world going , and found that most of the few tutorials I could find were WAY more complicated than what I want to start with .
GPS , map overlays , to - do lists , etc , which is great and all but I want to start simple and work up from that .
So I set out to build “ Hello Circle , ” a program which drew a dot on the screen wherever you touched it .
After about 12 hours of beating my head against Eclipse , the Android SDK , and the frequently incorrect Android documentation I got it working .
So here ’s a tutorial .
Setting up the environment I ’m going to assume you already successfully completed the Hello World tutorial .
Which means you ’ve got yourself an IDE ( probably Eclipse ) , the Android SDK , and the ADK ( Android Development Kit ) which is a plugin for Eclipse to help keep things in order .
If you have n’t done that yet follow these instructions and pray everything works as planned .
I ’ll see you in a few hours .
Create a project just like you did for Hello World .
Creating the ViewGroup
In order for anything to display on the screen you need to create a view .
In the Hello World tutorial you created a TextView .
We ’re going to use the XML setup for creating our view , and rather than creating a TextView we ’re going to use a FrameLayout , which is acutlaly a view group .
Open up / res / layout / main.xml and plop in this fine code ( obliterating anything that may be there ) :
This , when it ’s called in our code , will create a FrameLayout view with an id of “ main view , ” a width / height that fills the screen , and a neon green background .
The hex color code for the background includes the alpha channel ( the first to FFs ) .
Setting the contentView to our XML Head over to your main class and call setContentView on your layout .
Your code should look something vaguely like this :
import android.app.Activity ; import android.os .
Bundle ; public class RoboTown extends Activity { /**
Called when the activity is first created .
*/ @ Override public void on Create ( Bundle savedInstanceState ) { super.on Create( savedInstanceState ) ; setContentView(R.layout.main ) ; }
If you run your code at this point you should get a big green background which does nothing .
Hooray !
Creating the Ball class
Now we want to create a circle .
Actually we want to create a lot of circles .
So the first step is to create a new class called Ball .
Right click on your project ’s main class in the Package Explorer ( on the left ) and click New > Class .
Give it the name Ball and click Finish .
Our ball is actually going to be another view .
What ?
Yeah .
It ’s a view .
All of our Ball views will eventually go into our FrameLayout , but we ’ll worry about that later .
So first , modify your Ball class so that it extends View , since it ’s a new type of View , and while you ’re at it go ahead and import some of the things we ’ll need for drawing :
import android.content .
Context ; import android.graphics .Canvas ; import android.graphics .
Paint ; import android.view .
View ; public class Ball extends View { }
In order to draw a ball we need a handful of things : a Canvas to draw them on , x and y coordinates to place the center of the ball , the radius , and Paint to give it color .
So we ’ll start by establishing those ( I hid the imports for the sake of clarity , you should leave yours there ) :
public class Ball extends
View { private final float x ; private final float y ; private final int r ; private final Paint mPaint = new Paint ( Paint.ANTI_ALIAS_FLAG ) ; }
In the last line we create a new Paint object , creatively called mPaint .
A Paint contains information like colors , text sizes , etc , which affect the appearance of the drawing .
So far we have n’t assigned any of those things to the Paint , we ’ve just created it .
Now we need to write the Ball constructor , which is the method to be called whenever we create a new ball :
private final int r ; private final Paint m Paint = new Paint ( Paint.ANTI_ALIAS_FLAG ) ; public Ball ( Context context , float x , float y , int r ) { super ( context ) ; mPaint.setColor(0xFFFF0000 ) ; this .x = x ; this .y = y ; this .r = r ; } }
Our constructor takes a Context , x , y , and radius r.
We pass these arguments in when we instantiate the object and assign them to the object properties .
And lastly , the method which actually draws the circle , on Draw :
public Ball ( Context context , float x , float y , int r ) { super ( context ) ; mPaint.setColor(0xFFFF0000 ) ; this .x = x ; this .y = y ; this .r = r ; } @ Override protected void on Draw ( Canvas canvas ) { super.on Draw ( canvas ) ; canvas.drawCircle(x , y , r , mPaint ) ; }
Ok , our Ball class is done .
Save it and head back over to the main class .
Drawing a Ball on the screen
At this point we have n’t actually drawn anything .
We ’ve just created Ball which we * could * draw if we so desired .
In order to draw it on the screen we first have to get a hold of our FrameLayout .
Since we created it via XML we ’ll need to find it again using findViewById ( ) :
setContentView(R.layout.main ) ; FrameLayout main = ( FrameLayout ) findViewById(R.id.main_view ) ;
Now we can use the addView method to attach a new Ball to our main view :
FrameLayout main = ( FrameLayout ) findViewById(R.id.main_view ) ; main.addView( new Ball ( this ,50,50,25 ) ) ;
Run your code now and , if all goes well , you ’ll have a circle with a radius of 25 pixels in the upper left corner of the screen .
Yay !
Take some time to play around with Paint options , positioning , etc with the various methods outlined in the documentation .
Now all we have to do is add a touch listener to react when the screen is touched .
Which is thankfully pretty easy .
We ’re going to create a new touch listener and attach it to our main view all in one fell swoop :
main.addView(new Ball ( this ,50,50,25 ) ) ; main.setOnTouchListener(new View.OnTouchListener ( ) { public boolean onTouch ( View v , MotionEvent e ) { } } ) ;
The onTouch ( ) method is a callback function which will be hit whenever you touch the screen .
Android will send it a View ( v ) and a MotionEvent ( e ) .
We already know what a view is , and a MotionEvent is an object containing information about the touch .
All we care about are the X and Y coordinates , which are accessible via the getX ( ) and getY ( ) methods .
main.addView(new Ball ( this ,50,50,25 ) ) ; main.setOnTouchListener(new View.OnTouchListener ( ) { public boolean onTouch ( View v , MotionEvent e ) { float x = e.getX ( ) ; float y = e.getY ( ) ; } } ) ;
The last thing we have to do before we can start drawing is to cast the view we were sent as a FrameLayout , so we can use the addView ( ) method with it .
Then we can instantiate a new Ball at the coordinates sent in the Motion Event :
main.addView(new Ball ( this ,50,50,25 ) ) ; main.setOnTouchListener(new View.OnTouchListener ( ) { public boolean onTouch ( View v , MotionEvent e ) { float x = e.getX ( ) ; float y = e.getY ( ) ; FrameLayout flView = ( FrameLayout ) v ; flView.addView( new Ball ( getParent ( ) , x , y,25 ) ) ; } } ) ;
The getParent ( ) call sets the context for the Ball to the main Activity .
I only vaguely understand why it has to be done this way .
So now , the moment of truth !
You should have all the code you need to run the app in your emulator or even on a real phone .
Touching the screen will place a dot where you touched .
Amazing !
Hopefully you now have enough of an idea of how all this stuff plays together that you can forge your way to making something vaguely useful ( which this is n’t ) .

In March 2000 , the Secretary of State Madeleine Albright admitted that the Eisenhower administration organized a regime change in 1953 in Iran and that this historical event explained the current hostility of Iranians towards the United States .
Last week , during the speech he addressed to Muslims in Cairo , President Obama officially recognized that « in the midst of the cold war the United States played a role in the toppling of a democratically elected Iranian government » [ 1 ] .
At the time , Iran was controlled by a puppet monarchy headed by the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi .
He had been placed on the throne by the British who forced his father , the pro-Nazi Cossack officer Reza Pahlavi to resign .
However , the Shah had to deal with a nationalist Prime Minister , Mohammad Mossadegh .
Mossadegh , with the help of ayatollah Abou al - Qassem Kachani , nationalized the oil resources [ 2 ] .
Furious , the British persuaded the United States that the Iranian dissent needed to be stopped before the country became communist .
The CIA then put together Operation Ajax to overthrow Mossadegh with the help of the Shah , and to replace him with Nazi general Fazlollah Zahedi who until then was detained by the British .
Zahedi is responsible for having instituted the cruelest terror regime of the time , while the Shah would cover his exactions while parading for Western ‘ people ’ magazines .
Operation Ajax was lead by archeologist Donald Wilber , historian Kermit Roosevelt ( grandson of president Theodore Roosevelt ) and general Norman Schwartzkopf Sr. ( whose son with the same name lead Operation Desert Storm ) .
This operation remains a textbook example of subversion .
The CIA came up with a scenario that gave the impression of a popular revolt when in reality it was a covert operation .
The highpoint of the show was a demonstration in Tehran with 8 000 actors paid by the Agency to provide credible pictures to Western media [ 3 ] .
Is History repeating itself ?
Washington renounced to a military attack on Iran and has dissuaded Israel to take such an initiative .
In order to « change the regime » , the Obama administration prefers to play the game of covert actions – less dangerous but with a more unpredictable outcome .
After the Iranian presidential elections , huge demonstrations in the streets of Tehran are pitching supporters of president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and supreme leader Ali Khamenei on one side , to supporters of defeated candidate Mir-Hossein Mousavi and former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on the other .
The demonstrations are a sign of a profound division in the Iranian society between a nationalist proletariat and a bourgeoisie upset at being held back from economic globalization [ 4 ] .
With its covert actions , Washington is trying to weigh on the events to topple the re-elected president .
Once again , Iran is an experimental field for innovative subversive methods .
CIA is relying in 2009 on a new weapon : control of cell phones .
Since the democratization of mobile phones , Anglo - Saxon secret services have increased their interception capability .
While wired phones ’ tapping requires the installation of branch circuits – and therefore local agents , tapping of mobile phones can be done remotely using the Echelon network .
However , this system cannot intercept
Skype mobile phones communications , which explains the success of Skype telephones in conflict areas [ 5 ] .
The National Security Agency ( NSA ) therefore lobbied world Internet Service Providers to require their cooperation .
Those who accepted have received huge retribution [ 6 ] .
In countries under their occupation — Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan — , the Anglo - Saxons intercept all telephone communication , whether mobile or wired .
The goal is not to obtain full transcripts of any given conversation , but to identify « social networks » .
In other words , telephones are surveillance bugs which make it possible to know who anyone is in touch with .
Firstly , the hope is to identify resistance networks .
Secondly , telephones make it possible to locate identified targets and « neutralize » them .
This is why in February 2008 , the Afghan rebels ordered various operators to stop their activity daily , from 5 PM to 3AM , in order to prevent the Anglo - Saxons to follow their whereabouts .
The relay antennas of those that refused to comply where destroyed [ 7 ] .
On the contrary , with the exception of a telephone exchange which was accidentally hit , Israeli forces made sure not to hit telephone exchanges in Gaza during Operation Cast Lead from December 2008 to January 2009 .
This is a complete change in strategy .
Since the Gulf War , the most prevalent strategy was colonel John A. Warden ’s « five circles theory » : the bombing of telephone infrastructures was considered a strategic objective to both confuse populations and to cut communication lines between commanding centers and fighters .
Now the opposite applies : telecommunication infrastructures must be protected .
During the bombings in Gaza , the operator Jawwal [ 8 ] offered additional talk time to its users – officially to help them but de facto serving Israel ’s interests .
Going one step further , Anglo - Saxons and Israeli secrets services developed psychological warfare methods based on an extensive use of mobile phones .
In July 2008 , after the exchange of prisoners and remains between Israel and Hezbollah , robots placed tens of thousands of calls to Lebanese mobile phones .
A voice speaking in Arabic was warning against participating in any resistance activity and belittled Hezbollah .
The Lebanese minister of telecommunications , Jibran Bassil [ 9 ] , files a complaint to the UN against this blatant violation of the country ’s sovereignty [ 10 ] .
Following the same approach , tens of thousands of Lebanese and Syrians received an automatic phone call in October 2008 to offer them 10 million dollars for any information leading to the location and freeing of Israeli prisoners .
People interested in collaborating were invited to call a number in the UK [ 11 ] .
This method has now been used in Iran to bluff the population , to spread shocking news and to channel the resulting anger .
First , SMS were sent during the night of the counting of the votes , according to which the Guardian Council of the Constitution ( equivalent to a constitutional court ) had informed Mir-Hossein Mousavi of his victory .
After that , the announcing of the official results — the re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad with 64 % of cast votes — seemed like a huge fraud .
However , three days earlier , M. Mousavi and his friends were considering a massive victory of M. Ahmadinejad as certain and were trying to explain it by unbalanced campaigns .
Indeed the ex president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was detailing his grievances in an open letter .
The US polling institutes in Iran were predicting a 20 points lead for M. Ahmadinejad over M. Mousavi [ 12 ] .
M. Mousavi victory never seemed possible , even if it is probable that some fraud accentuated the margin between the two candidates .
Secondly , Iranian citizens were selected or volunteered on the Internet to chat on Facebook or to subscribe to Twitter feeds .
They received information — true or false — ( still via SMS ) about the evolution of the political crisis and the ongoing demonstrations .
These anonymous news posts were spreading news of gun fights and numerous deaths which to this day have not been confirmed .
Because of an unfortunate calendar overlap , Twitter was supposed to suspend its service for a night to allow for some maintenance of its systems .
The US State Department intervened to ask them to postpone it [ 13 ] .
According to the New York Times , these operations contributed to spread defiance in the population [ 14 ] .
Messages describing death threats , police bursting into homes , etc. sent by authors who cannot be indentified or located .
Simultaneously , in a new type of effort , the CIA is mobilizing anti-Iranian militants in the United States and in the United Kingdom to increase the chaos .
A Practical Guide to revolution in Iran was distributed to them , which contains a number of recommendations , including :
set Twitter accounts feeds to Tehran time zone ;
centralize messages on the following Twitter accounts @stopAhmadi , #iranelection and # gr88 ;
official Iranian State websites should not be attacked .
«
Let the US military take care of it » ( sic ) .
When applied , these recommendations make it impossible to authenticate any Twitter messages .
It is impossible to know if they are being sent by witnesses of the demonstrations in Tehran or by CIA agents in Langley , and it is impossible to distinguish real from false ones .
The goal is to create more and more confusion and to push Iranians to fight amongst themselves .
Army general staffs everywhere in the world are closely following the events in Tehran .
They are trying to evaluate the efficiency of this new subversion method in the Iranian experimental field .
Evidently , the destabilization process worked .
But it is unclear if the CIA will be able to channel demonstrators to do what the Pentagon has renounced to do , and what they do not want to do themselves : to change the regime and put an end to the Islamic revolution .
Red giant star Betelgeuse mysteriously shrinking
The red supergiant star Betelgeuse , the bright reddish star in the constellation Orion , has steadily shrunk over the past 15 years , according to University of California , Berkeley , researchers .
Long - term monitoring by UC Berkeley 's Infrared Spatial Interferometer ( ISI ) on the top of Mt. Wilson in Southern California shows that Betelgeuse ( bet ' el juz ) , which is so big that in our solar system it would reach to the orbit of Jupiter , has shrunk in diameter by more than 15 percent since 1993 .
( David Hale 2006 )
Since Betelgeuse 's radius is about five astronomical units , or five times the radius of Earth 's orbit , that means the star 's radius has shrunk by a distance equal to the orbit of Venus .
" To see this change is very striking , " said Charles Townes , a UC Berkeley professor emeritus of physics who won the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics for inventing the laser and the maser , a microwave laser .
" We will be watching it carefully over the next few years to see if it will keep contracting or will go back up in size . "
Townes and his colleague , Edward Wishnow , a research physicist at UC Berkeley 's Space Sciences Laboratory , will discuss their findings at a 12:40 p.m. PDT press conference on Tuesday , June 9 , during the Pasadena meeting of the American Astronomical Society ( AAS ) .
The results were published June 1 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters .
Despite Betelgeuse 's diminished size , Wishnow pointed out that its visible brightness , or magnitude , which is monitored regularly by members of the American Association of Variable Star Observers , has shown no significant dimming over the past 15 years .
The ISI has been focusing on Betelgeuse for more than 15 years in an attempt to learn more about these giant massive stars and to discern features on the star 's surface , Wishnow said .
He speculated that the measurements may be affected by giant convection cells on the star 's surface that are like convection granules on the sun , but so large that they bulge out of the surface .
Townes and former graduate student Ken Tatebe observed a bright spot on the surface of Betelgeuse in recent years , although at the moment , the star appears spherically symmetrical .
" But we do not know why the star is shrinking , " Wishnow said .
" Considering all that we know about galaxies and the distant universe , there are still lots of things we do n't know about stars , including what happens as red giants near the ends of their lives . "
Betelgeuse was the first star ever to have its size measured , and even today is one of only a handful of stars that appears through the Hubble Space Telescope as a disk rather than a point of light .
In1921 , Francis G. Pease and Albert Michelson used optical interferometry to estimate its diameter was equivalent to the orbit of Mars .
Last year , new measurements of the distance to Betelgeuse raised it from 430 light years to 640 , which increased the star 's diameter from about 3.7 to about 5.5 AU .
" Since the 1921 measurement , its size has been re-measured by many different interferometer systems over a range of wavelengths where the diameter measured varies by about 30 percent , " Wishnow said .
" At a given wavelength , however , the star has not varied in size much beyond the measurement uncertainties . "
The measurements cannot be compared anyway , because the star 's size depends on the wavelength of light used to measure it , Townes said .
This is because the tenuous gas in the outer regions of the star emits light as well as absorbs it , which makes it difficult to determine the edge of the star .
( Cristina Ryan 2008 )
The ISI that Townes and his colleagues first built in the early 1990s sidesteps these confounding emission and absorption lines by observing in the mid-infrared with a narrow bandwidth that can be tuned between spectral lines .
The ISI consists of three 5.4 - foot ( 1.65 - meter ) diameter mirrors separated by distances that vary from 12 to 230 feet ( 4 - 70 meters ) , said Townes .
Using a laser as a common frequency standard , the ISI interferometer combines signals from telescope pairs in order to determine path length differences between light that originates at the star 's center and light that originates at the star 's edge .
The technique of stellar interferometry is highlighted in the June 2009 issue of Physics Today magazine .
" We observe around 11 microns , the mid-infrared , where this long wavelength penetrates the dust and the narrow bandwidth avoids any spectral lines , and so we see the star relatively undistorted , " said Townes .
" We have also had the good fortune to have an instrument that has operated in a very similar manner for some 15 years , providing a long and consistent series of measurements that no one else has .
The first measurements showed a size quite close to Michelson 's result , but over 15 years , it has decreased in size about 15 percent , changing smoothly , but faster as the years progressed . "
Townes , who turns 94 in July , plans to continue monitoring Betelgeuse in hopes of finding a pattern in the changing diameter , and to improve the ISI 's capabilities by adding a spectrometer to the interferometer .
" Whenever you look at things with more precision , you are going to find some surprises and uncover very fundamental and important new things , " he said .
The ISI is supported by grants from the National Science Foundation , the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Office of Naval Research .

The California Supreme Court upheld a lower court ’s ruling Wednesday protecting the religious freedom of a Christian private school that expelled two female students for having a lesbian relationship …
… in January , the 4th District Court of Appeal found that a religious private school is not a business , but a social organization that exists primarily to instill its values in students , and therefore is not subject to the civil rights laws that force California businesses to cater to the homosexual movement .
In letting the appeal court ’s ruling stand , Casey Mattox , litigation counsel for the Virginia - based Center for Law and Religious Freedom , said Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar's of the state ’s supreme court made " the correct decision . "
" We think it preserves religious freedom , " he said .

Cafes and restaurants across Britain have been selling chicken secretly injected with beef and pork waste , The Independent can reveal today .
In a hi-tech fraud run by firms in three EU states , food manufacturers are making bulking agents out of porcine and bovine gristle and bones that help inflate chicken breasts , so that they fetch a higher price .
The swindle was only detected by the Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) using new scientific techniques because the non-chicken material had been so highly processed it passed standard DNA tests .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Thousands of restaurateurs and cafe owners are likely to have been conned into buying chicken containing the powder – which binds water into chicken breasts – while diners have been unwittingly consuming traces of other animals when eating out .
Britain's two million Muslims , Jews and Hindus are forbidden from eating either pork or beef .
Muslims would ordinarily eat halal chicken and Jews kosher chicken sold through approved caterers and butchers .
The Hindu Forum of Britain described news of the adulteration , which will be confirmed publicly today , as " shocking and potentially very distressing " .
Its secretary general , Bharti Tailor , said : " Eating beef is expressly forbidden because cows are considered to be sacred as they are a representation of the bounty of the gods , even unknowingly .
The fact that the protein powders injected into chickens served in restaurants and cafes contain even traces of beef or pork is horrific .
And [ the fact ] that Hindus will have been eating beef contaminated chickens will be mentally agonising .
Many will feel that they have broken their religious code of conduct . "
The food regulator acknowledged the serious consequences of its findings .
" Use of these proteins does not make chicken products unsafe , but it is important that people are given accurate information about their food , " the FSA said .
The fraud has been taking place for at least the past two years , and still continues because of inaction by the authorities in three EU states , believed to be Germany , Netherlands and Spain .
The European Commission rebuffed British demands to ban beef and pork proteins from being added to chicken when first detected in the UK and Ireland in 2001 and 2003 .
Then , action was taken against a chicken company in the Netherlands and the authorities thought the problem had gone away .
When complaints began to surface again last year , the FSA launched a secret investigation to ascertain whether chicken – the most eaten meat in the UK – was being adulterated again .
At first , scientists could not find any non-chicken protein because the meat had been " de- natured " ( made unrecognisable ) .
The Central Science Laboratory in York and York University developed special DNA market tests .
" It 's like Olympic drug tests ; they stay one step ahead of the testers , " said a source close to the investigation .
Manufacturers in Germany and Spain are thought to be making the protein powders ;
Dutch firms inject them into chickens sold on to UK wholesalers supplying the catering trade .
Using a new DNA marker technique , the FSA tested five protein powders from three companies .
All five were found to contain a non-poultry material identified as bovine collagen .
Further tests found the presence of porcine material in two powders .
Tests picked up traces of beef in one of three chicken breasts .
In a report passed to The Independent , the FSA noted : " The study of a small number of injection powders used in chicken breast products has indicated the presence of undeclared , mammalian peptides , i.e. , from a non-poultry source in the samples analysed .
The analyses applied indicate the presence of bovine collagen in all the powders sampled and suggest the presence of porcine collagen in some of the powders . "
It added : " Certification accompanying the powders claim they are produced only from a poultry source , however , the analytical results suggest this claim could not be substantiated . "
Manufacturers can legally add water to chicken , for instance to improve succulence , but must declare water content of above 5 per cent .
Fresh chicken meat sold by supermarkets or butchers cannot have any added ingredients .
When the FSA alerted its continental counterparts , the factories involved were inspected but no legal action has been taken .
Some chicken products state on the label whether they contain hydrolised ( chicken ) proteins .
The FSA advised consumers that they " may wish " to avoid such chicken .
" If you are eating food from a restaurant or takeaway you should ask if the chicken served contains hydrolysed animal proteins , " the FSA will say today .
" Restaurants and catering establishments will have this information available to them . "
Sue Davies , chief policy adviser at the consumer group Which ? , said : " It 's bad enough that when you think you 're buying chicken what you 're paying for is an awful lot of water and other animal proteins but if you want to avoid beef or pork for religious reasons it 's going to be particularly shocking and annoying .
There 's a need for better enforcement action , or people will carry on doing this . "
Religious views : Sacred products
Judaism
Jews are forbidden from eating pork as pigs are considered unclean animals .
The Jewish dietary laws are the laws of kashrut ( keeping kosher ) .
Hence food in accord with Jewish law is termed kosher , food not in accord is treifah or treif .
Hinduism
Observant Hindus who eat meat almost always abstain from beef .
The cow is sacred and beef has been forbidden in the Hindu religion and diet .
Hindu society honours the cow and cow - slaughter is banned legally in almost Indian states .
The largely pastoral Vedic people and subsequent generations relied heavily on it for dairy products and tilling the fields .
Islam
Muslims are prohibited from eating pork products .
All meat must come from a herbivorous animal slaughtered and bled to death in the name of God by a Muslim , Jew or Christian , with the exception of game that one has hunted or fished for oneself .
Food permissible for Muslims is known as halal food .
Protein problems : Contaminated chicken
2001
The Food Standards Agency finds chicken with as little as 54 per cent meat and undeclared protein .
The FSA urges the Netherlands and Belgium to tackle exporters .
2003
The FSA and the Food Safety Agency of Ireland find beef and pork in Dutch chicken .
The FSAI warns that the EU and the Dutch are failing to police labelling rules .
The European Commission rejects a call to ban beef and pork proteins , saying the matter is " primarily an infringement of food labelling legislation " .
2004-2007
No new surveys on chicken are published .
Many believe the problem has gone away .
2008
FSA investigates new allegations , but pork and beef cannot be detected by conventional DNA tests as it has been " de- natured " ( rendered unidentifiable from its origins ) .
2009
Test results are obtained by The Independent .
It does n't take a genius to figure out why , out of all the big ass summer blockbusters this year , Transformers : Revenge Of The Fallen was the one I was least worried about performing .
Camp - as - Christmas Hugh Jackman trying and failing to unleash his inner animal ?
Cringe .
Christian Bale 's CHAN CANNAR trying to avoid termination at the hands of retardobots ?
A disaster waiting to happen .
But Transformers ?
Big robots fighting other big robots ?
Bright colours ?
Exploding helicopters ?
Sunsets ?
Michael Bay was hardly going to underwhelm , was he ?
Terminator Salvation director McG challenged Bay to a " dick measuring contest " between their admittedly similar - in - concept movies , but his efffort failed because it took itself far too seriously .
Transformers : Revenge Of The Fallen , however , succeeds because it 's ridiculous in all the right ways .
Check your brain in with your coat and soak in the most gloriously dumb spectacle of the year .
Revenge Of The Fallen picks up two years after the events of its predecessor .
The Autobots who defeated Megatron first time around are now working alongside the military in a top secret organisation , tasked with rooting out rogue Decepticons hiding around the world ; first stop , Shangai , and a shit - kicking unicycle the size of a skyscraper .
Meanwhile , Sam Witwicky ( LaBeouf ) is off to college , leaving behind his worried parents , his achingly hot girlfriend Mikaela ( Fox ) and his ride , Bumblebee .
But when he accidentally discovers a lost shard of the Allspark - that 's the energy - loaded Macguffin of the first movie , do keep up - he kick - starts a whole new ruckus that sees Megatron hauled back from the depths of the ocean and the Decepticons strengthen their numbers in order to ... um , take over the planet or something dumb like that .
Here 's the thing .
Revenge Of The Fallen is a kids ' movie ; the secret to enjoying it as an adult is to unlock the ten - year - old within ( and not the one in your cellar , bunnngg ) .
It is , in common parlance , completely and utterly retarded .
The juxtaposition between hardcore military war movie and shitty Saturday morning cartoon feels downright bizarre at times .
You 'll be creaming at the sight of the US army unloading their weapons on the enemy , only to feel a little ashamed when you remember their enemy is a race of evil alien robots who want to destroy the sun .
Somewhere towards the end , when you realise the plot literally centres around magic dust , you 'll feel ever - so - slightly silly for enjoying it .
But hey , fuck it : this is Transformers we 're talking about here - us geeks have waited a lifetime for these movies , and no film snob can make a movie about angry robots any less entertaining .
In truth , Revenge Of The Fallen does n't stray too far from the solid framework built in the first movie .
It mixes superb action sequences - directed with panache and almost pornographic glee by a never - better Bay - with frequent scenes of light comic relief , some of which work ( squabbling robo - hick siblings Skids and Mudflap provide a few laughs ) , some of which do n't ( Wheelie the RC truck humping Fox 's leg ) .
Similarly , Revenge Of The Fallen shares its predecessor 's tin ear for the spoken word .
Dialogue , as if it even matters , is delivered at breakneck speed and is barely audible amongst the cacophony of metal on metal .
What can be heard is n't much worth listening to - it does n't feel much like a script , rather a transcription of Action Man 's greatest pull - string catchphrases .
In Michael Bay 's universe , soldiers really do say " Bring the rain ! " and villains really do snarl " This is n't over ! "
But come on .
Like you even care .
LaBeouf has less to do this time around , nudged out of the spotlight by a growing roster of robots .
He runs , he shouts , he flirts , he grimaces - he 's good , not great .
Megan
Fox , bless her , is required to do little else other than be Megan Fox - she 's hot , not entirely necessary .
The best human representatives are , bizarrely , Sam 's mother and father , who make the practically robot - free first half hour just breeze by , as they did in the original .
Naturally , the robots are the real stars again .
Optimus Prime is just as cool here as you 'd always hoped - his twin - sword showdown with three Decepticons is the kind of kick - ass fight scene that 'll make even the hairs on the back of non-fans ' necks stand on end .
Bumblebee gets a few chances to shine and is perhaps the best example of having a CG alien robot ' emote ' - tellingly , of course , he speaks no actual words .
Comparatively , the movie 's big bads let the side down somewhat .
Megatron , back from the dead , is still slightly underwhelming , lacking that much - missed Frank Welker snivel that made his cartoon iteration so loathsome .
The titular Fallen is hard to truly hate , given his spindly frame and lack of decent screen - time .
Devastator - the 120 foot high beast made from seven separate Constructicons - though technically astounding , is criminally underused : you can see the money burning every second he 's on screen .
( Worry not , DreamWorks - next year 's VFX Oscar is a lock . )
But damn , if it is n't fun watching them go to town on each other .
Each character boasts at least one bona fide badass moment , whether it 's Sideways crashing through a Chinese apartment block , Bumblebee taking the head off an opponent or Prime receiving a last - reel system upgrade .
Sure , some characters only exist for such visual flourishes ; motorbike bot Arcee vanishes after the opening act ( shame , since she 's the only girl Autobot ) while rickety old plane Jetfire acts only as a deliver of pained exposition .
But Revenge Of The Fallen is a movie that 's so thoroughly entertaining , such inconsistencies can be ignored : you 'll simply be having too much fun to notice .
Yes , you could level the same accusations at Transformers as I and many others lobbed at Terminator Salvation .
It 's over - long ; it has plot holes you could steer an aircraft carrier through ; it 's loud and stupid and relies too much on pyrotechnics .
But the difference is , the Terminator franchise was never designed to be consumed and enjoyed as blockbuster entertainment .
Transformers , on the other hand , was built from the ground up to be a popcorn - devouring , eye - popping , nostalgia - sparking crowd - pleaser - and Revenge Of The Fallen sees Michael Bay tick all those boxes and more .
The contest is over - not only does Bay have the bigger dick , he 's made the better film as well .

At a meeting of FOTA teams in London today it was decided to suspend the membership of the Williams team , after they broke ranks and submitted an entry to the 2010 world championship .
“ Fota ’s decision , although regrettable , is understandable , ” said team boss Frank Williams .
“ As a company whose only business is F1 with obligations to our partners and employees entering was unquestionable .
In addition we are legally obliged under our contract with FOM and the FIA to participate in the world championship until the end of 2012 . ”
Williams acknowledged that the suspension of the team is temporary , pending ongoing negotiations with the FIA over the rules for next season .
FOTA had no choice really and although their discussions concern the longer term issues which will also concern Williams , it is a sign of the irritation of the other teams that one of their number has been picked off , thus breaking the ‘ all for one and one for all ’ spirit which has made FOTA a force in F1 politics since its foundation last September .
It remains to be seen whether any of the other teams who signed up to a similar deal to Williams in 2005 feel that they are legally obliged to submit an entry by Friday ’s deadline , particularly Force India .
The Williams team has been one of the staunchest supporters of the idea of the budget cap and believes that the proposed £ 40 million level is about right .
Meanwhile talks continue .
I ’m on the fence about this yarn and not so sure that it is “ yearn worthy ” but felt that a good discussion about it was .
Caron yarns has a new entry into our yarn vernacular called Simply Soft Eco.
Simply Soft Eco is similar to Caron ’s other yarns made from acrylic , but contains 20 % of recycled PET content .
If you recall PET is plastic water or soda bottles and is popping up in recycled form in various places such as EcoFelt , fabric blends , clothing , bags , and even boats !
What I find really wonderful about this yarn is that it has recycled content , a huge selection of colors and that it is available in big box stores – great for when you do n’t have access to a small indie shop .
What makes me pause is the low amount of recycled content to begin with , but I guess it is better than none .
Caron is already boasting 1 million bottles recycled and that “ every 10 skeins of Simply Soft Eco saves 6 plastic bottles from America ’s landfills . ”
Huh ?
I ’m not so sure I would talk that statistic up .
How about 6 bottles saved per skein ?
The other thought provoking thing about this yarn is that Caron has had to already answer some interesting questions about the safty of PET .
Consumers wanted to know about phthalates in the yarn ( there are n’t any ) , clearly referring to CIPSA , if the bottles used in the yarn are clean ( they are ) and if it would cause allergies ( everyone is different ) .
There are also concerns about the plastic bits or “ flecks ” in the yarn itself , making me wonder of the craftsmanship of the yarn .
For those who do not use wool , it is possibly a good animal free product for your knitting and crochet needs .
But I ’m still stuck on the 20 % .
What do you think ?
Would you use this yarn ?
Is it a large company trying to get in on the green band wagon or a good acrylic yarn alternative ?
Please share your thoughts in the comments .

God -given reason and the Bill of Rights have just taken a beating from a federal judge .
The judge , James Selna , ruled that when history teacher of 20 years James Corbett referred to the Bible teaching of creation as " religious , superstitious nonsense " that he violated the First Amendment by attacking Christianity .
The First Amendment reads : " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . "
Nowhere in the First Amendment does it state that a public employee cannot be critical of religion .
Especially a teacher !
That 's all Mr. Corbett was doing .
He was not " prohibiting the free exercise " of religion , he was simply stating that the story of creation in the Bible is superstitious nonsense .
What the judge is doing is prohibiting freedom of speech for public school teachers and narrowing the scope of ideas that students can learn about .
The student who was offended by Mr. Corbett , Chad Farnan , used the Christian legal group Advocates For Faith & Freedom to sue his teacher and his school .
This is a group of Christian lawyers who falsely , yet , strongly , believe that " America was founded on Judeo - Christian principles . "
I guess they 've never read either the Declaration of Independence which only refers to God in Deistic terms referring to " Nature 's God " , not the Bible god , or the U.S. Constitution which does n't refer to God at all .
And since these " lawyers " probably have n't read either of these two key documents , I 'm certain they 're not aware of the Treaty of Tripoli , which plainly and clearly states in Article XI , " As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion . . . . "
The Treaty of Tripoli was started in the administration of George Washington and ratified in the administration of John Adams .
Judge Selna wrote in his ruling that " Corbett states an unequivocal belief that creationism is ' superstitious nonsense . '
The Court cannot discern a legitimate secular purpose in this statement , even when considered in context .
The statement therefore constitutes improper disapproval of religion in violation of the Establishment Clause . "
As an educated person , Selna should immediately recognize that there is great " secular purpose " in Mr. Corbett 's statement .
The purpose of education should be to teach critical thinking .
The Bible story of creation is , on its face , superstitious nonsense !
For example , how could there be days and light before the Sun existed ?
This Bible story in itself provides many examples of superstitious nonsense .
What a great teaching exercise it would be in critical thinking to have a class dissect just this one Bible myth !
As is the case in libel and slander actions , should n't truth be considered when looking at what teachers teach their students ?
For a teacher to be legally required to refrain from pointing out an obvious absurdity of a religion simply because it is a religion that is making the unreasonable claim is wrong .
Should teachers be required to pretend that the Bible promise at Matthew 21:22 of getting anything you ask for in a prayer is true ?
At Leviticus 20:9 , the Bible teaches that children who curse their parents should be stoned to death .
Is it wrong for a teacher to say that that is a terrible idea and a dangerous teaching ?
Or should she or he let their class think that by their silence they are giving their approval ?

Judge Attacks First Amendment

Overload & innovation in Twitter clients
I was at the Glue conference recently and one complaint I heard frequently about Twitter was that people were being overwhelmed with the amount of data coming in - to the point that Twitter had become useless to them after they ’d followed greater than x people .
At first , this confused me .
I ’ve never considered tweets “ must - read ” .
If I did , I ’d never get anything done .
Instead , I just sort of slurp from the fire hose periodically .
If I see something cool , great .
If I miss it , oh well .
As a data consumer , I use Twitter basically the same way I use radio .
So it surprised me that other people were consuming Twitter more similarly to email - that is , as a set of messages that all required attention .
With that usage scenario , it made a lot more sense to complain about the volume of incoming data .
And they ’re not alone .
I ’ve seen a fair number of tweets about what other people should or should not tweet - certain tweets are considered annoying .
Case in point - I personally dislike seeing twenty posts a day from someone live tweeting some event .
But asking people to apply a filter on the data producer side seems entirely backwards .
Sure , I do n’t like conference tweets , but I ’m sure somebody out there must like them .
What we really need is a lot more innovation on the data consumer side - i.e. in the Twitter clients .
Now , I wo n’t claim to be an expert on Twitter clients ( I ’ve only tried TweetDeck , Nambu , and Tweetie so far ) , but from what I ’ve seen , they ’ve mainly just wrapped the default Twitter feature set in ( very nice - looking ) non-web UIs .
Admittedly , there are some cool features - cross-service support ( e.g. Facebook ) , grouping contacts , and threaded conversations .
But to really solve the Twitter overload problem , we need clients that make the next leap forward .
Here ’s a few features that would dramatically help data consumers ( if any clients have these features , please let me know in the comments ) .
Groups
I know some clients already support this , but this concept can be pushed further .
Basically , I want configurable categories so I can break people I follow into groups .
One one end are those people whose updates I want to treat as “ must - read ” .
On the other end are people I felt obligated to follow but do n’t really care about .
And there are a few groups in between .
Popular Links
I may not read every tweet , but if the same blog post gets mentioned by a significant portion of the people I follow , chances are I ’ll be interested in it .
A client could follow links through the URL shorteners a few times a day and compile a daily list , sorted by popularity .
Micro-trends
Along the same lines , it ’d be cool to have a personalized version of Twitter trends .
I ’m likely much more interested in the trends specific to my network than those of the Twittersphere as a whole .
Topics
I ’m often interested in tweets using a particular keyword .
I should be able to either pull all those tweets into my main stream or , alternately , pull those tweets into a separate stream for viewing - and have them update automatically .
Ignoring
Sometimes I feel spammed by live tweeting or by a particularly talky user .
I ’d love a way to filter out all tweets by a particular user or featuring a particular hash tag for a few hours or a few days .
Bayesian Filtering
If it works for spam , why ca n’t it help me filter my Twitterstream ?
I ’d be happy to train the system by identifying tweets I like and do n’t like if it helped me pull really great stuff out of the river of incoming tweets .
In a nutshell , I want to play ninja with my incoming data - slice it , dice it , organize it , prioritize it , filter it , and mash it up * .
And I do n’t think Twitter should provide any of this .
Their job is just to help you publish your tweets to the world .
Instead , we need a competitive ecosystem of Twitter clients to create innovative ( and customizable ) interfaces to help each of us drink from this fire hose of information in our own unique ways .
What features would you like to see the in next generation of Twitter clients ?
* I do , however , think it makes sense for producers to create different channels of information for widely different contexts .
You see this already when people create multiple Twitter accounts - for example , one for personal stuff , one for professional stuff .
When I tried to push my Twitter updates to Facebook , it was a disaster .
The content of my Twitter updates were mostly technical or professional - to my old high school friends , that content seemed either unbearably boring or annoyingly self - promoting .
I had to recognize that they were fundamentally different channels , and I do n’t think any client is going to help my followers separate those contexts effectively ( at least not without a lot of effort on their part ) .
As Iranians go to the polls to repudiate ( it seems ) some of the most pernicious aspects of Ahmadinejad ’s rule , America ’s Iran point man continues to make Ahmadinejad look like a reasonable peacenik .
The newly released book by Dennis Ross , President Obama ’s special adviser on Iran , reads like a how - to manual for launching a war on Iran , marketing the war successfully , and making sure the Iranians cop all the blame for it .
Ross will have none of Bush ’s incompetent warmongering on flimsy pretenses of democracy and WMD’s ; when Ross launches his illegal war on Iran , it will be stage - managed to within an inch of its life .
“ Tougher policies – either militarily or meaningful containment – will be easier to sell internationally and domestically if we have diplomatically tried to resolve our differences with Iran in a serious and credible fashion , ” writes Ross .
Note that there is no way to read this sentence but to see that the goal is to attack Iran .
America trying to diplomatically resolve its differences with Iran is not a goal in itself ; it is merely a means to more easily sell war and sanctions .
And , then , of course , we get the special Dennis Ross brand of peacemaking - as - warmongering — Ross ’s signature dish : derailing negotiations while making it appear to be the other party ’s fault .
“ Such an approach may build pressures within Iran not to forgo the opportunity that has been presented , while also ensuring that the onus is put on Iran for creating a crisis and also for making conflict more likely . ”
The goal , of course , is not just to bring about a military conflict , but also to make sure that it appears that it was the Iranians who brought about this conflict .
This is exactly what Ross did as “ mediator ” of the Palestinian - Israeli negotiations , where he used diplomacy to further the aims of Israeli colonialism , as a cover for Israeli colonialism .
As Norman Finkelstein shows in his meticulous destruction of Ross ’ previous book , it was Ross himself who derailed the Palestinian - Israeli negotiations .
Ross simply used his position as “ mediator ” to push for terms that were even more favorable to Israel than what the Israelis themselves wanted .
During the negotiations , he became “ furious ” at Israelis for considering annexing less land in Palestine , and even said “ if [ Ehud ]
Barak offers anything more , I ’ll be against this agreement . ”
The result was a “ generous offer ” on which then Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben - Ami himself commented : “ if I were a Palestinian I would have rejected Camp David ” .
But when the Palestinians rejected this offer , of course , it was a green light for “ Israel ’s Lawyer ” to spend the last nine years blaming the Palestinians for rejecting his magnanimous offer .
The result is a global green light for the Israeli regime to destroy the Palestinian people and their chances of ever attaining freedom — while placing the blame entirely on the Palestinians .
America can now look forward to seeing this mendacious brand of evil shaping their policy towards Iran over the coming years .
Expect to continue to hear Ross talking about the failures of his heroic efforts at diplomacy , and then going on a WINEP - sponsored world tour blaming the Iranians for the conflict he worked so hard to precipitate .
This should leave no doubt that though the Obama Administration is mainly made up of sane humans who do not particularly want to nuke Iran , unreconstructed neocon fanatics like Ross will do all they can to bring about as bad an outcome as possible .
Watch this space .

NASA has always done cool things , but its latest mission is really a sci- fi geek 's dream come true , as it includes flying a rocket into the moon , triggering a huge explosion .
The purpose of the mission is to discover whether there 's frozen water in the craters near the moon 's south pole .
If water is indeed found , it could have very important implications for further human missions on the moon , as a potential source for oxygen ( you know why we need that ) and hydrogen ( for rocket fuel ) .
You can read about the mission in detail here , here , and here , but here 's a very short version : LCROSS ( Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite ) will send the Centaur rocket which helped it out of Earth 's orbit into the moon at a high speed , ejecting debris from the surface of one of moon 's craters .
LCROSS ' specialized instruments will then analyze the debris for the presence of water , before impacting the moon itself .
LCROSS ' launch date is today ; it 's scheduled to launch at about 08:30 PDT .
What 's especially cool about this mission is the fact that NASA is providing us with a variety of ways to follow the launch and the mission during the next four months .
First , you can watch the launch live at NASA TV .
You can also follow LCROSS on Facebook and Twitter .
Finally , for pictures related to the mission , check out NASA 's Twitpic account .
If everything goes well , LCROSS should impact the moon in about 111 days .
NASA promises the moon wo n't be damaged ( much ) , but you never know with these scientist types .
We 'll be watching closely ; ) .
Every June for centuries , Pisa and its leaning tower have been illuminated by thousands of candles and oil lamps to celebrate its patron saint , Ranieri , in one of the most atmospheric festivals in Tuscany .
But tomorrow night , for the first time , participation in the Luminara festival will be compulsory under a new city law , with police set to roam the twinkling city to slap fines of up to € 500 [ £ 420 ] on anyone caught without a candle in their window .
The city council insists the new law is essential to prevent " black holes " of darkness ruining the overall effect of the 80,000 - candle festival .
" Unfortunately black holes in the buildings along the river are a real offence to the city 's beauty , " Federico Eligi , the council 's celebrations chief , told the Corriere della Sera newspaper .
" There 's also a security issue , since the public lighting system is completely shut off and the candles are the only things illuminating the streets . "
But some Pisans are furious , especially since the law requires non-Christians to take part in the Luminara .
" You can't require people to celebrate a saint with a candle , and you can't deny people the freedom not to participate in a festival , " said Alfonso Maurizio Iacono , head of literature and philosophy at Pisa University .
Remo Bodei , another philosophy professor , disagreed : " St Ranieri is no longer a religious festival but a celebration of the city , and an ugly Luminara is n't decorous .
Now it will be even more charming . "
The unfortunate uselessness of most ’ state of the art ’ academic monetary economics
Willem Buiter
Standard macroeconomic theory did not help foresee the crisis , nor has it helped understand it or craft solutions .
This columns argues that both the New Classical and New Keynesian complete markets macroeconomic theories not only did not allow the key questions about insolvency and illiquidity to be answered .
They did not allow such questions to be asked .
A new paradigm is needed .
The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England I was privileged to be a ‘ founder ’ external member of during the years 1997 - 2000 contained , like its successor vintages of external and executive members , quite a strong representation of academic economists and other professional economists with serious technical training and backgrounds .
This turned out to be a severe handicap when the central bank had to switch gears and change from being an inflation - targeting central bank under conditions of orderly financial markets to a financial stability - oriented central bank under conditions of widespread market illiquidity and funding illiquidity .
Indeed , the typical graduate macroeconomics and monetary economics training received at Anglo - American universities during the past 30 years or so , may have set back by decades serious investigations of aggregate economic behaviour and economic policy - relevant understanding .
It was a privately and socially costly waste of time and other resources .
Most mainstream macroeconomic theoretical innovations since the 1970s ( the New Classical rational expectations revolution associated with such names as Robert E. Lucas Jr. , Edward Prescott , Thomas Sargent , Robert Barro etc , and the New Keynesian theorizing of Michael Woodford and many others ) have turned out to be self - referential , inward - looking distractions at best .
Research tended to be motivated by the internal logic , intellectual sunk capital and aesthetic puzzles of established research programmes rather than by a powerful desire to understand how the economy works - let alone how the economy works during times of stress and financial instability .
So the economics profession was caught unprepared when the crisis struck .
Complete markets
The most influential New Classical and New Keynesian theorists all worked in what economists call a ‘ complete markets paradigm ’ .
In a world where there are markets for contingent claims trading that span all possible states of nature ( all possible contingencies and outcomes ) , and in which intertemporal budget constraints are always satisfied by assumption , default , bankruptcy and insolvency are impossible .
As a result , illiquidity - both funding illiquidity and market illiquidity - are also impossible , unless the guilt - ridden economic theorist imposes some unnatural ( given the structure of the models he is working with ) , arbitrary friction (s ) , that made something called ‘ money ’ more liquid than everything else , but for no good reason .
The irony of modelling liquidity by imposing money as a constraint on trade was lost on the profession .
Both the New Classical and New Keynesian complete markets macroeconomic theories not only did not allow questions about insolvency and illiquidity to be answered .
They did not allow such questions to be asked .
It is clear that , when searching for an appropriate simplification to address the intractable mess of modern market economies , the starting point of ‘ no markets ’ , that is , autarky or no trade , is a much better one than that of ‘ complete markets ’ .
Goods and services that are potentially tradable are indexed by time , place and state of nature or state of the world .
Time is a continuous variable , meaning that for complete markets along the time dimension alone , there would have to be rather more markets for future delivery ( infinitely many in any time interval , no matter how small ) than you can shake a stick at .
Location likewise is a continuous variable in a 3 - dimensional space .
Again rather too many markets .
Add uncertainty ( states of nature or states of the world ) , never mind private or asymmetric information , and ‘ too many potential markets ’ , if I may ruin the wonderful quote from Amadeus attributed to Emperor Joseph II , comes to mind .
If any market takes a finite amount of resources ( however small ) to function , complete markets would exhaust the resources of the universe .
Beyond this simple ‘ impossibility of complete markets ’ proposition , there is the deeper point , that the assumption of complete markets in most of the New Classical and New Keynesian macroeconomics assumes away the problem of contract enforcement .
This problem is especially acute in trade over time or intertemporal trade , where the net value to each party to a contract of fulfilling the terms of the contract varies over time and can change sign .
In a world with selfish , rational , opportunistic agents , able and willing to lie and deceive , only a small set of voluntary transactions will ever be observed , relative to the universe of all potentially feasible transactions .
The first set of voluntary exchange - based transactions we are likely to see are self - enforcing contracts - those based on long - term relationships , repeated interactions and trust .
There are some of those , but not too many .
The second are those voluntarily - entered - into contracts that are not self - enforcing ( say because interactions between the same sets of agents are infrequent and market participants have a degree of anonymity that prevents the use of reputation as a self - enforcement mechanism ) but are instead enforced by some external agent or third party , often the state , sometimes the Mafia ( sometimes it ’s hard to tell who is who ) .
Third party enforcement of contracts is again often complex and costly , which is why it covers relatively few contracts .
It requires that the terms of the contract and the contingencies it contains be third - party observable and verifiable .
Again , only a limited set of exchanges can be supported this way .
The conclusion , boys and girls , should be that trade - voluntary exchange - is the exception rather than the rule and that markets are inherently and hopelessly incomplete .
Live with it and start from that fact .
The benchmark is no trade - pre-Friday Robinson Crusoe autarky .
For every good , service or financial instrument that plays a role in your ‘ model of the world ’ , you should explain why a market for it exists - why it is traded at all .
Perhaps we shall get somewhere this time .
The Auctioneer at the end of time
In both the New Classical and New Keynesian approaches to monetary theory ( and to aggregative macroeconomics in general ) , the strongest version of the efficient markets hypothesis ( EMH ) was maintained .
This is the hypothesis that asset prices aggregate and fully reflect all relevant fundamental information , and thus provide the proper signals for resource allocation .
Even during the seventies , eighties , nineties and noughties before 2007 , the manifest failure of the EMH in many key asset markets was obvious to virtually all those whose cognitive abilities had not been warped by a modern Anglo - American Ph.D. education .
But most of the profession continued to swallow the EMH hook , line and sinker , although there were influential advocates of reason throughout , including James Tobin , Robert Shiller , George Akerlof , Hyman Minsky , Joseph Stiglitz and behaviourist approaches to finance .
The influence of the heterodox approaches from within macroeconomics and from other fields of economics on mainstream macroeconomics - the New Classical and New Keynesian approaches - was , however , strictly limited .
In financial markets , and in asset markets , real and financial , in general , today ’s asset price depends on the view market participants take of the likely future behaviour of asset prices .
If today ’s asset price depends on today ’s anticipation of tomorrow ’s price , and tomorrow ’s price likewise depends on tomorrow ’s expectation of the price the day after tomorrow , etc. ad nauseam , it is clear that today ’s asset price depends in part on today ’s anticipation of asset prices arbitrarily far into the future .
Since there is no obvious finite terminal date for the universe ( few macroeconomists study cosmology in their spare time ) , most economic models with rational asset pricing imply that today ’s price depend in part on today ’s anticipation of the asset price in the infinitely remote future .
What can we say about the terminal behaviour of asset price expectations ?
The tools and techniques of dynamic mathematical optimisation imply that , when a mathematical programmer computes an optimal programme for some constrained dynamic optimisation problem he is trying to solve , it is a requirement of optimality that the influence of the infinitely distant future on the programmer ’s criterion function today be zero .
And then a small miracle happens .
An optimality criterion from a mathematical dynamic optimisation approach is transplanted , lock , stock and barrel to the behaviour of long - term price expectations in a decentralised market economy .
In the mathematical programming exercise it is clear where the terminal boundary condition in question comes from .
The terminal boundary condition that the influence of the infinitely distant future on asset prices today vanishes , is a ‘ transversality condition ’ that is part of the necessary and sufficient conditions for an optimum .
But in a decentralised market economy there is no mathematical programmer imposing the terminal boundary conditions to make sure everything will be all right .
The common practice of solving a dynamic general equilibrium model of a ( n ) ( often competitive ) market economy by solving an associated programming problem , that is , an optimisation problem , is evidence of the fatal confusion in the minds of much of the economics profession between shadow prices and market prices and between transversality conditions that are an integral part of the solution to an optimisation problem and the long - term expectations that characterise the behaviour of decentralised asset markets .
The efficient markets hypothesis assumes that there is a friendly auctioneer at the end of time - a God - like father figure - who makes sure that nothing untoward happens with long - term price expectations or ( in a complete markets model ) with the present discounted value of terminal asset stocks or financial wealth .
What this shows , not for the first time , is that models of the economy that incorporate the EMH - and this includes the complete markets core of the New Classical and New Keynesian macroeconomics - are not models of decentralised market economies , but models of a centrally planned economy .
The friendly auctioneer at the end of time , who ensures that the right terminal boundary conditions are imposed to preclude , for instance , rational speculative bubbles , is none other than the omniscient , omnipotent and benevolent central planner .
No wonder modern macroeconomics is in such bad shape .
The EMH is surely the most notable empirical fatality of the financial crisis .
By implication , the complete markets macroeconomics of Lucas , Woodford et. al. is the most prominent theoretical fatality .
The future surely belongs to behavioural approaches relying on empirical studies on how market participants learn , form views about the future and change these views in response to changes in their environment , peer group effects etc .
Confusing the equilibrium of a decentralised market economy , competitive or otherwise , with the outcome of a mathematical programming exercise should no longer be acceptable .
So , no Oikomenia , there is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow , and no Auctioneer at the end of time .
Linearise and trivialise
If one were to hold one ’s nose and agree to play with the New Classical or New Keynesian complete markets toolkit , it would soon become clear that any potentially policy - relevant model would be highly non-linear , and that the interaction of these non-linearities and uncertainty makes for deep conceptual and technical problems .
Macroeconomists are brave , but not that brave .
So they took these non-linear stochastic dynamic general equilibrium models into the basement and beat them with a rubber hose until they behaved .
This was achieved by completely stripping the model of its non-linearities and by achieving the transubstantiation of complex convolutions of random variables and non-linear mappings into well - behaved additive stochastic disturbances .
Those of us who have marvelled at the non-linear feedback loops between asset prices in illiquid markets and the funding illiquidity of financial institutions exposed to these asset prices through mark - to - market accounting , margin requirements , calls for additional collateral etc. will appreciate what is lost by this castration of the macroeconomic models .
Threshold effects , critical mass , tipping points , non-linear accelerators - they are all out of the window .
Those of us who worry about endogenous uncertainty arising from the interactions of boundedly rational market participants cannot but scratch our heads at the insistence of the mainline models that all uncertainty is exogenous and additive .
Technically , the non-linear stochastic dynamic models were linearised ( often log - linearised ) at a deterministic ( non-stochastic ) steady state .
The analysis was further restricted by only considering forms of randomness that would become trivially small in the neighbourhood of the deterministic steady state .
Linear models with additive random shocks we can handle - almost !
Even this was not quite enough to get going , however .
As pointed out earlier , models with forward - looking ( rational ) expectations of asset prices will be driven not just by conventional , engineering - type dynamic processes where the past drives the present and the future , but also in part by past and present anticipations of the future .
When you linearise a model , and shock it with additive random disturbances , an unfortunate by - product is that the resulting linearised model behaves either in a very strongly stabilising fashion or in a relentlessly explosive manner .
There is no ‘ bounded instability ’ in such models .
The dynamic stochastic general equilibrium ( DSGE ) crowd saw that the economy had not exploded without bound in the past , and concluded from this that it made sense to rule out , in the linearised model , the explosive solution trajectories .
What they were left with was something that , following an exogenous random disturbance , would return to the deterministic steady state pretty smartly .
No L - shaped recessions .
No processes of cumulative causation and bounded but persistent decline or expansion .
Just nice V - shaped recessions .
There actually are approaches to economics that treat non-linearities seriously .
Much of this work is numerical - analytical results of a policy - relevant nature are few and far between - but at least it attempts to address the problems as they are , rather than as we would like them lest we be asked to venture outside the range of issued we can address with the existing toolkit .
The practice of removing all non-linearities and most of the interesting aspects of uncertainty from the models that were then let loose on actual numerical policy analysis was a major step backwards .
I trust it has been relegated to the dustbin of history by now in those central banks that matter .
Conclusion
Charles Goodhart , who was fortunate enough not to encounter complete markets macroeconomics and monetary economics during his impressionable , formative years , but only after he had acquired some intellectual immunity , once said of the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium approach which for a while was the staple of central banks ’ internal modelling : “ It excludes everything I am interested in ” .
He was right .
It excludes everything relevant to the pursuit of financial stability .
The Bank of England in 2007 faced the onset of the credit crunch with too much Robert Lucas , Michael Woodford and Robert Merton in its intellectual cupboard .
A drastic but chaotic re-education took place and is continuing .
I believe that the Bank has by now shed the conventional wisdom of the typical macroeconomics training of the past few decades .
In its place is an intellectual potpourri of factoids , partial theories , empirical regularities without firm theoretical foundations , hunches , intuitions and half - developed insights .
It is not much , but knowing that you know nothing is the beginning of wisdom .

UBC graduate journalism students Heba Elasaad ( far left ) , Krysia Collyer ( second from left ) , Blake Sifton ( centre ) and Prof.
Dan McKinney ( far right ) spent 10 days in February in Ghana shooting a documentary on e-waste .
( ( Courtesy of Blake Sifton ) )
A hard drive containing information about multimillion - dollar U.S. defence contracts was obtained in Ghana by a group of Vancouver journalism students as they probed what happens to developed nations ' discarded and donated electronics .
" It 's pretty shocking , " said Blake Sifton , one of three UBC graduate journalism students who purchased the device containing information related to contracts between the Pentagon , the Department of Homeland Security and military contractor Northrop Grumman .
The hard drive cost the students just $ 40 .
" You 'd think a security contractor that constantly deals with very secret proprietary information would probably want to wipe their drives , " Sifton said Tuesday .
He visited Ghana for 10 days in February with classmates Heba Elasaad and Krysia Collyer and Prof .
Dan McKinney while making the documentary Ghana : Digital Dumping Ground for an international reporting course .
The finished documentary looks at problems arising as discarded computers , televisions and other " e- waste " make their way from North America and Europe to the markets and slums of West Africa .
It was broadcast Tuesday on the season finale of the PBS program Frontline / World .
The team bought seven hard drives at a bustling market in Tema , a major port near the capital city of Accra where a lot of electronic waste from Europe and North America enters Africa .
One of the unformatted drives contained personal information and photos from a family in the U.K .
Another was from New Zealand , and another contained the U.S. security data .
Special skills or software were n't required to access the data , said Peter Klein , who teaches the international reporting course and supervised the documentary project .
" We plugged them in and started reading files ….
They were just sitting there . "
Northrop Grumman declined to be interviewed by the students , but said it was looking into how the hard drive got to the Ghanaian market , and asked the students to return it , which they did not .
In a statement emailed to CBC News Tuesday evening , the company said it has a detailed procedure for disposing of equipment such as hard drives .
" Based on the documents we were shown , we believe this hard drive may have been stolen after one of our asset - disposal vendors took possession of the unit , " the company said , adding that " no company can inoculate itself completely against crime . "
Though the export of e-waste is technically banned by international treaties , it often winds up on long journeys to the developing world , the students found .
Some students in the class followed the e-waste to China and India — countries where e-waste is known to be dumped .
Many people are n't aware of the other path e-waste can take — to Africa , via donations of used electronics , Klein said .
Sifton , who graduated in May , said many exporters know that most computers they bring into Ghana are n't working .
Parts that work may be sold at the market , while the rest ends up in a nearby dump known as Agbogbloshie .
Charred toxic wasteland
' It 's incredibly difficult to breathe ' at the dump , said Blake Sifton , as up to seven fires are typically spewing ' black , sticky , acrid smoke ' at any one time .
( ( UBC Graduate School of Journalism ) )
" It 's essentially this charred toxic wasteland , " Sifton recalled Tuesday .
" The ground is just scorched absolutely everywhere .
Everywhere you walk , there 's shards of plastic and metal and glass protruding from the ground . "
Boys scramble about in flip - flops , helping young men smash piles of old computer monitors , televisions , and radios , rip out the wires , and burn them in fires fed by insulation from old refrigerators .
In that way , they extract lumps of copper that they sell for less than 50 cents a kilogram , Sifton said .
" It 's incredibly difficult to breathe because there 's usually between five and six and seven fires going at any time …. and there 's tons and tons of this black , sticky , acrid smoke coming out of them . "
After visiting the dump , Sifton would spend 20 minutes trying to clean the dark , smoky residue off his skin .
Separated from the dump by a toxic , lifeless river was a shantytown of metal and wood shacks .
Despite the horrific living conditions , however , the residents were very generous and welcoming , Sifton recalled .
People who donate their computers typically do n't picture them ending up in either Agbogbloshie or the market in Tema , but put to good use .
Sifton said he did visit universities in Ghana equipped with computers that would have been unaffordable if they had n't been donated .
He fears that people will increasingly start donating computers without the hard drives , rendering them useless and compounding the problem .
Hard drives can be safely donated : experts
One of the hard drives contained personal information and photos of a family in the U.K .
Another contained sensitive data about U.S. defence contracts .
( ( UBC Graduate School of Journalism ) ) Fiaaz Walji , senior director of sales for Websense Inc. , a computer , internet and data security firm , said the case involving the Northrop Grumman data is scary , and when people do n't erase their hard drives before disposal , " the risks are huge . "
" If you look at some of the bad guys … this is part of what they do , " he said .
" They go and scour hard drives and look for information , " such as personal information that can be used in identity theft and fraud .
Nevertheless ,
Walji does n't think it 's necessary to destroy the hard drive .
" That does n't help from a recycling perspective . "
He said high - level data wiping methods that write over the old data should be sufficient .
Cliff Missen , director of a project that has donated hundreds of computers to African universities , said he has never heard of anyone in Africa recovering data from a hard drive that has been wiped three or four times , even though it 's theoretically possible .
Missen 's Widernet project at the University of Iowa has donated hundreds of computers , mainly from corporate donors , to universities in Ethiopia , Liberia and Nigeria .
Most arrive with " just about everything " on the hard drive , but Widernet erases them , refurbishes the computers with extra memory , and packages up spare parts , before shipping them off .
Even though the computers are only delivered as part of computer training programs , the cost of security means some are stolen and may not end up where they were intended , he said .
Consumers should be vigilant : Sifton
Meanwhile , Sifton hopes people wo n't get too caught up in the cybersecurity element of the story his team has been trying to tell .
" The big picture here is that there 's thousands of tonnes of toxic waste — because we want the newer computer , newer TV , or the newer cellphone — being sent and poisoning children in Ghana , " he said .
He wants people to think about whether they really need a new , bigger , flat - screen TV before throwing their old one out .
But he acknowledged that when electronics do get too old , it is n't easy for consumers to know what to do with them .
" You do n't really know where your computer 's going to end up , even if you have the best intentions .
It 's hard ….
I just hope people will think twice and maybe be a little more vigilant when they 're donating their computer . "
In August of 2008 , the Yahoo User Interface team released the first preview release of YUI 3 , a complete rewrite of YUI from the ground up ( the first beta release of which is due out some time next week ! ) .
Why would they rewrite an already useful and mature library , you might ask ?
Well , as YUI 2 matured , the manner in which it was built also evolved .
As a result , parts of YUI that were present from the beginning were coded in an entirely different way from parts that were added later on .
The result was that the library contained inconsistencies – both in the internal mechanics and the API .
So , the team decided that they ’d bring the library back to basics and rebuild it from the ground up .
Their plan was to apply the experience they gained from the past three years of working on YUI and build a library that was lighter , faster , and easier to use .
Finally , in an effort to make the library as flexible as possible , YUI 3 introduces an all new plugin architecture that allows you to add your own functionality to nodes and widgets .
We ’ll see one such plugin in action a little later .
First , let ’s see what ’s new in YUI 3 .
Goodbye YAHOO , hello YUI
The first bit you ’ll notice when looking at YUI 3 code examples is the new global object name that it uses .
The old YAHOO global object has been replaced with the new YUI global object .
It was renamed for a couple of reasons : user feedback suggested that some companies disliked having the Yahoo name in their code ; but more importantly , it allows older versions of YUI to coexist with YUI 3 by virtue of having a different variable name .
As well as the global object being renamed , its usage is based on a fundamentally different principle than in 2.x .
For starters , it ’s no longer a static object but rather a function that , when executed , returns an instance of itself .
Now , every execution of YUI returns a self - contained environment where the version of the library and the version of all of its loaded components can run without interfering with any other instance of YUI on the page .
By extension this also means that multiple versions of the library can coexist on the same page , by instantiating different versions of the YUI object .
The example below illustrates this principle :
YUI ( ) .use ( ' dd - drop ' , ' anim ' , function (Y ) {
// Y.DD is available
// Y. Anim is available
}
Here , YUI ( ) is executed , which returns an instance of the library from which the use method is executed .
A minimum of two parameters are required : the library components , then the callback to run once everything is done loading .
In our above example , the first two parameters passed to use are the names of the library components that are to be loaded .
The final parameter is our callback function , which receives an object ( named Y in the example ) – this is an instance of the library containing all of the loaded components .
So , like the comments in the example above , the drag and drop component can be found at Y.DD , and the animation component can be found at Y. Anim .
A Cleaner , More Succinct Coding Style
One of the main concerns the team had was to ensure consistent internal mechanics and a consistent API across all YUI components .
So YUI 3 now has a new hierarchy of classes that allow exactly that .
The Attribute class , for example , provides get and set methods , initial configuration support , and attribute change events to classes that inherit it .
There ’s also a Base class that inherits from Attribute and provides some out - of - the - box object oriented functionality , like initializer and destructor methods for all classes that inherit from it .
Finally , they ’ve built a Widget class that inherits from Base and provides common functionality normally used by widgets , such as a render method – a common Model - View - Controller structure for managing the widget ’s rendering – and support for common widget attributes .
It also provides plugin registration and activation support .
Another problem YUI 3 overcomes is when your script needs to load a heavy piece of the library for only one or two functions contained within it .
For example , in YUI 2 you ’d have to include the entire Connection Utility ( weighing 38 KB , 12 KB when minified ) just to do some XMLHttpRequest calls .
YUI 3 solves this problem by splitting up functionality into smaller submodules .
That way , there ’s no need to pull down the entire utility just to make XMLHttpRequest calls .
In YUI 3 you can make an XMLHttpRequest call by only pulling down the IO Utility ’s io - base module , weighing a mere 19 KB ( 4KB minified ) .
In fact , the entire IO Utility weighs 29 KB ( 7KB minified ) and is much more feature - rich than its predecessor .
For example , it ’s now possible to make cross-domain or XDomainRequest calls with the io -xdr submodule .
Selecting and Chaining
YUI 2 introduced a selector engine , but it did so a little late in the library ’s life .
As a result , the whole library is built around old - school element fetching techniques .
In other words , you either passed an element ’s id or the element itself whenever a reference was needed , and that was about it .
With YUI 3 , however , the selector engine is built right into the very core of the library .
It permeates every part of it so that you can pass CSS selector strings virtually anywhere an element reference is needed .
As well as constructors , that also includes setting up event handlers and working with utilities .
Here ’s an example , which makes the first element with the class author draggable :
var dd = new Y.DD. Drag ({
node : '.author '
} ) ;
Whenever YUI 3 has no logical value to return , it tries to make the method chainable .
Here ’s an example of that in action :
Y.get ('.author ') .setStyle( 'cursor ' , ' move ' ) ;
Here , we referred to the first element with the class name author and set a cursor style on it .
Nodes and Event FaÃ§ades
YUI 3 introduces a new abstraction layer for the DOM with the Node Utility .
Rather than return a reference to a DOM element , YUI 3 returns Node s and NodeList s , which greatly simplify DOM interaction .
That ’s because Node s include all the functionality you need in order to interact with them , rather than having to go to separate functions .
What ’s more , the methods that are exposed by a Node take care of browser normalization whenever it ’s needed so the experience of working with them is as painless as possible .
Here ’s what you ’d have to write in YUI 2 in order to add a class name to an element :
YAHOO.util.Dom.addClass (" navProducts " , " selected " ) ;
In YUI 3 this becomes :
Y.get ( " #navProducts " ) .
addClass ( " selected " ) ;
In fact , if the node was already in hand , say in a variable named navProducts , then you ’d simply be able to do this :
navProducts.addClass (" selected " ) ;
YUI 3 simplified the interaction with the DOM , and has also normalized event management using the idea of an event faÃ§ade .
Every event listener receives an event faÃ§ade that takes care of all the browser normalization .
So , for example , where in YUI 2 you needed the following code in order to “ prevent default ” :
YAHOO.util.Event.on (" navProducts " , " click " , YUI2 callback (e ) {
e = e || event ;
YAHOO.util.Event.preventDefault(e ) ;
} ) ;
Now all you need to do is :
navProducts.on ( " click " , YUI3 callback(e ) {
e.preventDefault ( ) ;
} ) ;
What ’s more , this behavior extends over to purely custom events as well , so even these receive event faÃ§ades that allow them to prevent default and stop propagation .
Next : let ’s put some of these new methods into practice .
Show Me the Money !
I ’ve built a simple example page demonstrating how easy and powerful YUI 3 is to use .
To save space here in the article , I ’ll avoid showing you all the markup and code , but you can view the full source on the example page .
The first task I do is load up an instance of YUI with the Animation Utility , Slider Widget , MenuNav Node Plugin , and Drag & Drop Utilities .
YUI goes and fetches the necessary files and their dependencies from the Yahoo servers .
It then returns an instance of YUI with the loaded components to the callback function , which receives it in the variable named Y :
YUI ( ) .use ( ' anim ' , ' slider ' , ' node - menunav ' , ' dd - drag ' , function ( Y ) { ...
Next , I create a simple animation to bounce the page ’s contents into view .
In order to do this , I instantiate a new Animation object .
I pass it a reference to the element with the id main and tell it to animate the top value to 0 from wherever it currently is ( right now it ’s at - 1000 px , as specified in the example page ’s markup ) .
I also specify that the animation should take three seconds and that it should use the elasticOut easing method .
Once the object is instantiated , it ’s just a simple case of running it with the run method :
/*
* Bounce -in Anim
*/
var anim = new Y. Anim ( {
node : ' # main ' ,
to : {
top : 0
} ,
duration : 3 ,
easing : Y.Easing.elasticOut
} ) ;
anim.run ( ) ;
Next , I set up a Slider object in order to let users adjust the page ’s base font size .
YUI ’s fonts CSS ( included in the example page ) sets the page ’s base font size to 13 pixels .
It does this by setting the font - size value on the body element , from which all other font sizes are calculated .
This is what we ’re going to manipulate in order to change the whole page ’s font sizes .
I grab a node reference for the body element , which will be used later in conjunction with the slider .
Then I create a slider widget .
I set the minimum value to 13 and the maximum to 28 because I want the font size to stay within these values .
I then make sure the slider ’s rail size is 100 pixels wide .
Finally , I set the slider ’s thumb image ( which is loaded directly off Yahoo ’s hosted servers ) :
/*
* Font Size Slider
*/
var body = Y.get ( ' body ' ) ;
var slider = new Y.Slider ( {
min : 13 ,
max : 28 ,
railSize : ' 100 px ' ,
thumbImage :
' http://yui.yahooapis.com/3.0.0pr2/build/
slider / assets/skins/sam/thumb-classic-x.png '
} ) ;
Once the slider is instantiated , it ’s just a simple matter of rendering it .
I do this by calling the slider ’s render method with the class name of the element I want it rendered in .
The slider widget will render in the first element in the DOM that matches that class name :
slider.render('.horiz_slider ' ) ;
The only task left to do now is to wire up the slider so that it actually adjusts the page ’s font size .
This I do by hooking into its after event .
YUI 3 has standard on and after events you can hook into to make event handling like this much easier than in the prior version .
Now , whenever the valueChange event is fired , our body element ’s fontStyle value is changed :
slider.after (' valueChange ' , function ( e ) {
body.setStyle('fontSize ' , e.newVal + ' px ' ) ;
} ) ;
I ’ve also set up a navigation menu .
Once the page ’s content is ready I plug the MenuNav Node Plugin into the nav node .
It then automatically sets up a navigation menu based on the markup that it finds – as simple as that !
Here ’s the code :
/*
* MenuNav
*/
Y.on ( ' contentready ' , function ( ) {
this.plug (
Y.plugin.NodeMenuNav ,
{mouseOutHideDelay : 1} ) ;
} , ' #nav ' ) ;
Finally , I make the picture of yours truly draggable by simply instantiating a new drag and drop object and passing it a reference to my picture ’s class name .
As soon as the object is created , the image is draggable .
As an added touch , I change the mouse cursor when it hovers over the image so that it ’s apparent that the image is draggable :
/*
* Drag and Drop
*/
var dd = new Y.DD. Drag ({
node : '.author '
} ) ;
Y.get ('.author ') .setStyle( 'cursor ' , ' move ' ) ;
} ) ;
Summary
So , as you can see , YUI 3 is a completely different animal than its predecessor .
Along with a new syntax , you gain a faster , lighter , easier , and more flexible library – ready to take on your most ambitious web projects .
Seeing this was a primer , we ’ve barely scratched the surface of what ’s possible with YUI 3 .
For more reading , check out the YUI 3.x Preview Release 2 page , Satyen Desai ’s presentation on YUI 3 , and the YUI 3 forum .
So by now you ’ve seen all the footage out there regarding the PSP Go .
You ’ve seen the hot sliding action , and have probably wondered what you can do with the system when it ’s in its closed position .
Well the detailed answer to that question is right below .
A Sony representative has let loose some info stating that players can continue to use the PSP
Go when it is in its closed state .
While no official games that use solely the L and R buttons have been announced , when they are released “ users will be able to play those games with the PSP Go in closed mode . ”
“ Users will be able to access content and applications on the XMB such as videos , music and Skype when the panel is closed — but users will need to launch the application first before closing the panel . ”
Anybody here thinking about special versions of Loco Roco and Patapon ?
Or perhaps something even better – imagine if you could hook up the Go to your TV via Component cables , pair up a DualShock 3 controller via Bluetooth , and proceed to play your PSP games on a TV with your wireless controller !

The painting above is a depiction of the infamous Cadaver Synod , when a mad pope tried a dead one .
Here 's the gruesome story as told by Donald E. Wilkes , via Exploding Aardvark and Metafilter :
The Cadaver Synod occurred sometime in January 897 in the Church of St. John Lateran , the pope 's official church in his capacity as Bishop of Rome .
The defendant on trial was Formosus , an elderly pope who after a reign of five years had died April 4 , 896 and been buried in St. Peter 's Basilica .
( According to P. G. Maxwell - Stuart 's Chronicle of the Popes ( 1997 ) , the name Formosus means " good - looking " in Latin . )
The trial of Formosus was ordered by the reigning pontiff , Stephen VII ,
who had been prodded into issuing the order by a powerful Roman family dynasty and other anti-Formosus political factions , and who apparently
also was personally motivated by what The Oxford Dictionary of Popes ( 1986 ) calls a " near - hysterical hatred [ of Formosus ] . "
Although Formosus had been , according to McBrien , " a man of exceptional intelligence , ability , and even sanctity , he [ had ] made some bitter political enemies ... including one of his successors , Stephen VII . "
No trial transcript of the Cadaver Synod exists .
Nonetheless , it is reasonably clear what happened .
Sitting on a throne , Stephen VII personally presided over the proceeding .
Also present as co-judges were a number of Roman clergy who were there under compulsion and out of fear .
The trial began when the disinterred corpse of Formosus was carried into the courtroom .
On Stephen VII 's orders the putrescent
corpse , which had been lying in its tomb for seven months , had been dressed in full pontifical vestments .
The dead body was then propped up in a chair behind which stood a teenage deacon , quaking with fear , whose unenviable responsibility was to defend Formosus by speaking in his behalf .
The presiding judge , Stephen VII , then read the three charges .
Formosus was accused of ( 1 ) perjury , ( 2 ) coveting the papacy , and ( 3 ) violating church canons when he was elected pope .
The trial was completely dominated by Stephen VII , who overawed the assemblage with his frenzied tirades .
While the frightened
clergy silently watched in horror , Stephen VII screamed and raved , hurling insults at and mocking the rotting corpse .
Occasionally , when the
furious torrent of execrations and maledictions would die down momentarily , the deacon would stammer out a few words weakly denying the charges .
When the grotesque farce concluded , Formosus was convicted on all counts by the court .
The sentence imposed by Stephen VII was that all Formosus 's acts and ordinations as pope be invalidated , that the three fingers of Formosus 's right hand used to give papal blessings be hacked off , and that the body be stripped of its papal vestments , clad in the cheap garments of a lay person , and buried in a common grave .
The sentence was rigorously executed .
( The body was shortly exhumed and thrown into the Tiber , but a monk pulled it out of the river . )
Stephen VII 's fanatical hatred of Formosus , his eerie decision to convene the Cadaver Synod in the first place , his even eerier decision to have Formosus ' corpse brought into court , his maniacal conduct during the grisly proceeding , and his barbaric sentence that the corpse be abused and humiliated make it difficult to disagree with the historians who say that Stephen VII was stark , raving mad .
The turtle - shape four - door comes in three trim levels : base , midlevel CX and the top - of - the - line LX in which I spent much of my time .
This version has air - conditioning and power front windows .
Interestingly , for a car forged in the spirit of frugality , the relatively costly ( $ 3,800 ) LX has proved to be the most popular Nano , Tata Motors says , accounting for more than half the orders .
Image The interior of the Nano .

Indian customers have reasons to avoid the barest - bones model , which lacks air - conditioning , power brakes and even map pockets in the doors .
The spoil - yourself LX comes with frills like central locking , body - color bumpers , fancier seat and door trim , including map pockets ; cup holders in the console , foglights and an outlet for charging a cellphone .
The LX even has a small spoiler that presumably helps to keep it anchored to the road in the unlikely event of high speeds .
( The top speed is around 65 miles an hour . )
While cost containment was a big factor in the Nano ’s development , safety features were not .
While all Nanos have three - point safety belts , there are no air bags or antilock brakes .
The steering is not power - assisted , but the car ’s light unloaded weight ( 1,320 pounds ) and tight turning radius ( 13.1 feet ) make it nimble .
This proved especially useful when Tata Motors allowed a group of journalists to leave the test track and drive through the noontime scrum on city streets .
Cheap though it is , I did not find the Nano to be so cheap that it squeaked .
Nor did I hear any rattles on the cratered local roads , which made a credible stand - in for Manhattan ’s potholes .
The tiny 12 - inch wheels coped admirably with the rough terrain , and the power - assisted brakes  old - style drums , not discs  brought the car to a reassuring stop .
In the waning days of April , as federal officials were declaring a public health emergency and the world seemed gripped by swine flu panic , two rival supercomputer teams made projections about the epidemic that were surprisingly similar  and surprisingly reassuring .
By the end of May , they said , there would be only 2,000 to 2,500 cases in the United States .
May ’s over .
They were a bit off .
On May 15 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that there were “ upwards of 100,000 ” cases in the country , even though only 7,415 had been confirmed at that point .
The agency declines to update that estimate just yet .
But Tim Germann , a computational scientist who worked on a 2006 flu forecast model at Los Alamos National Laboratory , said he imagined there were now “ a few hundred thousand ” cases .
( At their peaks , epidemics are thought to double in as little as three days , which could drive the number into the millions , but Dr. Germann said he would not use such a rapid doubling rate unless it was a cold November and no countermeasures , like closing schools , were being taken . )
What went wrong ?
The leaders of both the Northwestern University and Indiana University teams seemed a bit abashed when they were asked that last week .
Anarchists in solidarity with the purged immigrants of Agios Panteleimonas ventured once again to open the public playground which is kept locked by fascists in favor of segregation , leading to battle with riot police and five arrests .
On Tuesday 9/06 anarchists in solidarity to immigrants who are being daily terrorised by fascist thugs of the Golden Dawn neonazi party and their local allies in the area of Agios Panteleimonas , moved to unblock the entrance of the local children playground which the fascists want to keep locked in an effort to impose segregation between greeks and immigrants , and " to preserve the blood purity of the white race " ... While unblocking the playground the anarchists were attacked by fascists who were soon routed before the arrival of riot police forces who engaged the anarchists in battle with the aim of protecting the fascists .
During the clashes one policeman was injured and five protesters were arrested on criminal charges .
After the end of the clashes , a local greek father , Mr Tasoulas , defying the reign of terror in the area , took his son to play in the coveted playground .
Soon they were surrounded by fascists who blocked the exit of the playground and threatened to linch the father calling him a traitor .
After he managed to handle the child to a sympathetic neighbor , the fascists beat the father in full presence of the chief of the local police station .
The strong police forces present at the scene then arrested the father and took him to the local police station , where his solicitor , a leading figure of the legal world and human rights activist , was piled with eggs by fascists who threatened her life .
The new tension in the area comes after the euroelection ascent of LAOS , the fascist Popular Orthodox Alarm Party , to the 4th position with 7 % of the vote .
This in combination with the governing party 's landslide defeat , has led the government to endorse the core of the extreme - right wing policies of LAOS , and pledge a mass sweeping operation against illegal immigrants and their greek supporters within the summer .
As the concentration camp planned to be built in the old NATO airbase of Aspropyrgos is now deemed impractical , the government has committed several old military camps of disgraceful humanitarian standards around the capital for the purpose of " cleaning the city of foreigners " .
The measures and discourse comes as little surprise as it comes from a political party famous for wanting to displace homosexuals in desert islands in the late 1970s .
Furthermore the " Law and Order " operation of the coming summer is said to also include a mass attack against anarchist squats , and solidarity actions to immigrants by the movement as a whole .
This the government hopes to achieve via a virtual military occupation of the center of Athens for the summer months modeled on Olympics 2004 , as well as the introduction of a disputed legislation that would eventually render protest marches illegal .
Due to the lack of a legislative majority by one MP , the government has resorted to yet another legal trick by increasing the total number of MPs by one , non-elected member of its own liking for the summer session of the Parliament .
The dictatorial rule of the right - wing and the ruthless employment of its parastate agents is increasing the tension across the country .
Last week one police station in Athens was attacked and a central tax office was bombed by a Marxist guerrilla group , while a series of luxury brothels frequented by the ruling class were destroyed .
At the same time , the movement is on its guard in expectation of next Saturday 's Gay Pride parade which last year was attacked by parastate fascist thugs , as well as in expectation of an evacuation of the old courts in down - town Athens which are occupied by immigrants and are a constant target by the bourgeois media who waste no time in supporting the fascists in a most unambiguous manner .
A number of renewable energy technologies are poised for significant growth .
Wind turbine production is booked for several years , while several companies have reached the point where they 're able to produce a Gigawatt of capacity annually .
Although the US has started from a small base , these power sources have grown at an annual rate of about 20 percent for most of the past decade , a period in which demand only grew about one percent annually .
The US National Academies of science has now examined the prospects for continued growth , and sees no limits within the next decade and beyond , but , should growth continue , there are going to have to be significant changes to our national grid .
The report was prepared as part of the America 's Energy Future Project , which is supported by everyone from General Electric to the Kavli and Keck charitable foundations .
It 's the second of several planned reports ; the next one will target prospects for energy - efficient technology .
The report excludes hydropower , which is renewable , but constrained by the availability of appropriate water resources .
At the moment , these other sources — geothermal , solar , biomass , and wind — account for about 2.5 percent of US electricity generating capacity , and estimates are that , under a business - as - usual scenario , they would reach eight percent by 2030 .
The report addresses the question of whether they'd be capable of scaling , should the US determine it wanted to increase reliance on these technologies ( the total available solar and wind energy within the US , at 13.9 million TWh , dwarfs any reasonable future projections of demand ) .
The authors limited their consideration of biomass use because they felt it was likely that the government would promote its use as a transportation fuel .
The authors point out that it's a much harder question to ask than it might appear , because renewable energy sources have properties that are radically different from traditional , fossil fuel energy sources .
So , while a traditional power plant can be built in reasonable proximity to the places where the electricity is needed , renewable plants generally have to be built where the energy supply is .
That means they require a large investment in transmission infrastructure , some of which might wind up spending part of its time underutilized , given the intermittent nature of most renewable sources .
Those interruptions in production , of course , add their own set of costs and challenges .
The good news is that the sorts of changes that will be needed are already areas of active R&D .
These include things like demand - based pricing and response control through a smart grid and the development of on - grid storage through technologies like advanced batteries and compressed air .
Solar and wind energy are also relatively diffuse .
Although they do n't create significant pollution concerns , the production facilities can cause tensions in terms of land use , both for the plants themselves and the transmission lines .
The technology itself is also a moving target , especially in the case of photovoltaics , which is affecting both the cost and the amount of land required for a facility of a given capacity .
Against all that complexity , the authors provide some reason for optimism in their analysis : past estimates of the cost of renewable power have proven to be reasonably accurate over time .
Where things have gone wrong is in predicting the consequences of those price changes for our use of the technologies .
In general , efficiency gains in fossil fuel production , transportation , and burning have helped them stay ahead of the price curve for longer than expected , although they exact their own costs in terms of price volatility .
As a result , the authors are less convinced that economics alone will necessarily drive renewable adoption unless the externalities of fossil fuels — pollution , environmental degradation , and importing from politically hostile nations — are factored in .
This could either happen via some form of a carbon tax or cap , or through requirements for renewable power production .
Both have been adopted by a number of states , and there is a chance the US government will join in in the near future .
The extent of renewable uptake , ultimately , will probably depend on the extent to which various governments formulate consistent policies to promote it .
If the government goes all out for renewables , what are the primary limitations on renewable power production ?
Aside from sustained policies and their consequences on prices , the authors view the primary limitation as being transmission for at least the next decade .
We simply do n't have the infrastructure in place to get the power from sites of efficient production to where it 's needed .
Solar can scale more or less indefinitely , and wind could account for 10 to 20 percent of the total electric needs in most areas ; other sources , like geothermal , may contribute in some specific areas .
Overall , even with the limits imposed by the grid , the authors conclude that the current manufacturing and technology improvements can get us to 10 percent renewable by 2020 , and double that in the decade afterwards .
There are a number of ways to limit the impact of the transmission problem .
The authors suggest combining generating capacities through joint solar / wind or wind / natural gas projects , which would allow the transmission lines to be more fully utilized during times when the intermittent nature of one form of production would otherwise leave them with nothing to transmit .
But somewhere between the 20 percent mark they think is possible and the point where half of our power comes from non -hydro renewables , we 're going to need to change the electric grid .
The good news is that the sorts of changes that will be needed are already areas of active R&D .
These include things like demand - based pricing and response control through a smart grid and the development of on - grid storage through technologies like advanced batteries and compressed air .
Efficient long - distance power transmission will also be key .
That does n't mean that the non -grid work will be easy .
The authors note estimates that getting onshore wind up to a 20 percent share of the power supply will require 100,000 turbines and another $ 100 billion in infrastructure work .
But , should the US decide to pursue the necessary policies , it appears to be in position to significantly change its energy mix .
The thing that concerns me about the report , however , is that all of this was obvious to someone without the resources available to the National Academies at least a year ago , and some of it was apparent decades ago .
The fact that we still need these expert reports to state the obvious provides some indication of the degree of inertia at work .

TOKYO / SEOUL ( Hollywood Reporter ) - Steven Spielberg and Will Smith are moving forward with plans for a remake of “ Old Boy ” despite a complex , behind - the - scenes rights wrangle involving the Japanese publishers of the original manga and the Korean producers of Park Chan - Wook ’s 2003 cult hit .
Futabasha , publisher of the manga by Nobuaki Minegishi and Garon Tsuchiya , has filed a case against Show East in Seoul , alleging the Korean company never had the right to negotiate a remake .
The issue is further complicated by the fact that Show East has shut down and its CEO , Kim Dong - Ju , has disappeared .
Big Egg , a co-producer of the ultra- violent revenge flick , has also closed up shop , and its former staffers are unreachable .
“ We have n’t been able to confirm that Show East is bankrupt , and at this stage we ’re not sure what effect this will have on the legal case , ” said a spokesperson from Futabasha in Tokyo , who noted that legal proceedings had begun last week .
South Korean sales company Cineclick Asia , which represented Show East ’s “ Oldboy ” in international territories , actually negotiated the remake deal with Universal .
Universal brought in Roy Lee ’s Vertigo Entertainment , which has made a specialty of Asian film remakes , to produce the picture , and then Mandate acquired the rights from Universal .
DreamWorks , in one of its first moves in the wake of its November separation from Paramount , secured remake rights from Mandate , which remains involved in the project .
DreamWorks had no comment on the dispute between Futubasha and Show East .

When it comes to offering men and women equal opportunities to play sports , close may no longer be good enough .
Judges have typically ruled that universities are in compliance with the federal gender - equity law known as Title IX if the proportion of athletes who are women is within 5 percent of the representation of women in the total enrollment .
But a settlement announced Wednesday between the University of California - Davis and three female athletes holds the university ’s athletic officials to a stricter 1.5 percent standard and could influence similar cases around the country , according to lawyers who are knowledgeable about gender - equity cases .
“ It is a boost in the momentum toward the real goal of equality of opportunity , and not a goal of approximate equality , but real equality , ” said Marcia Greenberger , co-president of the National Women ’s Law Center , an advocacy group that often litigates gender - equity cases .

The new handset , launched under its low - cost line of products - " Guru " - at a price of Rs.2,799 , has a solar panel on the back , which can be used to charge the battery anywhere the sun is shining .
" We have developed this phone keeping in minds the needs of the consumers , especially for people in areas where the electric supply is unstable , " said J.S. Shin , president and chief executive of Samsung , Southwest Asia .
The phone , christened the " Guru E1107 " , can provide around 5 - 10 minutes of talk - time with one - hour of solar charging when the handset is turned off and sunlight has adequate intensity .
" Solar charging can give you enough time to make few important calls when there is no electricity or you are not close to a plug point , " said Sunil Dutt , country head of Samsung India .
The battery will attain full power with about 40 hours of solar charging .
" But that is really not the intention behind the launch of this phone .
It is to enable customers to make a call when there is no electricity , " said Dutt .
The handset , the 11th model in the Guru series , will be in shops by month - end .
The first few batches of Guru E1107 will be imported from South Korea .
Saumsung has already launched about 20 models this year and plans to take this number to about 40 across categories .
Asked whether the company would consider introducing solar charging features in high - end phones , Dutt said : " We would definitely consider doing so . "
Samsung , which has invested about $ 44 million in developing its mobile manufacturing facility in Noida , also has ambitious plans for the huge Indian mobile market .
" Our market share is in the early double digits currently .
We plan to increase it by about 5 - 6 percent this year , " said a company official .
The company is also planning to introduce in India its solar - powered touchscreen mobile handset , Blue Earth - unveiled at a technology conference in Barcelona , Spain early this year .
Police : Teen slain by Harris County homeowner Officials : Harris man fatally shoots teen at home
A homeowner who had twice ordered a teenager to leave the property — once while holding a rifle — shot the teen dead after the boy refused to leave and walked toward him , authorities said .
“ He feared for his life , ” said Harris County sheriff ’s Lt. Rolf Nelson .
Dwayne Austgen , 69 , was inside his north Harris County home in the 5500 block of Susanna around 10:30 a.m.
Wednesday when he noticed a teenager in his front yard , officials said .
The man went outside , confronted 17 - year - old Vidal Herrera , and told him to leave , authorities said .
After the teen left the property , Austgen noticed Herrera had left a crack cocaine pipe , officials said .
Austgen then went back inside his home , taking the pipe with him , officials said .
A short while later , Herrera returned to the home , confronted Austgen about the pipe , and the pair argued , officials said .
Austgen , this time holding a rifle , again ordered the teen to leave , officials said .
Herrera began to walk away but then approached the homeowner , who fired the .22 - caliber rifle , striking the teen in the abdomen , officials said .
Herrera was taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital , where he died .
The case will be referred to a Harris County grand jury without charges .
Austgen could not be reached for comment .
Anxious neighborhood
Neighbors described him as a grandfather - type who works hard and has a shop housing construction equipment on his property .
The shooting aggravated an already anxious neighborhood .
Residents in the rural cluster of tidy homes and trailers said that over the past four months , burglars have taken all - terrain vehicles , tools , bicycles , and navigation and stereo equipment .
Janie Witcher , who lives a few doors down , said she and other neighbors have been nervous for their safety since the rash of crimes , worried the burglars might become violent .
Burglars hit her home and vehicles , Witcher said , adding that she might be the only resident to report a break - in .
“ It ’s like an invitation for them to come back , ” she said .
Witcher said another neighbor pulled a shotgun on a burglar about three months ago and had a difficult time scaring him away .
“ I ’ve had my kids sleeping in my room , ” she said .
“ My son is constantly looking out the window . ”
Her son , Kyle , has been sleeping with a baseball bat for weeks and plans to keep it that way for a while .

By Lord Aikins Adusei ( Modern Ghana )
By Lord Aikins Adusei Quite often when you read newspapers , listen to the radio and watch television in the West you will are bombarded with how poor and corrupt Africans are .
However , you will never watch , read or hear anything in these media outlets on the role play by : Western banking institutions ; property development and estate companies ; technology corporations ; oil and mining cartels ; defense and engineering companies ; and western political and business elite in promoting corruption in Africa .
When it comes to Africa and the developing world , the Western media pretend to be doing a good job only when there is an embarrassing story or a scandal that undermines their own credibility as the watchdog of the state .
It is not uncommon to see poverty stricken Africans being shown in documentaries , movies , and television screens in the West but these same documentaries fail to show the involvement of Western capitalist institutions in fanning the poverty .
Although corruption involves a giver and recipient , it is always the taker who is reported in the media .
In many instances bribes are offered in order to secure contracts , secure official favour or to induce officials in order to influence the out come of a government decision .
In other instances people become corrupt because of the existence of favouring conditions as can be seen in most western countries with their banking secrecy laws .
Why does the media in the West ignore the role of western institutions in corrupt deals ?
The media in the west tend to ignore the role of western institutions for many reasons .
They would rather show the poverty level in Africa but refuse to show the role play by western institutions for fear of loosing revenue through adverts .
Most media outlets survive through advertisements from mega businesses and the multinational corporations so for fear of loosing revenues the media turn a blind eye to their activities such bribing politicians , public officials and polluting the environment .
Again the editors , programme directors and the other big wigs in the media are thelselves shareholders in the companies in question so why would they want to jeopardise the source of their own wealth ?
The enthusiasm with which CNN , BBC , ABC , CBS , ITN , SKYNEWS , television producers portray Africa as poor , backward , least developed and corrupt is not displayed when they report on the role play by Western institutions in perpetuating the aforementioned .
They fail to tell the world that the looted funds that make Africans poor are sitting in Europe , America , Australia , New Zealand and other offshore Islands controlled by the West .
They fail to tell the world that Africa would be a different place if all the stolen monies are returned from Switzerland , Britain , America , France , Luxembourg , Austria and Liechtenstein .
After years of foot draggings Swiss authorities decided to repatriate monies stolen by the Abacha regime .
So I asked myself where was the western media when Swiss and British Banks were receiving the looted funds ?
The fact still remains that until recently and with the exception of the BBC none of the western media establishment had permanent reporters based in Africa with reason only best known to themselves .
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3577032.stm
Corruption is rife in Africa because banking institutions in Europe especially Switzerland , France , Jersey Island , Britain , Luxembourg , Liechtenstein , Austria and US among others accept money from African leaders without questioning its source .
According to the UN and the AU around $ 148 billion is stolen from the continent annually by political leaders , multinational corporations , the business elite and civil servants with complicity of banking and property industries in Europe and North America .
Even though western banks act as safe havens for looted funds , very little attention is received from the western media to expose them .
No effort has been made by the political elite in Europe and America to force the banks to return these stolen monies because they are often the shareholders and beneficiaries of profits made by these banks .
They have no agenda to combact corruption as that would mean no fat dividends for them and no cheap credits for their citizens .
Within five years of his reign ( 1993 - 98 ) Sani Abacha of Nigeria according to official sources was able to stash four billion dollars and between 12 and 16 billion dollars according to unofficial sources .
After his death in 1998 , investigators in Nigeria , Europe and America stumbled on over 130 bank accounts in Australia , New Zealand , London , New York , France and Switzerland among other countries where some of the money stolen was kept .
According to France24 , a French police investigation has established that Bongo and his family own at least 33 luxury properties in France , including a villa located at Rue de la Baume , near the Elysée Palace , in Paris bought in 2007 for 18.8 million Euros .
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy was spotted greeting Bongo in this villa bought with funds looted from Gabon .
http://www.france24.com/en/20090226-french-court-seizes-gabonese-presidents-accounts-omar-bongo-bank.
Other investigations have uncovered that he and his family have at least 59 properties , several bonds and stocks in France alone .
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner was embarrassed when it was revealed that Bongo ’s government paid his consultancy firm a staggering 2.64 million Euros for advice on health policy drawn up by Kouchner before he took office .
Source : Timesonline February 5 , 2009 .
http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5661746.ece.Kouchener is not the only person in France , Europe and America to have benfited from the shady and corrupt dealing of Africa 's political and business establishments .
It has recently come to light that Omar Bongo secretly financed Jacques Chirac and Francois Mitterand election campaigns using money he had stolen from his country .
The question is who assisted him to steal and hide his ill - gotten wealth in France I mean the 70 banks accounts stashed with hundreds of millions of euros and the 33 luxury mansions that he bought ?
Is it not those he helped to become presidents , prime ministers and foreign ministers ?
The fact is that Bongo was able to steal , mismanage and poorly run his country because of the support he received from those he helped win elections in France .
Araminta Wordsworth of Nationalpost.com says : " The French media are operating under no constraints in commenting on Africa ’s longest - ruling despot , a man successive French presidents played a huge role in keeping in power and vice - versa .
Bongo contributed to the election campaigns of François Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac ; Nicolas Sarkozy ’s first act as president - elect was to call the Gabonese president and thank him for his advice .
Bongo also worked for the French secret service .
But oil was key to his power , as Laurent d’Ersu notes in La Croix " .
Source : National Post , June 9 , 2009
The disgraced Elf - Aquataine executives said they paid Bongo between 30 to 50 million dollars through secrete bank accounts in Switzerland but no attempt has been made to expose and prosecute these banks .
On February 26 , 2009 a French court had Omar Bongo ’s nine bank accounts containing several millions of Euros frozen .
In confirming the court ’s decision , lawyer Jean - Philippe Le Bail said , “ This concerns Crédit Lyonnais , in which the president of Gabon has two current accounts , two savings accounts and a share account , and BNP , in which he has two checking accounts , a savings account and a share account ” .
These are the banks whose shady deals with the political and business elite impoverish African countries but which for profits sake the media refuse to tell the world about .
The banks know these corrupt leaders have stolen the money yet they pretend not to know until there is a scandal before they begin to act as if they are responsible institutions .
How and why Bongo was able to open so many bank accounts in France is only known to the banks and the political establishment in France but it is an undisputable fact that the media in France did notdo enougth to expose the rot in involving Bongo and the institutions in that country .
Most foreign banks have been implicated for receiving billions of dollars of looted funds from the late Mobutu of Zaire ; Lansana Conte of Guinea ; Eyadema of Togo ; and a number of tyrants such as Omar Bongo of Gabon ; Obiang Nguema of Equatorial Guinea ; Dos Santos of Angola ; Denis Sassou Nguesso of Congo ; Paul Biya of Cameroon ; Arap Moi of Kenya ; Jerry Rawlings of Ghana ; Ibrahim Babadjinda of Nigeria and a number of sitting and ex-presidents in Africa yet western media is silent about where the funds are being kept .
The banks in Europe and America that aided , abetted and provided sanctuary for Abacha´s $ 4 billion stolen funds are : Australia and New Zealand Banking Group , ANZ , London Branch ; Bank Len , Zurich ; Bankers Trust Company , London ; Bankers Trust Company , Frankfurt ; Bankers Trust Company , New York ; Banque Barring Brothers , Geneva ; Bank in Liechtenstein A.

Only heaven knows how much of Abacha´s loot still remain in these banks .
We did not hear anything about these banks in the Western media and how they were helping Abacha to loot Nigeria 's resources until his death in the until his death in 1998 .
According to a 110 page report prepared by international risk consultancy firm Kroll , Arap Moi and his family have banked £ 1 billion in 28 countries including Britain but the media in the west will not expose the banks involved .

Apart from the banking sector , the property sector in Europe , America and Australia have also connived with the political and business elite in Africa to impoverish the people .
Several African leaders have bought properties in Europe and America using monies stolen from their poor countries .
It is on record that Mobutu of DRC ( Zaire ) bought several villas in France , Switzerland , Belgium and many European Countries .
Yet again the companies selling the villas have been kept secret by the media .
Why ?
It has recently come to light that Arap Moi of Kenya and his family bought several multimillion pound properties in London , New York , South Africa including 10,000 - hectare ranch in Australia and bank accounts containing hundreds of millions of pounds .
While majority of Kenyans live in slums and in rural areas , with little roofing on their heads and lacking water and other basic necessities of life , Moi ’s family live in a £ 4 m home in Surrey and £ 2 m flat in Knightsbridge yet the media will not expose the estate companies involved .

It is common for western companies looking for lucrative contracts to pay bribes and kickbacks to induce officials into awarding them contracts .
For example on 17th September 2002 , a Canadian firm called Acres International was convicted by a High Court in Lesotho for paying $ 260,000 bribe to secure an $ 8 billion dam contract .

In 2002 , Halliburton , a company once controlled by Dick Cheney ( former US Vice President ) was accused of establishing $ 180 m fund and used it to bribe Nigerian officials in order to secure a $ 10 billion Liquefied Gas Plant contract in Nigeria .

Achair Partners ( a Swiss company ) and Progresso ( an Italian company ) have been accused of bribing Somalia ’s Transition Government officials in order to secure contracts to deposit highly toxic industrial waste in the waters of Somalia .
Such corrupt practices by western companies seeking contracts in Africa are one of the reasons why poverty and diseases are rife in the continent .
The catastrophic environmental damage being caused by Oil , mining and timber companies such as Shell , BP , Total , Elf , Texaco , Mittal , Anglo - America Corporation in Nigeria , Ghana , Gabon , Equatorial Guinea , Angola , Congo , DR .
Congo , South Africa , Guinea , Sierra Leone , Liberia , Senegal do not make the news in the West .
How often do we hear about the huge environmental price Africans are paying to satisfy the west ’s insatiable appetite for energy and technology ?
Apart from the huge profits being made by these conglomerates which we often hear in the news , do we hear also their complete disregard for environmental rules ; the pollution of rivers , lakes , streams , wells , and the environment ?

Except the wars and the stranded faces of hungry refugees , do these illegal activities by the corporations make the news in the Western media ?
Definitely not .
Even when local journalists and writers document this for broadcast in the west , it is not published as it does not serve their interests .
The media only publish stories after NGOs and civil society organisations have fought to expose corruption and shady deals involving western corporations , business and political leaders .
This is the hypocrisy and double standard of the western media .
They want the world to know how poor Africans are but fail to tell the world that Africans are poor because Western banking institutions , property development companies , defence companies and defence contractors , oil and mining corporations are major stakeholders in promoting Africa ’s poverty and underdevelopment .
Corruption and bribery in Africa and indeed the developing world could be reduced tremendously if the media for once put aside the pick and choose journalism and attached the same importance to show the degree of involvement by western capitalist institutions Europe , America and Japan and their role in keeping Africans poor .

( CNN ) --
The average price per gallon of self - serve regular gasoline is $ 2.66 , up 16.68 cents from two weeks ago , the Lundberg Survey found .
There is no reason to believe prices at the pump will reach the $ 4 - plus levels of last summer , surveyor says .
The price , an average of thousands of gas stations nationwide , is $ 1.34 lower than a year ago .
Last year in June , retail gas prices were nearing $ 4 , and stayed at that level or above until late July .
The most recent increase is not a reflection of increased demand , according to survey publisher Trilby Lundberg .
" It 's a direct result of continued increases in the price of crude , with crude oil itself responding to a flight from the weaker dollar on the expectation of rising inflation from federal monetary policy , " Lundberg said .
" Demand is not increasing .
It is shrinking . "
Lundberg said there is no reason to expect gas prices will reach the $ 4 - plus levels of last summer but " it might certainly feel that high to many consumers , especially those who are unemployed . "
The city with the lowest average price in the survey was Tucson , Arizona , at $ 2.41 , for a gallon of self - serve regular .
The highest average was in San Francisco , California , at $ 2.99 .
Here are the average prices in some other cities :
Houston , Texas : $ 2.45
St. Louis , Missouri : $ 2.45
Denver , Colorado : $ 2.49
Atlanta , Georgia : $ 2.52
Boston , Massachusetts : $ 2.63
Seattle , Washington : $ 2.82
Chicago , Illinois : $ 2.92

In a speech that underscored the pressures he has had to bear during his life serving as both a spiritual and political leader , the Dalai Lama has said there is no need for his successor to perform the two roles .
In a video clip shown to hundreds of monks , nuns and lay people gathered in the mountain town of Dharamsala , the 73 - year - old said it was essential that the Tibetan community in exile embraced democracy if it were to keep step with the wider world .
" The Dalai Lamas held temporal and spiritual leadership over the last 400 to 500 years .
It may have been quite useful .
But that period is over , " said the Nobel prize winner .
" Today , it is clear to the whole world that democracy is the best system despite its minor negativities .
That is why it is important that Tibetans also move with the larger world community . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Dalai Lama has long stressed the need for the Tibetan community to elect a political leadership , and the first election to select a prime minister was held in 2001 .
Indeed , the symposium at which his comments were broadcast late on Saturday night in the Indian Himalayan town where he has lived for almost five decades , was being held to discuss the next election for the government - in - exile – due to be held in 2011 .
Karen Lang , an associate professor of religion at the University of Virginia , said : " He is going to be 74 on 6 July and he is only human .
He is looking ahead to when he passes away and the undeniable political problems there will be in choosing his successor .
What he is saying [ about dividing the political and religious role ] makes a lot of sense , especially given the long interim period between announcing his successor and that person coming of age . "
The speech put the firmest cap possible on the idea that the Lama should be the sole repository of leadership for the Tibetan people .
" When we put the whole responsibility in the person of the Dalai Lama , it is dangerous , " he said .
" It is appropriate that a democratically elected leader lead a people 's movement .
In reality , a change is happening in the responsibility of the Dalai Lama as the temporal and spiritual leader .
This , I think , is very good .
A religious leader having to assume political leadership , that period is over . "
Yet there is often a gulf between the opinions expressed by the Dalai Lama and what actually happens within the Tibetan Buddhist community .
Last October , for instance , he announced that his moderate , so - called middle - way approach was having no success with the Chinese authorities and that he wanted to take a back - seat role .
He also called a mass meeting to discuss the way forward and for people to vote on whether they wanted to continue with his tactics .
Though many within the Tibetan community disagreed with his approach , when it came to the vote the Dalai Lama 's view won .
Robert Thurman , professor of Indo - Tibetan studies at Columbia University , said that while the Dalai Lama had managed to perform both a political and religious role , it was his belief that the Tibetan people would benefit from more secular education and taking more personal responsibility .
" He thinks that democracy is the best way for this .
He has dealt with Chinese autocracy for more than 60 years and he has seen what that has done , " he said .
Many Tibetans fear that the death of the Dalai Lama , who has lived in exile in India since he fled a crackdown by the Chinese after a failed uprising in 1959 , could create a leadership vacuum that Beijing could exploit to tighten its grip on Tibet .
China has claimed the Dalai Lama must follow " historical conventions " , including an endorsement from Beijing .
The authorities have gone as far as to say that his incarnation must be chosen by drawing lots from a gold urn given to Tibetans by the ethnic Manchu emperors of the Qing dynasty .
Despite the Dalai Lama 's stated commitment to democracy , some observers believe a " regent " could be appointed to lead the freedom struggle in the form of Ogyen Trinley Dorje , who is the Karmapa , or spiritual head of the Kagyu order of Tibetan Buddhism and the third highest - ranking figure across the various schools .
Whilst the 17th Karmapa could not inherit the title of Dalai Lama , he could act as a figurehead and help fill the void should the Dalai Lama fall ill or die .
Such a move has been publicly discussed amid concerns last year about the Dalai Lama 's health .
Earlier this year , the 23 - year - old Karmapa , who was born and raised in Tibet but who escaped to India in 2000 , told reporters : " His Holiness has been very successful in laying the foundations for the Tibetan struggle .
He has done a great job .
Now it is time for the next generation to build on this and carry it forward . "
Tenzin Taklha , a spokesman for the Dalai Lama , said the Tibetan leader had been promoting a democratic framework for the Tibetan community in exile since the late 1960s .

Veselin Sljivancanin ( left ) had returned to The Hague for the verdict on his and Mile Mrksic 's ( right ) appeals
A UN war crimes appeals court has ruled that a former Yugoslav army officer jailed for crimes at Vukovar in 1991 should serve 17 , not five years .
It found Veselin Sljivancanin 's original conviction for torture inadequate and jailed him for aiding and abetting the murder of prisoners .
Sljivancanin , 56 , was freed in December 2007 after four years in custody .
He had returned to The Hague for the ruling which also upheld a sentence against his superior , Mile Mrksic .
The only reasonable inference is that Mr Sljivancanin was aware that the TOs [ Territorial Defence ] and paramilitaries would likely kill the prisoners - of - war and that if he failed to act , his omission would assist in the murder of the prisoners
Judge Theodor Meron Mrksic , 62 , is serving 20 years for aiding and abetting the murder and torture of prisoners , as well as allowing inhumane conditions of detention .
The two men were convicted in September 2007 for their role in the execution of 194 non-Serbs seeking refuge at a Vukovar hospital in 1991 .
Charges included murder , torture and cruel treatment .
Victims were taken to a nearby farm building , where they were killed and buried in a mass grave .
The original verdicts were met with huge criticism in Croatia where the sentences were seen as too lenient for what was the gravest crime committed on Croatian soil since World War II , the BBC's Geraldine Coughlan reports from The Hague .
Croatia also disputed the acquittal of a third defendant , Miroslav Radic .
' Shock and tears '
Prosecutors had appealed for heavier sentences against both convicted men , who had also appealed against their convictions .
The appeals chamber dismissed all the appeals lodged by the defendants while , of the four prosecution appeals , it allowed one , granted two in part and dismissed one .
It found that the Hague trial chamber had erred when it acquitted Sljivancanin of aiding and abetting the murders and convicted him only of aiding and abetting torture .
Sljivancanin's wife , Persa , exclaimed with shock in the public gallery as the new sentence was handed down , an AFP news agency correspondent reports .
As she protested against the ruling , she was escorted out by a dozen policemen with her children in tears .
' Failure to act '
The original trial heard that the Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) had besieged Vukovar from August to November 1991 , during which time some 1,000 of the city 's residents were killed and another 5,000 taken prisoner .
Vukovar was attacked by Yugoslav troops and Serb militiamen in 1991
In the last days of the siege , several hundred people sought refuge at the city 's hospital , hoping to be evacuated in the presence of international observers .
But on 20 November 1991 , JNA soldiers stopped guarding the prisoners , allowing Serb Territorial Defence ( TO ) and paramilitary forces to load about 400 on to buses and take them to a farm in nearby Ovcara where at least 194 were beaten and later killed .
After the killings , the bodies of the victims were buried by bulldozer in a mass grave at the same location .
Mrksic was found guilty of aiding and abetting the murders as he had ordered the withdrawal of the JNA soldiers guarding the prisoners .
He was also found to have failed to act effectively to ensure that the prisoners were properly protected or treated , the trial chamber found .
" Upon learning of the order to withdraw the JNA troops from Mr Mrksic the only reasonable inference is that Mr Sljivancanin was aware that the TOs and paramilitaries would likely kill the prisoners - of - war and that if he failed to act , his omission would assist in the murder of the prisoners , " Presiding Judge Theodor Meron said in court on Tuesday .
Since its establishment , the Hague Tribunal says it has charged 161 persons with serious violations of humanitarian law committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia between 1991 and 2001 .
Proceedings against 119 have been concluded .

Cops throw the book at dumpers of dirty DVDs
A 47 - year - old public servant in Mie Prefecture has found himself in big trouble , reports Nikkan Gendai ( May 27 ) .
It seems he ’d decided it was time to get rid of his bulky collection of 284 pornographic mags and 53 adult videos , weighing about 150 kilograms in total .
“ Around 10:30 p.m. on the night of March 18 , he drove to Uda City ( in neighboring Nara Prefecture ) and discarded the items by flinging them over a guard rail into a rice paddy , ” a police source tells the newspaper .
“ Since some of the videos still carried labels with the name of the shop where they were purchased — which rents in addition to sells — we were able to pore through their customer records and trace him . ”
The man , an employee of Nabari City in Mie , was summoned to the police station and placed under arrest on May 25 for the illegal dumping of waste .
Apparently such crimes are not unusual .
Last February a 33 - year - old man in Aichi Prefecture was sent to the prosecutor on charges of discarding some 1,000 pornographic movies .
“ I told my wife to get rid of them , ” he explained to the authorities , to no avail .
“ I was ashamed and did n’t want anyone to know I ’d been watching . ”
In August 2008 , a 60 - year - old widower in Shizuoka Prefecture was arrested for abandoning the “ corpse ” of his life - size sex doll , which he discarded on a nearby mountain slope before going to live with his son and daughter - in - law .
The man reportedly told the local police he ’d felt sorry for the doll and could n’t bring himself to chop her up into small pieces .
“ In the 23 wards of central Tokyo , porno magazines are treated like any other recyclable waste , ” says a source in the recycling industry .
“ You just put them out for collection on the appointed day .
If you do n’t want your neighbors to know you ’ve been reading them , then carry them down the street to another pick - up point .
Or , stick them in a bag so the contents are n’t visible .
Video cassettes and DVDs are processed as regular combustible waste .
“ But if you ’ve got a sex doll , please dismember her first before taking her out to the curb , ” the source requests .
That ’s the trouble with fun , frowns Nikkan Gendai — you ’ve usually got to clean up afterwards .

What the out - of - town experts say about S.F. 1 / 5 Back to Gallery
Talk to San Francisco architects for any length of time and unless they worship at the shrine of Victoriana , the complaints begin .
Our buildings are too conservative .
Our skyline lacks drama .
Sharp designs are dulled by small - minded neighbors and planners .
Talking to out - of - town architects is a much different story :
If they 're disappointed by what they see , they are n't letting on .
In fact , except for the liberal use of such words as " fabric " and " scale , " they sound like any other besotted tourists .
" San Francisco - what 's not to like ? " laughs Ed Feiner , former chief architect for the federal government 's General Services Administration and now a principal with the national firm Perkins +
Will .
" You come here and you 're so overwhelmed by the natural beauty and the sculpture of the man -made terrain . "
Feiner and thousands of his peers were in town last week for the 141st annual convention of the American Institute of Architects .
By all accounts , most spent as little time as possible in the bowels of Moscone Center , instead exploring a constellation of neighborhoods and settings where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts - not that there 's anything wrong with that .
" San Francisco has n't historically had the singular iconic buildings , but that 's OK , " shrugs Larry Scarpa , whose Los Angeles firm Pugh +
Scarpa does n't shy away from bold colors and forms .
" It 's great for the water , the views ... essentially it 's the fabric .
I love to walk around . "
The city 's overall allure is also emphasized by architect David Jameson of Alexandria , Va. , whose residential work received two national honor awards this year from the AIA .
To illustrate his point , he referred to a mode of transportation - tourist alert - renowned for climbing halfway to the stars .
" You can ride a cable car up Powell Street , turn your head and have a visual connection to what seems like the entire city , " Jameson says .
" You can spatially feel so much of San Francisco at once . "
The designer in him offers a mild criticism ( " It 's surprising how few good buildings there are downtown " ) , but the rest of him does n't care : " It 's great to be in a small city with a walkable scale . "
One architect took a novel approach to the formal sessions :
He blew them off .
Instead , Michigan 's Michael Poris spent three days on convention - arranged tours of affordable housing , private homes , Golden Gate Park and the redeveloped blocks of Yerba Buena Center .
It was his first visit here since the early 1990s , and he 's startled by the changes - in a good way .
" I used to think of San Francisco as a museum , locked into doing buildings with bays , " says Poris , who worked for such architects as Cesar Pelli before moving back to the Detroit region where he grew up .
" There 's a different feeling now .
You still have the nice old neighborhoods , but there 's good contemporary design all over ... I 'm blown away . "
Another observation of Poris ' might startle locals convinced that things like graffiti and panhandling make San Francisco come off as an urban basket case .
" It 's so civilized , " Poris says .
" I do n't remember it being so clean , or Golden Gate Park being so well kept .
... I 'd live here in a second , and I never felt that way in the ' 80s . "
To be sure , Poris ' Detroit is a troubled metropolis where arson routinely claims dozens of abandoned buildings on the nights before Halloween .
But San Francisco's shine also was noted by one of the best young architects in Chicago , a city whose burly reputation has been polished of late by such features as colorfully landscaped boulevards and sparkling Millennium Park .
" What I 've been noticing about this city is the fresh - scrubbed appearance .
I remember it being grittier , " muses Jeanne Gang , whose 82 - story Aqua residential tower near Millennium Park opens in the fall .
This does n't translate to homogenization , though ; Gang and her husband , architect Mark Schendel , were struck by the variety of shops and restaurants between Moscone Center and their Union Square hotel : " You 've been able to maintain the small - scale activity we 've lost in ( central ) Chicago .
That 's a side of city life that has n't been erased here , at least not yet . "
Variety of another sort is relished by David Rubin of Olin Studio , a Philadelphia landscape architecture firm .
" When I come to San Francisco , I see the democratic process in full swing in terms of the people who congregate in public spaces , " says Rubin , whose firm has worked on portions of Mission Bay and the Presidio .
" It 's not like the East Coast , where like peoples tend to gather together .
I go to Yerba Buena Gardens or Union Square and I see people from all walks of life using those spaces . "
Ah , Union Square :
It reopened in 2002 with a stony look that made many local architects wince at the earnest pomp .
Is n't that a problem ?
" I wish it were a little less heavy - handed , " Rubin concedes .
" Honestly , though , my eyes are drawn away from that to the people who are enjoying the space . "
Many of them take a cue from Hajji Bakhshi , a grizzled veteran of the war with Iraq , who drives around Tehran in a bullet - riddled pick - up truck exhorting his followers to confront the forces of imperialism .
Take a trip to a New York ice - rink at the weekend and you 're likely to see a middle - aged Japanese man jumping and spinning in perfect harmony with Newtonian physics .
This is Michio Kaku 's idea of relaxation ; no relativity , little friction - just one man and the three laws of motion .
He moves almost effortlessly , his blades carving perfect patterns in the ice ; but then the three - dimensional world should present few problems to a man who is equally at home in 11 .
Kaku is the Henry Semat professor of theoretical physics at the City University in New York , and the man who , in the late 1960s , co-founded the field theory of strings - the equation that united a complex series of equations which described the behaviour of sub-atomic particles into a coherent whole .
Mention string theory - the notion that an electron is not a dot , but a rubber band which , if vibrated enough times , can turn into every single sub-atomic particle in the universe - to most people and you get a glazed incomprehension : but to theoretical physicists it is just about the hottest topic around .
" It either explains everything , or it explains nothing , " Kaku shrugs , though his expression tells you exactly which side of the fence he is on .
Over in the US you can buy a T - shirt with Kaku 's equation printed on the front , but it has taken a while for him to gain this recognition .
Back in 1974 , he was laughed off campus when it was discovered that strings could only vibrate coherently in 10 - dimensional hyperspace , and Kaku groans as he remembers being taunted by the Nobel laureate Richard Feynman with " How many dimensions are you living in today ? " .
Kaku started work on another theory , only to realise he was looking at the same phenomenon at a higher vibration on the rubber band .
And no one is laughing any more .
For years , physicists and cosmologists have been searching for the grand theory that united quantum physics and gravity theory .
Einstein spent the last 30 years of his life on just this problem , trying , in his words , " to read the mind of God " .
" He got to the fourth dimension and dabbled with the fifth , " says Kaku , " but there was n't yet the understanding of the nuclear force and quark model to allow him to progress .
String theory is now the only real contender for the grand unified theory ; everything else has fallen by the wayside .
If Einstein had never lived , we would have been able to determine all his ideas from string theory . "
Kaku slips into overdrive as he explains all the implications .
" String theory predicts the universe is like a soap bubble that is expanding and dying , " he says .
Billions of years from now stars will blink out ; the night sky will be dark and the oceans will freeze over .
But we may have an escape route .
Our soap bubble co-exists with other soap bubbles ; every time a black hole forms it may be creating a baby universe .
The matter being sucked in may be blown out the other side , creating a white hole in a twin universe , which will expand very rapidly , like our own Big Bang .
" Perhaps , also , a Type III civilisation , which can harness the Planck energy , will open a hole in space and tunnel through a wormhole to a parallel , warmer universe .
There is no other hope .
Either leave the universe or die with it .
If the wormhole is microscopic in size then we may send a nanobot that can reproduce itself indefinitely and create cloning factories to recreate the dead civilisation through it . "
This sounds like something out of Star Trek , but Kaku is deadly serious as he goes on to talk up his latest variation of string theory - M ( membrane ) theory , which operates out of 11 dimensions - and to speculate on multi-worlds theory , a new version of quantum theory , which predicts there may be clones of ourselves with separate lives .
" It sounds crazy , " he admits , " but we can't apologise for it as it's a possibility . "
He notices my eyebrow rise .
" It 's a theory that 's being pushed strongly by physicists over here in Oxford , " he adds , as if to show it 's not just some nutty Stateside notion .
Kaku 's voice washes easily over you .
Each sentence makes sense .
It 's only when you get to the end of each paragraph that you realise you 're hopelessly lost .
But you do n't really care , because it is never less than entertaining .
And - academic credentials aside - this is Kaku 's strong point .
In the US , he 's a regular contributor to the Wall Street Journal and has his own weekly radio show that explains the ins and outs of hyperspace and parallel universes .
It 's a skill that was born out of necessity .
" I remember being at the final congressional hearing in 1994 to decide whether the US government would fund the building of an atom smasher outside Dallas that would be twice the size of that at Cern , Geneva , " he says .
" A physicist was asked , ' Will we find God ? ' .
The reply came back , ' We will find the Higgs Boson [ sub - atomic particle ] . '
That answer cost US physics the £ 12bn project .
" Thinking back , I would have said , ' This machine will take us as close as humanly possible to his or her greatest creation - genesis itself .
It will give us a window on the instant of creation . '
Before 1990 , physicists only had to say ' Russia ' to get their hands on cash , but since the end of the cold war , we have had to learn the language of the taxpayer . "
It 's a language that Kaku now speaks fluently , and the financial rewards have been forthcoming .
Tempting as it is to caricature theoretical physicists as a bunch of geeks happy to operate in a mathematically pure vacuum , the reality is rather different .
For the theoretical is rapidly becoming practical , as billions of dollars are now being spent to test the validity of string theory .
When Cern opens for business in two years ' time , Kaku expects physicists to find evidence of sparticles - higher vibrations of the superstring , echoes from the 11th dimension .
But his biggest hopes are pinned on the Laser Inferometry Space Antenna ( Lisa ) , which will be launched in 2011 .
" Lisa is three satellites connected by laser beams which stretch 3 m miles across space .
This may pick up shock waves from the instant of creation , and maybe even pick up the umbilical cord of our universe . "
Kaku 's bet is that string theory will then be verified , but there 's plenty happening here on earth to keep him occupied .
Both string and M theory predict that gravity can seep across parallel universes - which means their existence can be proven by looking for deviations from Newton 's inverse square law of gravity .
One such experiment has already been conducted in Denver .
" The results came back negative , " he smiles , " but this just shows there are no parallel universes in Denver .
Physicists in Atlanta are already planning to repeat the experiment at the atomic level . "
It 's hard to keep track of parallel universes , especially when Kaku keeps insisting they could be here , right now , in your living room and that there could be a universe in which Elvis Presley never died and in which Hitler was never born .
But maybe Kaku's own life encourages him to believe in his own parallel world .
For in most normal worlds , the first - born son of Japanese immigrants who were interned outside San Francisco during the second world war do n't go on to refine and redefine Einsteinian physics .
His awakening came on hearing the news of Einstein 's death when he was eight years old .
" I saw this picture of his unfinished work lying on his desk , " he says , " and it became like a real - life murder mystery that I wanted to solve . "
By the time he was 16 , Kaku had bought 400lb of steel and 22 miles of copper wire and had built his very own atom smasher in the family garage .
It was powerful enough to pull fillings out of teeth , but the only thing it smashed was the house .
" It broke every fuse and ruined every circuit breaker , " he admits ruefully .
But it had the desired effect .
Kaku came to the attention of the renowned US physicist Edward Teller , who took him under his wing and secured him a scholarship to Harvard .
Even then there was a parallel twist .
" I discovered later that all Teller 's scholarship students were earmarked for the Star Wars programme at Los Alamos , " Kaku says .
" I was offered a chance to work there , but I 've always thought science was about creation , not destruction .
So I turned it down . "
Kaku 's legacy remains unclear .
He could go down in history as a brilliant but misguided mathematician or he could be the first person to read the mind of God .
But you sense that he is n't too bothered either way .
" String theory is the only game in town , " he says , " and you ca n't afford not to play it to the end . "
In any case , is n't there a parallel universe in which there 's a Michio Kaku who reckons string theory is a load of nonsense ?
" Quite possibly , " he laughs , before teleporting himself out of the room .

The US is embarking on a $ 1 billion crash program to expand its diplomatic presence in Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan , another sign that the Obama administration is making a costly , long - term commitment to war - torn South Asia , US officials said Wednesday .
The White House has asked Congress for – and seems likely to receive – $ 736 million to build a new US embassy in Islamabad , along with permanent housing for US government civilians and new office space in the Pakistani capital .
The scale of the projects rivals the giant US Embassy in Baghdad , which was completed last year after construction delays at a cost of $ 740 million .
Senior State Department officials said the expanded diplomatic presence is needed to replace overcrowded , dilapidated and unsafe facilities and to support a " surge " of civilian officials into Afghanistan and Pakistan ordered by President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Other major projects are planned for Kabul , Afghanistan ; and for the Pakistani cities of Lahore and Peshawar .
In Peshawar , the US government is negotiating the purchase of a five - star hotel that would house a new US consulate .
Funds for the projects are included in a 2009 supplemental spending bill that the House of Representatives and the Senate have passed in slightly different forms .
Obama has repeatedly stated that stabilizing Pakistan and Afghanistan , the countries from which Al Qaeda and the Taliban operate , is vital to US national security .
He 's ordered thousands of additional troops to Afghanistan and is proposing substantially increased aid to both countries .
Macro buildings to micro manage ?
In Pakistan , however , large parts of the population are hostile to the US presence in the region – despite receiving billions of dollars in aid from Washington since 2001 – and anti-American groups and politicians are likely to seize on the expanded diplomatic presence in Islamabad as evidence of American " imperial designs . "
" This is a replay of Baghdad , " said Khurshid Ahmad , a member of Pakistan 's upper house of parliament for Jamaat - e - Islami , one of the country 's two main religious political parties .
" This [ Islamabad embassy ] is more [ space ] than they should need .
It 's for the micro and macro management of Pakistan , and using Pakistan for pushing the American agenda in Central Asia . "
In Baghdad and other dangerous locales , US diplomats have sometimes found themselves cut off from the population in heavily fortified compounds surrounded by blast walls , concertina wire , and armed guards .
" If you 're going to have people live in a car bomb - prone place , you are driven to not have a light footprint , " said Ronald Neumann , a former US ambassador to Afghanistan and the president of the American Academy of Diplomacy .
Mr. Neumann called the planned expansions " generally pretty justified . "
In Islamabad , according to State Department budget documents , the plan calls for the rapid construction of a $ 111 million new office annex to accommodate 330 workers ; $ 197 million to build 156 permanent and 80 temporary housing units ; and a $ 405 million replacement of the main embassy building .
The existing embassy , in the capital 's leafy diplomatic enclave , was badly damaged in a 1979 assault by Pakistani students .
The US government also plans to revamp its consular buildings in the eastern city of Lahore and in Peshawar , the regional capital of the militancy plagued North West Frontier Province .
The consulate in the southern megacity of Karachi has just been relocated into a new purpose - built accommodation .
Buying the Pearl in Peshawar
A senior State Department official confirmed that the US plan for the consulate in Peshawar involves the purchase of the luxury Pearl Continental hotel .
The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was n't authorized to speak publicly .
The Pearl Contintental is the city 's only five - star hotel , set in its own expansive grounds , with a swimming pool .
It 's owned by Pakistani tycoon Sadruddin Hashwani .
Peshawar is an important station for gathering intelligence on the tribal area that surrounds the city on three sides and is a base for Al Qaeda and the Taliban .
The area also will be a focus for expanded US aid programs , and the American mission in Peshawar has already expanded from three US diplomats to several dozen .
In all , the administration requested $ 806 million for diplomatic construction and security in Pakistan .
" For the strong commitment the US is making in the country of Pakistan , we need the necessary platform to fulfill our diplomatic mission , " said Jonathan Blyth of the State Department 's Overseas Buildings Operations bureau .
" The embassy is in need of upgrading and expansion to meet our future mission requirements . "
A senior Pakistani official said the expansion has been under discussion for three years .
" Pakistanis understand the need for having diplomatic missions expanding and the Americans always have had an enclave in Islamabad , " said the official , who requested anonymity , because he was n't authorized to discuss the matter publicly .
" Will some people exploit it ?
They will . "
In Kabul , the US government is negotiating an $ 87 million purchase of a 30 - to 40 - acre parcel of land to expand the embassy .
The Senate version of the appropriations bill omits all but $ 10 million of those funds .

They gathered , the women in black , at Nilofar Square to mourn Neda Agha Soltan , the Iranian student cut down by a single bullet , whose last moments were captured on a video that has gone global .
I sat among the mourners in late afternoon , under the plane trees , as candles burned and a prayer was said .
The square seemed an oasis .
I asked a young woman if she was scared .
“ Yes , ” she said .
“ I ’m scared that all the blood shed for this cause may be wasted . ”
The cause , of course , is the annulment of Iran ’s fraudulent election and , beyond that , freedom .
The freedom not to live in a state that slams shut the doors of the mosque next to Nilofar Square because Neda , as a protester , was denied a proper service .
As the sound of the prayer rose , the regular city police joined in .
This was too much for the Basij militia , the regime ’s plainclothes shock troops , who arrived on motorbikes and , wielding sticks , broke up the gathering of about 60 people .
We ’re not the first to point you to this , and we wo n’t be the last , but we may be today ’s preferred pointer , and that ’s how the Internet works .
Bonnie Tyler ’s “ Total Eclipse of the Heart ” is an archetypal eighties hit not just because of its grandiose sound , but because of its incredibly stupid video .
As a kid , I remember watching MTV and being shocked by how the video made a ) no sense and b ) no sense interminably .
Now , it ’s been subjected to a Literal Video treatment .
Do you know what that is ?
You do n’t ?
Well , that ’s a viral video where the original song is replaced by a soundalike whose lyrics tell you exactly what is happening in the video .
The treatment has been applied to the Beatles ( “ Penny Lane ” ) and R.E.M. ( “ Losing My Religion ” ) , and I was n’t impressed by it before , but this “ Total Eclipse of the Heart ” has totally eclipsed my skepticism .
Comedian Sacha Baron Cohen appears as Ali G , a rapper - wannabe from Staines .
Ali G has his own TV show , where he interviews people on serious subjects .
They 're not aware that Ali G is just a character and they 're being set up as part of a comedy act .
Cohen also appears in two other guises : as Borat , a Kazakhstani reporter , and Bruno , a gay Austrian fashionista .
Hilarity ensues .

For many people around the world , it is a sign of the decline of American moral leadership that we continue to debate whether the government should prosecute those involved in the Bush torture program .
Their confusion is understandable .
Under our existing treaty obligations , we agreed to prosecute such crimes , and we have prosecuted others for precisely the same acts for decades .
The real question should be : Should the United States violate international law to shield individuals accused of war crimes ?
Our answer to that question will define or redefine this country for generations .
Notably , in the past few months , the many law professors who once defended the torture program have largely disappeared .
The shrinking number of apologists for the Bush administration are left with largely political arguments in the face of three unassailable legal truths .
First , waterboarding is torture .
Second , torture is a war crime .
Third , the United States is obligated to prosecute war crimes .
Despite early spin , there has never been a true debate about the status of waterboarding as torture .
It has been a well - recognized form of torture since before the Spanish Inquisition .
Indeed , it has remained popular because it leaves no incriminating marks and requires little training or equipment .
It was the chosen form of torture of the Gestapo , Pol Pot , and the Bush administration .
The status of waterboarding as torture was established by the United States .
The U.S. military used waterboarding ( " the water cure " ) in the Philippines in 1898 .
While the accused insisted ( as do many today ) that the torture was justified under the necessities and law of war , members of Congress rejected the argument and demanded the prosecution of Maj.
Edwin F. Glenn .
He was court - martialed and convicted of the crime of torture .
The United States remained a moral leader on torture for decades , including our prosecution of Japanese officers for waterboarding American and Allied soldiers .
One , Yukio Asano , was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for waterboarding .
In 1983 , the Justice Department prosecuted and convicted James Parker , a sheriff in Texas , and his deputies for waterboarding a prisoner .
Parker was sentenced to four years in prison .
Legal experts around the world have denounced the Bush program as classic and clear torture .
They have been joined by interrogators and officials from the Bush administration itself , including various Bush administration lawyers who vehemently objected to torture at the time .
Susan J. Crawford , a former judge and convening authority for the Bush military tribunals , and State Department official Richard Armitage acknowledged that we tortured individuals .
Republican John McCain ( himself a victim of torture ) has called it torture .
President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder declared that waterboarding is torture .
Leading organizations like the International Red Cross define it as not just torture but a war crime .
That brings us to the second truth : Torture is a war crime .
This one is easy , and even the dwindling number of George W. Bush apologists do not seriously question this point .
Torture is a crime under domestic and international law .
Various federal laws address torture , not the least of which is the Torture Act , 18 U.S.C. § 2340 .
There is also the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman , or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , which President Reagan signed .
The Convention Against Torture expressly states that " just following orders " is no defense and that " no exceptional circumstances whatsoever " will be considered .
This is acknowledged as a binding law , including recently by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
Finally , the United States is obligated to investigate and prosecute war crimes .
Under the Convention Against Torture , we agreed to make " all acts of torture offenses under [ our ] criminal law " and to prosecute any such cases .
The failure to prosecute war crimes committed by your own government is an offense of the same order as the original war crime .
Bush was adamant on the prosecution of war crimes in other countries .
In 2003 , he insisted , " War crimes will be prosecuted , war criminals will be punished , and it will be no defense to say , ' I was just following orders . ' "
On June 26 , 2003 , conservatives applauded as Bush told the United Nations that the United States " is committed to the worldwide elimination of torture , and we are leading this fight by example . "
Our failure to investigate and prosecute accused war criminals has led some United Nations officials to accuse the United States of violating treaty obligations .
More important , our continued debate over this question puts our troops in danger .
We will be hard pressed in the future to call for prosecution of leaders who torture our citizens and soldiers .
We cannot continue a war on terrorism while being violators of international law ourselves .
Torture and terrorism are cut from the same legal bolt : Both are violations of human rights and international law .
If we want the world to join us in fighting one crime against humanity , we cannot continue to obstruct the prosecution of another crime against humanity .
Ultimately , we all become accessories after the fact if we stand silent in the face of these war crimes .
Bush ordered these war crimes because he believed that he was above the law , and others like Rice have claimed that , if the president orders such actions , they are by definition legal .
They were both wrong .
The law is clear .
The only remaining question is whether we have the national character and commitment to the rule of law to hold even our leaders to account for crimes committed in our name .
Such prosecutions do not weaken a nation .
They reaffirm the difference between ourselves and those we are fighting .
To abandon our principles for politics would be to hand al Qaeda its greatest victory : not the destruction of lives or buildings but our own self - inflicted wound of hypocrisy and immorality .
True victory against our enemies will be found only on the other side of prosecuting those who ( like our enemies ) claim the right to wage war by any means .

Suppressing Interest Rates
Suppressing market interest rates to the lowest level possible seems to have become a key objective for central banks around the world as they respond to the turmoil in financial markets , the decline in output and the deterioration in the labor market .
However , it is a fatal policy : it amounts to fighting the correction of the debacle which has been caused by central banks ' downward manipulation of interest rates through a relentless increase in bank circulation credit and the money supply . [ 1 ]
But the monetary policy of suppressing the interest rate is widely hailed by mainstream economists as paving the way towards economic recovery — and this publicly accepted view provides governments and their central bankers with the intellectual support for continuing with the policy that has caused the disaster in the first place .
Ludwig von Mises knew about the public 's ideological aversion against the interest rate , and he put the ensuing tragic chain of events succinctly :
In the opinion of the public , more inflation and more credit expansion are the only remedy against the evils which inflation and credit expansion have brought about . [ 2 ]
While central banks have succeeded in bringing short - term interest rates to record lows , long - term interest rates have shown a ( much ) less pronounced decline .
For instance , US short - term interest rates have fallen sharply , whereas credit costs for high quality corporate issuers have hardly declined , and those for lower - rated issuers have even increased . [ 3 ]
The policy of suppressing the interest rate is an attempt to evade the costs of the debt that has been heaped up over the last decades as a result of money production under government - controlled fiat - money systems : if market interest rates no longer fall , or do not stay down , the credit pyramid would come crashing down .
Viewed from this perspective the so - called credit crisis might be much more than just a crisis that will , and can , be overcome shortly : it could herald an overindebtedness situation , in which borrowers have become heavily overstretched , and in which lenders are plagued by a growing concern that much of their lending decisions may turn out badly .
Lenders , in particular commercial banks , have become increasingly concerned about the possibility that borrowers might fail to service their debt as promised .
As a result , they refrain from rolling - over loans falling due , let alone increasing their credit exposure .
At the same time , borrowers find it difficult — in some cases impossible — to repay their maturing debt , and they would find it also hard , even impossible , to shoulder higher borrowing costs when rolling - over their debt .
In particular chronically debt - financed governments would see their room for maneuvering ( and their power ) severely restricted if access to credit funding at favorable terms ends all of a sudden .
All this might suggest that the " fight against the interest rate " is about to reach a new dimension .
The Way Towards Taking Full Control Of Interest Rates
In the United States , the Federal Open Market Committee reiterated on April 29 , 2009 ,
to provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets , the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of up to $ 1.25 trillion of agency mortgage - backed securities and up to $ 200 billion of agency debt by the end of the year .
In addition , the Federal Reserve will buy up to $ 300 billion of Treasury securities by autumn . [ 4 ]
There are at least two important aspects to these measures that need to be highlighted .
First , purchasing bonds outright is a policy of increasing the money stock : sellers of bonds receive base money from the Fed .
If commercial banks sell their bonds holdings , banks ' excess reserves increase , and their potential to create more credit and money rises .
If nonbanks ( such as insurance companies , funds , etc. ) sell their securities to the Fed , the stock of money in the hands outside the banking sector increases .
Second , if the government can sell newly issued debt directly to the central bank , the latter will increase the government 's account ( held either with the central bank or with commercial banks ) by an equivalent amount .
As the government uses the new money to pay its bills , the money stock in the hands of recipients ( typically nonbanks such as government contractors and employees , the unemployed , etc. ) rises .
Third , central - bank purchases in the open market will exert a major impact on the pricing and the interest rate of the bonds .
[ 5 ]
So far , central banks buy and sell short - dated bonds ( like T - bills ) for affecting the money supply .
If the central bank confines itself to buying and selling short - term paper , it controls short - term rates , but its control on long - term interest rates is far from being perfect . [ 6 ]
However , the central bank can secure control over the whole yield curve if it also intervenes in the markets for bonds with medium - to - long - term maturities .
By effectively fixing bond prices across the maturity spectrum , the central bank can determine short - , medium - and long - term interest rates according to political considerations .
This is actually what happened in the United States in the early 1940s .
Government Manipulation of the Interest Rate
For financing World War II , the US Treasury and the Fed decided early to pursue a policy of keeping market interest rates low and stable : T - bills were to yield 3/8 of 1 percent , while long - term government bonds were to yield 2½ percent .
[ 7 ]
The Fed effectively became a market maker for government debt .
Whenever the yield on , say , long - term government bonds rose above 2 ½ percent , the Fed could buy long - term bonds , bidding up their prices and lowering bond yields back to the politically desired level .
Likewise , if long - term yields fell below 2 ½ percent , the Fed could sell securities , thereby increasing the market supply of securities , lowering bond prices and increasing yields back to the politically desired level .
In the early 1940s , the US government kept running up huge war - related deficits .
The low - yielding T - bills were monetized by the Fed , while commercial banks received sufficient reserves to support the increased amount of deposit money they would create for the Treasury for purchasing its long - term debt .
Until the end of the policy of interest - rate pegging in March 1951 ( " Treasury - Fed Accord " ) , the Fed had actually lost control of its balance - sheet volume and , as a result , the money supply .
The Fed 's stabilizing of market interest rates on government debt resulted in a massive increase in the money supply .
As a consequence , prices for , for instance , consumer goods increased strongly , actually increasing well above nominal interest rates .
The " inflation tax " was imposed heavily on bond investors in general , as yields on private - sector debt remained relatively closely aligned to government debt yields .
The US monetary base had been rising sharply from the late 1930s , and the increase in the money stock also showed rising stock prices .
But the latter started inflating from around the time the interest - rate - pegging policy was put in place — which made possible the drastic expansion of the money stock without causing interest rates to rise .
The Economic Evils of Inflation
Needless to say , a policy of pegging the interest rate is a particularly vicious strategy .
If it is put into practice , it causes economic damage on a grand scale .
First and foremost , it is an inflation policy , and as such it brings all the economic and political evils that typically come with inflation .
It allows borrowers to issue even more debt , refund maturing debt at artificially suppressed interest rates , and reduce their real debt burden at the expense of money holders .
The downward manipulation of the interest rate drives a wedge between the ( real ) market interest rate and the societal time - preference rate , and therefore wreaks havoc with the economy 's intertemporal production structure .
It leads to economic impoverishment , as it would stimulate consumption at the expense of savings and encourage malinvestment of scarce resources .
What is more , suppressing the interest rate does not provide a solution to the overindebtedness problem , which is a result of government - controlled fiat money produced by banks extending credit in excess of real savings .
As Mises put it , inflation " could not last forever even if inflation and credit expansion were to go on endlessly .
It would then encounter the barriers , which prevent the boundless expansion of circulation credit .
It would lead to the crack - up boom and the breakdown of the whole monetary system . " [ 8 ]
The future could hold in store a bad surprise for bond investors and money holders if governments and their central banks push their current policy consequently to the end .
Tragically , there are not yet any signs that suggest governments and their central bankers will abandon their destructive policy .

A Russian woman ended up in intensive care after restoring her virginity for the sixth time .
The woman , identified as Natalia K. , got married at 24 .
Her husband was not the girl 's first sexual partner , Life .ru writes .
When the husband confessed he was upset about her losing her virginity before the wedding and with another man , Natalia decided to make things up for him .
To celebrate their first year together as a married couple , she went to a plastic surgery clinic and had a hymenoplasty operation .
The husband was so delighted with the present , that a year later Natalia wanted to give that joy to him again .
And the next year , and the year after that .
The sixth time the woman came for revirgination surgery , the doctors warned her it posed dangers for her health .
Nevertheless , Natalia signed a waiver of all claims and had the surgery done .
But the doctors ' fears turned out to be justified .
The woman 's weakened immune system failed to fight an unspecified minor infection she caught after the surgery , and landed her in intensive care .
As we all know , the Me 410 Hornisse was intended to replace the Me 210 .
The Me 410 was the result of trying to produce a Zerstörer after the failure with the Me 210 .
Me 410 was better than to any twin -engine German Zerstörer but it could n't not hold its own against Allied fighters .
Many Rüstsätze were produced for example an installment of guns up to 50 mm caliber and W Gr 21 rockets .
The main variant was the Me 410 - B series ( C , D , H did not enter operational status ) .
Me 410 was withdrawn from combat by the end of 1944 because of the need to produce fighters .
As only merely 1 160 a /c had been built when the production of the Me 410 ceased in Sept 1944 it made no important role in the air war over Germany .
Me 410 in combatThe night of 13 - 14 July 1943 , FL / Lt Bunting , 85 Squadron flying a Mosquito XII on a night interception patrol shot down a Me 410 the a / c turned over on its back and dived vertically into the sea .
It was the first Me 410 to be destroyed over Britain .
Two nights later another was shot down by 85 Squadron .
On 29 July a 3rd fell to the guns of the Mosquito from 256 Squadron and all 3 Me 410s was from VGruppe / KG 2.22 Feb 1944 , Hptm .
Eduard Tratt the highest scorer Zerstörer pilot claiming 38 a / c in the air , 26 on the ground , 24 tanks , 312 trucks and 33 anti-a / c guns took over command of II .
/ ZG76 in Sept 1943 and he made an foolhardy single - handed attack on a bomber formation near Nordhausen / Harz and was of course killed in the process , the escort FW 190s and Bf 109s from JG300 was unable to help him .
The only eye - witness was Oblt .
Prokopp who was killed a short time later when his Me 410 was rammed by a P - 47.13 May 1944 , One of the most disastrous missions for II .
/ ZG76 was when they was jumped by 20 P - 51s and 12 a / c were written of , many aircrews was lost and the US bomber force flew on unhindered to Poznan .
Obefelwebel Wolfgang Martin rammed a B - 17 with his damaged
Me 410 after ordering his crew to bale out .
2 July 1944 , I./ ZG76 had notable mission when together with I./ ZG 1 ( Me 110 ) and II ./ JG 27 ( Bf 109G ) destroyed 45 a / c in a big air battle over Budapest , 34 were bombers and 8 were claimed by I./ ZG76 without loss .
The Me 410 proved also to be quite a formidable adversary for the Mosquito's in the baby blitz 1943 - 1944 and one of the last units to operate the Me 410 was IV . / ZG26 based in Norway .

Submitted for the approval of The Midnight Society , I call this story ...
SPELUNKY !
This is my latest game release and my first Game Maker game .
Probably the easiest way to describe Spelunky is that it's ( kind of ) like La Mulana meets Nethack - every time you play the levels , items , monsters , and so forth , are all procedurally - generated .
And the terrain is destructible and there are quite a few ways in which the various game elements can interact with one another .
My goal was to create a fast - paced platform game that had the kind of tension , re-playability , and variety of a roguelike .
In roguelikes , the gameplay tells the story , and I wanted to give Spelunky that type of a feeling ... but make the player rely on their reflexes rather than their brain ( or knowledge of what 50 billion command keys do ! ) .
If there 's a best of both worlds , that 's what I was trying to go for .
But yeah , I 'll leave it to you to decide whether I got the mix right or failed miserably !
The game is not quite v1.0 , but it has most of the elements that I wanted to get in .
Hope you enjoy it , and I am eagerly awaiting your feedback , whether it 's good , bad , or frickin ' beautiful .
I 'm crossing my fingers that it does n't break !
Many , many thanks to the beta testers , without whom this would not have been possible !
Seriously , they contributed a ton of feedback , bug reports , and ideas to the game .
If it was n't for the constant tears in their eyes from my cruel lashes , I might have thought they even enjoyed it a bit .
And thanks , ChevyRay , for letting me use your nifty screen - scaling code .
Once I got it to work , it worked pretty beautifully .
K , that 's all !

» This game is really great , and damn it 's hard , I keep trying to kill the old man at the shops , but he always outsmarts me :D
I just have one complaint , I was playing the tutorial at first but then I tried to open a crate and it exploded ( ? ) , or maybe I confused the controls and dropped a bomb , not really sure what the hell happened .
Anyway my point is , I died in the tutorial without learning all the little quirks , and I really wanted to get back there , but it seems the tutorial only shows once .
I even tried deleting / start all over the again but the tutorial just wo n't show again .
Aside from that , really , the game is really nice , I got a feeling I 'll keep playing this game everyday for a long time .

As protesters continue their demonstrations all over Iran against 12th June presidential election results , Iranian authorities have arrested hundreds of activists , including bloggers .
Mohammad Ali Abtahi , former reformist vice president and an adviser to Mehdi Karoubi , a reformist candidate , was arrested last Tuesday .
Abtahi used to update his blog each day for several years and share his opinion on different topics , including Iranian issues .
Here is the last post that his friends published in his bilingual blog , Webneveshteha :
Mr. Abtahi arrested
Mohammad Ali Abtahi , former vice president during Mr. Khatami's presidency and the advisor to Mr. Karroubi in the presidential election had been arrested today ( Tuesday ) .
Whenever he gets released , he will write here on his website
In one of his last posts he called election “ obvious cheating ” :
I analyzed the obvious cheating .
It was a huge swindling .
Election was planned so wisely .
From one hand it made a new record of voting as it broke the previous record of Mr. Khatami who had gained more votes in second term of his presidential election and Mr. Ahmadi Nejad should gain more than him .
Also they would like to destroy Mr. Mosavi and his companions .
Another important part of scenario was the story of Mr. Karobi's 300,000 ballots .
Although Mr. Karobi had a fixed huge number of votes , they considered 300,000 votes for him avoiding others to say such democratic mottos .
Meanwhile information of other towns was showing at least equal votes for Mr. Mosavi and Ahmadi Nejad .
Somayeh Tohidloo , a female reformist blogger was also arrested .
As protests against the Iranian presidential election results grows , Iranian authorities continue to arrest political activists .
Recently , she and a couple of bloggers organized an Internet interview with former president Mohammad Khatami .
It seems that her blog is no longer accessible .
Mojtaba Saminejad , an Iran - based blogger and human rights activist , informs us about several other arrested bloggers .
Saminejad says that Shiva Nazar Ahari , a female blogger and human rights activist , Mehesa Amarabadi , a female blogger and journalist , Karim Argandehpour , a blogger and leading journalist and Amad Baharvar have all been detained .
So far there is no information about the charges against those bloggers .
Forget about Ashton Kutcher .
James Joyce 's Ulysses , one of the most difficult novels in English , is on Twitter .
Two devotees of Ulysses have adapted its 10th chapter to Twitter , which limits users to 140 characters per post .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Called Wandering
Rocks , the chapter is especially well - suited to Twitter because it follows 19 Dubliners going about their daily business .
For three years now , Ian Bogost , a Georgia Tech professor , and friend Ian McCarthy , a product manager at Linked In , have commemorated " Bloomsday " on Twitter on June 16 .
That date in 1904 is when the entirety of Ulysses takes place , chronicling the experiences of a man named Leopold Bloom .
Bogost says using Twitter " for literary performance art might help shift perspectives on the service " and get people to use it for more than self - centered musings .
" Perhaps in so doing , we can shift people 's interest in social media technologies from egomania and immediacy toward deliberation and cultural reflection , " Bogost wrote in an email from Australia .
Bogost and McCarthy have dubbed their performance Twittering Rocks , a play on the chapter 's title that could also mean Twittering is awesome .
They have registered 54 of the novel 's key characters as Twitter users , and Bogost built a software program that tweets their first - person utterances at the correct moments in the chapter .
" The result is a complex web of timed interactions between many characters , " he said , " precisely the effect Joyce was aiming for in the novel . "
Many people opt for newer homes because they are cleaner , bigger and often have more amenities .
But new research shows old houses in old neighborhoods may be better for your health .
University of Utah researchers found that people who live in older , more walkable neighborhoods are at lower risk for overweight and obesity .
The study , to be published in the September issue of The American Journal of Preventive Medicine , tracked the body mass index of nearly a half million Salt Lake County residents in Utah .
They found that neighborhoods built before 1950 tended to offer greater overall walkability because they had been designed for pedestrians .
Newer neighborhoods often were designed primarily to facilitate car travel , the researchers noted .
“ It is difficult for individuals to change their behavior , ” wrote Ken Smith , co-author of the study and professor of family and consumer studies at the University of Utah .
“ But we can build environments that promote healthy behavior . ”
Dr. Smith and colleagues used census data as well as height and weight information obtained from the drivers ’ license records of 453,927 Salt Lake County residents between the ages of 25 and 64 .
They found that men , on average , weighed 10 pounds less if they lived in a walkable neighborhood versus a neighborhood less conducive to walking .
The average woman weighed six pounds less .
“ The data show that how and where we live can greatly affect our health , ” Dr. Smith said .
“ Neighborhoods with higher fractions of residents who walk to work tell us that something beneficial about the neighborhood is promoting health . ”
The research offers a blueprint for communities on better ways to design new developments to encourage healthful living .
And for people shopping for homes , the lesson is to think about not just the house itself but whether the neighborhood is pedestrian - friendly , with sidewalks , bike and walking paths , low traffic and amenities like coffee shops or convenience stores that are within walking distance .
Last fall , Stanford Medicine Magazine also looked at the effect neighborhoods have on health .
Researchers there found that among people who were trying to be more active , living in walkable neighborhoods dramatically improved their odds of exercising for at least two - and - a - half hours a week .
In one study of people who were trying to change their exercise habits , 67 percent of people who lived in walkable neighborhoods achieved their goals , compared to just 30 percent of those who lived in pedestrian - unfriendly areas .
The human brain may be able to include cyborg implants in its representation of the body ( Image : Jeff J Mitchell / Getty )
When you brush your teeth , the toothbrush may actually become part of your arm – at least as far as your brain is concerned .
That ’s the conclusion of a study showing perceptions of arm length change after people handle a mechanical tool .
The brain maintains a physical map of the body , with different areas in charge of different body parts .
Researchers have suggested that when we use tools , our brains incorporate them into this map .
To test the idea , Alessandro Farné of the University of Claude Bernard in Lyon , France , and colleagues attached a mechanical grabber to the arms of 14 volunteers .
The modified subjects then used the grabber to pick up out - of - reach objects .

Shortly afterwards , the volunteers perceived touches on their elbow and fingertip as further apart than they really were , and took longer to point to or grasp objects with their hand than prior to using the tool .
The explanation , say the team , is that their brains had adjusted the brain areas that normally control the arm to account for the tool and not yet adjusted back to normal .
“ This is the first evidence that tool use alters the body [ map ] , ” says Farné .
Farné says the same kind of brain “ plasticity ” might be involved in regaining control of a transplanted hand or a prosthetic limb when the original has been lost .
The brain might also readily incorporate cyborg additions – a cyborg arm or other body part – into its body schema , says Farné , “ and possibly new body parts differing in shape and / or number , for example four arms . ”
Small implants such as pacemakers are inserted in the existing body so do not need to be accepted by the body schema , adds Farné , “ but a pair of wings would – that would be tough ! ”

Gov. Haley Barbour ( R - MS ) , Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) , and Mitt Romney all appeared on Sunday morning talk shows , and all said that disgraced South Carolina governor should not resign .
The Republicans all claimed that Sanford has a personal problem , and completely ignored the fact that Sanford abandoned his post as governor .
On Face the Nation Gov. Barbour was asked if Sanford should resign .
Barbour answered ,
Well , I do n’t think so , but that ’s up to the people of South Carolina .
But no , I do n’t think so . ”
Host Bob Schieffer followed up by asking about the fact that Sanford went AWOL , and Barbour dodged the question , You know , Bob , I do n’t know all the details .
But I ’ve been in politics a long time .
I ’ve made it my policy , I just do n’t talk about people ’s personal problems .
I do n’t– I do n’t think it ’s appropriate , I do n’t think it ’s polite , and I do n’t think it – it achieves any purpose . ”
( Note to all : It is not polite to talk about a governor who vanishes ) .
Lindsey Graham and Mitt Romney were on Meet the Press , and they also defended Sanford .
Graham , who is the godfather of the Sanford ’s youngest child said , “ I think if Mark can reconcile with Jenny , and that ’s not going to be easy , that he can finish his last 18 months .
He ’s had a good reform agenda .
And I do believe that if , if he can reconcile with his family and if he ’s willing to try , that the people of South Carolina would be willing to give him a second chance .
But he ’s also got to reconcile the legislature .
If he can get his family back together , I think he can continue out his term and maybe do some good things next year . ”

Mitt Romney tried to dodge the question about Sanford going MIA , You know , his , his holding onto that job is really between him and his family and the , and the people of South Carolina .
It ’s not for people outside the state to make pronouncements on .
This is a matter which is really a heartbreaking matter , and that ’s what I think you have to focus on .
You ’ve got a family in great distress .
And I ’m , I ’m really …
Well , overwhelmingly the heartbreak is what the public is focused on , and what we should be focused on .
And seeing this family become healed is our highest priority . ”
The hypocrisy of Barbour , Graham , and Romney is unbelievable .
These are people who were calling Bill Clinton to resign over the Lewinsky affair , and Clinton did n’t vanish to Argentina to hang out with his mistress .
The affair is n’t why Sanford should resign .
It is the fact that he abandoned the people of his state , and nobody knew where he was for days .
Republicans are trying to downplay his neglect of his political duties , and are trying to create sympathy for Sanford .
If you we ’re making an episode of the A - Team , and you needed to establish how evil your bad guy was , one way to show that would be to have them living it up in a big mansion while the town they rule is real poor .
And they could walk the streets drinking delicious water in front of little kids on the verge of dehydration .
This clip of Kate Gosselin is like that , except it ’s real life , and instead of random Mexican kids , it ’s her own god damn daughter .
Here we see Plus 8 chasing fireflies and playing kick the can .
Oh wait no they ’re in a television studio so Kate can use them as props while she does an interview .
While they wait , Mady says she ’s thirsty .
Kate ignores her .
Mady says it again .
Kate asks for a bottle of water , then takes a sip herself , then puts it away .
Mady is , at best , three inches away when this happens .
Mady says , “ You ’re really really mean , you drank it right in front of my face . ”
And Kate says , “ Be quiet . ”
Then , FOR THE SECOND GOD DAMN TIME , Kate pretends as if she ’s going to give a sip of water to adorable little girl , but then does n’t .
It ’s … I ca n’t … even …. she ’s so cold , it feels like watching Ralph Fienes shoot that little kid in the back in Schindlers List .
And he was a Nazi .
Who ran a concentration camp .
Even crocodiles provide for their kids , and they eat half of them .
A growing chorus claims that Apple ’s questionable approval policy for its iPhone application store raises issues with net neutrality .
Free Press , a group that advocates the idea of an open internet — that is , one in which consumers have the right to browse the web and run internet applications without restrictions — is the latest of several organizations to call out Apple for its inconsistencies .
Free Press alleges that Apple crippled SlingPlayer , a TV - streaming application for iPhone , so that it would only work on a Wi -Fi connection ; the initial version worked with a 3G cellular network connection as well as Wi-Fi .
The SlingPlayer restriction is inconsistent with Apple ’s approval of the Major League Baseball application , which provides live - streaming of sports events on both Wi-Fi and 3G connections , the group said .
“ That strikes us as odd and potentially nefarious because it really represents a carrier picking and choosing applications for consumers as opposed to letting consumers decide which videos they want to watch , ” said Ben Scott , policy director of Free Press .
“ It ’s exactly the sort of thing you ’d expect in an internet experience that ’s controlled by the carrier . ”
Now nearly a year old , Apple ’s App Store has received as much praise as it has criticism .
Featuring more than 50,000 applications , the App Store has made some programmers quite wealthy with sales of their apps while leaving others penniless when their software met the harsh fate of rejection .
Apple has said that iPhone and iPod Touch users have downloaded more than 1 billion apps from the store since it opened in July 2008 .
IPhone application developer Ben Kahle also feels that Apple is overreaching in its role as a gatekeeper to the mobile internet .
In May , Apple rejected Kahle ’s app “ Me So Holy , ” which would have enabled users to fashion their faces into portraits resembling Jesus Christ .
Apple said the app contains “ objectionable material , ” and when Kahle asked if he could modify the app to gain approval , Apple said it would never appear in the App Store under any condition .
Why ?
Apple said it has a “ worldwide market ” and must “ protect the sensitivity of the customers , ” according to Kahle .
“ It ’s definitely hypocritical , ” Kahle said of 3G - capable live - streaming for MLB in relation to SlingPlayer , which is Wi-Fi only .
“ There needs to be a better system for people to choose the type of content they can download . ”
Free Press ’ beef has to do with the apparently arbitrary nature of Apple ’s choices .
In May , SlingMedia told Wired.com it had to modify the SlingPlayer application to work only with Wi -Fi in order to gain Apple ’s approval .
Apple made that request on behalf of AT&T , whose terms of service states television signals may not be viewed on an device whose internet is provided by AT&T :
downloading movies using P2P file sharing services , redirecting television signals for viewing on Personal Computers , web broadcasting , and / or for the operation of servers , telemetry devices and / or Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition devices is prohibited .
An AT&T spokesman explained that a 3G - capable SlingPlayer could potentially strain AT&T ’s 3G network .
However , Major League Baseball ’s streaming video , which provides the same game coverage that you can find on TV broadcasts , can also be considered live television .
Thus , the MLB iPhone app also violates AT&T ’s terms of service , Scott said .
“ If you ’re going to allow video to stream on the 3G network , you ca n’t pick and choose which video services operate , ” Scott said .
“ You have to let them all operate , otherwise that ’s not the internet . ”
In response to Free Press ’ allegations , AT&T said the MLB app streams video from MLB ’s website , while SlingPlayer streams from the TV set - top box Slingbox .
AT&T also said the company is only trying to ensure all users on its network get the best possible service .
“ We ’re certainly not crippling any apps , ” an AT&T spokesman said .
“ This is an issue of fairness … .
While we would like to support all video services across our network , the reality is that wireless networks simply lack the capacity to support customers streaming hours of cable , satellite or IPTV video programming to individual users . ”
AT&T added that an app such as SlingPlayer would create congestion , allowing Sling users to use “ more than their fair share ” of available network capacity .
AT&T added that later this year it will begin upgrading its 3G networks to High Speed Packet Access 7.2 Mbps , which will theoretically double peak speeds of the current network from 3.6 megabits per second to 7.2 Mbps .
However , Ken Biba , founder of wireless consulting firm Novarum , said the rejection of SlingPlayer is clear evidence that AT&T ’s network is overloaded , and the problem is likely going to get worse .
“ I interpret AT&T ’s actions as less about being closed and more about having not enough network capacity , ” said Biba , noting that the new iPhone 3GS introduces video recording and uploading — which will clog the network even more .
Biba added that even when carriers roll out the fourth - generation Long Term Evolution cellular network , AT&T ’s network capacity will still be insufficient because by then , smartphones will be even more sophisticated and affordable , creating even more congestion .
Shortly after the 2008 launch of the iPhone 3G , Sam Greenholtz , founder of Telecom Pragmatics , told Wired.com that AT&T and Apple were not prepared to service the tremendous growth in iPhone users .
Greenholtz stressed that data traffic is the main cause of spotty reception , especially in major metropolitan areas where 3G is being used the most .
When a 3G tower gets overloaded with requests it dumps data packets ; some users ’ phones get no signal at all while others ’ default to the slower EDGE network on a less overloaded cell tower .
“ AT&T may have had 10,000 users in downtown , and the cell site may have been engineered to handle that many calls , but with this phenomenal buying there are now 20,000 people out there that have AT&T service on the 3G iPhone , ” Greenholtz said in 2008 .
Free Press ’ suggestion to Apple and AT&T for video - streaming applications ?
Either ban anything that provides live streaming , or approve them all under the condition that developers install code to temporarily disable live - streaming whenever the network does n’t have the capacity to handle it .
Biba said an even better solution would be if more cities deployed free Wi-Fi coverage to offload the stress from carrier networks .
What should AT&T , Apple and other carriers should do ?

There is n't much to be said for Nicholas ­Ridley , the most desiccated ­market ­fundamentalist in Margaret ­Thatcher 's cabinet , but at least he was aware of the ­government 's ­contradictions .
When he took over the Department of Trade and Industry in 1989 , he asked : " What is the DTI for ?
I 've got bugger all to do and thousands of staff to help me do it . "
Thatcher 's government had spent 10 years preaching that people should stand on their own two feet and that the market should be free from meddling by the state .
But it ran a large department whose purpose was to nanny free enterprise .
The name has changed , to Business , Enterprise & Regulatory Reform , but the department 's policies have not .
I think , however , that I have an answer to Ridley 's question .
BERR , now run by Lord Mandelson , functions as a fifth column within government , working for corporations to undermine democracy and the public interest .
Since he became business secretary in October , Mandelson has been quietly building a bonfire of the measures that protect us from predatory corporate behaviour .
You do n't have to look very far to see where BERR 's interests lie .
Most government departments contain either one unelected minister or none .
Two departments ( the Foreign Office and Innovation , Universities and Skills ) each accommodate two unelected ­ministers .
But BERR has four .
It is the only ­department of government in which unelected ministers outnumber members of parliament .
Until he became minister for communications in BERR , Lord Carter was the chief executive of Brunswick Group , a big public relations firm whose clients include British Airways , Barclays , Unilever , Rolls Royce and BT .
Lord Davies , the minister for trade and investment , was chairman of Standard Chartered and a non-executive director of Tesco .
Until October , the trade minister was Digby Jones , formerly the director general of the Confederation of British Industry .
Lord Jones refused to join the Labour party , or to say which party he would support at the next election .
As for Lord Mandelson , who previously ranked second on Gordon Brown 's execution list , the only convincing explanation for his appointment is that business demanded it .
Mandelson , who once avowed that " we are intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich " was partly responsible , both in Blair 's government and as European trade commissioner , for promoting the culture of deregulation that catalysed the economic crisis .
Yet even today he boasts about " a decade of reform that has given the UK the most open and flexible product and labour markets in the world " .
These unelected ministers appear to have formed their own lobby group within government , to prevent those upstart parliamentarians from interfering with the democratic rights of business .
They are responsible for some of the policies that now threaten to tear the Labour party apart .
Mandelson is the promoter of Labour 's crazy scheme to part - privatise Royal Mail .
Wildly unpopular with both the public and Labour MPs , it breaks a manifesto commitment and could provoke a parliamentary rebellion big enough to unseat the prime minister .
But most of his assaults on democracy have achieved much less attention .
Last week he helped neuter the EU 's working time directive by ensuring that European companies will still be able to push their employees into working for more than 48 hours a week .
BERR issued a gleeful press release bragging that talks on the directive " have broken down without agreement being reached " as a result of government filibusters .
Mandelson 's attempt to prevent companies exploiting their female workers was less successful .
The ­equality bill sought to audit large companies to ensure that they were not paying women less than men for the same jobs .
Mandelson insisted the audits should be voluntary , and that the policy should first be approved by the CBI , which often seems to be the real government of Britain .
Last month , although it passed almost unnoticed , BERR deregulated the news distribution industry .
This is a gift to the supermarkets but a disaster for both small newsagents – and for freedom of speech .
The companies that distribute newspapers and magazines to the shops have historically guaranteed , in return for exclusive delivery rights , to supply whatever stock a shop requests , however small the order might be .
This allowed small newsagents to survive and protected publishers from censorship by powerful retailers .
( In the United States , supermarkets often ­dictate the contents of the magazines they sell ) .
Tesco has been trying to break the ­distribution agreement since 2000 ; now Mandelson has delivered .
A few days ago , the Guardian revealed that BERR has set up a new unit , whose purpose appears to be to lobby another department on behalf of business .
The business department relinquished its responsibility for energy policy only six months ago .
Now it has created an energy and climate change unit , whose brief and title look suspiciously similar to Ed Miliband 's Department for Energy and Climate Change .
While Miliband gets the environment , Mandelson appears to be doing everything in his power to trash it .
Over the past year he has secured £ 2.6 bn in subsidies , loans and guarantees for the motor industry .
He boasts that this is " effectively the same as underwriting the entire vehicle sector 's research and development and capital expenditure for a year " .
He is widely blamed for the decision to build a third runway at Heathrow .
Last month BERR launched a consultation about the EU 's attempts to strengthen its directives on waste electrical equipment and hazardous substances .
The EU is trying to cut the amount of cyberjunk going into ­landfill and to prevent companies ­sending dead computers overseas to be ­dismantled by child labourers .
In ­drafting the ­consultation document , Mandelson 's department conferred with 10 ­industry bodies but no trade unions or ­environment or development groups .
In the strategic plan it released last month , BERR announced that it wants the government to " match … the influence it ­exercises in the economy to the strategic needs of business " .
It also wants to second even more people from the private ­sector into government , which is ­already ­infested with people whose public ­duties conflict with their ­commercial interests .
It revealed that , as of last month , " grant applicants to all ­research councils will have to set out the ­economic impact of their proposed research " .
This appears to mark the end of the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake : all research , whether funded by the state or corporations , must now ­consider the needs of business .
Business is perfectly capable of ­making its own representations .
It does not require a cell inside government to ensure that its voice is heard ; it should compete , like the rest of us , for the attention of ministers .
Mandelson 's department has one legitimate function : simplifying and clarifying regulations .
The others – the trade missions , the lobbying , the featherbedding – achieve the rare distinction of undermining both social democracy and free markets .
BERR now has a budget of £ 1.92bn , £ 460 m bigger than it was last year .
The government is looking for savings .
It should close this department down .
Brad Childress has taken a week off to go fishing in Alaska with his good buddy Andy Reid , and given all the hysteria around the team lately , I ca n’t say I blame him .
As a matter of fact , I have a good mind to join Chilly … not by going to Alaska to fish with him and Andy Reid – that would be stalking plus I hate fishing – but by taking a week off from blogging .
A week without having to post anything about Brett Favre !
That would be bliss .
Sadly , I ’m sure something would happen in the course of that week , some report of Favre ’s arm not being right , or a rumor about a second team jumping in to maybe offer him a deal , and I would get sucked back in just like a bad Al Pacino impersonator .
Then again , maybe nothing will happen .
Maybe Brett will take a week off from being Brett , and Ed Werder will take a week off from making up stories , and the whole sports media will take a week off from speculating .
In that case , I should have no problem taking a week off .
Well , screw it then …see you guys next Tuesday ( unless something happens ) .
Today ’s release of state unemployment and jobs numbers shows that the recession is affecting all states , but some much more than others .
Since the recession began in December 2007 , the unemployment rate has gone up in all 50 states , with the national average now at 8.9 % .
There are now eight states , which make up over a quarter of the US population , with unemployment over 10 % .
April , 2009 Unemployment Michigan 12.9 % Oregon 12.0 % South Carolina 11.5 % Rhode Island 11.1 % California 11.0 % North Carolina 10.8 % Nevada 10.6 % Ohio 10.2 % District of Columbia 9.9 % Indiana 9.9 % Tennessee 9.9 %
Below are tables that show the top 10 ( or 11 in the case of a tie ) states in terms of percentage point change in unemployment rates in the recession , percent of jobs lost , and current unemployment rates .
These essentially measure , respectively , the recession ’s impact on workers , the impact on the economy , and how workers are faring .
Since December 2007 Unemployment Percentage Point Change Job Loss ( percent ) Oregon 6.7 Michigan - 8.0 % North Carolina 5.8 Arizona - 8.0 % South Carolina 5.7 Nevada - 7.1 % Michigan 5.6 Florida - 6.3 % Indiana 5.4 Idaho - 6.1 % Nevada 5.4 Oregon - 6.0 % Alabama 5.2 North Carolina - 5.4 % Rhode Island 5.1 Ohio - 5.3 % California 5.1 Georgia - 5.2 % Florida 4.8 California - 5.1 % Indiana - 5.1 %
In these top 10 lists , there are 6 states that make all three : California , Indiana , Michigan , Nevada , North Carolina , and Oregon .
A common theme in many of these states is that manufacturing represents a large part of the state economy .
Before the recession began , four of these states ( Indiana , Michigan , North Carolina , and Oregon ) were well above the national average in terms of manufacturing jobs .
As that industry declined , these state economies were unable to shift gears quickly enough and move workers to other jobs .
As evidence of this , in these four states manufacturing jobs made up 14.6 % of the total jobs , yet represent 41.2 % of the total jobs lost since the recession began .
Here ’s another sign that California ’s foreclosures could jump in 2009 : Delinquencies on dues owed to homeowner associations have risen sharply .
The homeowner association delinquency rate can serve as a leading indicator of sorts because homeowners usually stop paying dues before they stop paying their mortgage .
The 90 - day delinquency rate on dues for the 260 homeowner associations in California managed by Merit Property Management jumped to 5.3 % in March from 2.8 % last June .
Delinquencies first spiked to 2.6 % in December 2007 ...
Today , June 4 , is the 35th anniversary of the drunkest night in sports history — Ten -Cent Beer Night at Municipal Stadium in Cleveland .
What better way to celebrate than getting absolutely blitzed on some cheap Stroh's ?

For those of you too young to remember the 1970s ( lucky you ) , on a night much like tonight in 1974 , the Indians hosted the Rangers with a special beer promotion that drew 25,000 fans , or roughly three times the average attendance , to the ball yard .
Eight ounces of tasty , tasty Stroh 's for just one thin dime .
Can you paint the picture in your head ?
The teams were not the best of friends ( they had brawled in Texas a week earlier ) and things got a little heated late in the game — a game that featured multiple streakers , mooners , and hot dog throwers .
The event even has its own Wikipedia page , which helpfully explains .
The ugliness escalated when Cleveland 's Leron Lee hit a line drive into the stomach of Rangers pitcher Ferguson Jenkins , after which Jenkins dropped to the ground .
The fans in the upper deck of Municipal Stadium cheered , then chanted " Hit 'em again !
Hit 'em again !
Harder !
Harder ! "
As the game progressed , more fans ran onto the field and caused problems .
Ranger Mike Hargrove ( who would manage the Indians and lead them to the World Series 21 years later ) was pelted with hot dogs and spit , and at one point was nearly struck with an empty gallon jug of Thunderbird .

Things came to a frosty head in the ninth when a fan tried to steal Texas outfielder Jeff Burroughs ' hat .
Burroughs tripped and fell down , his teammates thought he was under attack and charged out of the dugout with bats .
( Yes , Billy Martin was involved . )
A full - fledged riot ensued , players were hit with bottles , chairs , fists , and eventually Cleveland had to forfeit .
The local station broadcasting the game showed a tremendous lack of foresight into the coming YouTube age and switched off the live broadcast as soon as it turned ugly .
Still , good times all around .
And that 's why 35 years later , a local Cleveland watering hole is memorializing the occasion with ... 10 - cent drafts of Stroh's .
And some wholesome rock music .
Please tell me Mike Hargrove will be there .
Cleveland Bar Celebrates 35th Anniversary of Ten Cent Beer Night with Ten Cent Beer [ Cleveland Scene ]

Connie Culp , the nation 's first face transplant recipient , lost the middle of her face in the fall of 2004 when her husband shot her and then turned the gun on himself .
He survived with minor injuries and is serving a seven year sentence in prison .
Connie Culp , 40 at the time , lost her nose , one eye , her upper jaw and upper lip , palate and lower eyelids .
She could n't eat solid food , drink from a cup , smell or taste .
She could only breathe through a hole cut into her throat .
After nearly 30 surgeries at the Cleveland Clinic failed to help her , she became only the fourth person in the world to receive a face transplant .
On Tuesday she showed the world her new face .
The Dec. 9 operation , considered the most complex face transplant to date , lasted nearly 23 hours .
After doctors removed scar tissue , bone grafts , and metal from her previous surgeries , Culp received 80 percent of the face and underlying tissue of an organ donor .
Culp was released from the Clinic on Feb. 5th .
Her name , age , and type of injury had been withheld to protect her privacy .
She spoke to the media briefly for the first time Tuesday at a news conference held at the Intercontinental Hotel on the Clinic campus .
Culp , who had been taunted and called names because of her appearance , asked that everyone think twice about judging people who look differently .
" When somebody has a disfigurement or does n't look as pretty as you , do n't judge them , " she said .
" You never know what happened to them and you never know what might happen to you . . . . it might all be taken away . "
Culp has remained in the Cleveland area since her release from the hospital in order to receive follow - up treatment and has " progressed tremendously , " said Dr. Maria Siemionow , Culp 's surgeon and pioneer of the face transplant technique at the Clinic .
Like any transplant patient , she will need to have monthly doctor visits for the next year and will be closely monitored for any signs that her body is rejecting the foreign tissue .
Unlike many kidney , liver , or heart transplant patients who are critically ill by the time they need a transplant , Culp went into the transplant healthy .
" Her chance of getting a very good outcome with minimal side effects is very high , " Siemionow said .
She is due for more surgeries in the future , though .
Surgeons transplanted extra facial tissue in the operation because they thought that some of the tissue might be rejected .
It is all healthy , so Culp will need a few minor tuck procedures in four to five months to remove some of the excess donor skin , Papay said .
Time will also allow facial nerves to regenerate in Culp 's face , which will restore movement to the muscles of the donor tissue , allowing her to smile and show emotion .
Culp has been weaned off several anti-rejection drugs and is only taking one such medication now , said Dr. Frank Papay , chairman of the dermatology and plastic surgery institute .
She had one mild episode of rejection 47 days after the surgery that doctors found in a routine biopsy .
It was treated with a course of steroids , and there have been no problems since .
Facial transplantation has been controversial because some doctors and ethicists believe that the risks of immune rejection and other complications were unknown .
Dr. Eric Kodish , chairman of the department of bioethics at the Clinic , said that the progress Culp has made in recovering function is important evidence of the ethical justification of the surgery .
" This is not cosmetic surgery in any sense of the word , " he said .
Siemionow said the team is evaluating many potential candidates for future transplantation but the team is focused on Culp 's recovery and it will be several months before they consider another surgery .
The surgeon , who has spent 20 years researching transplantation of body parts and received approval to move ahead with a face transplant in 2004 , said that Culp 's outcome is overwhelming .
" This is all about functional outcome , " she said .
" If you can breathe through your nose in the spring in Cleveland , is n't that amazing ? "

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Many women taking the crowded train in Tokyo opt for women - only carriages during the rush hour to avoid gropers .

Now , for fear of being accused of groping , some are asking for carriages reserved for men as well .
Ten shareholders of Seibu Holdings , which runs trains in the Tokyo area , have petitioned for carriages reserved for men .
“ There have been many cases of groping , as well as false charges of groping , on Seibu Railway , ” the shareholders said in a notice seeking a vote at the company ’s annual meeting next Wednesday .
“ While measures against groping , such as setting women - only carriages , have been effective to a certain extent , no measures have been taken against false charges of groping ...
In the spirit of gender - equality , a male - only carriage must be introduced . ”
False accusations of groping were highlighted when Japan ’s Supreme Court overturned in April the conviction of a professor for groping a girl on a Tokyo train .
Judges pointed out a need to be careful in such cases when the accuser was the only source of evidence , media said .
But the shareholder request for men ’s carriages may not be implemented , as Seibu ’s board of directors opposes the idea .
“ The reality is that we have few requests from Seibu Railway users for setting up male - only carriages , ” the board said in its reply to the shareholder request .
In Tokyo , around 2,000 people were arrested for groping in 2007 , data from the police showed .
Many crowded train lines , including Seibu lines , designate a carriage just for women during the rush hour .
You ’ve heard the expression , “ everything is better with bacon ” – well , who knew that this included cupcakes .
Frankly , I do n’t believe I have ever met a person who can resist the magical powers of bacon .
The scent , the flavor , just thinking about bacon makes my mouth water .
It ’s funny how bacon plays well with so many other flavors and types of foods .
Bacon can instantly take the everyday sandwich or salad to a new level .
Bacon wrapped steak , scallops , chicken livers , or dates … the possibilities seem to be endless .
Anthony Bourdain ’s show “ No Reservations ” on the Travel Channel did a episode on Portland , Oregon .
Voodoo Doughnut was a strange local shop that specialized in unique donuts , one being a maple cream stick with crisp bacon .
This is where the idea of the French Toast and Bacon Cupcake was born .
Savory and sweet work so well together , and since I already drown my bacon in maple syrup , why not ?
Cinnamon , nutmeg , and a bit more vanilla are the key extras in this yellow cake recipe that give it a French Toast feel .
I should note , these cupcakes smell amazing while baking !
I whipped up a Maple Buttercream to frost them with and finished them with the crown jewel …crispy bacon .
For aesthetics I left the bacon in one piece , but would prefer it crumbled for easy eating !
Enjoy !
French Toast Cupcakes
What You ’ll Need :
3/4 cup unsalted butter ( 1 1/2 sticks ) , at room temperature

3. ) Meanwhile , in a medium bowl , whisk together the flour , baking powder , salt , nutmeg , and cinnamon .
Set aside .
In a small bowl , whisk together the milk and vanilla , and also set aside .
4. ) Add the egg yolks to the creamed butter one at time , waiting for each one to be fully incorporated before adding the next .
5. ) Reduce the speed of the mixer to low .
Alternately , add the flour mixture in 3 additions and the milk in 2 additions , waiting for each to be fully incorporated before adding the next ( scrape the bowl down occasionally ) .
Raise the speed to medium and mix briefly until a smooth batter is formed .
Transfer the batter to a large bowl .
6. ) Thoroughly clean the bowl of the mixer and put the egg whites inside .
Whip the egg whites on high speed , using the whisk attachment , until stiff peaks are formed .
7. ) Working in 3 batches , using a rubber spatula , fold the egg whites into the batter , until just incorporated .
Divide the batter evenly among the cups in the muffin pan .

Crisp Bacon
Bacon works well for me baked in an oven at 425 degrees on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper .

From Tianya :
Xinhua News : Around 5 o’clock on the 17th , an elevated road on Hongqi Road of Zhuzhou City in Hunan province collapsed , and at present the number of casualties is unknown .
Here are some pictures that were posed on various BBS forums incuding Sina , NetEase , and Mop :
The government said four people died .
Comments from Tianya :
唯一的老四 :
I passed by .
This kind of thing happens plenty of time .
If not too many people die , the central government wo n’t care .
救国军 :
Modern society ’s construction / buildings are all trash .
Modern people ’s construction are worse than the construction / buildings of people in the past .
BigMonster :
This is definitely not a tofu dregs building [ poorly constructed buildings that do not meet regulations ] , this elevated road had a mishap during demolition , the public security bureau , fire department , traffic police and various major hospitals were all present to help the rescue .
不快乐的想法 :
These days it seems like there is nowhere that is safe .
Walking across crosswalks is not safe , traveling on motorways is also not safe , what is going on ?
goya0818 :
This is not tofu dregs , this elevated road was in the process of being demolished
so there must have been a problem with the work process
but the reason is unclear .
The elevated road crushed 22 vehicles
include several public buses
because it just happened to be rush hour time .
Everyone please pray for those hurt under the elevated road .
yuxiang0826 :
3 public buses were crushed , how could there only be 4 [ dead ] .
Television / news channels , keep lying .
Continue on lying .
There are at least 100 + and above .
Nick走天涯 :
Very saddening !
I have been to Zhuzhou several times before , felt that city as pretty good .
However I bet the Hangzhou government will be able to breathe a little easier .
topmarques :
Although this was not tofu dregs building , this construction company clearly knew this elevated road was in a busy commercial area , completely did not implement safety measures , and completely did not consider the common people ’s lives and property .
Whenever they have something a little like success , they rush to report it in the news , but now that something bad has happened , how come we do not see the leadership anywhere ?
Aside from censoring and blocking information , what else do you guys know how to do ?
xuegong :
The Zhuzhou government is continuously working hard … … continuously working hard to censor and block information !!
广寒之西 :
The government again wants to censor and block information , yet again this nonsense .
Not valuing human life , in the past when there was no internet the government would just not report , this time we cannot keep silent .
There must be an explanation by the relevant departments .
May the innocent rest in peace .
贫僧只爱周晓涵 :
Speechess , blowing up one half , leaving on half , and since there were no danger warning signs , also no traffic police management , it was clearly waiting for a dangerous collapse !
MLGBD , a bunch of people who only know how to eat other ’s food and not do anything meaningful , all TMD with pig brains !
City construction in their eyes is just a trivial thing .
If they want to demolish something they demolish something .
If they want to build , they build .
In my hometown , there was a road lined with trees and flowers , but then they chopped all the trees , pulled up on the grass , and completely TMD paved it with bricks !
Why ?
Because the deputy mayor in charge of urban construction ’s brother - in - law makes and sells bricks !!!
四级士官 :
Looks like Sichuan ’s “ strong - willed bridge ” [ similar to “ strong - willed pig ” ] is still good , the Tuojiang Bridge built during the Cultural Revolution , ater last year ’s 5.12 earthquake was deemed to be a dangerous / unfit bridge by experts and was set to be demolished .
However , after being filled with large amounts of TNT explosives , after being detonated , the bridge actually still stood , remaining upright .
Simply ironic , that a 60 - year - old bridge could not be toppled by an earthquake and could not be detroyed by explosives .
风铃曲 :
According to what a friend at the hospital said , that day around 8 pm at night , the number of dead confirmed by the hospital was over 80 people , and Zhuzhou government saying only 4 dead is complete bullshit !!!
The pictures you see are only the outermost row of cars that were crushed , there are two more rows inside , and amongst them is a # 19 route public bus with all seats and standing space filled with passengers .
After the incident happened , no survivors .
潜 水4年多 :
Comrades , please calm down … according to the latest report , no one from the Zhuzhou City committee , party , government , military , or various leadership and their wives were hurt from this accident .
Those who died were only a few ordinary commoners , so there is no need to make a big deal over this engineering accident .
It will disappear within a month from the public ’s field of vision ;

A balance sport , Slacklining utilizes nylon webbing stretched tight between two anchor points .
The line is not held rigidly taut � it is dynamic , stretching and bouncing like a large rubber band .
The line 's tension can be adjusted to suit the performer and different types of dynamic webbing can be used to achieve a variety of feats .
The line itself is flat , due to the nature of webbing , therefore keeping the slacker 's footing from rolling as would be the case with an ordinary rope .
Christian Schou holds the Guinness World Record title for the highest slackline after crossins a Norwegian fjord in Kjerag , Norway at 3,280 feet ( 1000 meters ) � the equivalent of 3 Eiffel towers high .
To most of its 50 million users , it is the world 's largest car boot sale , where a little rummage turns up anything from a model of the F - 111 Aardvark bomber to a Legend of Zorro DVD and a million items in between .
It is a place to find a house , a car , a new job , or even love .
But to fulminating politicians and law - enforcers in the US , it is " America 's pimp " , where prostitutes tout for business among the lonely hearts ads .
Consumer advocates say it is a seething nest of scam artists and forgers .
It is , in other words , the human souk in all its glory , a venue for any and every kind of transaction .
It is Craigslist .
Assailed by legal challenges and a high - profile murder charge in Boston for the so - called " Craigslist killer " , you might think that this 14 - year - old internet phenomenon was cowed and on the defensive .
Because its major sources of revenue are job listings in US cities and estate agents in the teetering economy of New York , you might think the recession is giving it a beating .
Far from it .
According to a new report , Craigslist is bigger and healthier than ever , and is on course to top $ 100 m ( £ 61 m ) in revenues this year for the first time .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It has been an extraordinary rise , and local newspapers reliant on classified ads are still reeling from the impact .
Craigslist itself , though , looks as homespun and dishevelled as any car boot sale , an unadorned page of links , run without fanfare by 28 employees out of a Victorian house in San Francisco .
So , $ 100 m .
The figure comes from a US consultancy called the Aim Group , which has been counting the ads on Craigslist and doing the sums since 2003 .
Most of the postings on the site are free but with the massive audience has come the chance to charge professional advertisers .
Recruiters in Silicon Valley pay $ 75 to list job vacancies ; recruiters in other major US cities pay $ 25 .
Six years ago , the website could have had revenues of barely $ 7 m , says Peter Zollman , the Aim Group founder .
The jump this year is projected to be 23 per cent .
" It just continues to grow , " he said .
" There is absolutely nothing fancy about it , nothing glitzy or glamorous , but it works ...
And the website has grown almost entirely by word - of - mouth and through free publicity , because they spend a minuscule amount on marketing . "
The Craig whose list it is is Craig Newmark , now aged 56 , balding and bespectacled and looking nothing like the dot.com squillionaire you might expect .
A New Jersey native , he relocated to Silicon Valley and was working in an IT security job at a stockbroking firm when he began emailing local listings news among a small circle in 1995 .
A year later , that email list became a website bulletin board where others could submit events , list items for sale , or see if there was anyone nearby who might want to have sex with them .
As word spread , users in other cities asked for their own pages and now the phenomenon spans the globe , covering 570 cities in 50 countries .
The reason that Mr Newmark does not look like a dot.com squillionaire is that he has no ambitions to live like one .
He is happy running Craigslist according to what he calls " nerd values " – taking enough out to maintain a decent living , paying more attention to creating a community .
That might not seem so charming to his rivals .
One of the profound consequences of Craigslist 's rise is that newspapers have seen a massive erosion in their sales of classified adverts .
Classified revenue plunged 29 per cent in 2008 at US newspapers , where Craigslist 's revenue growth was an estimated 47 per cent .
All this talk of revenue is a touch distasteful to the folks at Craigslist .
They have never confirmed any of the Aim Group 's figures .
It is not clear how much Mr Newmark and his chief executive , Jim Buckmaster , own between them , although we know that eBay owns 25 per cent because they are having a furious legal battle over that investment .
In 2004 , the auction site bought into Craigslist expecting Messrs Newmark and Buckmaster to capitalise on the goldmine they had created , yet five years on , only a fraction of listings are paid for and there are no ads on the site .

In the past year , politicians have seized on Craigslist as a place where prostitutes tout for business .
The issue was brought into stark relief when a medical student , Philip Markoff , was charged with killing a prostitute , Julissa Brisman , he contacted through the site .
Attorneys general have been pressuring the site to stamp out the ads .
It agreed last month to replace its " erotic services " category – which charged for ads but gave the revenue to charity – with a more closely monitored " adult services " category .
To say that Mr Buckmaster is aggrieved would be an understatement .
In the company 's latest blog post , he lists dozens of adult adverts that appear on other websites and railed against " the absolute disinterest shown by politicians and journalists in hardcore sex - for - money ads featured in journalistic media , no matter how numerous or graphic they may be " .
In other words , this stuff will always be with us ; Craigslist is just one of any number of meeting places for the dizzying array of human transactions .
Fulminating against Craigslist is like fulminating against the human condition .
Craigslist by numbers
50 million Users of Craigslist every month .
1.15 billion Classified ads that have been posted so far .

Obama said Iran 's leaders would be unable hide the " outrageous " behavior of clamping down violently on their people .
" We see it and we condemn it , " Obama said .
" The rights of the Iranian people to assemble , to speak freely , to have their voices heard , those are universal aspirations . "
He added that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's chief rival , former prime minister Mir Hossein Mousavi , had " captured the imagination " of Iranians who want to open up to the West .
The US president made the comments in a joint White House appearance Friday with the German chancellor after the two had held private talks .
Obama went on to hail the Iranian people : " Their bravery in the face of brutality is a testament to their enduring pursuit of justice . "
Will of the people
The Iranian leadership has mishandled the protests , the two leaders say
Merkel said on arrival in Washington that she was " shocked " to see how the Iranian government had been handling the peaceful protests .
" For our part , it is clear that we defend all peaceful demonstrations , that we want freedom of the press , and that it is necessary to respect the will of the people , " she said .
Millions of Iranians accuse the government of fraud in the June 12 election which gave Ahmadinejad an overwhelming landslide victory , prompting protest demonstrations in which at least 17 people have been killed .
On Friday , a hard - line Iranian cleric called for the execution of leading " rioters " who have protested against the result of the presidential election .
" I want the judiciary to ... punish leading rioters firmly and without showing any mercy to teach everyone a lesson , " Ahmad Khatami told worshippers at Tehran University .
Closer ties with Russia
Moscow 's ties with Tehran could help solve nuclear issue , Merkel says
Merkel and Obama also spoke of how they are working to strengthen ties with Russia , which could prove vital if there is to ever be a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear question .
Obama , who will be heading to Moscow on July 6 told reporters that the US and Germany will need to work " with the Russian government on issues where we agree , and honestly confronting those areas where we disagree . "
That includes working with the former Cold War enemy to reduce " our joint commitment to reducing our nuclear arsenal and strengthening the global nonproliferation regime . "
Merkel said that Germany was very interested in seeing a very good relationship between the US and Russia .
She highlighted the important role Moscow could play in the current crisis over Iran 's suspect nuclear program .
US climate catch - up
Renewable energy in Germany has impressed the US president
Obama also said Friday that European nations have moved faster than the United States on global warming and that he would like to see America play a greater leadership role in climate matters .
He said he hoped the United States would soon match Germany 's commitment to tackling climate change , adding that he was " impressed " with Berlin's " foresight and commitment to clean energy . "
" It is my hope that the United States will match that commitment today , " Obama said as the US House of Representatives prepared to vote later in the afternoon on a landmark climate bill .
This is Merkel 's first visit to the US since Obama took office , but it 's the third time the two leaders have met for face - to - face talks .
Earlier , Merkel promised the US president her support in his international endeavors .
She said that the US and Germany had a chance to set a new course in global politics during the Obama administration .
" I have observed , with great pleasure , how US President Barack Obama has opened doors in various areas , " said Merkel during a visit to the Library of Congress , citing the Middle East Peace Process , Afghanistan , climate change and the economic crisis as examples .
She emphasized that Obama could count on Germany and Europe for support .
" I want to stress that European citizens - and me personally as German Chancellor - have a fundamental interest in the success of policies like these ; policies that move us forward . "

I ’ll always regret that my last conversation with Michael Jackson ended with him angrily hanging up the phone -- at least I ’ve long thought of Michael ’s mood that day more than a decade ago as angry .
I realize now that a more accurate description would be “ wounded . ”
Michael was among the sweetest and most talented people I met during 35 years covering pop music for the Los Angeles Times .
I was fortunate to be present at many of his proudest moments .
I was in the audience the night in 1983 that he unveiled the electrifying Moonwalk on the Motown TV special and in the studio in 1985 for the all - star “ We Are the World ” recording session .
I was with him at the Jackson family home in Encino soon after he purchased the Beatles song catalog in 1985 .
Michael struck me as one of the most fragile and lonely people I ’ve ever met .
His heart may have finally stopped beating Thursday afternoon , but it had been broken long ago .
During weekends I spent with him on the road during the Jacksons ’ “ Victory ” tour in 1984 , I learned that he was so traumatized by events during his late teens -- notably the rejection by fans who missed the “ little ” Michael of the Jackson 5 days -- that he relied desperately on fame to protect him from further pain .
In the end , that overriding need for celebrity was at the root of his tragedy .
I first met Michael in the early days of the Jackson 5 at the family home in Los Angeles , and the memory that stands out is that Michael , as cute and wide - eyed as an 11 - year - old could be , was eager to get through the interview so he could watch cartoons before having to go to bed .
When I caught up with him a decade later , his personality had changed radically .
That happy - go - lucky kid was nowhere to be found .
Michael ’s sales had fallen off dramatically in the mid-1970s , and by the time he reemerged with the hit “ Off the Wall ” album in 1979 , he was scarred emotionally .
There ’s often a gap between a performer ’s public and private sides , but rarely was it as noticeable as with Michael .
Sitting at the rear of the tour bus after a triumphant concert in St. Louis in 1981 , Michael was anxious , frequently bowing his head as he whispered answers to my questions .
In contrast to the charismatic , strutting figure on stage , he wrestled with a Bambi - like shyness .
Despite the resurgence in his popularity , he complained of feeling alone -- almost abandoned .
He was 23 .
When I asked why he did n’t live on his own like his brothers , rather than at his parents ’ house , he said , “ Oh , no , I think I ’d die on my own .
I ’d be so lonely .
Even at home , I ’m lonely .
I sit in my room and sometimes cry .
It is so hard to make friends , and there are some things you ca n’t talk to your parents or family about .
I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night , just hoping to find someone to talk to .
But I just end up coming home . ”
That ’s as far as Michael could go that night to explain his deep - rooted anguish .
It would be four more years before he was willing to tell me more .
Michael had signed a book deal with Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis , an editor at Doubleday , before the “ Victory ” tour , and he wanted me to help him write it .
I spent several weekends on the road with him during the tour .
I soon discovered that Michael -- who guarded his privacy at all costs -- wanted to put together a picture book , while Onassis wanted a full - scale biography .
After a showdown between the two , Michael ’s longtime attorney and friend John Branca called to thank me for my efforts and said Doubleday was going in a different direction .
My involvement ended .
During our time together , my conversations with Michael sometimes led -- once the tape recorder was off -- to darker moments from his past .
One night when we were going through a stack of old photos , a picture of him in his late teens triggered a sudden openness .
“ Ohh , that ’s horrible , ” he said , recoiling from the picture .
Michael explained that his face was so covered with acne and his nose so large at that time that visitors to the family home in Encino sometimes would n’t recognize him .
“ They would come up , look me straight in the eye and ask if I knew where that ‘ cute little Michael ’ was . ”
It was as if the “ whole world was saying , ‘ How dare you grow up on us . ’ ”
Michael said he started looking down at the floor when people approached or would stay in his room when visitors came to the house .
Michael vowed to do whatever it took to make people “ love me again . ”
The rejection fueled his ambition to be the biggest pop star in the world and to try to make his face beautiful .
Unfortunately , Michael ’s need was so great that no amount of love seemed to be enough .
The stage was his sanctuary .
There , he was larger than life and no one could threaten him .
Every time he left the stage , he said , he felt vulnerable again .
In the 1981 interview , he told me , “ My real goal is to fulfill God ’s purpose .
I did n’t choose to sing or dance .
But that ’s my role , and I want to do it better than anybody else .
I still remember the first time I sang in kindergarten class .
I sang ‘ Climb Every Mountain , ’ and everyone got so excited .
“ It ’s beautiful at the shows when people join together .
It ’s our own little world .
For that hour and a half , we try to show there is hope and goodness .
It ’s only when you step back outside the building that you see all the craziness . ”
Michael ’s hunger for fame and success struck me as increasingly obsessive and unhealthy .
Even though 1982 ’s “ Thriller ” was the biggest - selling album of all time , Michael told me one night that his next album would sell twice as many copies .
I thought he was joking , but he had never been more serious .
As years went by , I watched with sadness as his music went from the wonderful self - affirmation and endearing spirit of “ Thriller ” to something increasingly calculated and soulless .
His impact in the marketplace waned accordingly .
It appeared that his desperate need for ultra stardom -- the “ King of Pop ” proclamation -- and his escalating eccentricities made it difficult for audiences to identify with him .
Even some of his “ Thriller ” fans were ultimately turned off .
In the public mind , he went from the “ King of Pop ” to the “ King of Hype . ”
When I surveyed leading record industry executives in 1995 to determine pop ’s hottest properties , Michael was n’t in the top 20 .
One executive said flatly : “ The thing he does n’t understand is that he’d be better off in the long run if he made a great record that only went to No. 20 than if he hyped another mediocre record to No. 1 . The thing he needs is credibility . ”
Another executive said simply that Michael was “ over . ”
Michael was furious when he called me the day after the story ran in The Times .
How could I betray him by writing such lies ?
Could n’t I see the record executives were just jealous ?
I tried gently to tell him that I thought there was some truth in what the executives were saying and that he had lost touch with the qualities that once made him so endearing .
“ That hurts me , Robert , ” he said , his voice quivering .
I felt bad .
I started to say that he could be as big as ever if he would only . . . , but I could n’t complete the sentence .
Michael hung up .
After that , I followed his life from a distance -- the child molestation charges , the battle with painkillers , the marriage to Lisa Marie Presley , the increasingly bizarre lifestyle .
Although he would periodically announce recording projects or touring plans , I could n’t imagine , after all the humiliation and disappointment , that Michael could find the strength to step in front of the public again .
I thought the fear of failure was too great .
It was easier to stay in a fantasy land .
So I was surprised when he announced that he was returning to the stage in a few weeks and was even more surprised when he sold out 50 nights at the O2 Arena in London .
Maybe Michael was stronger than I thought .
It took enormous courage to be willing to go back on stage for what could be a make - or - break moment -- and the ticket demand must have given him hope .
Despite all that had happened , he saw that he was still loved by millions of fans .
In the best scenario , Michael , 50 , would have triumphed in London , not only erasing his mountain of debt but also restoring to himself the sense of invincibility that fame represented .
Failure in those shows , however , could have left him even more wounded and vulnerable .
As the July dates neared , I imagined Michael ’s anxiety mounting day by day , even hour by hour .
There must have been days when he felt he could do it , could reclaim his crown with a series of breathtaking performances and stand forever alongside Elvis Presley and the Beatles in pop music lore .
But what if he was wrong ?
What if he was n’t strong enough , physically and emotionally ?
What if he could n’t live up to expectations ?
What if no amount of adulation could make him feel safe again ?
The stress must have been immense -- and maybe in the end it was too much for his broken heart .

Time to tone down Hate Talk Radio ?
Presciently , the report said the top perceived threat was a " lone wolf " : " White supremacist lone wolves pose the most significant domestic terrorist threat because of their low profile and autonomy -- separate from any formalized group -- which hampers warning efforts . "
DHS , meet James von Brunn , whose wife divorced him because of his hatred , racism , paranoia and violence .
But the right - wing echo chamber went nuts about the report .
Rush called it " crap , " thundering , " There is not one instance they can cite as evidence where any of these right - wing groups have done anything . "
Rep. Michele Bachmann crowed : " To me , it looks like the extremists are those running the DHS . "
John Boehner called it " offensive " and said , " Unfortunately , Secretary Napolitano still has a lot of explaining to do . "
Newt Gingrich harrumphed that " the person who drafted the outrageous homeland security memo smearing veterans and conservatives should be fired . "
And Rep. Peter Burgess said Napolitano herself should " step down , and let 's move on . "
Will any of them apologize to Napolitano now ?
Dream on .
On a Web site he apparently maintains extolling a " Holy Western Empire , " von Brunn says he served in the U.S. Navy during World War II , worked for 20 years as an advertising executive and film producer in New York and then became " an artist and author " living on Maryland 's Eastern Shore .
Police sources said the suspect had a notebook listing other locations that law enforcement officials presumed were possible targets .
In 1981 von Brunn attempted to place the treasonous Federal Reserve Board of Governors under legal , non-violent , citizens arrest .
He was tried in a Washington , D.C. Superior Court ; convicted by a Negro jury , Jew / Negro attorneys , and sentenced to prison for eleven years by a Jew judge .
A Jew / Negro / White Court of Appeals denied his appeal .
He served 6.5 years in federal prison .
He is now an artist and author and lives on Maryland 's Eastern Shore . "
Earlier today Hebiclens , the artist who persuades all the Republicans to put on clown make - up so he can photograph them forsent me the two above , along with a question : " How many more innocent people have to die because of the hate that these Right - wing Pundits spew out into the public airwaves ? "
Good question .
Another one is why is Obama being so weak on domestic right wing terrorism ?
When Janet Napolitano , Secretary of Homeland Security , warned about this kind of thing , the extreme right wing noise machine crucified her .
I have n't heard Limbaugh or O'Reilly or Hannity or Coulter apologize .
I have n't heard the right - wing zealots like Virginia Foxx or Michele Bachmann or Patrick McHenry or Pete Sessions go to the press and withdraw their vicious innuendoes about her and praise her foresight .

Walsh made much the same point at Salon : I 'm sure you know by now that yesterday a far right white supremacist , James W. Von Brunn , walked into the Holocaust Museum in the middle of Washington DC , with a fucking rifle -- special thanks to John Ensign and most of the U.S. Senate for that -- and shot two people
One of the most respected bloggers writing today , Dave Neiwert , just released a new book , The Eliminationists : How Hate Talk Radicalized the American Right , dealing exactly with this kind of crap .
Dave writes at Crooks and Liars and this morning he asked the question about motivation .
Dave points out the perp was a " sovereign citizen , " something right wing terrorists and lunatic fringe addicts of Hate Talk Radio call themselves -- just like the murderer of Dr. George Tiller .
Speaking of Tiller 's killer , I wonder why they have n't waterboarded him since he seems to claim he has information he wo n't give up about more planned right - wing terrorism -- the imminent kind .
And I have n't heard a peep out of the Cheney family on this .
As Dave pointed out , Von Brunn has been in trouble with the law before .
Here 's a description von Brunn wrote of one of his own cases : Another empty Hate Talk personality , homophobic bigot , Carrie Prejean , was fired as Miss California by Donald Trump today .
The pageant gave her the boot for violating her contract -- not getting clearance to do extracurricular stuff -- no not the soft core porn again ; this time she was breaching her contract by anchoring one of Fox News ' hate talk shows .
I guess she could move to Lake Hayden and become Miss Idaho .

Haskell 's combination of purity , higher order functions , parameterized algebraic data types , and typeclasses allows us to implement polymorphism on a much higher level than possible in other languages .
We do n't have to think about types belonging to a big hierarchy of types .
Instead , we think about what the types can act like and then connect them with the appropriate typeclasses .
An Int can act like a lot of things .
It can act like an equatable thing , like an ordered thing , like an enumerable thing , etc .
Typeclasses are open , which means that we can define our own data type , think about what it can act like and connect it with the typeclasses that define its behaviors .
Because of that and because of Haskell 's great type system that allows us to know a lot about a function just by knowing its type declaration , we can define typeclasses that define behavior that 's very general and abstract .
We 've met typeclasses that define operations for seeing if two things are equal or comparing two things by some ordering .
Those are very abstract and elegant behaviors , but we just do n't think of them as anything very special because we 've been dealing with them for most of our lives .
We recently met functors , which are basically things that can be mapped over .
That 's an example of a useful and yet still pretty abstract property that typeclasses can describe .
In this chapter , we 'll take a closer look at functors , along with slightly stronger and more useful versions of functors called applicative functors .
We 'll also take a look at monoids , which are sort of like socks .
Functors redux
We 've already talked about functors in their own little section .
If you have n't read it yet , you should probably give it a glance right now , or maybe later when you have more time .
Or you can just pretend you read it .
Still , here 's a quick refresher : Functors are things that can be mapped over , like lists , Maybes , trees , and such .
In Haskell , they 're described by the typeclass Functor , which has only one typeclass method , namely fmap , which has a type of fmap :: ( a -> b ) -> f a -> f b .
It says : give me a function that takes an a and returns a b and a box with an a ( or several of them ) inside it and I 'll give you a box with a b ( or several of them ) inside it .
It kind of applies the function to the element inside the box .
A word of advice .
Many times the box analogy is used to help you get some intuition for how functors work , and later , we 'll probably use the same analogy for applicative functors and monads .
It 's an okay analogy that helps people understand functors at first , just do n't take it too literally , because for some functors the box analogy has to be stretched really thin to still hold some truth .
A more correct term for what a functor is would be computational context .
The context might be that the computation can have a value or it might have failed ( Maybe and Either a ) or that there might be more values ( lists ) , stuff like that .
If we want to make a type constructor an instance of Functor , it has to have a kind of * -> * , which means that it has to take exactly one concrete type as a type parameter .
For example , Maybe can be made an instance because it takes one type parameter to produce a concrete type , like Maybe Int or Maybe String .
If a type constructor takes two parameters , like Either , we have to partially apply the type constructor until it only takes one type parameter .
So we can't write instance Functor Either where , but we can write instance Functor ( Either a ) where and then if we imagine that fmap is only for Either a , it would have a type declaration of fmap :: ( b -> c ) ->
Either a b ->
Either a c .
As you can see , the Either a part is fixed , because Either a takes only one type parameter , whereas just Either takes two so fmap :: ( b -> c ) ->
Either b ->
Either c would n't really make sense .
We 've learned by now how a lot of types ( well , type constructors really ) are instances of Functor , like [ ] , Maybe , Either a and a Tree type that we made on our own .
We saw how we can map functions over them for great good .
In this section , we 'll take a look at two more instances of functor , namely IO and ( -> ) r.
If some value has a type of , say , IO String , that means that it's an I/ O action that , when performed , will go out into the real world and get some string for us , which it will yield as a result .
We can use <- in do syntax to bind that result to a name .
We mentioned that I/ O actions are like boxes with little feet that go out and fetch some value from the outside world for us .
We can inspect what they fetched , but after inspecting , we have to wrap the value back in IO .
By thinking about this box with little feet analogy , we can see how IO acts like a functor .
Let 's see how IO is an instance of Functor .
When we fmap a function over an I/ O action , we want to get back an I/ O action that does the same thing , but has our function applied over its result value .
instance Functor IO where fmap f action = do result <- action return ( f result )
The result of mapping something over an I/ O action will be an I / O action , so right off the bat we use do syntax to glue two actions and make a new one .
In the implementation for fmap , we make a new I /O action that first performs the original I/O action and calls its result result .
Then , we do return ( f result ) .
return is , as you know , a function that makes an I/ O action that does n't do anything but only presents something as its result .
The action that a do block produces will always have the result value of its last action .
That 's why we use return to make an I / O action that does n't really do anything , it just presents f result as the result of the new I /O action .
We can play around with it to gain some intuition .
It 's pretty simple really .
Check out this piece of code :
main = do line <- getLine let line ' = reverse line putStrLn $ " You said " ++ line ' ++ " backwards ! " putStrLn $ " Yes , you really said " ++ line ' ++ " backwards ! "
The user is prompted for a line and we give it back to the user , only reversed .
Here 's how to rewrite this by using fmap :
main = do line <- fmap reverse getLine putStrLn $ " You said " ++ line ++ " backwards ! " putStrLn $ " Yes , you really said " ++ line ++ " backwards ! "
Just like when we fmap reverse over Just " blah " to get Just " halb " , we can fmap reverse over getLine .
getLine is an I/ O action that has a type of IO String and mapping reverse over it gives us an I / O action that will go out into the real world and get a line and then apply reverse to its result .
Like we can apply a function to something that 's inside a Maybe box , we can apply a function to what 's inside an IO box , only it has to go out into the real world to get something .
Then when we bind it to a name by using <- , the name will reflect the result that already has reverse applied to it .
The I /O action fmap ( ++ " ! " )
getLine behaves just like getLine , only that its result always has " ! " appended to it !
If we look at what fmap 's type would be if it were limited to IO , it would be fmap :: ( a -> b ) -> IO a -> IO b. fmap takes a function and an I/O action and returns a new I / O action that 's like the old one , except that the function is applied to its contained result .
If you ever find yourself binding the result of an I/ O action to a name , only to apply a function to that and call that something else , consider using fmap , because it looks prettier .
If you want to apply multiple transformations to some data inside a functor , you can declare your own function at the top level , make a lambda function or ideally , use function composition :
import Data .
Char import Data .
List main = do line <- fmap ( intersperse '-' . reverse . map toUpper ) getLine putStrLn line
$ runhaskell fmapping_io.hs hello there E- R- E - H-T- -O-L-L-E-
H
As you probably know , intersperse ' -' . reverse .
map toUpper is a function that takes a string , maps toUpper over it , the applies reverse to that result and then applies intersperse ' -' to that result .
It 's like writing ( \xs -> intersperse ' -' ( reverse ( map toUpper xs ) ) ) , only prettier .
Another instance of Functor that we 've been dealing with all along but did n't know was a Functor is ( -> ) r.
You 're probably slightly confused now , since what the heck does ( -> ) r mean ?
The function type r -> a can be rewritten as ( -> ) r a , much like we can write 2 + 3 as (+ ) 2 3 . When we look at it as ( -> ) r a , we can see ( -> ) in a slighty different light , because we see that it 's just a type constructor that takes two type parameters , just like Either .
But remember , we said that a type constructor has to take exactly one type parameter so that it can be made an instance of Functor .
That 's why we can't make ( -> ) an instance of Functor , but if we partially apply it to ( -> ) r , it does n't pose any problems .
If the syntax allowed for type constructors to be partially applied with sections ( like we can partially apply + by doing ( 2+ ) , which is the same as (+ ) 2 ) , you could write ( -> ) r as ( r -> ) .
How are functions functors ?
Well , let 's take a look at the implementation , which lies in Control .
Monad .
Instances
We usually mark functions that take anything and return anything as a -> b . r -> a is the same thing , we just used different letters for the type variables .
instance Functor ( (-> ) r ) where fmap f g = ( \x -> f ( g x ) )
If the syntax allowed for it , it could have been written as
instance Functor ( r ->) where fmap f g = ( \x -> f ( g x ) )
But it does n't , so we have to write it in the former fashion .
First of all , let 's think about fmap 's type .
It 's fmap :: ( a -> b ) -> f a -> f b.
Now what we 'll do is mentally replace all the f's , which are the role that our functor instance plays , with ( -> ) r's .
We 'll do that to see how fmap should behave for this particular instance .
We get fmap :: ( a -> b ) -> ((->) r a ) -> ((->) r b ) .
Now what we can do is write the ( -> ) r a and ( -> r b ) types as infix r -> a and r -> b , like we normally do with functions .
What we get now is fmap :: ( a -> b ) -> ( r -> a ) -> ( r -> b ) .
Hmmm OK .
Mapping one function over a function has to produce a function , just like mapping a function over a Maybe has to produce a Maybe and mapping a function over a list has to produce a list .
What does the type fmap :: ( a -> b ) -> ( r -> a ) -> ( r -> b ) for this instance tell us ?
Well , we see that it takes a function from a to b and a function from r to a and returns a function from r to b .
Does this remind you of anything ?
Yes !
Function composition !
We pipe the output of r -> a into the input of a -> b to get a function r -> b , which is exactly what function composition is about .
If you look at how the instance is defined above , you 'll see that it 's just function composition .
Another way to write this instance would be :
instance Functor ( (->) r ) where fmap = (. )
This makes the revelation that using fmap over functions is just composition sort of obvious .
Do :m + Control .
Monad .
Instances , since that 's where the instance is defined and then try playing with mapping over functions .
ghci > :t fmap ( * 3 ) ( +100 ) fmap ( * 3 ) ( +100 ) :: ( Num a ) => a -> a ghci > fmap ( * 3 ) ( +100 ) 1 303 ghci > ( * 3 ) `fmap` ( +100 ) $ 1 303 ghci > ( * 3 ) . ( +100 ) $ 1 303 ghci > fmap ( show . ( * 3 ) ) ( * 100 ) 1 " 300 "
We can call fmap as an infix function so that the resemblance to .
is clear .
In the second input line , we 're mapping ( * 3 ) over ( +100 ) , which results in a function that will take an input , call ( +100 ) on that and then call ( * 3 ) on that result .
We call that function with 1 .
How does the box analogy hold here ?
Well , if you stretch it , it holds .
When we use fmap ( +3 ) over Just 3 , it 's easy to imagine the Maybe as a box that has some contents on which we apply the function ( +3 ) .
But what about when we 're doing fmap ( * 3 ) ( +100 ) ?
Well , you can think of the function ( +100 ) as a box that contains its eventual result .
Sort of like how an I / O action can be thought of as a box that will go out into the real world and fetch some result .
Using fmap ( * 3 ) on ( +100 ) will create another function that acts like ( +100 ) , only before producing a result , ( * 3 ) will be applied to that result .
Now we can see how fmap acts just like . for functions .
The fact that fmap is function composition when used on functions is n't so terribly useful right now , but at least it 's very interesting .
It also bends our minds a bit and let us see how things that act more like computations than boxes ( IO and ( -> ) r ) can be functors .
The function being mapped over a computation results in the same computation but the result of that computation is modified with the function .
Before we go on to the rules that fmap should follow , let 's think about the type of fmap once more .
Its type is fmap :: ( a -> b ) -> f a -> f b .
We 're missing the class constraint ( Functor f ) => , but we left it out here for brevity , because we 're talking about functors anyway so we know what the f stands for .
When we first learned about curried functions , we said that all Haskell functions actually take one parameter .
A function a -> b -> c actually takes just one parameter of type a and then returns a function b -> c , which takes one parameter and returns a c .
That 's how if we call a function with too few parameters ( i.e. partially apply it ) , we get back a function that takes the number of parameters that we left out ( if we 're thinking about functions as taking several parameters again ) .
So a -> b -> c can be written as a -> ( b -> c ) , to make the currying more apparent .
In the same vein , if we write fmap :: ( a -> b ) -> ( f a -> f b ) , we can think of fmap not as a function that takes one function and a functor and returns a functor , but as a function that takes a function and returns a new function that 's just like the old one , only it takes a functor as a parameter and returns a functor as the result .
It takes an a -> b function and returns a function f a -> f b .
This is called lifting a function .
Let 's play around with that idea by using GHCI 's :t command :
ghci > :t fmap ( * 2 ) fmap ( * 2 ) :: ( Num a , Functor f ) => f a -> f a ghci > :t fmap ( replicate 3 ) fmap ( replicate 3 ) :: ( Functor f ) => f a -> f [ a ]
The expression fmap ( * 2 ) is a function that takes a functor f over numbers and returns a functor over numbers .
That functor can be a list , a Maybe , an Either String , whatever .
The expression fmap ( replicate 3 ) will take a functor over any type and return a functor over a list of elements of that type .
When we say a functor over numbers , you can think of that as a functor that has numbers in it .
The former is a bit fancier and more technically correct , but the latter is usually easier to get .
This is even more apparent if we partially apply , say , fmap ( ++ " ! " ) and then bind it to a name in GHCI .
You can think of fmap as either a function that takes a function and a functor and then maps that function over the functor , or you can think of it as a function that takes a function and lifts that function so that it operates on functors .
Both views are correct and in Haskell , equivalent .
The type fmap ( replicate 3 ) :: ( Functor f ) => f a -> f [ a ] means that the function will work on any functor .
What exactly it will do depends on which functor we use it on .
If we use fmap ( replicate 3 ) on a list , the list 's implementation for fmap will be chosen , which is just map .
If we use it on a Maybe a , it 'll apply replicate 3 to the value inside the Just , or if it 's Nothing , then it stays Nothing .
ghci > fmap ( replicate 3 ) [ 1,2,3,4 ] [ [ 1,1,1 ] , [ 2,2,2 ] , [ 3,3,3 ] , [ 4,4,4 ] ] ghci > fmap ( replicate 3 ) ( Just 4 ) Just [ 4,4,4 ] ghci > fmap ( replicate 3 ) ( Right " blah " ) Right [ " blah " , " blah " , " blah " ] ghci > fmap ( replicate 3 ) Nothing Nothing ghci > fmap ( replicate 3 ) ( Left " foo " ) Left " foo "
Next up , we 're going to look at the functor laws .
In order for something to be a functor , it should satisfy some laws .
All functors are expected to exhibit certain kinds of functor - like properties and behaviors .
They should reliably behave as things that can be mapped over .
Calling fmap on a functor should just map a function over the functor , nothing more .
This behavior is described in the functor laws .
There are two of them that all instances of Functor should abide by .
They are n't enforced by Haskell automatically , so you have to test them out yourself .
The first functor law states that if we map the id function over a functor , the functor that we get back should be the same as the original functor .
If we write that a bit more formally , it means that fmap id = id .
So essentially , this says that if we do fmap id over a functor , it should be the same as just calling id on the functor .
Remember , id is the identity function , which just returns its parameter unmodified .
It can also be written as \x -> x .
If we view the functor as something that can be mapped over , the fmap id = id law seems kind of trivial or obvious .
Let 's see if this law holds for a few values of functors .
ghci > fmap id ( Just 3 ) Just 3 ghci > id ( Just 3 ) Just 3 ghci > fmap id [ 1..5 ] [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] ghci > id [ 1..5 ] [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] ghci > fmap id [ ] [ ] ghci > fmap id Nothing Nothing
If we look at the implementation of fmap for , say , Maybe , we can figure out why the first functor law holds .
instance Functor Maybe where fmap f ( Just x ) = Just ( f x ) fmap f Nothing = Nothing
We imagine that id plays the role of the f parameter in the implementation .
We see that if wee fmap id over Just x , the result will be Just ( id x ) , and because id just returns its parameter , we can deduce that Just ( id x ) equals Just x .
So now we know that if we map id over a Maybe value with a Just value constructor , we get that same value back .
Seeing that mapping id over a Nothing value returns the same value is trivial .
So from these two equations in the implementation for fmap , we see that the law fmap id = id holds .
The second law says that composing two functions and then mapping the resulting function over a functor should be the same as first mapping one function over the functor and then mapping the other one .
Formally written , that means that fmap ( f . g ) = fmap f . fmap g .
Or to write it in another way , for any functor F , the following should hold : fmap ( f . g ) F = fmap f ( fmap g F ) .
If we can show that some type obeys both functor laws , we can rely on it having the same fundamental behaviors as other functors when it comes to mapping .
We can know that when we use fmap on it , there wo n't be anything other than mapping going on behind the scenes and that it will act like a thing that can be mapped over , i.e. a functor .
You figure out how the second law holds for some type by looking at the implementation of fmap for that type and then using the method that we used to check if Maybe obeys the first law .
If you want , we can check out how the second functor law holds for Maybe .
If we do fmap ( f . g ) over Nothing , we get Nothing , because doing a fmap with any function over Nothing returns Nothing .
If we do fmap f ( fmap g Nothing ) , we get Nothing , for the same reason .
OK , seeing how the second law holds for Maybe if it 's a Nothing value is pretty easy , almost trivial .
How about if it 's a Just something value ?
Well , if we do fmap ( f . g ) ( Just x ) , we see from the implementation that it 's implemented as Just ( ( f . g ) x ) , which is , of course , Just ( f ( g x ) ) .
If we do fmap f ( fmap g ( Just x ) ) , we see from the implementation that fmap g ( Just x ) is Just ( g x ) .
Ergo , fmap f ( fmap g ( Just x ) ) equals fmap f ( Just ( g x ) ) and from the implementation we see that this equals Just ( f ( g x ) ) .
If you 're a bit confused by this proof , do n't worry .
Be sure that you understand how function composition works .
Many times , you can intuitively see how these laws hold because the types act like containers or functions .
You can also just try them on a bunch of different values of a type and be able to say with some certainty that a type does indeed obey the laws .
Let 's take a look at a pathological example of a type constructor being an instance of the Functor typeclass but not really being a functor , because it does n't satisfy the laws .
Let 's say that we have a type :
data CMaybe a = CNothing | CJust
Int a deriving ( Show )
The C here stands for counter .
It 's a data type that looks much like Maybe a , only the Just part holds two fields instead of one .
The first field in the CJust value constructor will always have a type of Int , and it will be some sort of counter and the second field is of type a , which comes from the type parameter and its type will , of course , depend on the concrete type that we choose for CMaybe a .
Let 's play with our new type to get some intuition for it .
ghci > CNothing CNothing ghci > CJust 0 " haha " CJust 0 " haha " ghci > :t CNothing CNothing :: CMaybe a ghci > :t CJust 0 " haha " CJust 0 " haha " :: CMaybe [ Char ] ghci > CJust 100 [ 1,2,3 ] CJust 100 [ 1,2,3 ]
If we use the CNothing constructor , there are no fields , and if we use the CJust constructor , the first field is an integer and the second field can be any type .
Let 's make this an instance of Functor so that everytime we use fmap , the function gets applied to the second field , whereas the first field gets increased by 1 .
instance Functor CMaybe where fmap f CNothing = CNothing fmap f ( CJust counter x ) = CJust ( counter + 1 ) ( f x )
This is kind of like the instance implementation for Maybe , except that when we do fmap over a value that does n't represent an empty box ( a CJust value ) , we do n't just apply the function to the contents , we also increase the counter by 1 .
Everything seems cool so far , we can even play with this a bit :
ghci > fmap ( ++ " ha " ) ( CJust 0 " ho " ) CJust 1 " hoha " ghci > fmap ( ++ " he " ) ( fmap ( ++ " ha " ) ( CJust 0 " ho " ) ) CJust 2 " hohahe " ghci > fmap ( ++ " blah " ) CNothing CNothing
Does this obey the functor laws ?
In order to see that something does n't obey a law , it 's enough to find just one counter - example .
ghci > fmap id ( CJust 0 " haha " ) CJust 1 " haha " ghci > id ( CJust 0 " haha " ) CJust 0 " haha "
Ah !
We know that the first functor law states that if we map id over a functor , it should be the same as just calling id with the same functor , but as we 've seen from this example , this is not true for our CMaybe functor .
Even though it 's part of the Functor typeclass , it does n't obey the functor laws and is therefore not a functor .
If someone used our CMaybe type as a functor , they would expect it to obey the functor laws like a good functor .
But CMaybe fails at being a functor even though it pretends to be one , so using it as a functor might lead to some faulty code .
When we use a functor , it should n't matter if we first compose a few functions and then map them over the functor or if we just map each function over a functor in succession .
But with CMaybe , it matters , because it keeps track of how many times it 's been mapped over .
Not cool !
If we wanted CMaybe to obey the functor laws , we'd have to make it so that the Int field stays the same when we use fmap .
At first , the functor laws might seem a bit confusing and unnecessary , but then we see that if we know that a type obeys both laws , we can make certain assumptions about how it will act .
If a type obeys the functor laws , we know that calling fmap on a value of that type will only map the function over it , nothing more .
This leads to code that is more abstract and extensible , because we can use laws to reason about behaviors that any functor should have and make functions that operate reliably on any functor .
All the Functor instances in the standard library obey these laws , but you can check for yourself if you do n't believe me .
And the next time you make a type an instance of Functor , take a minute to make sure that it obeys the functor laws .
Once you 've dealt with enough functors , you kind of intuitively see the properties and behaviors that they have in common and it's not hard to intuitively see if a type obeys the functor laws .
But even without the intuition , you can always just go over the implementation line by line and see if the laws hold or try to find a counter - example .
We can also look at functors as things that output values in a context .
For instance , Just 3 outputs the value 3 in the context that it might or not output any values at all .
[ 1,2,3 ] outputs three values — 1 , 2 , and 3 , the context is that there may be multiple values or no values .
The function ( +3 ) will output a value , depending on which parameter it is given .
If you think of functors as things that output values , you can think of mapping over functors as attaching a transformation to the output of the functor that changes the value .
When we do fmap ( +3 ) [ 1,2,3 ] , we attach the transformation ( +3 ) to the output of [ 1,2,3 ] , so whenever we look at a number that the list outputs , ( +3 ) will be applied to it .
Another example is mapping over functions .
When we do fmap ( +3 ) ( * 3 ) , we attach the transformation ( +3 ) to the eventual output of ( * 3 ) .
Looking at it this way gives us some intuition as to why using fmap on functions is just composition ( fmap ( +3 ) ( * 3 ) equals ( +3 ) . ( * 3 ) , which equals \x -> ( ( x * 3 ) +3 ) ) , because we take a function like ( * 3 ) then we attach the transformation ( +3 ) to its output .
The result is still a function , only when we give it a number , it will be multiplied by three and then it will go through the attached transformation where it will be added to three .
This is what happens with composition .
Applicative functors
In this section , we 'll take a look at applicative functors , which are beefed up functors , represented in Haskell by the Applicative typeclass , found in the Control .
Applicative module .
As you know , functions in Haskell are curried by default , which means that a function that seems to take several parameters actually takes just one parameter and returns a function that takes the next parameter and so on .
If a function is of type a -> b -> c , we usually say that it takes two parameters and returns a c , but actually it takes an a and returns a function b -> c .
That 's why we can call a function as f x y or as ( f x ) y .
This mechanism is what enables us to partially apply functions by just calling them with too few parameters , which results in functions that we can then pass on to other functions .
So far , when we were mapping functions over functors , we usually mapped functions that take only one parameter .
But what happens when we map a function like * , which takes two parameters , over a functor ?
Let 's take a look at a couple of concrete examples of this .
If we have Just 3 and we do fmap ( *) ( Just 3 ) , what do we get ?
From the instance implementation of Maybe for Functor , we know that if it 's a Just something value , it will apply the function to the something inside the Just .
Therefore , doing fmap ( *) ( Just 3 ) results in Just ( (* ) 3 ) , which can also be written as Just (* 3 ) if we use sections .
Interesting !
We get a function wrapped in a Just !
ghci > :t fmap (++) ( Just " hey " ) fmap (++) ( Just " hey " ) :: Maybe ( [ Char ] -> [ Char ] ) ghci > :t fmap compare ( Just ' a ' ) fmap compare ( Just ' a ' ) :: Maybe ( Char -> Ordering ) ghci > :t fmap compare " A LIST OF CHARS " fmap compare " A LIST OF CHARS " :: [ Char -> Ordering ] ghci > :t fmap ( \x y z -> x + y / z ) [ 3,4,5,6 ] fmap ( \x y z -> x + y / z ) [ 3,4,5,6 ] :: ( Fractional a ) => [ a -> a -> a ]
If we map compare , which has a type of ( Ord a ) => a -> a ->
Ordering over a list of characters , we get a list of functions of type Char ->
Ordering , because the function compare gets partially applied with the characters in the list .
It 's not a list of ( Ord a ) => a ->
Ordering function , because the first a that got applied was a Char and so the second a has to decide to be of type Char .
We see how by mapping " multi- parameter " functions over functors , we get functors that contain functions inside them .
So now what can we do with them ?
Well for one , we can map functions that take these functions as parameters over them , because whatever is inside a functor will be given to the function that we 're mapping over it as a parameter .
ghci > let a = fmap ( *) [ 1,2,3,4 ] ghci > :t a a :: [ Integer -> Integer ] ghci > fmap ( \f -> f 9 ) a [ 9,18,27,36 ]
But what if we have a functor value of Just ( 3 *) and a functor value of Just 5 and we want to take out the function from Just ( 3 *) and map it over Just 5 ?
With normal functors , we 're out of luck , because all they support is just mapping normal functions over existing functors .
Even when we mapped \f -> f 9 over a functor that contained functions inside it , we were just mapping a normal function over it .
But we can't map a function that 's inside a functor over another functor with what fmap offers us .
We could pattern - match against the Just constructor to get the function out of it and then map it over Just 5 , but we 're looking for a more general and abstract way of doing that , which works across functors .
Meet the Applicative typeclass .
It lies in the Control .
Applicative module and it defines two methods , pure and <*>.
It does n't provide a default implementation for any of them , so we have to define them both if we want something to be an applicative functor .
The class is defined like so :
class ( Functor f ) =>
Applicative f where pure :: a -> f a ( <*> ) :: f ( a -> b ) -> f a -> f b
This simple three line class definition tells us a lot !
Let 's start at the first line .
It starts the definition of the Applicative class and it also introduces a class constraint .
It says that if we want to make a type constructor part of the Applicative typeclass , it has to be in Functor first .
That 's why if we know that if a type constructor is part of the Applicative typeclass , it 's also in Functor , so we can use fmap on it .
The first method it defines is called pure .
Its type declaration is pure :: a -> f a. f plays the role of our applicative functor instance here .
Because Haskell has a very good type system and because everything a function can do is take some parameters and return some value , we can tell a lot from a type declaration and this is no exception .
pure should take a value of any type and return an applicative functor with that value inside it .
When we say inside it , we 're using the box analogy again , even though we 've seen that it does n't always stand up to scrutiny .
But the a -> f a type declaration is still pretty descriptive .
We take a value and we wrap it in an applicative functor that has that value as the result inside it .
A better way of thinking about pure would be to say that it takes a value and puts it in some sort of default ( or pure ) context — a minimal context that still yields that value .
The <*> function is really interesting .
It has a type declaration of f ( a -> b ) -> f a -> f b.
Does this remind you of anything ?
Of course , fmap :: ( a -> b ) -> f a -> f b .
It 's a sort of a beefed up fmap .
Whereas fmap takes a function and a functor and applies the function inside the functor , <*> takes a functor that has a function in it and another functor and sort of extracts that function from the first functor and then maps it over the second one .
When I say extract , I actually sort of mean run and then extract , maybe even sequence .
We 'll see why soon .
Let 's take a look at the Applicative instance implementation for Maybe .
instance Applicative Maybe where pure = Just Nothing <*> _ = Nothing ( Just f ) <*> something = fmap f something
Again , from the class definition we see that the f that plays the role of the applicative functor should take one concrete type as a parameter , so we write instance Applicative Maybe where instead of writing instance Applicative ( Maybe a ) where .
First off , pure .
We said earlier that it 's supposed to take something and wrap it in an applicative functor .
We wrote pure = Just , because value constructors like Just are normal functions .
We could have also written pure x = Just x .
Next up , we have the definition for <*>.
We can't extract a function out of a Nothing , because it has no function inside it .
So we say that if we try to extract a function from a Nothing , the result is a Nothing .
If you look at the class definition for Applicative , you 'll see that there 's a Functor class constraint , which means that we can assume that both of <*>'s parameters are functors .
If the first parameter is not a Nothing , but a Just with some function inside it , we say that we then want to map that function over the second parameter .
This also takes care of the case where the second parameter is Nothing , because doing fmap with any function over a Nothing will return a Nothing .
So for Maybe , <*> extracts the function from the left value if it 's a Just and maps it over the right value .
If any of the parameters is Nothing , Nothing is the result .
OK cool great .
Let 's give this a whirl .
ghci > Just ( +3 ) <*> Just 9 Just 12 ghci > pure ( +3 ) <*> Just 10 Just 13 ghci > pure ( +3 ) <*> Just 9 Just 12 ghci > Just ( ++ " hahah " ) <*>
Nothing Nothing ghci > Nothing <*>
Just " woot " Nothing
We see how doing pure ( +3 ) and Just ( +3 ) is the same in this case .
Use pure if you 're dealing with Maybe values in an applicative context ( i.e. using them with <* > ) , otherwise stick to Just .
The first four input lines demonstrate how the function is extracted and then mapped , but in this case , they could have been achieved by just mapping unwrapped functions over functors .
The last line is interesting , because we try to extract a function from a Nothing and then map it over something , which of course results in a Nothing .
With normal functors , you can just map a function over a functor and then you can't get the result out in any general way , even if the result is a partially applied function .
Applicative functors , on the other hand , allow you to operate on several functors with a single function .
Check out this piece of code :
ghci > pure (+ ) <*> Just 3 <*> Just 5 Just 8 ghci > pure (+ ) <*> Just 3 <*> Nothing Nothing ghci > pure (+ ) <*> Nothing <*> Just 5 Nothing
What 's going on here ?
Let 's take a look , step by step .
<*> is left - associative , which means that pure (+ ) <*> Just 3 <*>
Just 5 is the same as ( pure (+ ) <*> Just 3 ) <*> Just 5 . First , the + function is put in a functor , which is in this case a Maybe value that contains the function .
So at first , we have pure (+ ) , which is Just (+ ) .
Next , Just (+ ) <*>
Just 3 happens .
The result of this is Just ( 3+ ) .
This is because of partial application .
Only applying 3 to the + function results in a function that takes one parameter and adds 3 to it .
Finally , Just ( 3+ ) <*>
Just 5 is carried out , which results in a Just 8 .
Is n't this awesome ?!
Applicative functors and the applicative style of doing pure f <*> x <*> y <*> ... allow us to take a function that expects parameters that are n't necessarily wrapped in functors and use that function to operate on several values that are in functor contexts .
The function can take as many parameters as we want , because it 's always partially applied step by step between occurences of <*>.
This becomes even more handy and apparent if we consider the fact that pure f <*> x equals fmap f x .
This is one of the applicative laws .
We 'll take a closer look at them later , but for now , we can sort of intuitively see that this is so .
Think about it , it makes sense .
Like we said before , pure puts a value in a default context .
If we just put a function in a default context and then extract and apply it to a value inside another applicative functor , we did the same as just mapping that function over that applicative functor .
Instead of writing pure f <*> x <*> y <*> ... , we can write fmap f x <*> y <*> ....
This is why Control .
Applicative exports a function called < $ > , which is just fmap as an infix operator .
Here 's how it 's defined :
(<$ > ) :: ( Functor f ) => ( a -> b ) -> f a -> f b f < $> x = fmap f x
Yo !
Quick reminder : type variables are independent of parameter names or other value names .
The f in the function declaration here is a type variable with a class constraint saying that any type constructor that replaces f should be in the Functor typeclass .
The f in the function body denotes a function that we map over x .
The fact that we used f to represent both of those does n't mean that they somehow represent the same thing .
By using < $ > , the applicative style really shines , because now if we want to apply a function f between three applicative functors , we can write f < $> x <*> y <*> z .
If the parameters were n't applicative functors but normal values , we 'd write f x y z .
Let 's take a closer look at how this works .
We have a value of Just " johntra " and a value of Just " volta " and we want to join them into one String inside a Maybe functor .
We do this :
ghci > (++ ) <$> Just " johntra " <*>
Just " volta " Just " johntravolta "
Before we see how this happens , compare the above line with this :
ghci > (++) " johntra " " volta " " johntravolta "
Awesome !
To use a normal function on applicative functors , just sprinkle some < $> and <*> about and the function will operate on applicatives and return an applicative .
How cool is that ?
Anyway , when we do (++ ) <$> Just " johntra " <*>
Just " volta " , first ( ++ ) , which has a type of (++ ) :: [ a ] -> [ a ] -> [ a ] gets mapped over Just " johntra " , resulting in a value that 's the same as Just ( " johntra " ++ ) and has a type of Maybe ( [ Char ] -> [ Char ] ) .
Notice how the first parameter of ( ++ ) got eaten up and how the as turned into Chars .
And now Just ( " johntra " ++ )
<*>
Just " volta " happens , which takes the function out of the Just and maps it over Just " volta " , resulting in Just " johntravolta " .
Had any of the two values been Nothing , the result would have also been Nothing .
So far , we 've only used Maybe in our examples and you might be thinking that applicative functors are all about Maybe .
There are loads of other instances of Applicative , so let 's go and meet them !
Lists ( actually the list type constructor , [ ] ) are applicative functors .
What a suprise !
Here 's how [ ] is an instance of Applicative :
instance Applicative [ ] where pure x = [ x ] fs <*> xs = [f x | f <- fs , x <- xs ]
Earlier , we said that pure takes a value and puts it in a default context .
Or in other words , a minimal context that still yields that value .
The minimal context for lists would be the empty list , [ ] , but the empty list represents the lack of a value , so it can't hold in itself the value that we used pure on .
That 's why pure takes a value and puts it in a singleton list .
Similarly , the minimal context for the Maybe applicative functor would be a Nothing , but it represents the lack of a value instead of a value , so pure is implemented as Just in the instance implementation for Maybe .
ghci > pure " Hey " :: [ String ] [ " Hey " ] ghci > pure " Hey " :: Maybe String Just " Hey "
What about <*>?
If we look at what <*>'s type would be if it were limited only to lists , we get ( <* > ) :: [ a -> b ] -> [ a ] -> [ b ] .
It 's implemented with a list comprehension .
<*> has to somehow extract the function out of its left parameter and then map it over the right parameter .
But the thing here is that the left list can have zero functions , one function , or several functions inside it .
The right list can also hold several values .
That 's why we use a list comprehension to draw from both lists .
We apply every possible function from the left list to every possible value from the right list .
The resulting list has every possible combination of applying a function from the left list to a value in the right one .
ghci > [ ( *0 ) , ( +100 ) , ( ^2 ) ] <*> [ 1,2,3 ] [ 0,0,0,101,102,103, 1,4,9 ]
The left list has three functions and the right list has three values , so the resulting list will have nine elements .
Every function in the left list is applied to every function in the right one .
If we have a list of functions that take two parameters , we can apply those functions between two lists .
ghci > [ (+ ) , (* ) ] <*> [ 1,2 ] <*> [ 3,4 ] [ 4,5,5,6,3,4,6,8 ]
Because <*> is left - associative , [ (+ ) , (* ) ]
<*> [ 1,2 ] happens first , resulting in a list that 's the same as [ ( 1+ ) , ( 2+ ) , ( 1* ) , ( 2* ) ] , because every function on the left gets applied to every value on the right .
Then , [ ( 1+ ) , ( 2+ ) , ( 1* ) , ( 2* ) ]
<*> [ 3,4 ] happens , which produces the final result .
Using the applicative style with lists is fun !
Watch :
ghci > (++ ) < $> [ " ha " , " heh " , " hmm " ] <* > [ " ? " , " ! " , " . " ] [ " ha ? " , " ha ! " , " ha. " , " heh ? " , " heh ! " , " heh . " , " hmm ? " , " hmm ! " , " hmm . " ]
Again , see how we used a normal function that takes two strings between two applicative functors of strings just by inserting the appropriate applicative operators .
You can view lists as non-deterministic computations .
A value like 100 or " what " can be viewed as a deterministic computation that has only one result , whereas a list like [ 1,2,3 ] can be viewed as a computation that can't decide on which result it wants to have , so it presents us with all of the possible results .
So when you do something like (+ ) < $ > [ 1,2,3 ] <*> [ 4,5,6 ] , you can think of it as adding together two non-deterministic computations with + , only to produce another non-deterministic computation that 's even less sure about its result .
Using the applicative style on lists is often a good replacement for list comprehensions .
In the second chapter , we wanted to see all the possible products of [ 2,5,10 ] and [ 8,10,11 ] , so we did this :
ghci > [ x*y | x <- [ 2,5,10 ] , y <- [ 8,10,11 ] ]
[ 16,20,22,40,50,55,80,100,110 ]
We 're just drawing from two lists and applying a function between every combination of elements .
This can be done in the applicative style as well :
ghci > ( *) < $ > [ 2,5,10 ] <*> [ 8,10,11 ] [ 16,20,22,40,50,55,80,100,110 ]
This seems clearer to me , because it 's easier to see that we 're just calling * between two non-deterministic computations .
If we wanted all possible products of those two lists that are more than 50 , we 'd just do :
ghci > filter ( > 50 ) $ ( *) < $ > [ 2,5,10 ] <*> [ 8,10,11 ] [ 55,80,100,110 ]
It 's easy to see how pure f <*> xs equals fmap f xs with lists .
pure f is just [ f ] and [ f ]
<*> xs will apply every function in the left list to every value in the right one , but there 's just one function in the left list , so it 's like mapping .
Another instance of Applicative that we 've already encountered is IO .
This is how the instance is implemented :
instance Applicative IO where pure = return a <*> b = do f <- a x <- b return ( f x )
Since pure is all about putting a value in a minimal context that still holds it as its result , it makes sense that pure is just return , because return does exactly that ; it makes an I / O action that does n't do anything , it just yields some value as its result , but it does n't really do any I/O operations like printing to the terminal or reading from a file .
If <*> were specialized for IO it would have a type of ( <*> ) :: IO ( a -> b ) -> IO a -> IO b.
It would take an I/O action that yields a function as its result and another I/O action and create a new I / O action from those two that , when performed , first performs the first one to get the function and then performs the second one to get the value and then it would yield that function applied to the value as its result .
We used do syntax to implement it here .
Remember , do syntax is about taking several I / O actions and gluing them into one , which is exactly what we do here .
With Maybe and [ ] , we could think of <*> as simply extracting a function from its left parameter and then sort of applying it over the right one .
With IO , extracting is still in the game , but now we also have a notion of sequencing , because we 're taking two I/O actions and we 're sequencing , or gluing , them into one .
We have to extract the function from the first I /O action , but to extract a result from an I/ O action , it has to be performed .
Consider this :
myAction :: IO String myAction = do a <- getLine b <- getLine return $ a ++ b
This is an I/ O action that will prompt the user for two lines and yield as its result those two lines concatenated .
We achieved it by gluing together two getLine I/O actions and a return , because we wanted our new glued I/O action to hold the result of a ++ b.
Another way of writing this would be to use the applicative style .
myAction :: IO String myAction = (++ ) <$> getLine <*> getLine
What we were doing before was making an I/O action that applied a function between the results of two other I/O actions , and this is the same thing .
Remember , getLine is an I/O action with the type getLine :: IO String .
When we use <*> between two applicative functors , the result is an applicative functor , so this all makes sense .
If we regress to the box analogy , we can imagine getLine as a box that will go out into the real world and fetch us a string .
Doing (++ ) <$> getLine <*> getLine makes a new , bigger box that sends those two boxes out to fetch lines from the terminal and then presents the concatenation of those two lines as its result .
The type of the expression (++ ) < $> getLine <*> getLine is IO String , which means that this expression is a completely normal I / O action like any other , which also holds a result value inside it , just like other I /O actions .
That 's why we can do stuff like :
main = do a <- (++ ) <$> getLine <*> getLine putStrLn $ " The two lines concatenated turn out to be : " ++ a
If you ever find yourself binding some I/O actions to names and then calling some function on them and presenting that as the result by using return , consider using the applicative style because it 's arguably a bit more concise and terse .
Another instance of Applicative is ( -> ) r , so functions .
They are rarely used with the applicative style outside of code golf , but they 're still interesting as applicatives , so let 's take a look at how the function instance is implemented .
If you 're confused about what ( -> ) r means , check out the previous section where we explain how ( -> ) r is a functor .
instance Applicative ( (-> ) r ) where pure x = ( \_ -> x ) f <*> g = \x -> f x ( g x )
When we wrap a value into an applicative functor with pure , the result it yields always has to be that value .
A minimal default context that still yields that value as a result .
That 's why in the function instance implementation , pure takes a value and creates a function that ignores its parameter and always returns that value .
If we look at the type for pure , but specialized for the ( -> ) r instance , it 's pure :: a -> ( r -> a ) .
ghci > ( pure 3 ) " blah " 3
Because of currying , function application is left - associative , so we can omit the parentheses .
ghci > pure 3 " blah " 3
The instance implementation for <*> is a bit cryptic , so it 's best if we just take a look at how to use functions as applicative functors in the applicative style .
ghci > :t (+ ) < $ > ( +3 ) <*> ( * 100 ) (+ ) < $ > ( +3 ) <*> ( * 100 ) :: ( Num a ) => a -> a ghci > (+ ) < $ > ( +3 ) <*> ( * 100 ) $ 5 508
Calling <*> with two applicative functors results in an applicative functor , so if we use it on two functions , we get back a function .
So what goes on here ?
When we do (+ ) < $ > ( +3 ) <*> ( * 100 ) , we 're making a function that will use + on the results of ( +3 ) and ( * 100 ) and return that .
To demonstrate on a real example , when we did (+ ) < $ > ( +3 ) <*> ( * 100 ) $ 5 , the 5 first got applied to ( +3 ) and ( * 100 ) , resulting in 8 and 500 .
Then , + gets called with 8 and 500 , resulting in 508 .
ghci > ( \x y z -> [ x , y , z ] ) < $ > ( +3 ) <*> ( * 2 ) <*> ( /2 ) $ 5 [ 8.0,10.0,2.5 ]
Same here .
We create a function that will call the function \x y z -> [ x , y,z ] with the eventual results from ( +3 ) , ( * 2 ) and ( / 2 ) .
The 5 gets fed to each of the three functions and then \x y z -> [ x , y , z ] gets called with those results .
You can think of functions as boxes that contain their eventual results , so doing k < $> f <*> g creates a function that will call k with the eventual results from f and g .
When we do something like (+ ) <$> Just 3 <*>
Just 5 , we 're using + on values that might or might not be there , which also results in a value that might or might not be there .
When we do (+ ) < $ > ( +10 ) <*> ( + 5 ) , we 're using + on the future return values of ( +10 ) and ( +5 ) and the result is also something that will produce a value only when called with a parameter .
We do n't often use functions as applicatives , but this is still really interesting .
It 's not very important that you get how the ( -> ) r instance for Applicative works , so do n't despair if you 're not getting this right now .
Try playing with the applicative style and functions to build up an intuition for functions as applicatives .
An instance of Applicative that we have n't encountered yet is ZipList , and it lives in Control .
Applicative .
It turns out there are actually more ways for lists to be applicative functors .
One way is the one we already covered , which says that calling <*> with a list of functions and a list of values results in a list which has all the possible combinations of applying functions from the left list to the values in the right list .
If we do [ ( +3 ) , ( * 2 ) ] <*> [ 1,2 ] , ( +3 ) will be applied to both 1 and 2 and ( * 2 ) will also be applied to both 1 and 2 , resulting in a list that has four elements , namely [ 4,5,2,4 ] .
However , [ ( +3 ) , ( * 2 ) ] <*> [ 1,2 ] could also work in such a way that the first function in the left list gets applied to the first value in the right one , the second function gets applied to the second value , and so on .
That would result in a list with two values , namely [ 4,4 ] .
You could look at it as [ 1 + 3 , 2 * 2 ] .
Because one type can't have two instances for the same typeclass , the ZipList a type was introduced , which has one constructor ZipList that has just one field , and that field is a list .
Here 's the instance :
instance Applicative ZipList where pure x = ZipList ( repeat x ) ZipList fs <*>
ZipList xs = ZipList ( zipWith ( \f x -> f x ) fs xs )
<*> does just what we said .
It applies the first function to the first value , the second function to the second value , etc .
This is done with zipWith ( \f x -> f x ) fs xs .
Because of how zipWith works , the resulting list will be as long as the shorter of the two lists .
pure is also interesting here .
It takes a value and puts it in a list that just has that value repeating indefinitely .
pure " haha " results in ZipList ( [ " haha " , " haha " , " haha " ....
This might be a bit confusing since we said that pure should put a value in a minimal context that still yields that value .
And you might be thinking that an infinite list of something is hardly minimal .
But it makes sense with zip lists , because it has to produce the value on every position .
This also satisfies the law that pure f <*> xs should equal fmap f xs .
If pure 3 just returned ZipList [ 3 ] , pure ( * 2 ) <*> ZipList [ 1,5,10 ] would result in ZipList [ 2 ] , because the resulting list of two zipped lists has the length of the shorter of the two .
If we zip a finite list with an infinite list , the length of the resulting list will always be equal to the length of the finite list .
So how do zip lists work in an applicative style ?
Let 's see .
Oh , the ZipList a type does n't have a Show instance , so we have to use the getZipList function to extract a raw list out of a zip list .
ghci > getZipList $ (+ ) < $> ZipList [ 1,2,3 ] <*> ZipList [ 100,100,100 ] [ 101,102,103 ] ghci > getZipList $ (+ ) < $> ZipList [ 1,2,3 ] <*> ZipList [ 100,100 .. ]
[ 101,102,103 ] ghci > getZipList $ max < $> ZipList [ 1,2,3,4,5,3 ]
<*> ZipList [ 5,3, 1,2 ] [ 5,3,3,4 ] ghci > getZipList $ ( , , ) < $> ZipList " dog " <*> ZipList " cat " <*> ZipList " rat " [ ( ' d ' , 'c ' , 'r ' ) , ( 'o ' , 'a ' , 'a ' ) , ( ' g ' , 't ' , 't ' ) ]
The ( , , ) function is the same as \x y z -> ( x , y, z ) .
Also , the ( , ) function is the same as \x y -> ( x , y ) .
Aside from zipWith , the standard library has functions such as zipWith3 , zipWith4 , all the way up to 7 .
zipWith takes a function that takes two parameters and zips two lists with it .
zipWith3 takes a function that takes three parameters and zips three lists with it , and so on .
By using zip lists with an applicative style , we do n't have to have a separate zip function for each number of lists that we want to zip together .
We just use the applicative style to zip together an arbitrary amount of lists with a function , and that 's pretty cool .
Control .
Applicative defines a function that 's called lift A2 , which has a type of lift A2 :: ( Applicative f ) => ( a -> b -> c ) -> f a -> f b -> f c .
It 's defined like this :
liftA2 :: ( Applicative f ) => ( a -> b -> c ) -> f a -> f b -> f c lift A2 f a b = f < $> a <*> b
Nothing special , it just applies a function between two applicatives , hiding the applicative style that we 've become familiar with .
The reason we 're looking at it is because it clearly showcases why applicative functors are more powerful than just ordinary functors .
With ordinary functors , we can just map functions over one functor .
But with applicative functors , we can apply a function between several functors .
It 's also interesting to look at this function 's type as ( a -> b -> c ) -> ( f a -> f b -> f c ) .
When we look at it like this , we can say that lift A2 takes a normal binary function and promotes it to a function that operates on two functors .
Here 's an interesting concept : we can take two applicative functors and combine them into one applicative functor that has inside it the results of those two applicative functors in a list .
For instance , we have Just 3 and Just 4 .
Let 's assume that the second one has a singleton list inside it , because that 's really easy to achieve :
ghci > fmap ( \x -> [ x ] ) ( Just 4 ) Just [ 4 ]
OK , so let 's say we have Just 3 and Just [ 4 ] .
How do we get Just [ 3,4 ] ?
Easy .
ghci > liftA2 ( :) ( Just 3 ) ( Just [ 4 ] ) Just [ 3,4 ] ghci > ( :) <$> Just 3 <*> Just [ 4 ]
Just [ 3,4 ]
Remember , : is a function that takes an element and a list and returns a new list with that element at the beginning .
Now that we have Just [ 3,4 ] , could we combine that with Just 2 to produce Just [ 2,3,4 ] ?
Of course we could .
It seems that we can combine any amount of applicatives into one applicative that has a list of the results of those applicatives inside it .
Let 's try implementing a function that takes a list of applicatives and returns an applicative that has a list as its result value .
We 'll call it sequenceA .
sequenceA :: ( Applicative f ) => [ f a ] -> f [ a ] sequenceA [ ] = pure [ ] sequenceA ( x:xs ) = ( :) < $> x <*> sequenceA xs
Ah , recursion !
First , we look at the type .
It will transform a list of applicatives into an applicative with a list .
From that , we can lay some groundwork for an edge condition .
If we want to turn an empty list into an applicative with a list of results , well , we just put an empty list in a default context .
Now comes the recursion .
If we have a list with a head and a tail ( remember , x is an applicative and xs is a list of them ) , we call sequenceA on the tail , which results in an applicative with a list .
Then , we just prepend the value inside the applicative x into that applicative with a list , and that 's it !
So if we do sequenceA [ Just 1 , Just 2 ] , that 's ( :) < $> Just 1 <*> sequenceA [ Just 2 ] .
That equals ( :) < $> Just 1 <*> (( :) < $> Just 2 <*> sequenceA [ ] ) .
Ah !
We know that sequenceA [ ] ends up as being Just [ ] , so this expression is now ( :) < $> Just 1 <*> (( :) <$> Just 2 <*> Just [ ] ) , which is ( :) < $> Just 1 <*> Just [ 2 ] , which is Just [ 1,2 ] !
Another way to implement sequenceA is with a fold .
Remember , pretty much any function where we go over a list element by element and accumulate a result along the way can be implemented with a fold .
sequenceA :: ( Applicative f ) => [ f a ] -> f [ a ] sequenceA = foldr ( liftA2 ( : ) ) ( pure [ ] )
We approach the list from the right and start off with an accumulator value of pure [ ] .
We do lift A2 ( :) between the accumulator and the last element of the list , which results in an applicative that has a singleton in it .
Then we do lift A2 ( :) with the now last element and the current accumulator and so on , until we 're left with just the accumulator , which holds a list of the results of all the applicatives .
Let 's give our function a whirl on some applicatives .
ghci > sequenceA [ Just 3 , Just 2 , Just 1 ] Just [ 3,2,1 ] ghci > sequenceA [ Just 3 , Nothing , Just 1 ] Nothing ghci > sequenceA [ ( +3 ) , ( +2 ) , ( +1 ) ] 3 [ 6,5,4 ] ghci > sequenceA [ [ 1,2,3 ] , [ 4,5,6 ] ] [ [ 1,4 ] , [ 1,5 ] , [ 1,6 ] , [ 2,4 ] , [ 2,5 ] , [ 2,6 ] , [ 3,4 ] , [ 3,5 ] , [ 3,6 ] ] ghci > sequenceA [ [ 1,2,3 ] , [ 4,5,6 ] , [ 3,4,4 ] , [ ] ] [ ]
Ah !
Pretty cool .
When used on Maybe values , sequenceA creates a Maybe value with all the results inside it as a list .
If one of the values was Nothing , then the result is also a Nothing .
This is cool when you have a list of Maybe values and you 're interested in the values only if none of them is a Nothing .
When used with functions , sequenceA takes a list of functions and returns a function that returns a list .
In our example , we made a function that took a number as a parameter and applied it to each function in the list and then returned a list of results .
sequenceA [ ( +3 ) , ( +2 ) , ( +1 ) ] 3 will call ( +3 ) with 3 , ( +2 ) with 3 and ( +1 ) with 3 and present all those results as a list .
Doing (+ ) < $ > ( +3 ) <*> ( * 2 ) will create a function that takes a parameter , feeds it to both ( +3 ) and ( * 2 ) and then calls + with those two results .
In the same vein , it makes sense that sequenceA [ ( +3 ) , ( * 2 ) ] makes a function that takes a parameter and feeds it to all of the functions in the list .
Instead of calling + with the results of the functions , a combination of : and pure [ ] is used to gather those results in a list , which is the result of that function .
Using sequenceA is cool when we have a list of functions and we want to feed the same input to all of them and then view the list of results .
For instance , we have a number and we 're wondering whether it satisfies all of the predicates in a list .
One way to do that would be like so :
ghci > map ( \f -> f 7 ) [ ( > 4 ) , ( < 10 ) , odd ] [ True , True , True ] ghci > and $ map ( \f -> f 7 ) [ ( > 4 ) , ( < 10 ) , odd ]
True
Remember , and takes a list of booleans and returns
True if they 're all True .
Another way to achieve the same thing would be with sequenceA :
ghci > sequenceA [ ( > 4 ) , ( < 10 ) , odd ] 7 [ True , True , True ] ghci > and $ sequenceA [ ( > 4 ) , ( < 10 ) , odd ] 7 True
sequenceA [ ( > 4 ) , ( < 10 ) , odd ] creates a function that will take a number and feed it to all of the predicates in [ ( > 4 ) , ( < 10 ) , odd ] and return a list of booleans .
It turns a list with the type ( Num a ) => [ a ->
Bool ] into a function with the type ( Num a ) => a -> [ Bool ] .
Pretty neat , huh ?
Because lists are homogenous , all the functions in the list have to be functions of the same type , of course .
You can't have a list like [ ord , ( +3 ) ] , because ord takes a character and returns a number , whereas ( +3 ) takes a number and returns a number .
When used with [ ] , sequenceA takes a list of lists and returns a list of lists .
Hmm , interesting .
It actually creates lists that have all possible combinations of their elements .
For illustration , here 's the above done with sequenceA and then done with a list comprehension :
ghci > sequenceA [ [ 1,2,3 ] , [ 4,5,6 ] ] [ [ 1,4 ] , [ 1,5 ] , [ 1,6 ] , [ 2,4 ] , [ 2,5 ] , [ 2,6 ] , [ 3,4 ] , [ 3,5 ] , [ 3,6 ] ] ghci > [ [ x , y ] | x <- [ 1,2,3 ] , y <- [ 4,5,6 ] ] [ [ 1,4 ] , [ 1,5 ] , [ 1,6 ] , [ 2,4 ] , [ 2,5 ] , [ 2,6 ] , [ 3,4 ] , [ 3,5 ] , [ 3,6 ] ] ghci > sequenceA [ [ 1,2 ] , [ 3,4 ] ] [ [ 1,3 ] , [ 1,4 ] , [ 2,3 ] , [ 2,4 ] ] ghci > [ [ x , y ] | x <- [ 1,2 ] , y <- [ 3,4 ] ] [ [ 1,3 ] , [ 1,4 ] , [ 2,3 ] , [ 2,4 ] ] ghci > sequenceA [ [ 1,2 ] , [ 3,4 ] , [ 5,6 ] ] [ [ 1,3,5 ] , [ 1,3,6 ] , [ 1,4,5 ] , [ 1,4,6 ] , [ 2,3,5 ] , [ 2,3,6 ] , [ 2,4,5 ] , [ 2,4,6 ] ] ghci > [ [ x , y,z ] | x <- [ 1,2 ] , y <- [ 3,4 ] , z <- [ 5,6 ] ] [ [ 1,3,5 ] , [ 1,3,6 ] , [ 1,4,5 ] , [ 1,4,6 ] , [ 2,3,5 ] , [ 2,3,6 ] , [ 2,4,5 ] , [ 2,4,6 ] ]
This might be a bit hard to grasp , but if you play with it for a while , you 'll see how it works .
Let 's say that we 're doing sequenceA [ [ 1,2 ] , [ 3,4 ] ] .
To see how this happens , let 's use the sequenceA ( x:xs ) = ( :) < $> x <*> sequenceA xs definition of sequenceA and the edge condition sequenceA [ ] = pure [ ] .
You do n't have to follow this evaluation , but it might help you if have trouble imagining how sequenceA works on lists of lists , because it can be a bit mind - bending .
We start off with sequenceA [ [ 1,2 ] , [ 3,4 ] ]
That evaluates to ( : ) < $ > [ 1,2 ] <*> sequenceA [ [ 3,4 ] ]
Evaluating the inner sequenceA further , we get ( : ) < $ > [ 1,2 ] <*> ( ( :) <$ > [ 3,4 ] <*> sequenceA [ ] )
further , we get We 've reached the edge condition , so this is now ( : ) < $ > [ 1,2 ] <*> ( ( : ) < $ > [ 3,4 ] <* > [ [ ] ] )
Now , we evaluate the ( : ) < $ > [ 3,4 ] <*> [ [ ] ] part , which will use : with every possible value in the left list ( possible values are 3 and 4 ) with every possible value on the right list ( only possible value is [ ] ) , which results in [ 3 :[ ] , 4 : [ ] ] , which is [ [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] ] .
So now we have ( : ) < $ > [ 1,2 ] <* > [ [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] ]
part , which will use with every possible value in the left list ( possible values are and ) with every possible value on the right list ( only possible value is ) , which results in , which is .
So now we have Now , : is used with every possible value from the left list ( 1 and 2 ) with every possible value in the right list ( [ 3 ] and [ 4 ] ) , which results in [ 1 : [ 3 ] , 1 : [ 4 ] , 2:[3 ] , 2 : [ 4 ] ] , which is [ [ 1,3 ] , [ 1,4 ] , [ 2,3 ] , [ 2,4 ]
Doing (+ ) < $ > [ 1,2 ] <*> [ 4,5,6 ] results in a non-deterministic computation x + y where x takes on every value from [ 1,2 ] and y takes on every value from [ 4,5,6 ] .
We represent that as a list which holds all of the possible results .
Similarly , when we do sequence [ [ 1,2 ] , [ 3,4 ] , [ 5,6 ] , [ 7,8 ] ] , the result is a non-deterministic computation [ x , y , z , w ] , where x takes on every value from [ 1,2 ] , y takes on every value from [ 3,4 ] and so on .
To represent the result of that non-deterministic computation , we use a list , where each element in the list is one possible list .
That 's why the result is a list of lists .
When used with I/O actions , sequenceA is the same thing as sequence !
It takes a list of I/O actions and returns an I/ O action that will perform each of those actions and have as its result a list of the results of those I /O actions .
That 's because to turn an [ IO a ] value into an IO [ a ] value , to make an I/ O action that yields a list of results when performed , all those I/ O actions have to be sequenced so that they 're then performed one after the other when evaluation is forced .
You can't get the result of an I /O action without performing it .
ghci > sequenceA [ getLine , getLine , getLine ] heyh ho woo [ " heyh " , " ho " , " woo " ]
Like normal functors , applicative functors come with a few laws .
The most important one is the one that we already mentioned , namely that pure f <*> x = fmap f x holds .
As an exercise , you can prove this law for some of the applicative functors that we 've met in this chapter .
The other functor laws are :
pure id <*> v = v
pure (. ) <*> u <*> v <*> w = u <*> ( v <*> w )
pure f <*> pure x = pure ( f x )
u <*> pure y = pure ( $ y ) <*> u
We wo n't go over them in detail right now because that would take up a lot of pages and it would probably be kind of boring , but if you 're up to the task , you can take a closer look at them and see if they hold for some of the instances .
In conclusion , applicative functors are n't just interesting , they 're also useful , because they allow us to combine different computations , such as I/O computations , non-deterministic computations , computations that might have failed , etc. by using the applicative style .
Just by using < $> and <*> we can use normal functions to uniformly operate on any number of applicative functors and take advantage of the semantics of each one .
The newtype keyword
So far , we 've learned how to make our own algebraic data types by using the data keyword .
We 've also learned how to give existing types synonyms with the type keyword .
In this section , we 'll be taking a look at how to make new types out of existing data types by using the newtype keyword and why we'd want to do that in the first place .
In the previous section , we saw that there are actually more ways for the list type to be an applicative functor .
One way is to have <*> take every function out of the list that is its left parameter and apply it to every value in the list that is on the right , resulting in every possible combination of applying a function from the left list to a value in the right list .
ghci > [ ( +1 ) , ( * 100 ) , ( * 5 ) ] [ 1,2,3 ] [ 2,3,4,100,200,300,5,10,15 ]
The second way is to take the first function on the left side of <*> and apply it to the first value on the right , then take the second function from the list on the left side and apply it to the second value on the right , and so on .
Ultimately , it 's kind of like zipping the two lists together .
But lists are already an instance of Applicative , so how did we also make lists an instance of Applicative in this second way ?
If you remember , we said that the ZipList a type was introduced for this reason , which has one value constructor , ZipList , that has just one field .
We put the list that we 're wrapping in that field .
Then , ZipList was made an instance of Applicative , so that when we want to use lists as applicatives in the zipping manner , we just wrap them with the ZipList constructor and then once we 're done , unwrap them with getZipList :
ghci > getZipList $ ZipList [ ( +1 ) , ( * 100 ) , ( * 5 ) ] ZipList [ 1,2,3 ] [ 2,200,15 ]
So , what does this have to do with this newtype keyword ?
Well , think about how we might write the data declaration for our ZipList a type .
One way would be to do it like so :
data ZipList a = ZipList [ a ]
A type that has just one value constructor and that value constructor has just one field that is a list of things .
We might also want to use record syntax so that we automatically get a function that extracts a list from a ZipList :
data ZipList a = ZipList { getZipList :: [ a ] }
This looks fine and would actually work pretty well .
We had two ways of making an existing type an instance of a type class , so we used the data keyword to just wrap that type into another type and made the other type an instance in the second way .
The newtype keyword in Haskell is made exactly for these cases when we want to just take one type and wrap it in something to present it as another type .
In the actual libraries , ZipList a is defined like this :
newtype ZipList a = ZipList { getZipList :: [ a ] }
Instead of the data keyword , the newtype keyword is used .
Now why is that ?
Well for one , newtype is faster .
If you use the data keyword to wrap a type , there 's some overhead to all that wrapping and unwrapping when your program is running .
But if you use newtype , Haskell knows that you 're just using it to wrap an existing type into a new type ( hence the name ) , because you want it to be the same internally but have a different type .
With that in mind , Haskell can get rid of the wrapping and unwrapping once it resolves which value is of what type .
So why not just use newtype all the time instead of data then ?
Well , when you make a new type from an existing type by using the newtype keyword , you can only have one value constructor and that value constructor can only have one field .
But with data , you can make data types that have several value constructors and each constructor can have zero or more fields :
data Profession = Fighter | Archer | Accountant data Race = Human | Elf | Orc | Goblin data PlayerCharacter = PlayerCharacter Race Profession
When using newtype , you 're restricted to just one constructor with one field .
We can also use the deriving keyword with newtype just like we would with data .
We can derive instances for Eq , Ord , Enum , Bounded , Show and Read .
If we derive the instance for a type class , the type that we 're wrapping has to be in that type class to begin with .
It makes sense , because newtype just wraps an existing type .
So now if we do the following , we can print and equate values of our new type :
newtype CharList = CharList { getCharList :: [ Char ] } deriving ( Eq , Show )
Let 's give that a go :
ghci > CharList " this will be shown ! " CharList {getCharList = " this will be shown ! " } ghci > CharList " benny " == CharList " benny " True ghci > CharList " benny " == CharList " oisters " False
In this particular newtype , the value constructor has the following type :
CharList :: [ Char ] -> CharList
It takes a [ Char ] value , such as " my sharona " and returns a CharList value .
From the above examples where we used the CharList value constructor , we see that really is the case .
Conversely , the getCharList function , which was generated for us because we used record syntax in our newtype , has this type :
getCharList :: CharList -> [ Char ]
It takes a CharList value and converts it to a [ Char ] value .
You can think of this as wrapping and unwrapping , but you can also think of it as converting values from one type to the other .
Using newtype to make type class instances
Many times , we want to make our types instances of certain type classes , but the type parameters just do n't match up for what we want to do .
It 's easy to make Maybe an instance of Functor , because the Functor type class is defined like this :
class Functor f where fmap :: ( a -> b ) -> f a -> f b
So we just start out with :
instance Functor Maybe where
And then implement fmap .
All the type parameters add up because the Maybe takes the place of f in the definition of the Functor type class and so if we look at fmap like it only worked on Maybe , it ends up behaving like :
fmap :: ( a -> b ) -> Maybe a ->
Maybe b
Is n't that just peachy ?
Now what if we wanted to make the tuple an instance of Functor in such a way that when we fmap a function over a tuple , it gets applied to the first component of the tuple ?
That way , doing fmap ( +3 ) ( 1,1 ) would result in ( 4,1 ) .
It turns out that writing the instance for that is kind of hard .
With Maybe , we just say instance Functor Maybe where because only type constructors that take exactly one parameter can be made an instance of Functor .
But it seems like there 's no way to do something like that with ( a , b ) so that the type parameter a ends up being the one that changes when we use fmap .
To get around this , we can newtype our tuple in such a way that the second type parameter represents the type of the first component in the tuple :
newtype Pair b a = Pair { getPair :: ( a , b ) }
And now , we can make it an instance of Functor so that the function is mapped over the first component :
instance Functor ( Pair c ) where fmap f ( Pair ( x , y ) ) = Pair ( f x , y )
As you can see , we can pattern match on types defined with newtype .
We pattern match to get the underlying tuple , then we apply the function f to the first component in the tuple and then we use the Pair value constructor to convert the tuple back to our Pair b a .
If we imagine what the type fmap would be if it only worked on our new pairs , it would be :
fmap :: ( a -> b ) ->
Pair c a ->
Pair c b
Again , we said instance Functor ( Pair c ) where and so Pair c took the place of the f in the type class definition for Functor :
class Functor f where fmap :: ( a -> b ) -> f a -> f b
So now , if we convert a tuple into a Pair b a , we can use fmap over it and the function will be mapped over the first component :
ghci > getPair $ fmap ( * 100 ) ( Pair ( 2,3 ) ) ( 200,3 ) ghci > getPair $ fmap reverse ( Pair ( " london calling " , 3 ) ) ( " gnillac nodnol " , 3 )
On newtype laziness
We mentioned that newtype is usually faster than data .
The only thing that can be done with newtype is turning an existing type into a new type , so internally , Haskell can represent the values of types defined with newtype just like the original ones , only it has to keep in mind that the their types are now distinct .
This fact means that not only is newtype faster , it 's also lazier .
Let 's take a look at what this means .
Like we 've said before , Haskell is lazy by default , which means that only when we try to actually print the results of our functions will any computation take place .
Furthemore , only those computations that are necessary for our function to tell us the result will get carried out .
The undefined value in Haskell represents an erronous computation .
If we try to evaluate it ( that is , force Haskell to actually compute it ) by printing it to the terminal , Haskell will throw a hissy fit ( technically referred to as an exception ) :
ghci > undefined *** Exception : Prelude.undefined
However , if we make a list that has some undefined values in it but request only the head of the list , which is not undefined , everything will go smoothly because Haskell does n't really need to evaluate any other elements in a list if we only want to see what the first element is :
ghci > head [ 3,4,5 , undefined ,2, undefined ] 3
Now consider the following type :
data CoolBool = CoolBool { getCoolBool :: Bool }
It 's your run -of - the - mill algebraic data type that was defined with the data keyword .
It has one value constructor , which has one field whose type is Bool .
Let 's make a function that pattern matches on a CoolBool and returns the value " hello " regardless of whether the Bool inside the CoolBool was True or False :
helloMe :: CoolBool ->
String helloMe ( CoolBool _ ) = " hello "
Instead of applying this function to a normal CoolBool , let 's throw it a curveball and apply it to undefined !
ghci > helloMe undefined " *** Exception : Prelude.undefined
Yikes !
An exception !
Now why did this exception happen ?
Types defined with the data keyword can have multiple value constructors ( even though CoolBool only has one ) .
So in order to see if the value given to our function conforms to the ( CoolBool _ ) pattern , Haskell has to evaluate the value just enough to see which value constructor was used when we made the value .
And when we try to evaluate an undefined value , even a little , an exception is thrown .
Instead of using the data keyword for CoolBool , let 's try using newtype :
newtype CoolBool = CoolBool { getCoolBool :: Bool }
We do n't have to change our helloMe function , because the pattern matching syntax is the same if you use newtype or data to define your type .
Let 's do the same thing here and apply helloMe to an undefined value :
ghci > helloMe undefined " hello "
It worked !
Hmmm , why is that ?
Well , like we 've said , when we use newtype , Haskell can internally represent the values of the new type in the same way as the original values .
It does n't have to add another box around them , it just has to be aware of the values being of different types .
And because Haskell knows that types made with the newtype keyword can only have one constructor , it does n't have to evaluate the value passed to the function to make sure that it conforms to the ( CoolBool _ ) pattern because newtype types can only have one possible value constructor and one field !
This difference in behavior may seem trivial , but it 's actually pretty important because it helps us realize that even though types defined with data and newtype behave similarly from the programmer 's point of view because they both have value constructors and fields , they are actually two different mechanisms .
Whereas data can be used to make your own types from scratch , newtype is for making a completely new type out of an existing type .
Pattern matching on newtype values is n't like taking something out of a box ( like it is with data ) , it 's more about making a direct conversion from one type to another .
type vs. newtype vs. data
At this point , you may be a bit confused about what exactly the difference between type , data and newtype is , so let 's refresh our memory a bit .
The type keyword is for making type synonyms .
What that means is that we just give another name to an already existing type so that the type is easier to refer to .
Say we did the following :
type IntList = [ Int ]
All this does is to allow us to refer to the [ Int ] type as IntList .
They can be used interchangeably .
We do n't get an IntList value constructor or anything like that .
Because [ Int ] and IntList are only two ways to refer to the same type , it does n't matter which name we use in our type annotations :
ghci > ( [ 1,2,3 ] :: IntList ) ++ ( [ 1,2,3 ] :: [ Int ] ) [ 1,2,3,1,2,3 ]
We use type synonyms when we want to make our type signatures more descriptive by giving types names that tell us something about their purpose in the context of the functions where they 're being used .
For instance , when we used an association list of type [ ( String , String ) ] to represent a phone book , we gave it the type synonym of PhoneBook so that the type signatures of our functions were easier to read .
The newtype keyword is for taking existing types and wrapping them in new types , mostly so that it 's easier to make them instances of certain type classes .
When we use newtype to wrap an existing type , the type that we get is separate from the original type .
If we make the following newtype :
newtype CharList = CharList { getCharList :: [ Char ] }
We can't use ++ to put together a CharList and a list of type [ Char ] .
We can't even use ++ to put together two CharLists , because ++ works only on lists and the CharList type is n't a list , even though it could be said that it contains one .
We can , however , convert two CharLists to lists , ++ them and then convert that back to a CharList .
When we use record syntax in our newtype declarations , we get functions for converting between the new type and the original type : namely the value constructor of our newtype and the function for extracting the value in its field .
The new type also is n't automatically made an instance of the type classes that the original type belongs to , so we have to derive or manually write them .
In practice , you can think of newtype declarations as data declarations that can only have one constructor and one field .
If you catch yourself writing such a data declaration , consider using newtype .
The data keyword is for making your own data types and with them , you can go hog wild .
They can have as many constructors and fields as you wish and can be used to implement any algebraic data type by yourself .
Everything from lists and Maybe - like types to trees .
If you just want your type signatures to look cleaner and be more descriptive , you probably want type synonyms .
If you want to take an existing type and wrap it in a new type in order to make it an instance of a type class , chances are you 're looking for a newtype .
And if you want to make something completely new , odds are good that you 're looking for the data keyword .
Monoids
Type classes in Haskell are used to present an interface for types that have some behavior in common .
We started out with simple type classes like Eq , which is for types whose values can be equated , and Ord , which is for things that can be put in an order and then moved on to more interesting ones , like Functor and Applicative .
When we make a type , we think about which behaviors it supports , i.e. what it can act like and then based on that we decide which type classes to make it an instance of .
If it makes sense for values of our type to be equated , we make it an instance of the Eq type class .
If we see that our type is some kind of functor , we make it an instance of Functor , and so on .
Now consider the following : * is a function that takes two numbers and multiplies them .
If we multiply some number with a 1 , the result is always equal to that number .
It does n't matter if we do 1 * x or x * 1 , the result is always x .
Similarly , ++ is also a function which takes two things and returns a third .
Only instead of multiplying numbers , it takes two lists and concatenates them .
And much like * , it also has a certain value which does n't change the other one when used with ++.
That value is the empty list : [ ] .
ghci> 4 * 1 4 ghci> 1 * 9 9 ghci > [ 1,2,3 ] ++ [ ] [ 1,2,3 ] ghci > [ ] ++ [ 0.5 , 2.5 ] [ 0.5,2.5 ]
It seems that both * together with 1 and ++ along with [ ] share some common properties :
The function takes two parameters .
The parameters and the returned value have the same type .
There exists such a value that does n't change other values when used with the binary function .
There 's another thing that these two operations have in common that may not be as obvious as our previous observations : when we have three or more values and we want to use the binary function to reduce them to a single result , the order in which we apply the binary function to the values does n't matter .
It does n't matter if we do ( 3 * 4 ) * 5 or 3 * ( 4 * 5 ) .
Either way , the result is 60 .
The same goes for ++:
ghci > ( 3 * 2 ) * ( 8 * 5 ) 240 ghci> 3 * ( 2 * ( 8 * 5 ) ) 240 ghci > " la " ++ ( " di " ++ " da " ) " ladida " ghci > ( " la " ++ " di " ) ++ " da " " ladida "
We call this property associativity .
* is associative , and so is ++ , but - , for example , is not .
The expressions ( 5 - 3 ) - 4 and 5 - ( 3 - 4 ) result in different numbers .
By noticing and writing down these properties , we have chanced upon monoids !
A monoid is when you have an associative binary function and a value which acts as an identity with respect to that function .
When something acts as an identity with respect to a function , it means that when called with that function and some other value , the result is always equal to that other value .
1 is the identity with respect to * and [ ] is the identity with respect to ++.
There are a lot of other monoids to be found in the world of Haskell , which is why the Monoid type class exists .
It 's for types which can act like monoids .
Let 's see how the type class is defined :
class Monoid m where mempty :: m mappend :: m -> m -> m mconcat :: [ m ] -> m mconcat = foldr mappend mempty
The Monoid type class is defined in import Data .
Monoid .
Let 's take some time and get properly acquainted with it .
First of all , we see that only concrete types can be made instances of Monoid , because the m in the type class definition does n't take any type parameters .
This is different from Functor and Applicative , which require their instances to be type constructors which take one parameter .
The first function is mempty .
It 's not really a function , since it does n't take parameters , so it 's a polymorphic constant , kind of like minBound from Bounded .
mempty represents the identity value for a particular monoid .
Next up , we have mappend , which , as you 've probably guessed , is the binary function .
It takes two values of the same type and returns a value of that type as well .
It 's worth noting that the decision to name mappend as it's named was kind of unfortunate , because it implies that we 're appending two things in some way .
While ++ does take two lists and append one to the other , * does n't really do any appending , it just multiplies two numbers together .
When we meet other instances of Monoid , we 'll see that most of them do n't append values either , so avoid thinking in terms of appending and just think in terms of mappend being a binary function that takes two monoid values and returns a third .
The last function in this type class definition is mconcat .
It takes a list of monoid values and reduces them to a single value by doing mappend between the list 's elements .
It has a default implementation , which just takes mempty as a starting value and folds the list from the right with mappend .
Because the default implementation is fine for most instances , we wo n't concern ourselves with mconcat too much from now on .
When making a type an instance of Monoid , it suffices to just implement mempty and mappend .
The reason mconcat is there at all is because for some instances , there might be a more efficient way to implement mconcat , but for most instances the default implementation is just fine .
Before moving on to specific instances of Monoid , let 's take a brief look at the monoid laws .
We mentioned that there has to be a value that acts as the identity with respect to the binary function and that the binary function has to be associative .
It 's possible to make instances of Monoid that do n't follow these rules , but such instances are of no use to anyone because when using the Monoid type class , we rely on its instances acting like monoids .
Otherwise , what 's the point ?
That 's why when making instances , we have to make sure they follow these laws :
mempty `mappend` x = x
x `mappend` mempty = x
( x `mappend` y ) `mappend` z = x `mappend` ( y `mappend` z )
The first two state that mempty has to act as the identity with respect to mappend and the third says that mappend has to be associative i.e. that it the order in which we use mappend to reduce several monoid values into one does n't matter .
Haskell does n't enforce these laws , so we as the programmer have to be careful that our instances do indeed obey them .
Lists are monoids
Yes , lists are monoids !
Like we 've seen , the ++ function and the empty list [ ] form a monoid .
The instance is very simple :
instance Monoid [ a ] where mempty = [ ] mappend = (++)
Lists are an instance of the Monoid type class regardless of the type of the elements they hold .
Notice that we wrote instance Monoid [ a ] and not instance Monoid [ ] , because Monoid requires a concrete type for an instance .
Giving this a test run , we encounter no surprises :
ghci > [ 1,2,3 ] `mappend` [ 4,5,6 ] [ 1,2,3,4,5,6 ] ghci > ( " one " `mappend` " two " ) `mappend` " tree " " onetwotree " ghci > " one " `mappend` ( " two " `mappend` " tree " ) " onetwotree " ghci > " one " `mappend` " two " `mappend` " tree " " onetwotree " ghci > " pang " `mappend` mempty " pang " ghci > mconcat [ [ 1,2 ] , [ 3,6 ] , [ 9 ] ] [ 1,2,3,6,9 ] ghci > mempty :: [ a ] [ ]
Notice that in the last line , we had to write an explicit type annotation , because if we just did mempty , GHCi would n't know which instance to use , so we had to say we want the list instance .
We were able to use the general type of [ a ] ( as opposed to specifying [ Int ] or [ String ] ) because the empty list can act as if it contains any type .
Because mconcat has a default implementation , we get it for free when we make something an instance of Monoid .
In the case of the list , mconcat turns out to be just concat .
It takes a list of lists and flattens it , because that 's the equivalent of doing ++ between all the adjecent lists in a list .
The monoid laws do indeed hold for the list instance .
When we have several lists and we mappend ( or ++ ) them together , it does n't matter which ones we do first , because they 're just joined at the ends anyway .
Also , the empty list acts as the identity so all is well .
Notice that monoids do n't require that a `mappend` b be equal to b `mappend` a .
In the case of the list , they clearly are n't :
ghci > " one " `mappend` " two " " onetwo " ghci > " two " `mappend` " one " " twoone "
And that 's okay .
The fact that for multiplication 3 * 5 and 5 * 3 are the same is just a property of multiplication , but it does n't hold for all ( and indeed , most ) monoids .
Product and Sum
We already examined one way for numbers to be considered monoids .
Just have the binary function be * and the identity value 1 .
It turns out that that 's not the only way for numbers to be monoids .
Another way is to have the binary function be + and the identity value 0 :
ghci> 0 + 4 4 ghci> 5 + 0 5 ghci > ( 1 + 3 ) + 5 9 ghci> 1 + ( 3 + 5 ) 9
The monoid laws hold , because if you add 0 to any number , the result is that number .
And addition is also associative , so we get no problems there .
So now that there are two equally valid ways for numbers to be monoids , which way do choose ?
Well , we do n't have to .
Remember , when there are several ways for some type to be an instance of the same type class , we can wrap that type in a newtype and then make the new type an instance of the type class in a different way .
We can have our cake and eat it too .
The Data .
Monoid module exports two types for this , namely Product and Sum .
Product is defined like this :
newtype Product a = Product { getProduct :: a } deriving ( Eq , Ord , Read , Show , Bounded )
Simple , just a newtype wrapper with one type parameter along with some derived instances .
Its instance for Monoid goes a little something like this :
instance Num a => Monoid ( Product a ) where mempty = Product 1 Product x `mappend` Product y = Product ( x * y )
mempty is just 1 wrapped in a Product constructor .
mappend pattern matches on the Product constructor , multiplies the two numbers and then wraps the resulting number back .
As you can see , there 's a Num a class constraint .
So this means that Product a is an instance of Monoid for all a's that are already an instance of Num .
To use Producta a as a monoid , we have to do some newtype wrapping and unwrapping :
ghci > getProduct $ Product 3 `mappend` Product 9 27 ghci > getProduct $ Product 3 `mappend` mempty 3 ghci > getProduct $ Product 3 `mappend` Product 4 `mappend` Product 2 24 ghci > getProduct .
mconcat . map Product $ [ 3,4,2 ] 24
This is nice as a showcase of the Monoid type class , but no one in their right mind would use this way of multiplying numbers instead of just writing 3 * 9 and 3 * 1 .
But a bit later , we 'll see how these Monoid instances that may seem trivial at this time can come in handy .
Sum is defined like Product and the instance is similar as well .
We use it in the same way :
ghci > getSum $ Sum 2 `mappend` Sum 9 11 ghci > getSum $ mempty `mappend` Sum 3 3 ghci > getSum .
mconcat . map Sum $ [ 1,2,3 ] 6
Any and All
Another type which can act like a monoid in two distinct but equally valid ways is Bool .
The first way is to have the or function || act as the binary function along with False as the identity value .
The way or works in logic is that if any of its two parameters is True , it returns True , otherwise it returns False .
So if we use False as the identity value , it will return False when or -ed with False and True when or -ed with True .
The Any newtype constructor is an instance of Monoid in this fashion .
It 's defined like this :
newtype Any = Any { getAny :: Bool } deriving ( Eq , Ord , Read , Show , Bounded )
Its instance looks goes like so :
instance Monoid
Any where mempty = Any False Any x `mappend` Any y = Any ( x || y )
The reason it 's called Any is because x `mappend` y will be True if any one of those two is True .
Even if three or more
Any wrapped Bools are mappended together , the result will hold True if any of them are True :
ghci > getAny $ Any True `mappend` Any False True ghci > getAny $ mempty `mappend` Any True True ghci > getAny .
mconcat . map Any $ [ False , False , False , True ]
True ghci > getAny $ mempty `mappend` mempty False
The other way for Bool to be an instance of Monoid is to kind of do the opposite : have && be the binary function and then make True the identity value .
Logical and will return
True only if both of its parameters are True .
This is the newtype declaration , nothing fancy :
newtype All = All { getAll :: Bool } deriving ( Eq , Ord , Read , Show , Bounded )
And this is the instance :
instance Monoid
All where mempty = All True All x `mappend` All y = All ( x && y )
When we mappend values of the All type , the result will be True only if all the values used in the mappend operations are True :
ghci > getAll $ mempty `mappend` All True True ghci > getAll $ mempty `mappend` All False False ghci > getAll .
mconcat . map All $ [ True , True , True ]
True ghci > getAll .
mconcat . map All $ [ True , True , False ] False
Just like with multiplication and addition , we usually explicitly state the binary functions instead of wrapping them in newtypes and then using mappend and mempty .
mconcat seems useful for Any and All , but usually it 's easier to use the or and and functions , which take lists of Bools and return
True if any of them are True or if all of them are True , respectively .
The Ordering monoid
Hey , remember the Ordering type ?
It 's used as the result when comparing things and it can have three values : LT , EQ and GT , which stand for less than , equal and greater than respectively :
ghci > 1 `compare` 2 LT ghci > 2 `compare` 2 EQ ghci > 3 `compare` 2 GT
With lists , numbers and boolean values , finding monoids was just a matter of looking at already existing commonly used functions and seeing if they exhibit some sort of monoid behavior .
With Ordering , we have to look a bit harder to recognize a monoid , but it turns out that its Monoid instance is just as intuitive as the ones we 've met so far and also quite useful :
instance Monoid Ordering where mempty = EQ LT `mappend` _ = LT EQ `mappend` y = y GT `mappend` _ = GT
The instance is set up like this : when we mappend two Ordering values , the one on the left is kept , unless the value on the left is EQ , in which case the right one is the result .
The identity is EQ .
At first , this may seem kind of arbitrary , but it actually resembles the way we alphabetically compare words .
We compare the first two letters and if they differ , we can already decide which word would go first in a dictionary .
However , if the first two letters are equal , then we move on to comparing the next pair of letters and repeat the process .
For instance , if we were to alphabetically compare the words " ox " and " on " , we 'd first compare the first two letters of each word , see that they are equal and then move on to comparing the second letter of each word .
We see that ' x ' is alphabetically greater than 'n ' , and so we know how the words compare .
To gain some intuition for EQ being the identity , we can notice that if we were to cram the same letter in the same position in both words , it would n't change their alphabetical ordering .
" oix " is still alphabetically greater than and " oin " .
It 's important to note that in the Monoid instance for Ordering , x `mappend` y does n't equal y `mappend` x .
Because the first parameter is kept unless it 's EQ , LT `mappend` GT will result in LT , whereas GT `mappend` LT will result in GT :
ghci > LT `mappend` GT LT ghci > GT `mappend` LT GT ghci > mempty `mappend` LT LT ghci > mempty `mappend` GT GT
OK , so how is this monoid useful ?
Let 's say you were writing a function that takes two strings , compares their lengths , and returns an Ordering .
But if the strings are of the same length , then instead of returning EQ right away , we want to compare them alphabetically .
One way to write this would be like so :
lengthCompare :: String -> String ->
Ordering lengthCompare x y = let a = length x `compare` length y b = x `compare` y in if a == EQ then b else a
We name the result of comparing the lengths a and the result of the alphabetical comparison b and then if it turns out that the lengths were equal , we return their alphabetical ordering .
But by employing our understanding of how Ordering is a monoid , we can rewrite this function in a much simpler manner :
import Data .
Monoid lengthCompare :: String -> String ->
Ordering lengthCompare x y = ( length x `compare` length y ) `mappend` ( x `compare` y )
We can try this out :
ghci > lengthCompare " zen " " ants " LT ghci > lengthCompare " zen " " ant " GT
Remember , when we use mappend , its left parameter is always kept unless it 's EQ , in which case the right one is kept .
That 's why we put the comparison that we consider to be the first , more important criterion as the first parameter .
If we wanted to expand this function to also compare for the number of vowels and set this to be the second most important criterion for comparison , we 'd just modify it like this :
import Data .
Monoid lengthCompare :: String -> String ->
Ordering lengthCompare x y = ( length x `compare` length y ) `mappend` ( vowels x `compare` vowels y ) `mappend` ( x `compare` y ) where vowels = length .
filter ( `elem` " aeiou " )
We made a helper function , which takes a string and tells us how many vowels it has by first filtering it only for letters that are in the string " aeiou " and then applying length to that .
ghci > lengthCompare " zen " " anna " LT ghci > lengthCompare " zen " " ana " LT ghci > lengthCompare " zen " " ann " GT
Very cool .
Here , we see how in the first example the lengths are found to be different and so LT is returned , because the length of " zen " is less than the length of " anna " .
In the second example , the lengths are the same , but the second string has more vowels , so LT is returned again .
In the third example , they both have the same length and the same number of vowels , so they 're compared alphabetically and " zen " wins .
The Ordering monoid is very cool because it allows us to easily compare things by many different criteria and put those criteria in an order themselves , ranging from the most important to the least .
Maybe the monoid
Let 's take a look at the various ways that Maybe a can be made an instance of Monoid and what those instances are useful for .
One way is to treat Maybe a as a monoid only if its type parameter a is a monoid as well and then implement mappend in such a way that it uses the mappend operation of the values that are wrapped with Just .
We use Nothing as the identity , and so if one of the two values that we 're mappending is Nothing , we keep the other value .
Here 's the instance declaration :
instance Monoid a => Monoid ( Maybe a ) where mempty = Nothing Nothing `mappend` m = m m `mappend` Nothing = m Just m1 `mappend` Just m2 = Just ( m1 `mappend` m2 )
Notice the class constraint .
It says that Maybe a is an instance of Monoid only if a is an instance of Monoid .
If we mappend something with a Nothing , the result is that something .
If we mappend two Just values , the contents of the Justs get mappended and then wrapped back in a Just .
We can do this because the class constraint ensures that the type of what 's inside the Just is an instance of Monoid .
ghci >
Nothing `mappend` Just " andy " Just " andy " ghci > Just LT `mappend` Nothing Just LT ghci > Just ( Sum 3 ) `mappend` Just ( Sum 4 ) Just ( Sum {getSum = 7} )
This comes in use when you 're dealing with monoids as results of computations that may have failed .
Because of this instance , we do n't have to check if the computations have failed by seeing if they 're a Nothing or Just value ; we can just continue to treat them as normal monoids .
But what if the type of the contents of the Maybe are n't an instance of Monoid ?
Notice that in the previous instance declaration , the only case where we have to rely on the contents being monoids is when both parameters of mappend are Just values .
But if we do n't know if the contents are monoids , we can't use mappend between them , so what are we to do ?
Well , one thing we can do is to just discard the second value and keep the first one .
For this , the First a type exists and this is its definition :
newtype First a = First { get
First :: Maybe a } deriving ( Eq , Ord , Read , Show )
We take a Maybe a and we wrap it with a newtype .
The Monoid instance is as follows :
instance Monoid ( First a ) where mempty = First Nothing First ( Just x ) `mappend` _ = First ( Just x ) First Nothing `mappend` x = x
Just like we said .
mempty is just a Nothing wrapped with the First newtype constructor .
If mappend 's first parameter is a Just value , we ignore the second one .
If the first one is a Nothing , then we present the second parameter as a result , regardless of whether it's a Just or a Nothing :
ghci > get
First $ First ( Just ' a ' ) `mappend` First ( Just 'b ' )
Just ' a ' ghci > get
First $ First Nothing `mappend` First ( Just 'b ' )
Just ' b ' ghci > get
First $ First ( Just ' a ' ) `mappend` First Nothing Just 'a '
First is useful when we have a bunch of Maybe values and we just want to know if any of them is a Just .
The mconcat function comes in handy :
ghci > get
First .
mconcat . map First $ [ Nothing , Just 9 , Just 10 ] Just 9
If we want a monoid on Maybe a such that the second parameter is kept if both parameters of mappend are Just values , Data .
Monoid provides a the Last a type , which works like First a , only the last non-Nothing value is kept when mappending and using mconcat :
ghci > getLast .
mconcat . map Last $ [ Nothing , Just 9 , Just 10 ] Just 10 ghci > getLast $ Last ( Just " one " ) `mappend` Last ( Just " two " ) Just " two "
Using monoids to fold data structures
One of the more interesting ways to put monoids to work is to make them help us define folds over various data structures .
So far , we 've only done folds over lists , but lists are n't the only data structure that can be folded over .
We can define folds over almost any data structure .
Trees especially lend themselves well to folding .
Because there are so many data structures that work nicely with folds , the Foldable type class was introduced .
Much like Functor is for things that can be mapped over , Foldable is for things that can be folded up !
It can be found in Data .
Foldable and because it export functions whose names clash with the ones from the Prelude , it 's best imported qualified ( and served with basil ) :
import qualified Foldable as F
To save ourselves precious keystrokes , we 've chosen to import it qualified as F .
Alright , so what are some of the functions that this type class defines ?
Well , among them are foldr , foldl , foldr1 and foldl1 .
Huh ?
But we already know these functions , what 's so new about this ?
Let 's compare the types of Foldable 's foldr and the foldr from the Prelude to see how they differ
WASHINGTON 
More than four decades after the surgeon general declared smoking a health hazard , the Senate on Thursday cleared the final hurdle to empowering federal officials to regulate cigarettes and other forms of tobacco for the first time .
The legislation , which the White House said President Obama would sign as soon as it reached his desk , will enable the Food and Drug Administration to impose potentially strict new controls on the making and marketing of products that eventually kill half their regular users .
The House , which passed a similar bill in April , may vote on the Senate version as soon as Friday .
“ This is a historic step changing the nature of tobacco in society forever , ” said Clifford E. Douglas , the director of the University of Michigan Tobacco Research Network , which has extensively studied the health effects of smoking and was one of many groups that have long pushed for tobacco regulation .
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the new law would reduce youth smoking by 11 percent and adult smoking by 2 percent over the next decade , in addition to reductions already achieved through other actions , like higher taxes and smoke - free indoor space laws .
“ I CAN pass this exam ” , “ I am a wonderful person and will find love again ” and “ I am capable and deserve that pay rise ” are phrases that students , the broken - hearted and driven employees may repeat to themselves over and over again in the face of adversity .
Self - help books through the ages , including Norman Vincent Peale 's 1952 classic , “ The Power of Positive Thinking ” , have encouraged people with low self - esteem to make positive self - statements .
New research , however , suggests it may do more harm than good .

I am important .
I am , really
Since the 1960s psychologists have known that people are more accepting of ideas close to their own views and resistant to those that differ .
With regard to self - perception , if a person who believes they are reasonably friendly is told that they are extremely gregarious , they will probably accept the idea .
But if told they are socially aloof , the idea will most likely be met with resistance and doubt .
Wondering if the same tendencies could apply to making positive self - statements , Joanne Wood of the University of Waterloo in Canada and her colleagues designed a series of experiments .
They questioned a group of 68 men and women using long - accepted methods to measure self - esteem .
The participants were then asked to spend four minutes writing down any thoughts and feelings that were on their minds .
In the midst of this , half were randomly assigned to say to themselves “ I am a lovable person ” every time they heard a bell ring .
Immediately after the exercise , they were asked questions such as “ What is the probability that a 30 - year - old will be involved in a happy , loving romance ? ” to measure individual moods using a scoring system that ranged from a low of zero to a high of 35 .
Past studies have indicated that optimistic answers indicate happy moods .
As the researchers report in Psychological Science , those with high self - esteem who repeated “ I 'm a lovable person ” scored an average of 31 on their mood assessment compared with an average of 25 by those who did not repeat the phrase .
Among participants with low self - esteem , those making the statement scored a dismal average of 10 while those that did not managed a brighter average of 17 .
Dr Wood suggests that positive self - statements cause negative moods in people with low self - esteem because they conflict with those people 's views of themselves .
When positive self - statements strongly conflict with self - perception , she argues , there is not mere resistance but a reinforcing of self - perception .
People who view themselves as unlovable find saying that they are so unbelievable that it strengthens their own negative view rather than reversing it .
Given that many readers of self - help books that encourage positive self - statements are likely to suffer from low self - esteem , they may be worse than useless .
Dana Maltby , better known as TCB ( Twin Cities Brightest ) is a Jedi Master in the art of Light Painting photography , or Light Art Performance Photography ( L.A.P.P. ) if you will .
This light painting photographer from the Minneapolis , Minnesota can be found in the tunnels running under the twin cities on a nightly basis .
Using a handheld light source as a brush and the open shutter of a camera as a canvas he creates the most amazing light paitings .
All the photography you see here is as real as it can get and none of pictures were harmed with photoshop .
Besides being a Jedi Master in light painting photography , TCB is also a source of inspiration for the light painting community , sharing tutorials for all kinds of light painting on his website and Flickr account .
So I would say , please strap on your seatbelt and be ready for a great adventure in phtography !
We present you with light art performance photographer TCB :
Hi , I ’m Dana , and I just recently figured out that I am addicted to light painting !
But before all of that , here is a little background .
I live in St. Paul , Minnesota .
It is smack dab in the middle of America , and it ’s a pretty chill place to live .
The mighty Mississippi river runs right through the twin cities , St. Paul and Minneapolis , and because of that there are many drains and bridges to explore .
Minnesota and the twin cities were also a large grain producer up until recent years , but since then the old grain elevator buildings have become abandoned , and make for really great urban exploration missions .
Finding something new
Before I was addicted to light art , I skateboarded and snowboarded .
It was always about finding the coolest place or spot to skate at .
Finding new locations was the best feeling in the world , and doing an awesome trick there made it even better !
I ended up hurting my shoulder , so I had to cool out on the boarding for a while .
I picked up doing graffiti about 5 years ago at the ripe old age of twenty .
Not really the best time to start committing felonies on a daily basis .
I got really into graff for the last couple of years , and met a lot of cool people .
The best part about painting graffiti for me was exploring by following the river , and finding cool abandoned and forgotten slabs of concrete scattered throughout the cities .
I loved journeying into the unknown with a backpack full of beer and paint .
Finding something new was just like skateboarding , it was the best feeling ever .
I ended up getting serious with school , and graffiti ended up causing a lot of drama in my life , so I stopped pursuing it .
I had however become an urban explorer in the process , so I continued doing that to stay sane .
One day in a pitch - black tunnel , I was taking pictures , and at this point I was just documenting the expedition , and I accidentally made some light paintings by doing long exposure photographs .
The flashlights we were using to see looked like paintbrushes in space , and I soon realized that you could create a composition by considering the aperture size and shutter speed along with the location .
Flickr
A week or so later I had been to every toy store in town searching for cool light up toys , and ended up spending about twenty bucks on different stuff .
The results were so cool ; I could n’t stop thinking about it at that point .
I would be skipping class to go into the tunnels since it ’s always dark in them , even in the daytime .
I came across the group Light Junkies on Flickr.com , and saw that some people were doing some amazing things with light .
Tdub303 and PooleShooterCindi were a huge inspiration , and guided me into this unknown realm of painting with light .
I met Lapp - pro.de on Flickr also , and his photographs took this form of art to the next level .
Light art performance photography ( l.a.p.p . )
He described my work as being Light Art Performance Photography , which in essence , takes many aspects of light art and adds it all together to create a dynamic composition with a story while utilizing the location to the maximum .
By this time I had made many light tools , hula - hoops , long poles , and wheels , all with lights attached to them .
Each tool wielded it ’s own special power , and created a different effect .
My first breakthrough was when I made light spirographs using the wheel on the end of a paint roller extension pole in the depths of the tunnels .
The images that were produced seemed almost too perfect to be made from such an elementary tool .
It was just some five - dollar battery powered Christmas lights on a wheel off of a girl ’s bike I bought for ten bucks ; that ’s two wheels !
Magic
The images evoked a magical feeling , and a somewhat sci - fi vibe also .
It was at this point that I realized that Light Art Performance Photography , or LAPP , was what I was really interested in .
From that point on I was still experimenting every time I went out to shoot , but I always took careful consideration as to the camera position , the location , the white balance , the composition , and the light that was prevalent in the shot .
So now I am about to graduate college , for graphic design , but my heart belongs to light painting .
I am not worried though , because my heart knows best , and by chasing this dream and pushing myself into this unknown land , I am having the time of my life and I never want to stop . ” – Dana Maltby

I have started my China journey in Yanchi County .
Yanchi is all about sheep .
It is a major lamb producing area and home to the Tan Yang breed of sheep , whose wool is so naturally curly it looks like perfectly coiffed dreadlocks .
Yanchi is a major lamb producing area
For the Tan Yang sheep this means an early and final visit to the halal slaughterhouse in downtown Yanchi .
There is more to lament for the Tan Yang .
Here the Great Wall of China runs in a kind of jagged , sandy mound for hundreds of miles alongside the motorway .
It is a haunting sight , dotted with swallows ' nests and shepherds ' huts .
But the ground is so barren here that the government has banned sheep grazing .
So the Tan Yang have to spend most of their days in the farmyards , eating their staple diet of cornmeal and liquorice bush .
For the people of Yanchi life is hard , but for 20 years the upside has been perpetual economic growth and incremental improvement .
I want my kids to have a job like yours .
I keep telling them - do n't be like us .
Do n't live the hard life we 've lived .
Li Xiao Li
Read Paul Mason 's Idle Scrawl blog I meet Li Xiao Li as she carefully removes the skin of a Tan Yang , taking care not to get blood on her designer jeans .
" I want my kids to have a job like yours , " she tells me .
" I keep telling them - do n't be like us .
Do n't live the hard life we 've lived . "
To send her daughter to school she spends most of her monthly income , and puts the rest aside to cover health costs .
This is the big problem in China : absent a welfare state , even poor -ish Chinese people save lots of their money , or spend it on health and education .
The actual consumer economy is weak .
Escaping the propaganda
That is a problem now because the export economy has taken a massive hit - exports were 22 % down in the first quarter of this year .
China has to try and rebalance its economy towards domestic demand .
Easy for economists to say , but it would mean a revolution in the life of people like Ms Li .
It is to find out if they can do this that I am on this journey , with legendary Chinese fixer and translator , Edera Liang , and driver Wang Zhi Gang .
I am trying to dodge the usual obstacles that greet foreign journalists in China - the dinners , the rice wine , the official briefings from propaganda chiefs - and just see it as it is .
Paul Mason 's journey across China will be broadcast in two parts on Newsnight on Tuesday 16 and Wednesday 17 June 2009 at 10.30BST on BBC Two , and then available to watch on the Newsnight website .

The reclassification of cannabis from a class C to a class B drug has finally come into effect .
The government defied expert scientific and medical opinion , which opposed reclassification on the grounds that cannabis is not as harmful as other class B drugs and that its harm was not sufficient to warrant harsher penalties .
The government 's own Advisory Council of the Misuse of Drugs recommended that it should remain a class C drug .
Ignoring the expert evidence , the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , caved in to irrational , ill - informed anti-cannabis hysteria .
Making no distinction between responsible , occasional use and reckless , constant abuse , she has now reclassified all cannabis enjoyment as dangerous and harmful , and upped the maximum penalties for possession from two to five years .
This signals to the police and the courts that they should treat cannabis more harshly , on a par with demonstrably damaging banned narcotics .
Meanwhile , the most socially harmful drugs , alcohol and tobacco , remain legal and outside the scope of anti-drugs legislation .
This selective get - tough - on - drugs policy seems motivated by the government 's cynical desire to win few extra votes from Daily Mail readers .
It has little to do with any genuine or effective attempt to encourage less frequent and safer cannabis use via advice such as : " Eat it , do n't smoke it " and " Every day ?
Perhaps not good .
Save it for a special occasion . "
Millions of Britons enjoy cannabis sensibly , in moderation and without harm to themselves or others .
Tens of thousands use it to ameliorate the symptoms of diseases such as cancer , HIV and multiple sclerosis .
East Londoner Edwin Stratton is one of them .
For the last 18 months he 's been using cannabis to treat his disabling coeliac condition .
He 's found it immensely effective , reducing his pain and nausea and improving his appetite .
It has enabled him to cut his prescription medicines by half , saving the NHS a lot of money in the process .
Experiencing the medical benefits of cannabis and being of modest financial means , Stratton decided to grow his own .
Self - production not only cut his costs , it also eliminated the need for him to deal with the criminal gangs who supply cannabis ; striking a personal blow against the organised crime syndicates that dominate the drugs trade .
Also important , home growing enabled him to protect himself from the pesticides and other chemicals frequently used by cannabis cartel producers .
Unfortunately , in May 2008 , the police discovered Stratton 's home - grown during a routine investigation .
He acknowledged that he privately grew cannabis plants in his home , to combat his medical condition .
Rejecting a police caution , he chose to fight the case .
He believes that under the Human Rights
Act the denial of his right to grow and possess cannabis is an invasion of privacy and a denial of property rights .
It is also discriminatory in that this right is not denied to people who choose to brew at home the equally or more harmful drug , alcohol .
Stratton was duly charged with production of a controlled drug ( then class C ) , in contravention of section 4 ( 1 ) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 .
Stratton attended Waltham Forest magistrate 's court in October 2008 , accompanied by Darryl Bickler of the Drug Equality Alliance , acting as his " McKenzie Friend " .
He declined to plead , and instead moved to quash the indictment as an abuse of process .
The magistrate agreed to a stay of proceedings , giving Stratton leave to apply to the high court for permission for a judicial review of the decision to prosecute him .
His judicial review application is eloquent and compelling .
Stratton is backed by the Drug Equality Alliance with the support of the drug charities Release and Transform Drug Policy Foundation .
The essence of his legal defence includes four issues : the right to privacy , the protection of property rights , the unequal application of the law to controlled and non-controlled drug users and the maladministration of the Misuse of Drugs
Act – most notably the government 's failure to make drug use penalties uniformly commensurate with the harm they cause .
According to Stratton :
I am not fighting the law as it stands , but its misapplication by the government and its state agencies .
The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 is a pretty good piece of legislation , because it 's designed to evolve along evidential lines .
It explicitly provides for the relaxation of controls on drugs in accordance with scientific evidence of relative harms .
However , government and judicial policy has n't developed in line with scientific evidence , and vast swaths of the act have clearly been ignored or not understood .
Stratton was recently referred to a Whipps Cross hospital pain specialist .
After mentioning the relief cannabis provides him , the doctor offered to prescribe something similar .
He issued a prescription for Nabilone , a synthetic analogue of Delta -9 THC , which is virtually identical to the main psychoactive substance in cannabis .
It is ironic that the government forbids Stratton to use natural cannabis , but allows the NHS to prescribe him a synthetic version .
Unfortunately , Nabilone does not work for Stratton .
Moreover , if it did work , it would cost the NHS and the taxpayer approximately £ 9,000 a year .
Stratton , in contrast , can grow a year 's supply of more effective herbal cannabis for less than £ 250 – a payment he is prepared to cover himself .
Any rational cost - benefit analysis would conclude that Nabilone is medically inferior and a financial rip - off of the NHS .
Whichever way you look at it , the government 's drug policy is a mess : unfair , inconsistent , costly and ineffective .
Good luck to Edwin Stratton in his efforts to secure a rational , evidence - based , uniform , workable and humane policy that applies to all controlled and non-controlled drugs , without prejudice or discrimination .
Korea has developed a long - range anti-submarine missile which can hit an enemy submarine about 20 km away .
The " Red Shark " has a longer range and far sharper accuracy than the light torpedoes normally fired by conventional vessels or aircraft .
The Agency for Defense Development on Monday said the Defense Acquisition Program Agency developed the Red Shark at a cost of about W100 billion ( US $ 1=W1,276 ) over nine years .
Europe , Russia and the U.S. have anti-submarine missil es , but the Red Shark is only the second vertical - launch anti-submarine rocket developed in the world following the U.S. , the ADD said .
Red Sharks are 5.7 m long and 0.38 m in diameter , weigh 820 kg , and cost about W2 billion .
They will be installed in the Korean - made vertical launch system of the 5,000 t- class KDX - II and KDX - III Aegis destroyers .
Health Reform for Beginners : The Difference Between Socialized Medicine , Single - Payer Health Care , and What We'll Be Getting
I 've been meaning to write this post for some time .
The words " socialized medicine " and " single - payer health care " get thrown around with such gleeful abandon that they 've both become a bit unmoored from their actual meanings .
In the American health - care debate , they tend to refer to " whatever the Democrats are proposing . "
But that 's not what they mean .
Socialized medicine is a system in which the government owns the means of providing medicine .
Britain is an example of socialized system , as , in America , is the Veterans Health Administration .
In a socialized system , the government employs the doctors and nurses , builds and owns the hospitals , and bargains for and purchases the technology .
I have literally never heard a proposal for converting America to a socialized system of medicine .
And I know a lot of liberals .
Single - payer health care is not socialized medicine .
It 's a system in which one institution purchases all , or in reality , most , of the care .
But the payer does not own the doctors or the hospitals or the nurses or the MRI scanners .
Medicare is an example of a mostly single - payer system , as is France .
Both of these systems have private insurers to choose from , but the government is the dominant purchaser .
( As an aside here , unlike in socialized medicine , " single - payer health care " has nothing in particular to do with the government .
The state might be the single payer .
But if Aetna managed to wrest 100 percent of the health insurance market , then it would be the single payer .
The term refers to market share , not federal control . )
Socialized medicine is far outside any discussion we 're having .
Single - payer medicine has a genuine constituency but is also a vanishingly unlikely outcome .
But the promiscuous use of the terms has created a rather confused population .
" Socialized medicine " is the thing we do n't have .
In some case , it 's the thing we do n't like .
The graph atop this post comes from a poll conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health .
They found that Americans actually preferred socialized medicine to our system .
Or take this question , about our current system :
You 're reading that right .
About 30 percent of Americans think HMOs are socialized medicine .
Which implies a couple things .
First , the term " socialized medicine " has been diluted beyond all meaning .
Second , it 's no longer considered a terrifying outcome .
And third , nothing that 's this amorphous -- and actually preferred by a plurality of the population -- is likely to prove a terribly effective attack against health reform .
Socialized medicine has become such a stand - in for " not this system of medicine " that it 's begun to look good in comparison .
Meanwhile , what we 're actually going to get is not socialized medicine or single - payer health care .
It 's a hybrid system .
Private insurers , hopefully competing with a public option .
Private doctors and private hospitals .
Government regulation and subsidies .
It 's going to be complicated and messy and inefficient and hopeful and the product of a strange mix of corporate preferences and public compassion and latent populism .
It will , in other words , be a uniquely American system , and hard to describe with a single epithet .
Girls Aloud won the Brit Award for best single at this year 's ceremony
Obscene stories or free speech ?
A former civil servant who wrote an internet article imagining the kidnap and murder of the pop group Girls Aloud has been cleared of obscenity .
Darryn Walker , 35 , from South Tyneside , was charged after his blog appeared on a fantasy pornography site .
He appeared at Newcastle Crown Court on Monday but was cleared when the prosecution offered no evidence .
His defence argued that the piece was not easily accessible and could only be found in a specific internet search .
Judge Esmond Faulks formally returned a not guilty verdict to the charge of publishing an obscene article .
Mr Walker 's 12 - page blog - Girls ( Scream ) Aloud - was brought to the attention of police by the Internet Watch Foundation , an organisation for the public and IT professionals which polices potentially obscene material .
It was never his intention to frighten or intimidate the members of Girls Aloud
Tim Owen QC
He was arrested in February 2008 at his home in Mowbray Road , South Shields , by officers from the Obscene Publications Unit .
David Perry QC , prosecuting , said that the decision to prosecute under the Obscene Publications
Act was made in July 2008 .
" A crucial aspect of the reasoning that led to the instigation of these proceedings was that the article in question , which was posted on the internet , was accessible to people who were particularly vulnerable - young people who were interested in a particular pop music group .
" It was this that distinguished this case from other material available on the internet .
" The CPS concluded , with the benefit of counsel 's advice , there was a realistic prospect of conviction . "
However , a report for the defence by an information technology expert said the article could only be discovered by internet users seeking such specific material .
' Threat to freedom ' A report from a consultant psychiatrist also said it was " baseless " to suggest that reading such material could turn other people into sexual predators .
Tim Owen QC , defending Mr Walker , said : " It was never his intention to frighten or intimidate the members of Girls Aloud .
" He had written what he had described as an adult celebrity parody and was only meant to be for an audience of like - minded people .
" As soon as he was aware of the upset and fuss that had been created , he took steps himself to take the article off the website . "
He added : " This type of writing is widely available on the internet in an unregulated and uncensored form .
" In terms of its alleged obscenity , it is frankly no better or worse than other articles . "
The court heard that Mr Walker had lost his job since his arrest .
Jo Glanville , editor of the freedom of expression group Index on Censorship , said the prosecution should not have been brought in the first place .
" Since the landmark obscenity cases of the '60s and ' 70s , writers have been protected from such prosecutions and have remained free to explore the extremes of human behaviour , " she said .
" This case posed a serious threat to that freedom .
" In future , obscenity cases should be referred directly to the Director of Public Prosecutions before any prosecution is triggered . "

Finally The Original Fantasy
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Wednesday , 24th of June 2009 - 10:24 PM ]
As if there has n't been enough awesome Final Fantasy going about the interwebs since E3 , Square - Enix drops some more good news for all of the FFFreaks ( F3 from now on ) .
Not as cool as a full on remake of FFVI for the PS3 , or FFVII remake either , but today on the Japanese PSN " the game that launched a billion spin offs " was made available .
I 'm talking the original Final Fantasy .
The PSOne upgrade version at that .
Now I know this does n't mean it is coming to an english speaking PSN anytime soon , but if you look at the track record , it is pretty certain .
Or at least we can hope or download it with a Japanese PSN account .
Also download it for the price of games of comparable file size as well .
600 yen ( 6.30 USD ) for a 60 MB game of awesomeness .
Not a bad deal at all if I do say so myself .
They could have tried to charge the full cost of the game , but only went the way of a small PSN game .
How kind .
Seems like only a small matter of time before we 'll be able to have all of these great games and stories in one location .
As long as it is n't just a cock tease to everyone but the Japanese kids there .
01 of 11 The First Sauropod Ever Discovered Carnegie Museum of Natural History Apatosaurus — the dinosaur formerly known as Brontosaurus — was one of the first sauropods ever to be described , cementing its permanent place in the public imagination .
But what made Apatosaurus so special , especially compared to two other sauropods with which it shared its North American habitat , Diplodocus and Brachiosaurus ?
Discover 10 fascinating Apatosaurus facts .
02 of 11 Apatosaurus Used to Be Known as Brontosaurus Universal Pictures / Handout / Getty Images
In 1877 , the eminent paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh bestowed the name Apatosaurus on a new breed of sauropod recently discovered in the American west -- and two years later , he did the same for a second fossil specimen , which he dubbed Brontosaurus .
Much later , it was determined that these two fossils belonged to the same genus — meaning that , according to the rules of paleontology , the name Apatosaurus took precedence , even though Brontosaurus had long since become more popular with the public .
03 of 11 The Name Apatosaurus Means " Deceptive Lizard " dbrskinner / Getty Images
The name Apatosaurus ( " deceptive lizard " ) was n't inspired by the mixup between it and Brontosaurus ; rather , Othniel C. Marsh was referring to the fact that this dinosaur 's vertebrae resembled those of mosasaurs , the sleek , vicious marine reptiles that were the apex predators of the world 's oceans during the later Cretaceous period .
Sauropods and mosasaurs were both gigantic , and they were both doomed by the K/T Extinction Event , but they otherwise occupied entirely different branches of the prehistoric reptile family tree .
04 of 11 A Full - Grown Apatosaurus Could Weigh Up to 50 Tons Wikimedia Commons
As horrifyingly huge as Apatosaurus must have seemed to 19th - century dinosaur enthusiasts , it was only moderately sized by sauropod standards , measuring about 75 feet from head to tail and weighing in the neighborhood of 25 to 50 tons ( compared to lengths of well over 100 feet and weighs close to 100 tons for behemoths like Seismosaurus and Argentinosaurus ) .
Still , Apatosaurus was heavier than the contemporary Diplodocus ( although much shorter ) , and about on a par with its other fellow sauropod of late Jurassic North America , Brachiosaurus .
05 of 11 Apatosaurus Hatchlings Ran on Their Two Hind Legs Sam Noble Museum of Natural History Recently , a team of researchers in Colorado discovered the preserved footprints of a herd of Apatosaurus .
The tiniest trackmarks were left by hind ( but not front ) feet , conjuring up the image of 5 - to 10 - pound Apatosaurus hatchlings skittering on their two hind legs to keep up with the thundering herd .
If this was really the case , then it 's likely that all sauropod babies and young juveniles , and not just those of Apatosaurus , ran bipedally , the better to elude hungry predators like the contemporary Allosaurus .
06 of 11 Apatosaurus May Have Cracked its Long Tail Like a Whip Wikimedia Commons
Like most sauropods , Apatosaurus possessed an extremely long , thin tail that acted as a counterweight to its equally long neck .
To judge by the lack of characteristic trackmarks ( see previous slide ) that would have been left in the mud by a dragging tail , paleontologists believe Apatosaurus held its long tail off the ground , and it 's even possible ( though far from proven ) that this sauropod " whipped " its tail at high speeds to intimidate or even inflict flesh wounds on its meat - eating antagonists .
07 of 11 No One Knows How Apatosaurus Held its Neck Wikimedia Commons .
Paleontologists are still debating the posture and physiology of sauropods like Apatosaurus : did this dinosaur hold its neck at its fullest possible height to eat from the high branches of trees ( which would have entailed its possessing a warm - blooded metabolism , in order to have the energy to pump all those gallons of blood 30 feet into the air ) , or did it hold its neck parallel to the ground , like the hose of a gigantic vacuum cleaner , feasting on low - lying shrubs and bushes ?
The evidence is still inconclusive .
08 of 11 Apatosaurus Was Closely Related to Diplodocus JoeLena / Getty Images Apatosaurus was discovered in the same year as Diplodocus , yet another gigantic sauropod of late Jurassic North America named by Othniel C. Marsh .
These two dinosaurs were closely related , but Apatosaurus was more heavily built , with stockier legs and differently shaped vertebrae .
Oddly enough , despite the fact that it was named first , Apatosaurus is today classified as a " diplodocoid " sauropod ( the other major category are the " brachiosaurid " sauropods , named after the contemporary Brachiosaurus and characterized , among other things , by their longer front than hind legs ) .
09 of 11 Scientists Once Believed Apatosaurus Lived Underwater Charles R. Knight
The long neck of Apatosaurus , combined with its unprecedented ( at the time it was discovered ) weight , flummoxed 19th - century naturalists .
As was the case with Diplodocus and Brachiosaurus , early paleontologists tentatively proposed that Apatosaurus spent most of its time underwater , holding its neck out of the surface like a gigantic snorkel ( and perhaps looking a bit like the Loch Ness Monster ) .
It 's still possible , though , that Apatosaurus mated in the water , the natural buoyancy of which would have kept males from crushing the females !
10 of 11 Apatosaurus Was the First - Ever Cartoon Dinosaur Winsor McCay / Wikimedia Commons / Public Domain
In 1914 , Winsor McCay — best known for his comic strip Little Nemo in Slumberland — premiered Gertie the Dinosaur , a short animated film featuring a realistically hand - drawn Brontosaurus .
( Early animation entailed arduously painting individual " cels " by hand ; computer animation did n't become widespread until the late 20th century . )
Since then , Apatosaurus ( usually referred to by its more popular name ) has been featured in countless TV shows and Hollywood movies , with the odd exception of the Jurassic Park franchise and its marked preference for Brachiosaurus .
People around the world have been smoking marijuana for thousands of years while also using the hemp plant for everything from fabric and rope to ethanol fuel .
Unfortunately , somewhere along the way , a man with a bit of power and enough determination decided pot was wicked , evil and narcotic .
He moved mountains to make it illegal worldwide .
In the U.S. , the struggle continues to this day to overcome the lies and misconceptions about marijuana that the government spent billions to spread .
Between 1937 and 1947 , the government spent $ 220 million on the war against drugs .
Between 1948 and 1963 , the cost of this “ war ” on marijuana alone escalated to $ 1.5 billion .
From 1964 to 1969 the government spent $ 9 billion on the war against marijuana , a price tag that continues to rise .
First Fabric Known to Man
The hemp plant , also called cannabis or marijuana , has been used around the world for thousands of years .
Sometime around 7000 – 8000 BCE , the first fabric is believed to have been woven from dried hemp weed .
Cannabis Seeds Used as Food
Around 6000 BCE hemp seeds were used as food in China .
By 2727 BCE , the Chinese documented the use of cannabis as a medication to treat a variety of health problems .
They later grew the plant on a large scale for food and fiber .
Cannabis is Cultivated and Left as an Offering
In 1500 BCE Scythians started to cultivate cannabis for weaving cloth .
By 700 – 300 BCE the status of the plant had been elevated among Scythian tribes and cannabis seeds were left as offering in royal tombs .
“ Sacred Grass ” Named One of Five Sacred Plants in India
Cannabis is called “ Sacred Grass ” in the Hindu sacred text Arthava - Veda and named one of the five sacred plants of India .
It was used as an offering to Shiva and also as a medication in India from 1200 – 800 BCE .
Hemp Use Spreads Throughout Europe
The hemp plant was introduced into Northern Europe by the Scythians around 500 BCE
Over the next 400 years it spread throughout the subcontinent .
Cannabis Mentioned in the Jewish Talmud
Sometime around 500 – 600 CE , there was a mention of the euphoric properties on cannabis in the Jewish Talmud .
Smoking Cannabis Becomes Popular in the Middle East
Between 900 - 1000 the use of cannabis spread throughout the Arab world .
By the early 1200s , smoking marijuana had become very popular in the region .
It was popular among Muslims , who are not permitted to drink alcohol .
Marijuana Comes to the New World
In 1492 , Christopher Columbus brought Cannibis Sativa to America .
Farmers in America Required to Grow Hemp
From 1000 to 1500 , the use of marijuana spread further .
The French and British grew hemp in the colonies of Port Royal , Virginia and Plymouth .
In 1619 a law was passed in Jamestown , Virginia Colony , which required farmers to grow hemp .
Marijuana also became a major trade item between Central and South Asia during this time .
Presidential Marijuana
At Mount Vernon , George Washington grew hemp as his primary crop in 1797 .
Thomas Jefferson grew hemp as a secondary crop at Monticello .
Napoleon Bans Hemp
In 1798 , Napoleon declared a total prohibition of hemp after realizing much of the Egyptian lower class were habitual smokers of marijuana .
Medical Cannabis Sold in the U.S .
In 1840 , medicines with a cannabis base were available in U.S. pharmacies .
Hashish was available in Persian pharmacies .
U.S. Receives the Gift of Marijuana
In 1876 , the Sultan of Turkey gave marijuana to the United States as a gift .
By 1880 , Turkish smoking parlors were opened all over the northeastern U.S .
Food and Drug Administration Formed in the U.S .
In 1906 , the Pure Food and Drug Act was passed in the U.S. and the Food and Drug Administration was formed .
This was the first time drugs had any government oversight .
Ford ’s Hempmobile
In 1908 , Henry Ford made his first Model T with hemp plastic .
The car was fueled with hemp ethanol .
Cannabis Prohibition Begins in the U.S .
California passed the first state marijuana law in 1913 , but it was largely overlooked because it specifically addressed “ preparations of hemp , or loco weed . ”
Other state anti-marijuana law were passed in Utah in 1915 , in Texas in 1919 , Louisiana in 1924 and New York in 1927 .
Cannabis Prohibition in Britain
In 1928 , the recreational use of marijuana was banned in Britain .
Marijuana Ordinance Passed in El Paso
Marijuana came into the southwestern United States in the early 1900s with Mexican migrants who entered the country looking for work .
Laborers enjoyed smoking marijuana after hard days in the fields .
The local European Whites believed that marijuana gave the Mexicans “ superhuman strength ” and turned them into killers .
In 1914 in El Paso , some white men were allegedly attacked by a Mexican man who had “ gone crazy ” on supposedly “ killer weed . ”
Following the incident , the El Paso City Council passed an ordinance banning possession of marijuana .
The law was more about controlling the local Mexican populace than controlling marijuana , as the predominantly white constituency did not like the Mexicans or their customs .
Harry J. Anslinger Declares War on Marijuana
The federal government gave control of illegal drugs to the Treasury Department , which created the Federal Bureau of Narcotics .
Harry J. Anslinger , a prohibitionist , became the first commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in 1930 .
He held the position until 1962 .
Anslinger declared war on drugs and effectively shaped America ’s views about marijuana .
Marijuana Use Spreads to Major Cities
In the 1930s , bales of marijuana ( called muggles ) , tea and reefer were arriving in southern port cities such as New Orleans via West Indian sailors .
Jazz musicians travelled north and took marijuana with them , making reefer parties popular in many major cities along the way .
The Uniform State Narcotic Act
When it became too expensive for the Bureau to pursue all drug cases on its own , Anslinger tirelessly campaigned and lobbied for the passage of the Uniform State Narcotic
Act , which would require states to police drug trafficking and commit state resources for the war on drugs .
Only nine states initially agreed , so Anslinger launched a nationwide media campaign declaring marijuana causes temporary insanity .
The ads featured young people smoking marijuana , then behaving recklessly , committing crimes , killing themselves and others or dying from marijuana use .
The propaganda campaign was a success and all states signed on .
Reefer Madness
In 1936 , the propaganda film “ Reefer Madness ” was made in an attempt to scare young Americans away from using marijuana .
The film directly stated that smoking marijuana causes insanity .
In the film , a woman smokes marijuana , then laughs while a man who has smoked marijuana beats a third person to death .
Marijuana Tax Stamp Act
Anslinger ’s propaganda campaign convinced the public that marijuana was in fact a “ killer drug . ”
Hysterical voters demanded action without seeing or hearing about any scientific research about marijuana or proof of the supposed harm that comes from smoking it .
On October 2 , 1937 , without any open debate , scientific enquiry , or political objection , President Roosevelt signed the Marijuana Tax Law .
The law made it illegal to possess marijuana in the U.S. without a special tax stamp issued by the U.S. Treasury Department .
In theory , growing and selling marijuana was still legal as long as you bought the government tax stamp for $ 1.00 .
However , the Treasury Department did not issue any tax stamps for marijuana , effectively making growing , selling and possessing marijuana illegal under the Act .
First Marijuana Conviction
On the very day the Marijunana Tax Stamp Act was passed , the FBI and Denver police raided the Lexington Hotel and arrested two people : Samuel R. Caldwell and Moses Baca .
Three days later , Caldwell , a 58 year old unemployed laborer , became first person in the U.S. to be convicted of selling of marijuana without a tax stamp .
He was sentenced to four years of hard labor in Leavenworth Penitentiary .
Presiding Judge J Foster Symes , had previously stated that he considered marijuana to be the worst of all narcotics and vowed to impose harsh sentences for violations of the Marijuana Tax Act .
Caldwell was also fined $ 1,000 for the two marijuana cigarettes that were found in his possession .
Baca , who was his customer , was found guilty of possession of marijuana and was sentenced to 18 months in prison .
Both men served their full sentences .
Caldwell died a year after his release .
New York Mayor Takes a Stand Against Marijuana Prohibition
Fiorello La Guardia , the mayor of New York , spoke out against the Marijuana Tax Stamp Act , saying the majority of Americans did not want the law and it should be abolished .
He was skeptical of the government ’s claims and propaganda touting marijuana as a dangerous , evil , killer narcotic .
La Guardia commissioned a six - year study by a group of 31 impartial scientists .
After an in - depth scientific analysis , researchers concluded that marijuana does not cause violent , psychotic episodes , is not responsible for anti-social behavior , does not cause uncontrollable sexual urges and does not alter a person ’s core personality structure .
In 1944 , La Guardia ’s commission published a report of the findings , scientifically disproving all of Anslinger ’s propaganda and outlandish clams about the effects of smoking marijuana .
Once again , Anslinger used his muscle with the press to discredit the report and destroyed every copy of the report he could .
He then successfully blocked any further research by restricting the availability of marijuana .
Anslinger Targets Hollywood
Anslinger then began digging up dirt on anti-prohibitionists , and took special aim at the entertainment industry .
Hollywood buckled under the pressure and gave Anslinger personal control over movie scripts that mentioned drugs .
Any movie that Anslinger felt sent the wrong message was banned .
The Marijuana Propaganda Continues in the 1950s
In the 1950s , Anslinger used a new scare tactic by producing propaganda claiming that marijuana was a gateway drug to heroin .
Americans were concerned about a growing number of teens using heroin , so Anslinger used that concern as an opening to push his marijuana message once again .
The media circulated the myth that most heroin - addicts were led down the path to disaster by marijuana and that most marijuana users become addicted to harder drugs .
Boggs Act Increases Drug Penalties
In 1951 , Anslinger supported an amendment to the Harrison Narcotic Act , introduced by Senator Hale Boggs , that would dramatically increase mandatory drug sentences .
Boggs said that harsh sentences were needed for all drug offenses because drugs were a tool of Communist China .
Truman signed the Boggs Act .
Narcotic Control Act of 1956
On a roll , Anslinger then pushed for even tougher drug laws and got President Eisenhower on board .
The Narcotic Control
Act put marijuana in the same drug class as heroin and added more severe penalties .
A first conviction of possession of marijuana was punishable by a mandatory two to 10 years in prison .
State drug laws also toughened up .
In Missouri , a second conviction for possession of marijuana was eligible for a life sentence .
Anslinger Targets the United Nations
Propelled by his success in criminalizing marijuana and adding teeth to drug laws , Anslinger set his sights higher and went to the U.N .
In 1961 , Using the then - considerable influence of the United States , he convinced over 100 countries to consolidate their drug agreements into a single convention that would make marijuana illegal around the world .
Anslinger was honored by JFK at his retirement in 1962 .
1960s Anti-Drug Propaganda
In the 1960s , anti-drug propaganda was widely distributed with the message that smoking marijuana would not only make you lazy and irresponsible , but that you were also out of touch with reality and a threat to national security .
Dr. Leo E. Hollister , the associate chief of staff and the Palo Alto Veterans Hospital in California conducted a study of the effects of marijuana and concluded that smoking marijuana makes people happy , friendly , intoxicated and sleepy .
He found no reason to believe that smoking pot made people aggressive or led to addiction to other drugs .
Marijuana Culture is Born in the U.S .
Despite the propaganda , marijuana increased in popularity on college campuses across the country .
Students spoke out about their marijuana use and gradually changed the public ’s perception of the drug .
By 1965 , an estimated 1 million Americans had tried marijuana .
With events like Woodstock and popular groups such as the Grateful Dead , smoking marijuana became a part of pop-culture .
By 1972 , approximately 24 million Americans had tried marijuana .
Nixon ’s War on Drugs
Nixon won the election on a campaign - platform for restoring law and order in the country .
Since most criminal violations are handled by the states , he found that drug laws could allow him to be most effective .
He launched Operation Intercept .
Two thousand customs agents were deployed along the Mexican border in a military - style search and seizure mission to stop the flow of marijuana .
Virtually no marijuana was found among the 5 million people who were searched and after three weeks the operation was abandoned .
Nixon then decided to concentrate on police training to fight the war against marijuana .
Almost immediately , marijuan - related arrests and convictions increased dramatically .
Don Crowe Sentenced to 50 Years
Twenty - five year old Vietnam veteran Don Crowe was convicted of selling marijuana to an undercover cop .
It was his first offense and the amount of marijuana was under an ounce .
He was sentenced to 50 years in prison .
The Controlled Substances Act
There was a push for marijuana reform as the public began to realize that marijuana laws were not effective and that the penalties were too harsh .
A big wake - up call for many middle - class people was the fact that their own kids were the top demographic for arrests and prosecution .
At a Senate hearing on marijuana legislation in 1969 , Dr. Stanley Yolles estimated that 8 to 12 million people in the United States smoked marijuana and urged Congress to abolish mandatory minimum sentencing for drug offenses .
Congress took the advice and passed Controlled Substances
Act which eliminated mandatory minimums and reduced penalties for possession of marijuana .
The National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse Report
Nixon continued his anti-drug crusade .
He enlisted celebrities and used the media to spread the message , as well as funded a new study to identify the dangers of marijuana .
Researchers found that using marijuana did not lead to crime , and that laws were selectively enforced and police targeted people with a certain look .
They also found the cost of attempting to enforce marijuana laws far outweighed any deterrent effect of that enforcement .
In 1972 , The National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse released a report which would be the most comprehensive study on marijuana ever done .
The commission took the position that smoking marijuana in one ’s own home should not be criminalized .
Nixon threw the report in the garbage can without ever reading it .
DEA is Born
Nixon did not give up , and pushed forward with his war against marijuana .
In 1972 , all of the government ’s existing drug agencies were combined into one super - powerful agency , the Drug Enforcement Agency .
The DEA was given the authority to enter homes without knocking , use wiretaps and gather intelligence on anyone .
Marijuana Activism
In the 1970s , smoking marijuana became popular among middle - class adults , and activists revamped the movement for decriminalization .
The Reagan Administration ’s War on Drugs
In the 1980s , the Reagan administration launched its own war on drugs .
An average of one person every 38 seconds was arrested for violating marijuana laws .
Judge Francis Law Recommends Reclassifying Marijuana as a Prescription Drug
Judge Francis Law , a DEA administrative law judge , held hearings on the medical benefits of marijuana .
He found that marijuana has a clearly established medical use and recommended that it be reclassified as a prescription drug .
However , no action was taken to reclassify marijuana based on Law ’s findings .
First U.S. Medical Marijuana Law Passed
Although Canada became the first country in the world to legalize medical marijuana in 2003 , the U.S. Federal Government has been resistant to changing marijuana laws .
California passed Proposition 215 , the first U.S. medical marijuana law , in 1996 .
Today Alaska , California , Colorado , Hawaii , Maine , Maryland , Michigan , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington have passed medical marijuana laws .
Several other states are also considering legalizing medical marijuana .
U.S. Supreme Court Declines to Hear Medical Marijuana Case
On May , 18 , 2009 , the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a dispute over California ’s medical marijuana law .
Opponents of California ’s Compassionate Use
Act argue that the law undermines federal drug laws .
Last year , a California appeals court ruled that the state ’s medical marijuana law does not supersede federal drug laws .
The Fight for Reform and Medical Marijuana Continues
Currently marijuana activists are working for marijuana reform and fighting for medical marijuana laws .
The U.S. National Institute of Health spent $ 1 million on medical research to investigate the therapeutic effects of synthetic chemicals that mimic the effects of smoking marijuana .
At Temple University , research is also being done on synthetic marijuana .
Meanwhile , the U.S. government , which supposedly has no horse in the medical marijuana race , has patented medical marijuana .

NEW YORK -- Crude oil futures spent Monday under pressure after the International Energy Agency said world oil demand will fall by 2.4 million barrels a day this year .
The forecast was far weaker than the agency 's prior view .
Light , sweet crude for May delivery settled at $ 50.05 a barrel , down $ 2.19 or 4.2 % , on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Brent crude on the ICE Futures exchange settled down $ 1.92 at $ 52.14 a barrel .

The light aircraft was spotted by the three passengers in the Ford Ute , who were rendered immobile by the sight of the plane falling out of the sky while traveling in their general direction .
The Piper Cherokee hit head on , damaging the front end of the Ute and throwing the rear passenger out of the vehicle .
The plane and its two passengers were n't as lucky .
After the impact the plane erupted in flames , trapping them inside .
Fortunately for them a passerby made the brave decision to risk his own life in order to rescue the two .
They were taken to the hospital with extensive injuries , but are reported to fully recover .

The driver of the Ute , Monica Braganca , had this to say about the incident :
" I was thinking we were going to die , not one ounce of me thought I was going to survive .
It felt like in a movie .
I could n't say anything , no one was screaming .
I just thought it was the end , I 'd never be lucky enough to escape it .
The scary part was seeing the faces of the pilots looking straight at us . "
We guess that Ute really was Ford Tough . [ via TheTimes.co.za , News.com.au ]
Several employees at Feed The Children say tensions at the charity ’s Oklahoma City headquarters make it traumatic to work there since a judge reinstated ousted directors and gave four fired top executives their jobs back .
" We are in hell , ” one employee said of the Christian - based charity .
About 100 Oklahoma City employees this week signed a " no confidence ” petition asking those directors and four executives to quit .
It states conditions at the charity improved while they were gone .
" During your tenure , Feed The Children maintained an atmosphere and reputation as a brutal workplace filled with infighting , poor business decisions , employee harassment from top - down management and a ghost Board of Directors who offered no governance or oversight , ” the petition says .
It is the latest development in a legal struggle for control of the charity that pits President Larry Jones and his wife against most of the charity board ’s directors and four executives including his daughter , the general counsel .
An Oklahoma County judge overseeing the legal battle got a copy of the " no confidence ” petition in the mail Friday .
A hearing in the case is set for next week .
Jones in December had six directors removed from the charity ’s board after he found out they planned to force him to take a sabbatical .
He also had top executives fired .
Five directors sued .
District Judge Patricia Parrish in February ordered those five reinstated and threw their replacements off the board .
She later explained that her ruling also reinstated the executives .
They returned to work in April .
Employees told The Oklahoman some cry at work or go home early because of the stress .
One reinstated executive allegedly made an obscene gesture at work toward an employee .
The board at an April 16 meeting passed a motion that it " expects full cooperation from all members of management and all employees . ”
E-mails spark ire
Employees also have complained directors did not take harsher action against a reinstated executive , internal auditor George Stevens , for improper e-mails at the charity .
Stevens , who is a nonvoting director , was suspended for three days .
The subject of one Oct. 27 e-mail was PLOT TO KIDNAP OBAMA .
It showed a photo of a watermelon under a box propped up by a stick .
Another e-mail showed photos of a semi-nude female golfer .
In a statement Friday , Stevens said , " During the recent presidential campaign , I received many political e-mails and I did forward some of them on to others .
Some of these e-mails were inappropriate and in poor taste .
I realize my error in judgment . ”
He said the e-mails ’ release to The Oklahoman " violates my reasonable expectation of privacy in my employment records . ”
South Korea has accused the communist North of preparing to defy the world yet again by readying for the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile .
Satellite photos reportedly show North Korea moving a long - range missile towards its launch site on the east coast , with experts saying it could be ready for launch within a fortnight .
But over the weekend US Defence Secretary Robert Gates warned that the United States would not stand idly by as Pyongyang develops nuclear weapons .
In its latest belligerent bulletin , North Korean state TV warned the world yet again that any fresh United Nations Security Council sanctions would be met with what it called ' self - defence measures ' .
One so - called self - defence measure , the alleged intercontinental ballistic missile , could already be on its way to a launch site at Musundan - ri in the Stalinist state 's north - east .
Last week the communist North conducted a nuclear test and followed that over several days by firing short - range missiles .
At a meeting of Asian defence ministers in Singapore over the weekend , Mr Gates offered an assurance to North Korea 's jittery neighbours .
" We will not accept North Korea as a nuclear weapons state .
We will not stand idly by as North Korea builds the capability to wreak destruction on any target in the region or on us , " he said .
As Mr Gates was speaking , the first deployment of American F - 22 Raptor fighter jets was landing on Okinawa in southern Japan .
This mission was authorised before North Korea detonated its nuclear device last week , but in a phone call to Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso , US President Barack Obama said the arrival of the stealth fighters reinforced the US commitment to Japan .
Pyongyang knows that US warplanes based in Japan can be in North Korean air space within 30 minutes .
Washington knows that Pyongyang has 1.2 million fully trained troops and an arsenal of rockets pointed at Seoul and Tokyo .
For Japan , the most immediate priority is the UN Security Council finalising a new resolution with tougher sanctions on the Stalinist state .
Speaking in Singapore Japanese defence minister Yasukazu Hamada urged the Security Council to take a hard line against North Korea .
Just how hard that line will be should be known within days .
By that time it should also be known whether North Korea is readying another long - range missile for launch .
People under 50 are experiencing an alarming rise in bowel cancer , and a diet of too much meat and fast food may be to blame , cancer experts in the United States say .
Bowel cancer incidence rates have remained stable or decreased in older people for more than a decade in the US , largely due to screening tests such as colonoscopies , which are recommended for people over 50 .
An increase in red meat consumption is contributing to the rise in bowel cancer in younger people , researchers say .
However the study , published by the American Cancer Society yesterday , found incidence rates of colorectal cancer in those aged 20 to 49 increased 1.5 per cent a year in men and 1.6 per cent a year in women between 1992 and 2005 .
The biggest rise was seen in those under 30 , where rates rose by 5.2 per cent a year in men and 5.6 per cent a year in women .
In sharp contrast , rates for the over - 50s are now dropping 2.8 per cent a year in men and 2.2 per cent a year in women .

It is by no means exhaustive and I welcome any other questions you may have .
I will do my best to answer and may add them to the FAQ .
The rapid fire pace of daily life takes its toll and often fails to give us even a moment to pause , recover from , or even consider what ’s going on around us .
Our world is more frenetic , more overwhelming and more opportunity - laden than at any time before in human experience .
Modern life has become a hail storm of input , activity , connectivity , and a never ending flow of information .
Pressured situations come at us from all sides – at work , in social settings , or at home .
If we ’re to make the most of the whirlwind existence sweeping around us , then it ’s a good bet that we ’ll need some shelter from the storm from time to time .
We ca n’t stay inside forever — literally or figuratively — not unless we want to give up participating in the world and the company of our fellow human beings .
So , how do we find a moment of shelter from the storm ?
Planning Ahead
No matter what ’s going on at any given moment , there are very few conversations , occurrences or situations that would stop you from getting out of life ’s hurricane for just a few moments .
Knowing that you may need to take refuge of a sort during your day , you can prepare your “ emergency shelters ” ahead of time and assail the tempest with confidence .
As with most everything , taking the time to plan before hand will be worth hours of damage control after the fact .
Just knowing what you would want to do under stressful circumstances , planning the type of response that will serve you best , as well as mentally rehearsing situations over which you want to gain a better control will give you a tremendous advantage .
Following through on these things will greatly increase your ability to cope with stressful situations and how to get through them .
Before you get caught in a moment of stress or emotional storm , make a list of the situations or type of situation you want to handle more aptly .
Decide what the ideal response would be .
Make a list of 3 - 4 things you can do or say next time that situation comes up .
Get a friend to play the other side of the conversation or , if there ’s no one that you care to share your practice sessions with , write out or visualize the situation and your preferred responses to it .
Whether you are coping with an irritating co-worker , trying to run the obstacle course that is your teenager ’s bedroom , or even explaining to your super - controlling mother - in - law ( for the 20th time ) why you are going to bring something to the family reunion that your kids will actually eat , instead of the recipe she picked out for you to make , you can get your mental and spiritual umbrella all set up and ready to go before you step out your door .
Stepping Away From the Storms of Life
From my friend Colleen , I learned the fine art of stepping away momentarily from the storms of life .
In the middle of relating a story in which she was under a great deal of stress at work , she used a phrase that stopped me dead in my tracks .
“ I had to get away from the situation for a few moments , so I went in the back and had an invisible cup of tea . ” .
“ A what ! ? ” I interrupted , totally intrigued .
“ An invisible cup of tea , since I did n’t have time for a real one . ”
She replied in her signature calm , matter - of - fact manner .
Even if the world is not obliging enough to pause for the amount of time we ’d like to have to come up with a reply , catch our mental breath , take a vacation day , or just get organized for the next round of strum und drang brewing up over the horizon , we can build a shelter or two along the road , despite the storms go on around us .
Even if all you have is five seconds , you can pause and put up a metaphoric umbrella for yourself .
“ What on earth can be done in five seconds ? ” Someone , somewhere surely would ask .
Unless you are being cross-examined by the latest incarnation of Perry Mason , defusing a bomb , or are engaged in life - and - death level activities , you can take a step back — mentally , if not physically — from whatever is going on around you .
It ’s all too easy to be caught up in the moment and forget that you do n’t have to respond to most things in fewer than five seconds .
With five seconds you can :
Take a deep breath and think before you speak
Focus on a pre-chosen image or mantra that you associate with calm , strength , clarity , or whatever you feel you need most at the moment .
Choose to use a phrase that will place the situation on actual physical hold : “ Excuse me for a moment . ”
“ I ’m sorry ; I have to check on something . ”
Place the information stream on hold while you catch your breath .
Think of the punch line to your favorite joke .
Ground yourself by touching an item that carries meaning for you– your wedding ring , a souvenir on your desk or a good luck charm in your pocket .
With one minute you can :
Recall what your priorities for the situation are .
Step out of the room and take a brisk turn around the hall .
Pull out pictures of your loved ones and let the good memories flow .
Make a quick list of all the things for which you are grateful .
Recite a prayer or other meaningful utterance .
Imagine what your Mom or your witty roommate from college would say .
With five minutes you can :
Check your facts on the net or in the nearest reference work .
Make a quick call for moral support .
Find a window and get a dose of sunlight
Re-read a note from a loved one .
Plan what your next words will be .
Listen to your favorite song .
Step away from the situation and have an invisible cup of tea .
Final Thoughts
No matter how fast - paced life becomes , no matter how much someone wants you to do something yesterday , no matter that you just froze up like a deer in headlights — take those five seconds , that minute , or five minutes .
The world wo n’t end , and I guarantee you ’ll be much happier if you do yourself the kindness to take a moment away from the downpour .
So get ready , prep your umbrella , and smile quietly as you step out your door into the world .
You may find that you ’ve got more opportunities to use it than you realize at first and you may be surprised to at how much room you have under there to share .
How do you take shelter from the storms of life ?

I charted the NASDAQ 100 Index ( $ NDX.X ) on Friday , June 26 , 2009 when it closed at $ 1,480.20 for the week .
While I ’m still not able to get on the bull band wagon for most of the indices , the NASDAQ 100 has more appeal still .
NDX pulled back almost 6.5 % intraday after hitting a recent high a few weeks ago and has rallied from that level .
A nice round 10 % correction would ’ve made the story better , but the 6.5 % did take some risk off the table nonetheless .
I did n’t bother to draw some of the old trend lines for NDX that have broken support .
Maybe I should have because I think it ’s almost a positive to see that it has slowed down its trajectory .
That might mean its rally has legs still since it ’s following a less steep slope now .

I just read the ComputerWorld article " Are there too many desktop Linuxes ? " and once again I think the author is missing something very obvious and important .
If we are talking about Desktop Linux , we are talking about the consumer and enterprise market .
If we are talking about the consumer and enterprise market , we are talking mostly about non-technical people and not me or you ( since you are reading my blog , I do not consider you the average computer user ) .
I usually describe the consumer and enterprise market to be 99 % of the population , which I often visualize as : my mother !
For those that are already confused , my mother is non-technical and not a power user .
She uses applications and often struggles with tasks I consider basic .
But this mostly means I too have a skewed perception of computer users and basic computer skills .
( If your mother is too distracting as an example , consider you are a support engineer of a big enterprise and you are in charge of the enterprise desktop systems of the company 's management including the CEO . )
A desktop Linux system is a means to a goal , and not the goal itself for 99 % of the people .
Now the following list of facts exists and may be inherited in the consumer and enterprise markets :
Technical people have little time or patience to upgrade , maintain or provide support for the 99 % of other people .
I can do it for a selected few only ( in my spare time ) .
My mother ( or your CEO ) is only interested that her applications work reliably , she does not need the latest bleeding - edge features , nor does she want new versions of applications or a new OS every 6 months that may look or behave differently to what she is used to .
I am not interested in updating / upgrading my mom's computer whenever I pay a visit because the OS demands that from me .
I 'd rather do other things with my time .
The longer I can have my mom's computer running ( think years ) in a secure manner , the fewer worries I have .
Every intervention that can be avoided , is time I can use for something else .
Or is money saved for the company .
This means that high - maintenance , bleeding - edge Linux distributions , while very useful to the selected few , are not a nice fit for 99 % of the market because they change too often , require work to update them and change often spurs breakage , instability or behavioral change .
" If it ai n't broken , do n't fix it . " applies in the consumer and enterprise market very well ( unless maybe when you make money by fixing ) .
So , we end up dismissing all distributions that :
have less than 5 years of support ( security updates )
have a new release ( and forced upgrade path ) that is less than 3 years
update applications during the course of the lifetime with little consideration to support / stability
Which means most Linux distributions are not suitable as a Desktop Linux for the majority of the population .
So not Fedora , not Ubuntu , not OpenSUSE , not any of the other distributions except :
RHEL / CentOS
Ubuntu LTS
SLES / SLED
the Enterprise distributions .
And I have nothing against the Fedora / Ubuntu / OpenSUSE / whatnot distributions of today , they are very needed for driving progress and for fostering the Open Source community .
But please , not at the expense of the non-technical end -user .
I know that many of you have compelling reasons to like and use bleeding - edge distributions , and that is fine .
But please also consider that your requirements are not necessarily the same requirements as my mother or your CEO .
And the way you manage your own computer does not scale very well if you need to support 10 , 100 or 1000 end - user Linux desktops .
Paris Airshow Israeli developers working on a ducted - fan flying hovercar say that a full - size , turbine driven unmanned prototype will fly " within two months " .
Flight tests with a smaller electrically - driven model , they say , have validated their basic technology .
Sorry sir , your flying car is n't quite ready yet .
The Reg flying - car desk spoke today with Janina Frankel - Yoeli , marketing veep at Urban Aeronautics of Israel , at the Paris Airshow .
Urban Aeronautics prefer to call their designs " fancraft " , thereby distinguishing them from hovercraft , which can't actually fly .
" We 've solved the three basic problems of ducted - fan craft , " he says .
" Our craft are stable , they can lift heavy loads , and they can fly fast - better than 100 knots . "
Various ducted fan designs were tested for the US forces decades ago , and it was widely expected in some circles that " air jeeps " would soon supersede helicopters - and also take on many tasks that helicopters could n't tackle , such as access to and from built - up urban areas .
The old US designs were marginal in terms of performance , however , and difficult to control .
They never progressed beyond testing .
Frankel - Yoeli says it 's a different world now .
In particular , he argues that Urban Aero 's patented arrays of control vanes above and below the lift fans make the craft hugely more stable and controllable .
He demonstrated how , as the small " Panda " electrical prototype is tilted ( as by someone boarding from a windowsill four floors up , for instance , in the case of a full - size manned version ) the vanes automatically swivel to redirect the airflow .
Urban Aero say that the vanes , combined with modern fly - by - wire control electronics , will beat the stability problems that bedevilled their fancraft predecessors .
The system will also allow an Urban Aero Mule or future manned X - Hawk to manoeuvre in any direction and rotate about its vertical axis without the need to tilt its thrust discs .
" Its great advantage is in urban areas , " says Frankel - Yoeli .
" Not just for military missions .
Imagine a car accident , with both lanes of traffic blocked .
A normal ambulance can't get there .
A helicopter has no room .
But we can land on the pavement . "
The Israeli fancraft ticks a lot of flying - car boxes .
It takes off and lands vertically , hovers , and can manoeuvre about between buildings without crashing blades into them .
All that said , Urban Aero " fancraft " still are n't shaping up as flying cars just yet .
Large models capable of carrying people need to be powered by noisy gas turbines , unacceptable in residential areas .
Then , the design is dominated by the need to keep the fan discs large - enough to seriously affect the useability of the craft .
( This is why helicopters and tiltrotors have so far been the only serious vertical - takeoff craft : they can have nice big , efficient thrust discs . )
There 's also the fact that it 's pretty difficult to get mainstream aerospace and military people to take ideas like this seriously .
Bell Helicopter in the States actually decided three years ago that it would take up the job of marketing Urban Aero fancraft to the US military .
But there seems to have been little interest from the Pentagon , and the new CEO at Bell has disowned the project altogether .
But Frankel - Yoeli and his colleagues are n't giving up .
The hovering fancraft could yet be a boon to the military and perhaps the emergency services - if they can really perform as advertised .
The electric Panda seems to work , but the real test will come this summer when the turbine Mule takes to the skies . ®

This web - site is designed to give users a very general " introduction to Ethics . "
The materials offer both historical and thematic perspectives on the subject .
Key representatives of the history of ethics are presented and major ethical theories are analyzed and critiqued .
Pat I of the site relies on original sources , excerpts from Ethics in the History of Western Philosophy ( Macmillan , 1989 ) , and excerpts from the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy .
The treatment of ' ethical theories ' in Part II is often informed by the approach of Beauchamp and Childress in their Principles of Biomedical Ethics ( 5th Ed . )
And the introduction to the topics of Applied Ethics owes much to Brendan Minogue 's pedagogical use of institutional review boards in his Bioethics : A Committee Approach .
Of course , for a full appreciation of these authors � positions , a reading of their texts is required .
I make no claim to fully represent their views .
The section on " Applied Ethics " points to the use of interactive multimedia modules to simulate real world scenarios involving difficult moral choices .
Specifically recommended are the CD - ROMs A Right to Die ?
The Dax Cowart Case and The Issue of Abortion in America .
Both were produced by Carnegie Mellon 's Center for the Advancement of Applied Ethics and both were published by Routledge Electronic Titles .
GENERAL PHILOSOPHY RESOURCES : Relevant online materials from the Internet can be accessed through Episteme Links as well as the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy , the Stanford Online Encyclopedia of Philosophy , and the Routledge Online Encyclopedia of Philosophy .
Of special importance for the area of Moral Philosophy is Larry Hinman 's Ethics Updates site .

Is it only the blogs that noticed a huge spike in interest rates over the last couple of weeks ?
Stuck inside these four walls , sent inside forever ,
Band on the Run — Paul McCartney and Wing
One of the advantages of reading topic - specific blogs like the IHB is that you find out about things before they reach general public awareness .
For instance , last week , there was a sudden and dramatic rise in interest rates .
Mr. Mortgage has written extensively about this and its ramifications in posts : 5 - 28 – Potential Consequences of 5.5 % Mortgage Rates , 5 - 29 – ‘ The Day After ’ the Interest Rate Spike , 6 - 5 Beware Real Estate False Bottoms ( Link to 69 page PDF file . )
Some other bloggers have been on the case including Calculated Risk : Rising Rates : The Next Fed Meeting Will be Interesting .
For the most part , the mainstream media has not been covering this story and its important ramifications .
I had the following email exchange with a mortgage broker :
Question :
With our limited inventory , many affordable properties are seeing numerous
bids , sometimes over the ask .
Do you think this phenomenon will stop due to the
higher rates ?
Answer :
This rate Tsunami has n’t even made the news yet .
When I mean news , I mean buyers do n’t realize that their Pre-Qual letters are now worthless and payment expectations are shattered .
Realtors also have no idea what will happen when 45 % of all sales suddenly stop – meaning 1st timers will start holding back buying distressed homes .
These buyers are very rate sensitive and will sit idly by waiting for rates to improve .
Since rates wo n’t be back in the sub 4.5 % range ( 7.0 point cost today to get a 4.5 % rate ! ) only price reductions will make the sales perk back up .
This is a 30 day problem .
In other words , the fit has hit the shan and 30 days from now is when everyone will finally get a whiff of the trouble this means .
In our forums , this same broker had this to say :
Firefox 3.5 is a pretty substantial update to the popular open - source browser , and it 's just around the corner .
See what features , fixes , and clever new tools are worth getting excited about in the next big release .

UPDATE : A previous version of this list had Taskfox , an integrated version of Ubiquity , included as a Firefox 3.5 feature .
It 's still in the experimental phase , in fact , as readers pointed out , and we regret the confusion ( and false optimism ! ) .
This new list includes an additional item , and the rankings have been shifted slightly .

If you accidentally close a tab you 'd meant to keep open , Firefox 3 , at least through extensions like Tab Mix Plus , can bring it back .
Update :
To clarify , Firefox can resurrect closed tabs without Tab Mix Plus ( just hit Ctrl + Shift + T , for example ) ; the extension simply adds more fine - grained control .
If you accidentally kill a separate window full of tabs , though , you 've been pretty much out of luck .
Firefox 3.5 implements a restore feature for both tabs and windows from the History menu , which would ( hopefully ) also restore any text you 've typed into them .
9 . Forget this site
Advertisement
Tools like Private Browsing Modes and history wipers are good for what they do , but sometimes it would be great to have just one site wiped off your history — either because it 's hogging your quick address bar results , or because you 'd rather your coworker be unaware of your workday LOLcat browsing .
Firefox 3.5's history browser offers a convenient " Forget this site " option , erasing your browser 's memory of particular domains .
It does n't cover subdomains , and your network traffic and Flash memory would still hold some details , but it 's a handy tweak however you cut it .
8. Tab tearing

Google Chrome ( Update : And Safari , as our readers note ) somewhat stole the thunder out from under this feature , but it 's still a nice one : Grab a tab and drag it out a bit to create a new browser window from it .
Drag windows into tabs again , and open any tab in a new window from the right - click menu , if clicking and dragging is n't your style .
Advertisement
Firefox 3's AwesomeBar / address bar offers a speedy list of suggestions to complete whatever you 're typing .
That 's great , but that list comes from your page history , bookmarks , and tags , and can be matched by URL or name , leaving some results almost uselessly cluttered .

What good is it to bring back all the tabs you just lost to a crash if the tab that brought everything down comes back too ?
Firefox 's developers took a cue from the users and turned the session restore feature into more of a crash recovery tool , allowing users to select which tabs should come back .
If you do n't know who 's the culprit , here 's a hint :
It 's probably the one with Flash on it .

The snarky types ( i.e. my editor ) can call it " Porn Mode , " but this feature , already in a number of competing browsers , has uses beyond the prurient .
Beyond obvious situations , like gift buying and sensitive research , logging onto a friend 's browser for a quick email check or bill pay is made a lot more secure if you can get to the private mode .
Likewise , anonymizing some of your searches and cookie collection on your own machine is n't a bad idea , and a private mode can do that too .
You do n't need it all the time , but you might be glad it 's available .

Different cameras , monitors , and capture devices grab and set colors in different ways .
On the web , most colors look the same , though , because they 're filtered and optimized for quick viewing in every browser .
Firefox 3.5 introduces dynamic color profiles for each picture , meaning that whatever the graphic designer or photographer saw when they were doing their work , you 'll see it on their web page .

Months ago , Mozilla said its still - in - development JavaScript engine , TraceMonkey , was " 20 to 40 times " faster than the SpiderMonkey engine installed in Firefox 3 .
That has n't shown up in our speed tests , which themselves rely on a Mozilla - assembled testing suite , but JavaScript testing suites are often like drag races — they do n't really tell you what a browser runs like in a real daily sense , just pure timings .
Even if TraceMonkey is ultimately outpaced by Chrome and / or Safari , its innovations push the whole browser market forward and give us all a bit less load time to complain about .

If you type post office into a maps site , you probably do n't want the headquarters of the U.S. Post Office , or post office listings from two towns over .
Integrated geo-location , powered by Google 's Wi-Fi triangulation and simple IP address information , looks to know roughly where you are and help you when you 're looking for something local .
You can disable it if you 'd like , but , realistically , signing on from any IP address reveals a bit about where you are anyways .
If a good number of sites pick it up , geo-location could bring to the browser what a lot of people are already enjoying on their phone .
1. Video superpowers with HTML 5
If you 're viewing a page coded in HTML 5 with video in an open - source format like Ogg Vorbis or Theora , Firefox 3.5 treats that video like it 's just part of the page , not a separate little island of Flash content .
That means instant commenting on videos .
It could also mean offering links from inside a tutorial video that offer more details on what 's being shown — soldering tips on an iPhone repair guide would be keen .
In general , it 's just a promising step forward into a seamless melding of video and text on a future web .

Now that we 've thrown out the 10 features that are getting us jazzed for a final 3.5 release , let 's hear what you 're most looking forward to , and what remains unrequited among your Firefox desires , in the comments .
The Obama Administration argued Monday that no court , including the Supreme Court , has the authority to hear a challenge by Indiana benefit plans to the role the U.S. Treasury played in the Chrysler rescue , including the use of “ bailout ” ( TARP ) funds .
The Indiana debt holders , U.S. Solicitor General Elena Kagan wrote , simply have no right to raise that issue , thus putting it out of the reach of the courts .
The government ’s brief opposing a plea to delay the Chrysler sale can be downloaded here .
The main case at the Court is Indiana State Police Pension Trust , et al. , v. Chrysler LLC ( application 08A1096 ) .
( The other filings in the Chrysler proceeding before the Court , and this blog ’s weekend coverage , can be found at this link . )
All of the legal filings expected in the Chrysler case are now before Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , as Circuit Justice , and thus she or the full Court could now act on the three applications to postpone the sale of most of the auto company ’s assets to a new company representing a combination with Fiat , the Italian auto company .
Ginsburg or the full Court probably will act by mid-afternoon , since there is a 4 p.m. deadline set by the Second Circuit Court .
After that , the plan can go forward , unless the Supreme Court decides otherwise .
A federal bankruptcy judge and the Second Circuit have approved the deal .
The Circuit Court is expected to issue one or more opinions Monday explaining its decision .
The Supreme Court , however , does not have to wait for that in order to act .
Although arguing that the courts may not rule on the validity of Treasury ’s decision to shore up a new Chrysler company with funds from the Troubled Assets Relief Program , the Solicitor General did argue that those funds may go to a troubled auto company , and not just to banks or other regular financial institutions , and the Indiana benefit funds had contended .
“ The Treasury has determined that TARP funds may be used to purchase assets from automobile companies when necesssary to prevent those companies ’ failure or major disruption from disrupting the stability of the Nation ’s economy and financial markets . ”
Chrysler had received $ 4 billion in TARP funds before filing for bankruptcy .
The new company will receive more and , in return , the U.S. government will become a part owner of NewChrysler , the surviving company .
In arguing that the Indiana benefit funds do not have “ standing ” to challenge Treasury ’s use of “ bailout ” money to rescue Chrysler , the Solicitor General noted that the bankruptcy judge had found that those debt holders cannot show any injury to their interests from the sale deal and , even if they might experience some injury , it can not be traced to the Treasury ’s role .
The debt holders ’ “ challenge to the use of TARP funds is not properly before the Court because ( as both courts below appear to have concluded ) [ the funds ] lack standing to raise it , ” the government brief said .
The funds , it added , cannot show that four Justices will vote to hear their challenge on the TARP issue , which involves an issue of how to interpret the federal economic recovery law — an issue that neither the bankruptcy court nor the Second Circuit ruled upon because of the funds ’ lack of standing
If that is so , Kagan wrote , “ no federal court has jurisdiction to decide the merits of the challenge . ”
Moreover , she said , the law is only eight months old , and has not been interpreted by any federal court , so that , too , would indicate it is not ready for the Supreme Court ’s attention .
The Indiana debt holders “ are left with the contention that this Court should grant review because the Chrysler bankruptcy is of national importance .
As an economic matter , that is true , and blocking the transaction would undoubtedly have grave consequences , ” the brief said .
Unless the Supreme Court is prepared to grant full review of the Chrysler deal and decided it on the merits by June 15 ( a cutoff date set by Fiat ) , Kagan said , entry of a stay order “ could itself have the effect of preventing the sale from going forward . ”
Only two outcomes are now possible , the brief added .
“ Either the sale will go forward , in which case NewChrysler will be able to restart the production lines — or Chrysler will be liquidated . ”
The funds ’ attempt to block the deal would force that liquidation , “ a step whose economic consequences would be so severe that two national governments [ the U.S. and Canada ] have committed unprecedented resources to prevent it . ”
The Solicitor General did not respond directly to the stay applications by consumer groups ( 08A1099 ) and by a woman who has an asbestos tort claim pending against Chrysler ( 08A1100 ) .
Third , the Obama approach reduces the fear that impels change .
The U.S. government will own most of G.M.
It would be politically suicidal for the Democrats , or whoever is in power , to pull the plug on the company  now or ever .
Therefore , the current managers can rest assured that they never need to fear liquidation again .
There will always be federal subsidies for their own mediocrity .
Fourth , the Obama plan dilutes the company ’s focus .
Instead of thinking obsessively about profitability and quality , G.M. will also have to meet the administration ’s environmental goals .
There is no evidence G.M. is good at building the sort of small cars the administration demands .
There is no evidence that there is a large American market for these cars .
But G.M. now has to serve two masters , the market and the administration ’s policy goals .
Fifth , G.M. ’s executives and unions now have an incentive to see Washington as a prime revenue center .
Already , the union has successfully lobbied to move production centers back from overseas .
Already , the company has successfully sought to restrict the import of cars that might compete with G.M. brands .
In the years ahead , G.M. ’s management will have a strong incentive to spend time in Washington , urging the company ’s owner , the federal government , to issue laws to help it against Ford and Honda .
Sixth , the new plan will create an ever - thickening set of relationships between G.M. ’s new owners  in government , management and unions .
These thickening bonds between public and private bureaucrats will fundamentally alter the corporate culture , and not for the better .
Members of Congress are also getting more involved in the company they own , and will have their own quaint impact .
The end result is that G.M. will not become more like successful car companies .
It will become less like them .
The federal merger will not accelerate the company ’s viability .
It will impede it .
We ’ve seen this before , albeit in different context :
An overconfident government throws itself into a dysfunctional culture it does n’t really understand .
The result is quagmire .
The costs escalate .
There is no exit strategy .

India may be the globe ’s largest democracy , but a 150 - year - old rule on the books certainly appears to limit individual freedom : the one that makes same - sex sex a crime .
Now , an effort to repeal it : “ India is one of the few professed liberal democracies in the world that still has such a law .
The others are mostly Islamic or authoritarian , and even China lifted its ban in 1997 .
Successive governments have long argued that Indian society is too conservative to accept repealing Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code — under which sex ‘ against nature ’ is punishable by up to ten years in prison .
India ’s leaders have come under increasing pressure in recent years from activists who say that the law , introduced in 1860 , violates civil liberties and encourages the spread of HIV by forcing homosexuals underground .
The new Government that took power in May after the Congress Party ’s surprise election victory has indicated that it is ready to change the law , which is at present being challenged in the Delhi High Court , according to Indian media reports . ”
The continuous monitoring of Titan ’s atmosphere by the Cassini mission , which has been exploring the Saturnian system since July 2004 , is starting to reveal seasonal changes in the atmospheric circulation and shedding new light on the global climatology of the biggest moon of the ringed planet .
In a study that 's being published in this week 's issue of Nature , planetary scientists examined over 10,000 images captured by the Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer instrument onboard Cassini , taken between July 2004 and December 2007 .
The study was conducted by an international team led by Sebastien Rodriguez of the University of Nantes in France .
They spotted over 200 individual cloud activities in their data and analyzed the clouds ’ spatial distribution , temporal variance , and spectral characteristics .
Some of these individual events , including rain , have been previously reported , but the new report is the first time the global climatology of the satellite was examined with the intent of identifying seasonal changes in Titan ’s atmosphere .
It 's the sort of study that 's enabled by the vast observational data that the spacecraft has accumulated over the years .
Clouds on Titan are extremely difficult to detect , because the thick stratospheric haze layer hides everything underneath , including any weather events and surface features .
The high - altitude haze was discovered by the Voyager probes , which flew by Saturn in 1980 - 81 and were the only previous spacecraft to return close - range images of Titan before Cassini .
Since then , scientists have realized that there are a few wavelength bands in the infrared range that can peer through the thick haze layer , and the first map of the surface was made in 1994 when the Hubble Space Telescope peered through one of these so - called spectral windows .
Modeling the invisible
Even with the advances in observational techniques , the studies of Titan ’s atmospheric circulation have been largely derived from climate models prior to the arrival of Cassini , as the observational data completely lacked spatial resolution and temporal coverage .
Even with today ’s state - of - the - art technologies , almost all clouds on Titan remain undetectable from ground - or space - based telescopes .
So , scientists applied what little they knew about the moon — solar intensity , atmospheric composition , the rotation rate , and the orbital parameters — to predict the atmospheric conditions .
One of the most significant findings from these modeling efforts is that , with its day 15 times longer than on Earth , the slow rotation rate of Titan should cause its atmospheric circulation to differ radically from that of Earth .
On Earth , the solar heat received near the equator is transported poleward through a large scale circulation system called the Hadley cells , which start at the equator and extend to about the 35 degree latitudes , making for two large symmetric convection cells in each hemisphere .
On Titan , scientists predict that the slow rotation rate weakens the Coriolis effect , which limits the latitudinal extent of the Hadley circulation on Earth .
This means that , on Titan , a single Hadley cell can straddle the equator and transport the heat directly from the summer hemisphere to the winter hemisphere .
As a result , Titan is expected to have one gigantic pole - to - pole convection cell .
To date , this prediction , originally made in 1995 , has not been confirmed .
Giving models a reality check
The new study is the first to compare the observed global cloud patterns to the models ' predictions .
Right now , Titan is in late northern winter and approaching an equinox in August 2009 , when the northern hemisphere spring ( and southern autumn ) will begin ; i.e. , the summer and winter hemispheres will switch .
So , if the predicted pole - to - pole Hadley circulation actually exists on Titan , the direction of the circulation should reverse around the time of the equinoxes .
The scientists are looking for early signs of this circulation reversal in the data collected so far by Cassini .
In the new report , Rodriguez et al. show that many of the clouds observed by Cassini are consistent with the climate model predictions .
As predicted , clouds are seen where the ascending point of the Hadley circulation should be in the southern mid-latitudes .
Cumulus clouds are also observed at the south pole ( still in summer ) , where the pole - to - pole circulation should drive methane storms .
Stable clouds are found around the north polar region , where the stratospheric ethane should condense in the cold winter polar night .
On the other hand , the timing of the cloud events predicted by the models seem to be a little off .
The models indicate that the cloud activities in the southern ( summer ) hemisphere should be weakening as the equinox approaches .
Although the frequency of the southern hemisphere cloud events show hints of a decline , the south polar clouds should have completely disappeared by now according to the models ' predictions , so the observed behaviors are different from the predicted gradual decline .
The models also predict the presence of mid-latitude clouds in the northern ( winter ) hemisphere , but none are observed .
The discrepancies between predictions and observations are important clues that should improve our understanding of Titan ’s atmospheric circulation .
The authors reason that the timing of the drop in southern hemisphere cloud activity is a hint that the climate model does not yet incorporate all the seasonal heating effects the real system has .
This points us to what should be the next steps in understanding what drives the atmospheric circulation on Titan .
The absence of northern mid-latitude clouds also suggest that the pole - to - pole Hadley cell is more efficient than previously thought at transporting heat from the summer hemisphere to the winter one .
The plans for the Cassini orbiter , which is currently in its first extended - mission phase , will have it continue its mission at least past the equinox to 2010 .
After that , an extended - extended mission is currently under development , which will hopefully stretch the orbiter 's activities until the solstice in 2017 , as the spacecraft is in excellent health and plenty of propellant is left onboard to continue the mission .
With all the weather activities we are familiar with , including haze , cloud and rain , Titan makes an interesting case study for comparisons with Earth .
The basic physics revealed through studying Earth should also be applicable to Titan , and what we learn from Titan must , of course , also apply to Earth .
The continuing Cassini mission demonstrates that Titan is an excellent laboratory to challenge our understanding of the physics of climate .
The images used for this article are derived from a large animated GIF prepared by Cassini scientists that reveals the clouds and surface features of Titan as it rotates .

Interview Fri Jun 12 2009
If you 're headed to Ribfest Chicago this weekend , perhaps you 're curious about the fake meat that 's in Delicious Cafe 's vegan ribs .
Upton 's Naturals is a local business specializing in seitan .
They are making the seitan , portioning it into ribs just for Delicious , and packing it into buckets with a sauce developed by Delicious Cafe .
The ribs come ready for Delicious to grill at Ribfest Chicago .
I sat down with the owners of Upton's , Dan Staackmann and Russ Calderwood , in their factory in Skokie 's South - East Industrial District .
How did they design the seitan for the fake ribs ?
Russ :
" We have our base recipe that we use as a jumping off point whenever we launch a new product .
And then we just worked with [ Delicious Cafe ] as far as the size and texture and presentation that they wanted . "
Your correspondent : " Do you try to get the seitan to taste just like meat , or ... a little like meat ? "
Russ : " When we got started , we were not interested in the sorts of processed foods that were readily available .
And specifically , we were not interested in using the natural flavors generally associated with meat alternatives .
We were hoping to just have a great tasting product with a really good texture and use that as a vehicle for the actual spices that you would use at home to make sausage or prepare meat . "
Your correspondent : " Give me an example . "
Russ : " Well in particular , our Italian sausage .
That 's the sort of meat product in the first place where what you 're enjoying is the garlic and fennel and red pepper and oregano - and the texture . "
Your correspondent : " Would it be fair to say your product is processed or unprocessed ? "
Russ :
" The great thing about seitan is it 's exactly as processed as a loaf of bread .
It 's pretty much the exact same ingredients .
[ but ] ... the proportion of [ gluten to starch ] in the flour is much higher to give it the chewy , meat - like texture . "
A pallet of vital wheat gluten stood next to us .
Probably enough to make the ribs for Ribfest Chicago .
The festival expects fifty thousand people .
How'd Upton 's gear up to supply an event that large ?
Russ : " As far as what kind of numbers we came up with of trying to predict how much we 're going to sell , we do n't really have any idea . "
Russ chuckles .
Dan ( joking in a deadpan voice ) : " One rib per person . "
Russ : " We 're delivering 400 pounds of seitan to [ Delicious ] ... "
Your correspondent : " So how'd you come up with 400 pounds ? "
Russ ( chuckling first ) : " I pulled a rabbit out of a hat and the rabbit told me 400 .
It worked out really well , actually . "
This is the first time Upton 's is making ribs , but they have four solid years of experience making seitan for restaurants and selling retail packs in local grocery stores .
They 've recently brought on three full time employees .
How'd they get started ?
Russ : " Dan has the entrepreneurial spirit in him .
He was looking to get something going .
And we'd both been vegans and friends for a long time .
So we started experimenting .
And it worked . "
Dan : " We saw that there were n't many companies making seitan .
Especially not for food service .
So we just started experimenting and came up with the product . "
Rolls of Upton 's labels for their packages hung above a table in the distance .
The labels depict an old time looking character with a mustache .
Russ : " Neither Dan nor I wanted to take the fall to be the guy on the box .
So we invented our little character , Upton .
I 've got an old barbering book from the ' 40s , that just had page after page of the most popular mustache styles by decade starting in the mid 1800s .
So our friend John Sampson , an illustrator , he made a composite character from this barber book .
And we decided to put a different mustache on every product .
That 's our pledge .
So every time we release a new product , you 'll have a new hilarious mustache . "
So why is it called Upton's ?
Dan told me they wanted a unique name with an " old - timey " sound .
" The name is just something we liked the sound of . "
Moving games into the third dimension introduced a new challenge for game designers : player - controlled perspective , and the host of problems associated with it .
One of those problems is guiding the player ’s eye .
How can you direct them toward the next objective ?
How can you make them notice special events and clues ?
How can you ensure that they ’re facing the right direction at the right time ?
Michel McBride - Charpentier explored some of these methods in a post entitled How Designers Turn Heads .
The most naive solution is to “ simply temporarily remove camera control from the player and send it off somewhere with a script ” , a blunt method which sacrifices player immersion and denies the interactive nature of games .
A step above this is the Gears of War approach , where “ the camera can be focused on a special event at the press of a button . ”
This offers the player a simple binary choice : look at the event or ignore it .
This method is still artificial and inelegant , as it relies on a “ giant blinking controller button prompt ” to indicate that something is happening .
The best approach is to guide the player organically , catching their eye with elements that fit seamlessly into the game world .
In this school of thought , Valve is peerless .
The Half Life series is a testament to subtly managing the player ’s navigation while maintaining the illusion of a big open world .
I ’d like to explore some of the methods they use to do this , using screenshots from my recent playthrough of Half - Life 2 : Episode Two .
Flock of Birds
One of the most obvious tricks that Valve uses is having the player startle a flock of birds which fly off in the direction of a distant object of interest .
Their sudden movement captures and directs the player ’s attention .
As Michel put it , “ Birds are never just birds in Half - Life 2 . ”
For instance , near the beginning of the game , the player approaches a cliff overlooking a small abandoned factory and startles a group of crows1 .
As the birds take off , they fly toward a rooftop where the player can catch a glimpse of a Hunter robot stalking them .
This neatly foreshadows the upcoming encounter .
Getting the player to look at the birds can also be inherently useful .
Valve occasionally uses them as a proxy for the player , demonstrating the consequences of nearby danger .
Halfway through “ Under The Radar ” , the player has been tasked with taking out the Autoguns that are defending a nearby Combine bunker .
As the player crouches to enter their firing range , he / she startles a nearby crow .
2
The Autoguns swiftly target and dispatch the bird , warning the player that they must remained crouched in this area or suffer a similar fate .
Ammo & Supplies
Another method that Valve uses to draw the player ’s attention is the careful positioning of supply crates .
In many first person shooter games , unmarked crates and barrels may or may not hold health and ammo .
The player must therefore break everything in sight in order to replenish their supplies .
In Half Life 2 , however , ammo caches are clearly identified by a yellow marking .
The player will therefore consciously look out for them and navigate toward them .
For example , halfway through the Antlion den , the player spots a yellow ammo crate sitting in front of a wooden plank wall .
On approach , an Antlion Guardian breaks through the barricade and attempts to slash the player .
This prompts the Vortigaunt companion to comment on this new enemy , and once again foreshadows a future confrontation .
In another example , a shield battery can be seen next to a fallen ally at the end of a dark hallway .
This encourages the player to investigate the corridor .
At the end of the passage , the player finds a hole in the floor .
The presence of additional health and shield supplies at the bottom indicates that the player should jump in and explore it .
Like breadcrumbs , the path through the following underground tunnel is also marked by scattered supplies .
By using supply caches as navigational tools , Valve provides game world incentives for staying on the right path .
Furthermore , since they disappear after being picked up , ammo and health provide one - directional guidance .
There ’s little chance of the player inadvertently following the chain of supplies backwards .
Barnacles
Barnacles are passive ceiling - dwelling enemies .
They drop down a long sticky tongue that latches on to anything it touches , pulling up prey to their razor - sharp mouth .
They ’re used in many creative ways in Half Life ‘s level design , including inciting the player to look straight up .
For instance , toward the end of “ This Vortal Coil ” , the player walks into a cavern where a Barnacle ’s long tongue is hanging down .
The player looks upwards to kill the enemy , only to discover a web cache with health and ammo embedded in the ceiling .
Had the Barnacle not directed the player ’s attention , the concealed supplies would likely have gone completely unnoticed .
Graffiti
Finally , Valve will occasionally make use of suggestive graffiti to lead the player ’s eye .
This approach is a bit lacking in subtlety ; why would anyone tag a wall with lines and arrows ?
Fortunately , it ’s a technique that ’s used sparingly .
The shed that houses the Autoguns features some suspicious markings , possibly tagged by someone named “ Mooee ” ?
3
Turning the corner , the player finds a Zombine hammering on the back door .
This communicates that the door is locked , and that the player should seek an alternate entrance .
Valve subtly guides the player ’s attention toward significant events and objects by using elements naturally found in the game world .
This allows the player to retain control of their perspective without getting lost or confused , and contributes to an overall immersive experience .
Rooftop solar panel installation is often a time - consuming and complicated process , but Armageddon Energy ’s new prefab panels are practically roof - ready when they come out of the box .
A solar “ clover ” –enough to provide 400 watts of power–is made up of three 10 to 12 pound silicon hexagonal panels , a triangular frame and a micro-inverter .
The panels can be easily connected with a series of uncomplicated tab and slots .
Then all that ’s left is for a professional , or mechanically - inclined homeowner , to secure the clovers to the roof , angle them towards the sun , and plug them into the home power system .
According to Armageddon , the process only takes a few minutes .
Armageddon ’s solar panels are significantly lighter than traditional 40 - pound silicon - panels , mainly because the solar cells are coated in Teflon instead of glass .
At $ 6 per watt , the panels produce power cheaply , too – that ’s $ 1 per watt less than conventional systems .
Armageddon recently completed solar panel prototypes and is currently working on a beta round .
The company expects commercial production to begin in about a year .
But by the time Armageddon ’s panels make it to market , they ’ll have some competition in the prefab arena .
Veranda Solar is working on a panel design that requires only a screwdriver and a standard home outlet .
Can IKEA - branded DIY panels be far behind ?

“ Can you do a diatribe on dry - clean - only labels ? ” asked my editor friend , Tam , citing the numerous times she threw caution to the wind and hand washed a garment despite the dry - clean - only instructions .
Yes , Tam , we can do that .
We at EcoSalon are here to please the frugal green crowd looking for ways to avoid high cleaning costs , as well as the toxic detergents regularly used by conventional cleaning companies .
For some answers , I turned to Karl Huie of Eco Dry Cleaners in the San Francisco Bay Area which goes by the motto :
“ We are not business people capitalizing on the green movement , we are an established dry cleaner changing an industry . ”
Huie won the 2009 Francine Levien Activist award , which recognized him for taking a leadership role in promoting the health of the community .
Huie ’s parents first opened a cleaners in 1969 which he and other family members converted into an eco company in 2007 with stores in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of the city and across the Bay in Sausalito , Calif .
( Marin ’s first and only certified green cleaners ) .
The Pacific Heights Cleaners is seen as a demonstration site for a statewide program .
They are what ’s considered a wet cleaners , which means they use a water - based solution made of natural soaps and conditioners ; and Carbon Dioxide ( CO2 ) Cleaning , which uses compressed liquid CO2 with detergents .
In other words , they really know how to handle wet clothes , which according to Huie , is the criteria for cleaning your own garments without professional help .
Luanne :
Which fabrics are safest for DIY cleaning at home ?
Karl : I think polyester and nylon are probably the safest , including recycled polyester from PET bottles , because the plastic in it will hold everything together .
Bamboo is an organic product that cleans very nicely and is easily accessible if handled correctly , but you have to be careful not to put too much agitation to the rayon because that will cause it to break or get fuzzy .
Luanne :
What about cotton fabrics ?
You would think you could clean those yourself .
Karl :
The risk is shrinkage .
That can happen with leather , too , when people try to clean it themselves .
The other day a customer brought in a leather jacket they shrunk wanting to know if I could stretch it back out .
I also get customers bringing in cotton clothes with stains they tried to remove .
They bring them in still wet in plastic bags .
You have to have some experience with material and know how to handle it when it is wet .
Luanne : I ’m always surprised when I hear friends wash their own sweaters .
I ’m always afraid the texture will get ruined .
Karl : Generally , silks and cashmeres are not easy to handle .
It does n’t so much have to do with getting them wet but the pH balance of the water and the detergent you use .
The wrong balance can alter and shrink the wool and strip off oils that can cause the texture to change .
Luanne : I never go near any garments with hand beading or special stones but people question why they ca n’t be hand washed with care .
What ’s the best thing to do if you are n’t sure ?
Karl :
Any time not sure how to handle something it is best go get advice from a pro .
If you are a regular customer of mine I ’m happy to tell you how to take care of it .
All the time people bring in items for me to fix after the damage is done .
For some great tips on hand washing or dealing with stains , such as salad dressing spills or chocolate messes , you can go to Karl ’s blog , Your Green Dry Cleaner .
On the site is a section about cleaning items yourself .
Karl advises :
“ Just because something is washable does n’t mean that ’s the best way to handle it .
If you ’ve got good quality jeans , sweaters , linens , bedding , etc. you want to protect them .
Dry cleaning your fine things extends their longevity , keeps color from fading and prevents shrinkage .
Plus you get a professional ’s skills in stain removal .
Talk to your dry cleaner to determine the best way to protect and preserve all your fine things . ”

Take - Two ’s latest intellectual property and PlayStation 3 exclusive , Agent , made a brief appearance at the Sony Press Conference .
But nothing new has come out about it besides its promise of being an “ ultimate action ” title .
In another interview with Ben Feder of Rockstar Games , the CEO of Take - Two sets the record straight on media comparisons between Grand Theft Auto and Agent .
When asked about a comparison between this new I.P. and Rockstar ’s previous Houser brothers production , GTA IV , Feder had this to say :
“ It ’s a completely different storyline , there is completely different character development .
It ’s a game about espionage , set in the 1970s .
GTA is obviously more about an urban experience , a typically rags to riches experience .
Very , very different storylines , very different character development .
It ’s going to be very fresh for gamers . ”
Being a project by the Houser brothers , the original founders of Rockstar Games and the creators of the GTA series , this title is expected to be a blockbuster hit with the developers even saying that they ’re expecting the PS3 to do for Agent what the PS2 did for GTA .

Do n't mess with Texas , especially if you 're a blogger on somebody 's bad side .
Houston - based blogger Lyndal Harrington was jailed last week for failing to turn over her computer as part of a defamation case involving the late Anna Nicole Smith .
The 53 - year - old grandmother claimed that her house was broken into and her computer was stolen after the court had subpoenaed it for evidence .
US District Judge Tony Lindsay did n't buy the story , however , and jailed her for contempt .
Anna Nicole 's mother , Virgie Arthur , first sued Harrington and a number of others after Harrington wrote blog posts at Rose Speaks , essentially claiming that Arthur had married her stepbrother and abused Smith when she was younger .
Others named in the suit include three other bloggers , Howard Stern , CBS , and the father of Smith 's daughter , Larry Birkhead .
Supposedly , the group conspired to defame Arthur so that she would n't get custody of Smith 's daughter ( who , coincidentally , may inherit almost $ 100 million — we 're sure that has nothing to do with it , though ) .
As part of the case , Harrington was ordered to turn over her computer for evidence , but she told the court she was unable to do so due to its being stolen .
A police officer testified to the court that he believed the theft was staged , leading Judge Lindsay to call Harrington a liar and hold her in contempt of court .
She was jailed the Friday before Memorial Day weekend for four days and ordered to produce the computer by July 2 — or else .
The problem ?
Harrington says she still does n't have the computer .
" I ca n’t turn over something I do n’t have , " she told the Houston Chronicle .
Despite all this , Harrington insists that she did nothing more than voice her opinion online and that she did not conspire with anyone .
" I got into this because my business had fallen apart in this economy and it was something to do , " Harrington told AFP .
" I developed a lot of friendships with women who are retired or ill at home . "
Bloggers have increasingly found themselves in hot water for voicing their opinions over the past few years — last year , the University of Washington released a report saying that the number of blogger arrests around the world had tripled since 2006 .
Media Blogger Association president Robert
Cox seems to agree with this general trend , telling the Chronicle that lawsuits against bloggers have more than doubled every year for the past five years .
" Bloggers have a tendency to believe myths — like that they are judgment - proof , " he said .
As for Harrington , things are n't looking good — she says she can no longer pay for a lawyer to represent her , and clearly the judge in this case is n't showing any sympathy .
If she does n't have a computer to hand over come July 2 , Harrington faces being thrown in jail again , and for who knows how long .

Taliban presence , in the Islamabad region .
Information on Taliban presence obtained from open source and derived by The Long War Journal based on the presence of Taliban shadow governments , levels of fighting , and reports from the region .
Map created by Bill Raymond for The Long War Journal .
Last updated : April 24 , 2009 .
As the fighting between the Pakistani military and the Taliban heats up in the war - torn district of Swat , the Taliban has moved a small force eastward into the district of Battagram .
More than 150 Taliban fighters advanced into the northern district on May 14 , linked up with local supporters , and attacked a police checkpoint in Batta Mori .
The Taliban force quickly captured the four policemen on duty , took control of the checkpoint , and seized the policemen ’s rifles and ammunition .
The Taliban then threatened to torture and behead the policemen , according to a report in The News .
The police were released after they promised to quit their jobs .
The Taliban then torched the checkpoint .
The checkpoint was established to block a Taliban advance into the district after fighting broke out in the neighboring districts of Shangla and Buner , as well as in nearby Swat and Dir .
Unnamed Pakistani sources close to President Zardari claimed the Army was moving six brigades of troops from the border with India to help halt the Taliban movement from the combat zone .
But President Zardari himself contradicted these reports and said there were no more troops available for the fighting in Swat .
General Pervez Kiyani , the Chief of Army Staff , confirmed Zardari ’s statement when he told parliament that no troops would be moved from the Indian border despite guarantees by the international community that India would not attack Pakistan .
US military and intelligence officials said the Taliban attack in Battagram highlights the disorganization and lack of planning behind the Swat operation .
“ Clearly the military launched the Swat operation due to international pressure a need to show progress against the Taliban as President Zardari visited the US , and not out fear of the Taliban ’s advance , ” a US intelligence official told The Long War Journal .
“ If they were serious , they would have deployed the forces to block any potential Taliban retreat or redeployment prior to kicking off the operation , ” the official continued .
“ Instead they talked of moving forces after the fighting began , but then again we ’re not even convinced they are moving significant forces . ”
Other officials said the Battagram incident shows the military is n’t serious about the operation .
“ They put four police officers at an outpost when its well known the Taliban are attacking in large formations ? , ” a military officer who is tracking the situation in Pakistan said in disbelief .
“ Have they been paying attention to what has happened in their own country over the past few years ? ”
The Taliban have expanded eastward from Swat since the government agreed to a peace agreement with the Taliban that would impose an end to the fighting and impose sharia , or Islamic law , last February .
Hundreds of Taliban fighters poured into Buner and Shangla and took over the districts , while advance parties have moved into Haripur and Mansehra , just on the outskirts of Islamabad .
Unconfirmed reports indicate the Taliban have established a presence in Swabi as well .
Meanwhile , the Pakistani military said it is advancing toward the main town of Mingora in Swat , where the Taliban are said to have dug in for a siege .
Between 100,000 and 200,000 civilians are said to be trapped in Mingora .
Previously the military claimed it had surrounded Mingora .
The Pakistani military currently has an estimated 15,000 troops in Swat , while the Taliban forces are numbered at between 5,000 to 7,000 fighters .
The military claims that more than 1,000 Taliban fighters have been killed since the fighting began in late April , but US officials are highly skeptical of these reports .
Today , the military claimed 47 Taliban fighters were killed during fighting over the past 24 hours .

Police have withdrawn charges against a man who was found driving a fake pope- mobile around Sydney .
The car was built as a protest against the Pope 's visit and World Youth Day in July last year .
Police charged the driver , Ian Bryce , for distracting motorists and ordered him to take the car off the road .
Mr Bryce says the decision is a victory for free speech .
" I was setting out to inform , " he said .
" The purpose of the pope- mobile was the draw the media attention and the public 's attention to the false claims and the very bad actions of the Pope and the Church in coming here for World Youth Day , which I believe is in effect a latter day crusade . "
Mr Bryce says he had a barrister and solicitor from the NSW Council of Civil Liberties , which he believes persuaded the police to drop the charges .
" It was against the Pope 's claims to have supernatural authority , and all the harm he 's doing in the world in banning condoms and trying to avoid family planning , " he said .
" And now he 's said that gays are an equal threat to mankind as climate change , and I can't for the life of me see what harm they 're doing anyone . "
Mr Bryce says the charge that was dropped was one related to his vehicle being an annoyance to other motorists .
He says he was trying to aggitate attention about World Youth Day and , when asked if he was an annoyance , he replied , " I hope so , I think the Pope is a bigger annoyance . "
But he says he was not trying to annoy other motorists .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A U.S. government panel listed 13 countries Friday as " egregious " violators of religious freedom .
Homeless Pakistani Christians protest last month in Islamabad for protection of Christian minorities .
The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom 's annual report named Myanmar , North Korea , Eritrea , Iran , Iraq , Nigeria , Pakistan , China , Saudi Arabia , Sudan , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , and Vietnam .
It recommended that the Obama administration designate them as " countries of particular concern " or CPC .
The group has issued a watch list that includes Afghanistan , Belarus , Cuba , Egypt , Indonesia , Laos , Russia , Somalia , Tajikistan , Turkey , and Venezuela , countries that do n't rise to the level of a CPC but need to be monitored .
" Unfolding events in Pakistan make clear the relevance of this theme to the 2009 Annual Report .
At the time of writing , emboldened Taliban - associated extremists had advanced to within 60 miles of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad , " the report said .
" In the areas they already control , these groups are imposing draconian restrictions on human rights and religious freedom and engaging in brutal acts against individuals , particularly women and local police , who refused to accede to their repressive policies . "
The federal commission is bipartisan , and its commissioners are appointed by the president and members of Congress .
A CPC designation gives Secretary of State Hillary Clinton " a range of specific policy options to address serious violations of religious freedom . "
It requires the secretary " to enter into direct consultations with a government to find ways to bring about improvements in the respect for religious freedom . "
The report covers the period May 2008 through April .
The commission was created by the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 .
" While sanctions are a possible policy option , the secretary may decide to develop a binding agreement with the CPC government on specific actions that it will take to end the violations that gave rise to the designation or take a commensurate action , " the commission said .
" The secretary may determine that pre-existing sanctions are adequate or waive the requirement of taking action in furtherance of the Act . "
All About Hillary Clinton • The Taliban
Rockstar has built plenty of open worlds in the past , from the expansive , breathtaking cityscapes of its Grand Theft Auto series to the modest but charming schoolyards of Bully , but never has it attempted anything quite like Red Dead Redemption .
There are n't any city streets crammed with cars or impenetrable clusters of urban sprawl in this game .
Instead , you 'll be facing the enormity of the American and Mexican wild near the beginning of the 20th Century , and Rockstar 's got some interesting ideas about how to fill that virtual space to make it as engaging and entertaining as possible .
<b>More+space,+more+wilderness,+and+lots+of+wildlife.</b>
see deal Red Dead Redemption : Game of the Year Edition - PlayStation 3 $ 19.99 on Gamestop
< b>A+new+story,+a+new+main+character .</b>
We already brought you the basics of Rockstar 's next big game , and now it 's time for an information overload .
In addition to our hands - off demonstration we were given , we got the rare opportunity to sit down with creative VP and co-founder of Rockstar Dan Houser , who 's driving a lot of the production on this unique open - world Western .
The marathon interview session was so long we had to break it into two parts , so do n't forget to check back next week for more .
Notions for building Redemption were whirring around even before Rockstar acquired the partially - built bits of first game , Red Dead Revolver , from Capcom .
So with Revolver , Rockstar wound up polishing and completing the product , but the core was n't what Houser termed a " Rockstar design . "
" It did n't fundamentally play like a Rockstar game , " he said .
For Redemption , the company had more freedom to maneuver since it was n't tied to an existing design .
" We still kept the best mechanics we felt from the first , but built … when we really go to town , the kind of games we really like to make .
" Work on the game is being done by Rockstar 's San Diego studio , members of the core Grand Theft Auto team and folks from Rockstar Leeds .
" We've had the current Rockstar setup since early 2003 with roughly the same studios we 've got now .
We 've added a few since then and we finally in the last year or so got it working in an amazingly integrated way …
It 's a game that on the one hand has got a very talented team working on it , and on another got a lot of our very best experts helping guide them and making sure that we use the expertise we 've got as a company on other , similar open world games from a tech and design standpoint to make as few mistakes as possible .
"
The eventual decision to move forward into production on Redemption had a lot to do with the emerging technology at the dawning of the current console generation .
" We were just starting to get wind of dev kits and the ideas about what would become the 360 , what would become the PS3 , we were beginning to get wind of some of the specs on that and thinking about things we'd want to do on the new hardware .
Obviously one of the things that we decided we would love to do is a game where countryside was rendered beautifully , because that was very difficult on a PS2 to make these big , open environments that look fantastic .
We 'd done it in a couple of different games , but we 'd never made a game that was to the countryside as GTA was to the city .
" During the beginning stages of production , Rockstar had to decide which elements from Revolver fit in with the drastically changed structure of the game world in Redemption .
" We loved the mechanic of Deadeye and thought it was executed very nicely for the time … so we wanted to keep that and keep the Wild West theme , but beyond that I do n't think there 's much that 's being kept .
I think the way we came to see Read Dead Revolver as being about the kind of myths and iconic images of the Old West , the cowboy with the scar on his face , the Indian , or the iconic set pieces put together in a somewhat linking story but it was really about trying to show off these very iconic myths about the Old West .
Then what we wanted to do with Red Dead Redemption Red Dead Redemption features a new character , John Marston , who players will control throughout the campaign .
" He 's a reformed bank robber and member of an outlaw gang who left that world and started to raise his family in more orthodox surroundings , then gets sucked back into that world by forces outside of his control to go and look for a character who used to be in a gang with him out in a different part of the world he does n't know .
As you play through the game , you start to uncover more about his backstory and his family life and these characters that he 's looking for and how their relationships are entwined and what went down between them .
I can't give you too much more without giving away major plot spoilers , but the setup for him is he 's a guy who tried and for a few years succeeded in changing his life around and is coming to see that that is impossible .
"
As Marston moves out into the world , he 'll travel around a vast wilderness set in the southern United States and Northern sections of Mexico around the turn of the 20th Century .
" There 's three linked bits of map .
You start in what we 're calling the Frontier area and these are all counties or states or regions … meant to be one of the last wild patches still being brought under the yolk of modern America .
Telegraph poles are everywhere , people are starting to play around with big telephones in their offices , but on the other hand people have hardly ever seen any other form of modernization .
The trains have been there for a while , but it 's still pretty primitive , and still pretty lawless , and still has a Marshall rather than a police force …
Then you get sent to Mexico to a province that is on the point of civil war .
You get to see some of the characters there including the local , somewhat overly zealous political leaders and there 'll be rebellious leaders and some other people hiding out south of the border from life in America .
Then you eventually end up back in the Northeastern part of the map which is a contrast geographically with the other two which are different styles of more desert and scrub , and this is much more verdant with pine trees and hills and mountains in there and also a bigger town which is a lot more modern … so you end the map with a lot more of the modern world in your face .
"
The game world Rockstar is constructing is supposed to be massive , in a way that could be one of the largest worlds the company has yet created .
Achieving this kind of scale was of critical importance for the type of game the company wanted Redemption to be .
" The sense of scale , and the sense of riding across these big areas and exploring these weird corners of the map , that is part of the experience , just as much as having the shootouts and part of the story and adventure .
The act of seeing these beautiful views and discovering them for yourself and feeling like it 's enormous and I can go over there and see what 's up that hill and see for miles in the distance , that is part of the beauty and fun of the game . "
Zeev Suraski is one of many open source success stories and now oversees the development of PHP
Zend is one of many open source success stories .
Following a model that 's proved strong with MySQL and Subversion , it provides support and commercial software that sits alongside mainstream PHP use , targeting enterprise customers who need high - reliability , high - scalability web app servers .
The company has announced software called Zend Server , an all - in - one bundle for running PHP applications on between one and three servers .
It includes a highspeed code cache , which makes nearly every PHP run faster – sometimes by a factor of 10 .
It also monitors all the PHP scripts running across your servers , providing feedback on where things are running slowly and where errors occur .
Now , for the first time , Zend is making a cut - down version of its enterprise software available for free – although that 's freeware rather than free software .
In Zend Server Community Edition ( CE ) you get the same high - performance code execution and administration front - end , but you do n't get the support or the hot fixes when PHP updates are issued .
In short , you 're on your own , but at least you get the power features , which can easily save expensive hardware upgrades .
We talked to Zeev Suraski about how Zend Server CE relates to its non-free counterpart and just what 's taking the dev team so long in producing PHP 6 …
Linux Format : How does Zend Server fit into your product range alongside the existing Zend Platform software , which is also for enterprise server use ?
Zeev Suraski : Initially , we 're going to have both products side - by - side , with Zend Server geared towards single - server solutions or up to two or three servers , and Zend Platform geared towards larger clusters .
We decided to roll out the Zend Server strategy gradually , so in the future we do plan to have the clustering support added to Server and [… to add ] things that exist in Zend Platform – as well as new features .
LXF : So your plan , then , is not to take features from Server and put them into Platform , but to take features from Platform and put them into Server ?
ZS : Yes , but beyond the features we 're taking from Platform we 're also working on the UI and usability , so it 's not that you 're going to see exactly the same features [ … ] dropped into a clustered version of Zend Server in the future .
You 're going to see revised versions of them ; in some cases higher performance and in some cases just brand - new features .
LXF : One of the key features of Zend Server is that it's an all - in - one solution , with software coming configured to work in an optimised way .
But it also comes with MySQL and Apache .
Do people really need that ?
ZS : That depends on what operating system you 're installing it on .
If you install it on a Linux machine that has Apache installed , which I think probably close to 100 per cent of [ people ] do , then it 's going to use the operating system 's native Apache without installing a new one .
If you do n't , then you have the option of installing Apache through Zend Server and it's going to work out of the box .
LXF : Can you use the distro's built - in PHP ?
ZS : No .
You have to use the Zend Server PHP .
If a user asks us this question , then the answer is going to be " no " .
From a technical perspective , you should be able to – if you really wanted to hack around and get the various components that we ship together with Zend Server to work with a different PHP – as long as it's from the same family ( in this case PHP 5.2 ) but it's not something that you 're supposed to do and it's not something that we 're going to support .
LXF : Zend Server 's monitoring agent automatically tracks when things go wrong with a script , database connection or another PHP - related problem – it saves the app state so it can be retrieved and stepped through later .
Is there much overhead for that ?
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - North Korea said on Saturday it would start a uranium enrichment program and weaponize all its plutonium in response to fresh U.N. sanctions , which the United States said it would work vigorously to enforce .
Pyongyang also threatened military action if Washington and its allies tried to isolate it .
The U.N. Security Council approved a resolution on Friday that banned all weapons exports from North Korea and most arms imports into the country .
It authorized U.N. member states to inspect North Korean sea , air and land cargo , requiring them to seize and destroy shipped goods that violate the sanctions .
On Saturday , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said North Korea ’s “ continuing provocative actions are deeply regrettable .
“ They have now been denounced by everyone and have become further isolated , ” Clinton said during a news conference with her Canadian counterpart in Niagara Falls , Canada .
“ This was a tremendous statement on behalf of the world community that North Korea ’s pursuit of nuclear weapons and the capacity to deliver those weapons through missiles is not going to be accepted by the neighbors as well as the greater international community , ” Clinton said of the U.N. resolution .
KCNA news agency quoted an unnamed North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying in a statement , “ We ’ll take firm military action if the United States and its allies try to isolate us .
North Korea would start a program to enrich uranium for a light - water reactor , he said .
Experts said North Korea lacks the technology and resources to build such a costly reactor but may use the program as cover to enrich uranium for weapons .
North Korea would “ weaponize all plutonium and we ’ve reprocessed more than one - third of our spent nuclear fuel rods , ” the spokesman said
Clinton said the United States would work with other nations to enforce the U.N. resolution “ in a vigorous way to send a clear message that we intend to do all we can to prevent continued proliferation by the North Koreans . ”
Clinton said there is “ still an open opportunity ” for North Korea to return to six - party nuclear disarmament talks with the two Koreas , the United States , Russia , Japan and China .
SQUEEZE CONCESSIONS
North Korea has raised tensions in the region in the past months by test - firing missiles , restarting a plant to produce arms - grade plutonium and holding a May 25 nuclear test , which put it closer to having a working nuclear bomb .

North Korea also this month sentenced two U.S. journalists , Laura Ling and Euna Lee , to 12 years hard labor for “ grave crimes , ” saying they illegally entered the country .
Clinton had appealed for the release of the two women on humanitarian grounds .
The impoverished country for years has used its military threat to squeeze concessions out of regional powers willing to pay Pyongyang for taking steps that decrease regional risks .
In Lecce , Italy , finance ministers of the Group of Eight wealthy countries said they were “ committed to the effective and timely implementation of financial measures against North Korea ” as set out in the U.N. resolution .
Slideshow ( 9 images )
North Korea responded to the U.N. punishment for an April rocket launch , widely seen as a disguised long - range missile test , by saying it had restarted a plant that separates plutonium from spent fuel rods and threatening to test fire an intercontinental ballistic missile .
North Korea ’s Soviet - era Yongbyon nuclear plant was being taken apart under a now - stalled disarmament - for - aid deal among Pyongyang and five regional powers .
The spent fuel rods cooling at Yongbyon can produce up to one more bomb ’s worth of fissile material , experts said .
The United States has long suspected North Korea , which has ample supplies of natural uranium , of having a program to enrich uranium for weapons , which would give it a second path toward producing atomic weapons .
Studies have shown that U.N. sanctions imposed on North Korea for missile testing and its only prior nuclear test in 2006 had almost no impact , while its meager trade actually increased due to lax enforcement of those measures .
“ The success of financial sanctions depends heavily on how far China and the United States are willing to go to pressure North Korea , ” said Jeong Hyung - gon , a research fellow at the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy .
The isolated country ’s $ 2 billion annual trade with neighboring China , equal to about 10 percent of North Korea ’s annual GDP , is its most important economic relationship .
Beijing has wanted to avoid any measures that could cause North Korea ’s economy to collapse and lead to chaos on its border .
Interior design does not have to be extremely costly .
Many designers are hired because of their ability to find and create reasonably priced solutions for a given space .
1. Salvage furniture you already own .
The most important thing is to salvage furniture you already have if possible .
If you do n't mind the shape of your sofa buy a slip cover for it or have one custom made .
A slip covers are great because you can remove them and wash them and they also cost far less than a new piece of furniture .
Slip covers make it affordable to update the look of your space more often .
Make sure the slip cover is machine washable and do not put it in the dryer .
Even if the fabric does n't shrink the cotton thread can and you will never be able to get the slip cover back on .
2. Update your tables .
Try and salvage your coffee tables , end tables , and dining tables .
You can revamp their look in a variety of ways .
You can take them in to a furniture restoring shop and have an antiqued paint finish applied to them .
You can also find industrial painting facilities that can spray paint them with a high gloss finish .
Another option is having glass cut to fit your table tops .
This can be expensive for dining tables but it is an affordable way to up date coffee tables and / or end tables .
Take the cut glass and use painters tape to cover the bevelled edges then spray the glass with metallic spray paint on one side .
Choose a high luster silver , bronze or gold spray paint .
Once you have given the spray paint 24 hours to dry remove the painters tape from the edges and place the glass painted side down on the table .
This is an affordable way to enhance items you already have without having to have them refinished and it is also a good way to add interest to new basic items .
3 . Choose a feature item .
Successful designs usually combine high and low .
Its a good idea to incorporate a more expensive feature item in your design .
Purchase one amazing chair .
Do not try and perfectly match furniture and avoid sets .
By buying one expensive chair you have opportunity to save because you an purchase it on clearance because it is the last one left , or you can save by buying a floor model at a custom shop .
Buy a chair with removable cushions .
This way you can flip them if any accidents occur on the upholstery .
When purchasing furniture think about how easy they would be to reapolster down the road ( if the apolstery is less complex then the service of having it done will be more affordable ) .
Go rich but go solid .
By choosing a colour that you really love in a solid you can easily update the look of your furniture with patterned toss cushions on a more frequent basis .
If your feature chair has a wooden frame or a woven frame with removable cushions choose whatever fabrics you like because they will be realitively affordable to change at a later date .
Furniture with toss cushion style back cushions is great because you can keep the seat cushion as is and replace the back cushions with large pre-made tosses to create a more dramatic look .
4. Avoid literal symmetry in your space .
Avoid literal symmetry in a space .
Instead create balance by using the visual weight of items .
If you require a lot of seating do not put two sofas in a room .
Instead use a sofa on one side , and a loveseat and club chair on the other .
5 . Do not neglect lighting .
Never neglect lighting within a room .
Lighting is worth spending a little extra on and it is a great way to create highs and lows withing a space .
Keep a handle on your budget by buying lighting fictures at second hand shops .
Ignore the colour and focus on the shape of the lamp .
You can always replace the lampshade and spray paint the lamp with Tremclad in any colour you wish .
Combine table lamps and tall freestanding lamps .
If you have high ceilings you need to utilize the space so that the room does not feel weighed down .
Mirrors and art are a must in spaces with high ceilings .
You can make you own mirrors by purchasing mirrored acetate at art and craft stores and cutting it to fit inside picture frames .
It will still look great while avoiding the high cost of decoratively framed mirrors .
They also wo n't be as heavy which can be helpful if you can not find a centered stud in your space .
6 . Things to remember when designing your dining room .
If you have a limited budget and are purchasing a dining set try and go for a simpler lower priced table and focus your budget on chairs .
Also consider refinishing the chairs you already have or slip covering them .
A fun way to add interest to your dining set is picking up all different chairs at antique shops , flea markets , second hand stores and garage sales .
Just make sure you commit to a height for the backs of the chairs , stay within an inch .
Once you have acquired the number of chairs you want have them all repainted with an antique finish to unite them .
This works well for eclectic spaces .
Lighting is very important in the dining room .
Lamps create fill light which gets rid of the shadows caused by lighting fixtures placed above the table .
By creating more even lighting everyone will have the opportunity to look their best .
7. Purchase luxurious accents .
When redesigning your space think about purchasing accent furniture pieces like a console table in the living room and a side board or buffet in the dining room .
These items add luxury while providing useful surfaces and increasing the number of opportunities for lighting .
Consider putting lamps in your dining room .
It will create more even lighting which will improve ambiance .
8. Leave room to accessorize .
If you are budge conscious for all of you big purchases you will be able to afford all of the final details that truly make a space sing .
Choose accessories with a pop colour that compliments the space , whether it be canary yellow , turquoise , red etc. is up to you .
Shallow floating shelves are a great way to provide opportunities for introducing more details without biting into your space .
When purchasing accessories choose a variety of heights and purchase items to be grouped together in uneven numbers ( either 3 or 5 depending on the size of the space and the scale of the items .
Remember less is more focus on quality instead of quantity ( after all you will have to move everything everytime you dust ! ) .
9. Remember to combine textures .
Regardless of whether you are going modern , ecclectic , traditional , or country always try to layer textures within a space to create interest .
Think about antiqued finishes , frosted glass , glass , chrome , suede , velvet , textured fabrics etc .
Think about textures when purchasing both furniture and accessories .
Microsoft has endured a lot of flack over the past few years because of the various failures of Vista .
At the same time , however , one of its operating systems has been quietly scooping up a lot of praise , thanks to its seamless interface , speed of interaction and general suitability for purpose .
The product line in question is Surface , the multitouch hospitality system that is probably installed on a coffee table - sized PC in a hotel or airport near you .
A typical Surface system is a clever array of rear projected screen and sub - surface cameras for tracking gestures , while the software is a derivative of Windows .
The projects branched at some time in the past , but there 's rumblings that they may be merged again at some point soon .
Windows 7 already natively supports multitouch , and recently we 've seen multitouch laptops from Dell and HP running Vista .
To get a feel for the kinds of thing Microsoft is hoping ambitious developers will do with Windows 7 and multitouch , PC Plus magazine was invited to Microsoft 's Reading campus , where an HP IQ850 TouchSmart was kitted out with Windows 7 and some converted Surface apps to show how the two projects will come together .
First off , if you 've got a PC screen that supports multitouch , there are some things in Windows 7 that are already working well , although driver support for the screens is occasionally flaky .
Gestures are up and running in Internet Explorer 8 , so you can move backwards and forwards through the page history just by swiping the screen .
Pinch zooming is fast too .
Then there 's Windows Live Photo Gallery , which has gesture support for rotating and zooming images .
Cropping an area just makes sense when you do it with your fingertips .
Touching the future
The Surface apps may not make the leap to your PC directly , but they do a great job of demonstrating what Windows 7 could become .
Collage , a photo manipulation tool that gives you complete control over the placement , rotation and scale of a set of images , has been repeatedly shown in Surface demos and translates well to the small screen .
Surface Globe , meanwhile , is a completely gesture controlled version of Microsoft Earth .
As well as being able to control the camera angle and zoom as you spin your way from location to location , it pulls in relevant information from the web to highlight points of interest .
Using it , we 're reminded of the demo from January 's CES in which Steve Ballmer showed a vision of the future where our documents and images are populated with layered information pulled from websites , email databases , IM messages and academic resources , all made relevant by search algorithms .
It genuinely feels like Surface Globe is nine tenths of the way to fulilling this vision .
All the app needs to get the rest of the way is a couple of good plug-ins to make it customisable , allowing users to create personalised maps to lag up friends ' houses , places of work , the local hairdresser or previous and future holiday destinations .
What we 've seen so far has been very much proof of concept , but it 's not just PC vendors who are working with Microsoft on reining their multitouch interfaces .
At least one major retailer , we 're told , is close to co-launching a mini-system using barcode scanning and multitouch for online grocery shopping .
The best thing about the different demos that we 've seen , though , is that they do n't feel gimmicky , like most of the current touchscreen desktop apps around at the moment .
Each adds a level of interaction that 's simply not possible with a keyboard or mouse – and together they strongly imply that Windows 7 could bring multitouch out of its shell and finally make it live up to its potential .
Pontiac Solstice
Coupe is indeed the car of this generation and driving this small beast gives you the feeling of familiarity as though you have been driving this for years .
It gives a good driving comfort and makes driving a cool experience .
This drop - top variant is small but impresses with its style and performance .
The car feels like a true offspring of C4 Corvette Coupe and a Dodge Viper .
Though the car is not anyway near in size or in power as these two American giants , all the features and merits of these two cars is present in this little coupe and this makes it unique in its cadre .
This car was spanned during the Bob Luz era at the GM .
Bob is a true leader and one who values others creativity and innovation .
He always wanted some new ideas from his designers and the first task he assigned to his designers when he joined GM in 2001 was to create a new concept or idea for the Detroit Auto Show .
This has resulted in this grand coupe , Solstice .
Now with the company struck hard by the recession , Lutz is winding down his time at the company and as a result Solstice and the entire Pontiac are also fading slowly .
Solstice is undoubtedly a true symbol of what went right and what went wrong with GM and Pontiac .
The original designs of this coupe were made by Franz Von Holzhausen , a newbie in the General Motor ’s design studio at that time .
From then on , Von Holzhausen has had tenure at Mazda and currently he leads a design team at Tesla Motors which works on the Model S.electric sedan .
The designs were created by Von in the early 2002 for Detroit and Chicago auto shows and it was only in 2008 New York Auto show the coupe went to its production version .
The interiors of the coupe are tightly fit but are comfortable enough to provide the right amount of space .
The center tunnel in the coupe is tall and wide to accommodate the transmission and the drive shaft .
Unlike other sports cars , the coupe lacks dozens of buttons on its dashboard controlling its features .
The seating position and the comfort are not up to the mark and the gaps between the dashboard and the doors are also uneven .
There is also an issue of visibility in this solstice coupe .
With the roof panel , looking out of the low windshield requires you to lean ahead to see the traffic lights .
It is indeed a difficult thing to do when you ought to concentrate more on road and drive .
The side glasses placed also do not encourage much as the side view is also not quite clear .
Though there where initial doubts about the poor top mechanism employed for this coupe , the Pontiac now comes with a fold - up soft top that can be packed and kept inside .
But this does not come with the base price as it is an $ 1100 option .
May 6 , 2009 -- British left groupings Socialist Resistance and the International Socialist Group have joined the Socialist Party , Socialist Workers Party , Scottish Socialist Party and others of the European anti-capitalist left in endorsing this statement for the European elections .
The statement was agreed at a conference in Strasbourg on April 3 , 2009 .
* * *
It 's not for people and workers to pay for the crisis , the capitalists should pay !
The next European elections will be held during the worst crisis capitalism has known since 1929 .
Economic , social , financial , banking , food , climatic , it is a global , general crisis .
Once again , the ruling classes want to make workers and peoples pay for the crisis .
Governments have given hundreds of billions to banks but at the same time millions of layoffs fall on employees .
Unemployment is going through the roof .
The purchasing power of wages is falling .
The destruction of public services continues .
It 's not for people and workers to pay for the crisis , the capitalists should pay !
This policy of European Union institutions has been rejected by the " No " votes in France , the Netherlands and Ireland .
We reject the plans of EU governments that save banks and not people .
We put forward an emergency social and democratic plan :
No layoffs !
A stable and secure job with decent pay for all !
For an increase of wages and incomes in every country for workers , unemployed and pensioners !
Harmonisation of social rights in Europe upwards : minimum wages , reduction of work time without wage cuts , pensions and social security !
European cooperation in promoting social protection for the unemployed and the poor , and for common policies for the sustainability of public pensions !
For the defence and extension of public services , across Europe !
For a public health system guaranteeing equal access to medical care for all !
For the defence of public education : withdrawal of the Bologna reforms !
No to the payment of the deficits of failed banks , and for the creation of unified public banking and financial system under public and popular control !
For the closure of all offshores !
European countries must give the example starting to close the offshores located in their own territories which are responsible for 2/3 of the world offshore business !
For the cancellation of the Third World debt !
For the defence of the undocumented and for equal rights for all residents in Europe , whether " national " or from a foreign country !
For the legalisation of all undocumented immigrants !
For equal rights between men and women !
For women 's rights , the right to free and safe contraception and abortion !
For LGBT rights and equal rights for heterosexual and homosexual couples !
For the repeal of anti-terrorist and laws and exceptional procedures !
For an ecological Europe , to fight effectively against climate change , we need a public service of energy production and distribution under the supervision of employees and consumers and we need to develop transport and housing public services !
No to war !
Disband NATO and all European militaristic bodies !
Withdraw foreign troops from Iraq and Afghanistan !
Israeli army 's withdrawal from the West Bank !
End to the blockade of Gaza !
Recognition of all national rights of the Palestinian people !
In these circumstances , and taking into account the particularities of each country , we are committed to building convergences in opposition against employers ' and governments ' attacks and at the same time to creating the conditions for a political alternative and an anti-capitalist pole based on the popular mobilisations , one which would stand for a Europe of social rights , and refuses any support of or participation in social - liberal governments with social - democratic parties or the centre left .
Indeed , what is needed is to break with capitalism and its logic .
In this sense , the anti-capitalist European left put these aims in the perspective of the struggle for 21st century socialism , and commits itself to restarting the debate on questions of a new distribution of wealth , of property and of democracy .
On this basis , and in the framework of the choices of each organisation , the undersigned will intervene during the next weeks in the electoral campaign for the European Parliament .
The signatory organisations :
Belgium : Ligue communiste révolutionnaire , Parti socialiste de lutte
France : Nouveau Parti Anticapitaliste
Germany : internationale sozialistische linke , Revolutionär Sozialisticher

On Wednesday , January 15 , 2003 , I filmed a television show with Bill Nye in Seattle , Washington , for a new PBS science series entitled “ Eye on Nye . ”
This series is an adult - oriented version of Bill ’s wildly successful 100 - episode children ’s series “ Bill Nye the Science Guy . ”
This 30 - minute segment was on psychics and talking to the dead .
Although I have analyzed the process and written about it extensively in Skeptic , Scientific American , How We Believe , and on www.skeptic.com, I have had very little experience in actually doing psychic readings .
Bill and I thought it would be a good test of the effectiveness of the technique and the receptivity of people to it to see how well I could do it armed with just a little knowledge .
Although the day of the taping was set weeks in advance , I did absolutely nothing to prepare until the day before .
This made me especially nervous because psychic readings are a form of acting , and good acting takes talent and practice .
And I made matters even harder on myself by convincing Bill and the producers that if we were going to do this we should use a number of different psychic modalities , including Tarot cards , palm reading , astrology , and psychic mediumship , under the theory that these are all “ props ” used to stage a psychodrama called cold reading ( reading someone “ cold ” without any prior knowledge ) .
I am convinced more than ever that cheating ( getting information ahead of time on subjects ) is not a necessary part of a s uccessful reading .
I read five different people , all women that the production staff had selected and about whom I was told absolutely nothing other than the date and time of their births ( in order to prepare an astrological chart ) .
I had no contact with any of the subjects until they sat down in front of me for the taping .
There was no conversation between us until the cameras were rolling .
The setting was a sound stage at KCTS , the PBS affiliate station in Seattle .
Since sound stages can have a rather cold feel to them , and because the set - up for a successful psychic reading is vital to generate receptivity in subjects , I instructed the production staff to set up two comfortable chairs with a small table between them , with a lace cloth covering the table and candles on and around the table , all sitting on a beautiful Persian rug .
Soft colored lighting and incense provided a “ spiritual ” backdrop .
The Partial Facts of Cold Reading
My primary source for all of the readings was Ian Rowland ’s insightful and encyclopedic The Full Facts Book of Cold Reading ( now in a 3rd edition available at www.ian-rowland.com).
There is much more to the cold reading process than I previously understood before undertaking to read this book carefully with an eye on performing rather than just analyzing .
( Please keep in mind that what I ’m describing here is only a small sampling from this comprehensive compendium by a professional cold reader who is arguably one of the best in the world .
If you want to try doing cold readings it is essential that you read the book and not just rely on my gloss on it . )
Rowland stresses the importance of the pre-reading set - up to prime the subject into being sympathetic to the cold reading .
He suggests — and I took him up on these suggestions — adopting a soft voice , a calm demeanor , and sympathetic and non-confrontational body language : a pleasant smile , constant eye contact , head tilted to one side while listening , and facing the subject with legs together ( not crossed ) and arms unfolded .
I opened each reading by introducing myself as Michael from Hollywood , calling myself a “ Psychic Intuitor . ”
( This was Bill ’s brilliant derivative from my original version “ Psychic Intuitive , ” which was grammatically incorrect — we needed a noun , not an adjective . )
I explained that my “ clients ” come to see me about various things that might be weighing heavy on their hearts ( the heart being the preferred organ of new age nonsense ) , and that as an intuitor it was my job to use my special gift of intuition — a gift , I added , that everyone has but that I have just developed through practice — to help them find their way through the vagaries of life .
I said that we would start general and then get more focused , beginning with the present then glancing back to the past , and finally taking a glimpse of the future .
I also noted that we psychics cannot predict the future perfectly — thereby setting up the pre-emptive excuse for later misses — by explaining how we look for general trends and “ inclinations ” ( an astrological buzz word ) .
I built on the disclaimer by adding a touch of self - effacing humor meant also to initiate a bond between us : “ While it would be wonderful if I was a hundred percent accurate , you know , no one is perfect .
After all , if I could psychically divine the numbers to next week ’s winning lottery I would keep them for myself ! ”
Finally , I explained that there are many forms of psychic readings , including Tarot Cards , Palm Reading , Astrology , and the like , and that my specialty was . . . whatever modality I was about to do with that particular subject .
Since I do not do psychic readings for a living , I do not have a backlog of dialogue , questions , and commentary from which to draw , so I outlined the reading into the following themata that are easy to remember ( that is , these are the main subject areas that people want to talk about when they go to a psychic ) : Love , Health , Money , Career , Travel , Education , Ambitions .
I also added a personality component , since most people want to hear something about their inner selves .
I did n’t have time to memorize all the trite and trivial personality traits that psychics toss out to their marks , so I used the Five Factor Model of personality , also known as the “ Big Five , ” that has an easy acronym of OCEAN : Openness to experience , Conscientiousness , Extroversion , Agreeableness , and Neuroticism .
Since I have been conducting personality research with my colleague Frank Sulloway ( primarily through a method we pioneered of assessing the personality traits of historical personages such as Charles Darwin , Alfred Russel Wallace , and Carl Sagan through the use of expert raters ) , it was easy for me to riffle through the various adjectives used by psychologists to describe these five personality traits .
For example : Openness to Experience ( fantasy , feelings , likes to travel ) , Conscientiousness
( competence , order , dutifulness ) , Agreeableness ( tender - minded versus tough - minded ) , Extroversion ( gregariousness , assertiveness , excitement seeking ) , and Neuroticism ( anxiety , anger , depression ) .
Since there is sound experimental research validating these traits , and I have learned through Sulloway ’s research how they are influenced by family dynamics and birth order , I was able to employ this knowledge to my advantage in the readings , including ( with great effect ) nailing the correct birth order ( first - born , middle - born , or later - born ) of each of my subjects !
I began with what Rowland calls the “ Rainbow Ruse ” and “ Fine Flattery , ” and what other mentalists more generally call a Barnum reading ( offering something for everyone , as P.T. always did ) .
The components of the following reading come from various sources , the particular sequential arrangement is my own .
Essentially I opened all of my readings with this general statement :
You can be a very considerate person , very quick to provide for others , but there are times , if you are honest , when you recognize a selfish streak in yourself .
I would say that on the whole you can be rather quiet , self - effacing type , but when the circumstances are right , you can be quite the life of the party if the mood strikes you .
Sometimes you are too honest about your feelings and you reveal too much of yourself .
You are good at thinking things through and you like to see proof before you change your mind about anything .
When you find yourself in a new situation you are very cautious until you find out what ’s going on , and then you begin to act with confidence .
What I get here is that you are someone who can generally be trusted .
Not a saint , not perfect , but let ’s just say that when it really matters this is someone who does understand the importance of being trustworthy .
You know how to be a good friend .
You are able to discipline yourself so that you seem in control to others , but actually you sometimes feel somewhat insecure .
You wish you could be a little more popular and at ease in your interpersonal relationships than you are now .
You are wise in the ways of the world , a wisdom gained through hard experience rather than book learning .
According to Rowland — and he was spot on with this one — the statement “ You are wise in the ways of the world , a wisdom gained through hard experience rather than book learning ” was flattery gold .
Every one of my subjects nodded furiously in agreement and said that this statement really summed them up to a tee .
After the general statement and personality assessment , I went for specific comments lifted straight from Rowland ’s list of high probability guesses .
These include items found in the subject ’s home :
A box of old photographs , some in albums , most not in albums
Old medicine or medical supplies out of date Toys , books , mementoes from childhood
Jewelry from a deceased family member
Pack of cards , maybe a card missing
Electronic gizmo or gadget that no longer works Notepad or message board with missing matching pen
Out - of - date note on fridge or near the phone Books about a hobby no longer pursued
Out - of - date calendar
Drawer that is stuck or does n’t slide properly
Keys that you ca n’t remember what they go to
Watch or clock that no longer works
And peculiarities about the person :
Scar on knee
Number 2 in the home address
Childhood accident involving water
Clothing never worn
Photos of loved ones in purse
Wore hair long as a child , then shorter haircut
One earring with a missing match
I added one of my own to great effect : “ I see a white car . ”
All of my subjects were able to find a meaningful connection to a white car .
As I was reading this list on the flight to Seattle the morning of the reading , I was amazed to discover how many flight attendants and people around me validated them .
Finally , Rowland reminds his ersatz psychics that if the set - up is done properly people are only too willing to offer information , especially if you ask the right questions .
Here are a few winners :
“ Tell me , are you currently in a long - term relationship , or not ? ”
“ Are you satisfied in terms of your career , or is there a problem ? ”
“ What is it about your health that concerns you ? ”
“ Who is the person who has passed over that you want to try to contact today ? ”
While going through the Barnum reading I remembered to pepper the commentary with what Rowland calls “ incidental questions , ” such as :
” . . . now why would that be ? ” ” . . . is this making sense to you ? ” ” . . . does this sound right ? ” ” . . . would you say this is along the right lines for you ? ” ” . . . this is significant to you , is n’t it ? ” ” . . . you can connect with this ca n’t you ? ” ” . . . so who might this refer to please ? ” ” . . . what might this link to in your life ? ” ” . . . what period of your life , please , might this relate to ? ” ” . . . so tell me , how might this be significant to you ? ” ” . . . can you see why this might be the impression I ’m getting ? ”
With this background , all gleaned from a single day of intense reading and note taking , I was set .
The Tarot Card reading
My first subject was age 21 , for whom I was to do a Tarot card reading .
To prepare myself I bought a “ Haindl Tarot Deck , ” created by Hermann Haindl and produced by U.S. Games Systems in Stamford , Connecticut ( $ 16.00 ) , at the Alexandria II new age book store in Pasadena , California , and read through the little pamphlet that comes with it ( itself glossed from a two - volume narrative that presumably gives an expanded explanation of each card ) .
It is a beautiful deck of cards , with elegant illustrations on them , each one replete with an astrological symbol , a Rune sign , a Hebrew letter , I Ching symbols , and lots of mythic characters from history .
For example , the Wheel of Fortune card description reads :
The wheel is set against a field of stars symbolizing the cosmos .
Below , looking upward , is the Mother , the Earth .
At the upper left is the Sky Father , Zeus .
At the upper right is an androgynous child .
The child , with its wizened face , represents humanity and our ancestors .
Inside the Wheel , the mushrooms symbolize luck , the snake , rebirth , the eye , time , the dinosaur , all things lost in the turning of time .
Divinatory meanings : Change of circumstances .
Taking hold of one ’s life .
Grabbing hold of fate .
Time to take what life has given you .
For dramatic effect , my presentation included death card , which reads :
The image of the boat belongs to birth as well as to death ; the baby ’s cradle originally symbolized a boat .
The trees and grass signify plants , the bones , minerals , the birds , the animal world , and the ferryman , the human world .
The peacock ’s eye in the center signifies looking at the truth in regard to death .
The bird also symbolizes the soul and the divine potential of a person .
Divinatory meanings : The Death card rarely refers to physical death .
Rather , it has to do with one ’s feelings about death .
Psychologically , letting go .
New opportunities .
At a total of 78 cards there was no way I was going to memorize all the “ real ” meanings and symbols , so the night before I sat down with my family and read through the instruction manual and we did a reading together , going through what each of the 10 cards we used is suppose to mean .
My 11 - year old daughter Devin then quizzed me on them until I had them down cold .
( This was , I think , not done just out of Devin ’s desire to help her daddy ; it also had the distinct advantage of getting her out of doing her homework for the evening , plus gave me a test of my own medicine of repetitive learning . )
I used what is called the “ Hagall Spread ” ( no explanation given as to who or what a Hagall is ) , where you initially lay out four cards in a diamond shape , then put three cards on top and three more on the bottom .
This spread is suppose to indicate :
The general situation Something you ’ve done , or an experience you ’ve had that has helped create the current situation Your beliefs , impressions and expectations , conscious or subconscious or the situation
The likely result of the situation as things stand now Spiritual history , how you ’ve behaved , what you ’ve learned Spiritual task at this time , challenges and opportunities in the current situation Metamorphosis , how the situation will change and the spiritual tasks that will come to you as a result The Helper : Visualize the actual person .
This person gives you support Yourself .
You are expressing the qualities of the person shown on the card The Teacher .
This figure can indicate the demands of the situation , and also the knowledge that you can gain from the situation
By the time of the reading I forgot all of this , so I made up a story about how the center four cards represent the present , the top three cards represent the future , and the bottom three cards are the characters that are going to help you get to that future .
It turns out that it does n’t matter what story you make up , as long as it sounds convincing .
I was glad , however , that I had memorized the meanings of the symbols and characters on the cards I used because my subject had previously done Tarot card reading herself .
( Since you are supposed to have the client shuffle the Tarot cards ahead of time to put her influence into the deck , I palmed my memorized cards and then put them on top of the newly shuffled deck . )
Since this subject was my first reading I was a little stiff and nervous , so I did not stray far from the standard Barnum reading , worked my way through the Big Five personality traits fairly successfully ( and from which I correctly guessed that she was a middle child between first and last born siblings ) , and did not hazard any of the high probability guesses .
Since she was a student I figured she was indecisive about her life , so I offered lots of trite generalities that would have applied to almost anyone : she is uncertain about her future but exited about the possibilities , she is confident in her talents yet still harbors some insecurities , travel is in her immediate future , she strikes a healthy balance between head and heart , intellect and intuition , and so forth .
Tarot cards are a great gimmick because they provide the cold reader with a prop to lean on , something to reference and point to , something for the subject to ask about .
I purposely put the “ Death ” card in the spread because that one seems to make people anxious ( recall the “ Death ” card was in the news of late because the east coast sniper said that it influenced him to begin his killing spree ) .
This gave me an opportunity to pontificate about the meaning of life and death , that the card actually represents not physical death but metaphorical death , transitions in life are a time of opportunity — the “ death ” of a career and the “ rebirth ” of another career — and other such dribble .
The line was cast , the bait set , and the fish bit .
After each reading the producers conducted a short taped interview with the subject , asking them how they thought the reading went .
Micael said she thought the reading went well , that I accurately summarized her life and personality , but that there were no surprises , nothing that struck her as startling .
She had experienced psychic readings before and that mine was fairly typical .
I felt that the reading was mediocre at best .
I was just getting started .
The Palm Reading
My second reading was on a young woman , age 19 .
Palm reading is the best of the psychic props because , as in the Tarot cards , there is something specific to reference , but it has the added advantage of making physical contact with the subject .
I could not remember what all the lines on a palm are suppose to represent , so while I was memorizing the Tarot cards Devin did a google image search for me and downloaded a palm chart , which depicted lines ( creases ) for Life , Head , Heart , Health , Fate , Marriage , Money , Sex , Spirit , Travel , and Luck .
I mainly focused on the Life , Head , Heart , and Health lines , and for added effect added some blather about the Marriage , Money , and Fate lines .
Useful nonsense includes :
If the Head and Life lines are connected it means that there was an early dependence on family .
If Head and Life lines are not connected it means the client has declared independence early .
The degree of separation between the Head and Heart lines indicates the degree of dependence or independence between the head and the heart for making decisions .
The strength of the Head line indicates the thinking style — intuitive or rational .
Breaks in the Head line may mean there was a head injury , or that the subject gets headaches , or something happened to the head at some time in the subject ’s life .
On one web page I downloaded some material about the angles of the thumbs to the hand that was quite useful .
You have the subject rest both hands palm down on the table , and then observe whether they are relaxed or tight and whether the fingers are close together or spread apart .
This purportedly indicates how uptight or relaxed someone is , how extroverted or introverted they are , how confident or insecure they feel , etc .
According to one palm reader a small thumb angle “ reveals that you are a person who does not rush into doing things .
You are cautious and wisely observe the situation before taking action .
You are not pushy about getting your way . ”
A medium thumb angle “ reveals that you do things both for yourself and for others willingly .
You are not overly mental about what you are going to do , so you do n’t waste a lot of time doing unnecessary planning for each job . ”
And a big thumb angle “ reveals that you are eager to jump in and get things done right away .
You do things quickly , confidently , and pleasurably because you like to take charge and get the job done . ”
Conveniently , you can successfully use any of these descriptions with anyone .
It turns out that you can tell the handedness of a person because the dominant hand is a little larger and more muscular .
That gave me an opening to tell this subject , who was left - handed , that she was right - brain dominant , which means that she puts more emphasis on intuition than on intellect , that she is herself very intuitive ( Rowland says that a great ruse is to flatter the subjects with praise about their own psychic powers ) , and that her wisdom comes more from real world experience than traditional book learning .
She nodded furiously in agreement .
According to the various palm reading “ experts , ” you are suppose to comment on the color and texture of the skin , hair on the back of the palm , and general shape of the hands .
Any major discrepancy between the two hands is supposed to be a sign of areas where subjects have departed from their inherited potential .
The psychic should also take note of the shape of the fingers .
The outer phalanges of the fingers ( the finger tips ) represent spiritual or idealistic aspects of the person , the middle phalanges everyday and practical aspects , and the lower phalanges the emotional aspects of personality .
I found it most effective to rub my fingers over the mounds of flesh on each finger segment while commenting on her personality .
For this reading I threw in a few high probability guesses , starting with the white car .
It turns out that this subject ’s 99 - year old grandmother had a white car , which gave me an opening to comment about the special nature of her relationship with her grandmother , which was spot on .
Then I tried the out of date calendar , which did not draw an affirmative response from my mark , so I recovered by backing off toward a more general comment : “ Well . . . what I ’m getting here is something about a transition from one period in your life to another , ” which elicited a positive affirmation from Brittany that she was thinking of switching majors .
This subject ’s assessment of my reading was slightly more positive than than the first subject ’s , as was my own self - evaluation , but no one was yet floored by anything said .
I was still gathering steam for the big push to come .
The Astrological Reading
My third subject was another young lady , age 20 , and was my toughest read of the day .
She gave monosyllabic answers to my incidental questions for extracting information , and did not seem to have much going on in her life that required much in the way of psychic advice .
I used an astrological chart that I downloaded from the Internet .
It was constructed some time ago for a guy named John Corbett , born May 9 , 1961 .
The young lady was born September 3 , 1982 .
I have n’t got a clue what the chart means .
Of course , since it does n’t actually mean anything , I began by explaining that “ the stars incline but do not compel , ” and then I just made up a bunch of stuff about how the conjunction of having a rising moon in the third house and a setting sun in the fifth house is an indication that she has a bright future ahead of her , and that her personality is a healthy balance between head and heart , mind and spirit , intellect and intuition .
Her nods indicated agreement .
I threw out a bunch of high probability guesses and got about half of them right ( including the line about wearing her hair longer at a younger age ) , then closed the reading by asking her if she had any questions for me .
She said that she had applied for a scholarship in order to participate in a foreign student exchange program in England , and wanted to know if she was going to get it .
I responded that the important issue at hand was not whether she was going to get the scholarship or not , but how she would deal with getting it or not getting it , and that I was highly confident that her well balanced personality would allow her to handle whatever the outcome .
This seemed to go over well .
In the post - reading interview she was much more positive than I anticipated , considering how stilted the reading was , so I suppose we can count this one as a success as well , although I was not particularly proud of it .
Psychic Reading
My fourth subject as age 58 , for which I was to do a straight cold read with no props .
I began with the Barnum reading , but did not get far into it before it became apparent that she was more than a little willing to talk about her problems .
She did not want to hear all that generic crap .
She wanted to get straight to the specific issues on her mind that day .
Since she was overweight and did not look particularly healthy , but I did n’t want to say anything about her weight , I said I was picking up something about her being concerned about her health and diet , guessing , since this was still early January , that she probably made a New Year ’s resolution about losing weight and starting a new exercise program .
Bingo !
This subject then opened up about her recent back surgery and other bodily ailments .
I tried a number of high probability guesses that worked quite well , especially the box of photographs , broken gadgets around the house , and the short hair / long hair line , all hits , especially the hair , which she explained she changes constantly .
I said I was getting something about a scar or scrape on her knees , and that left her slack jawed .
She said that she had not scraped her knees since childhood , but had just the week before fallen down and tore them up pretty badly .
Swish !
Although I was able to glean from the conversation that she had recently lost her mother , and a few minutes of generic comments from me about her mother staying close to her in her memory left her in tears , she really came to find out about her son .
What was he going to do ?
A minute of Q & A revealed that he is a senior in high school , so I assumed that as his mother she was worried about him going off to college .
Nothing but net !
What in particular was she worried about ?
He was thinking of going to USC , so I jumped in before she could explain , and surmised that it was because the University of Southern California is located in downtown Los Angeles , not exactly the safest neighborhood in the area .
In the post - reading interview this subject praised my psychic intuition to the hilt and Bill and his producers were beside themselves with glee at what great dramatic television this was going to make .
Imagine how John Edwards ’ producers must feel after a taping of Crossing Over .
( On a positive note we did learn that day that James Van Praagh ’s television series was just cancelled due to poor ratings . )
Talking to the Dead
My last subject was a woman age 50 . . . and my best reading .
She had told Bill ’s producer that she had something very specific she wanted to talk about , but did not offer a clue as to what it was .
It did n’t take me long to find out .
When I introduced myself and shook her hand , I noticed that her hands were exceptionally muscular and her palms sweaty .
This was a high - strung , nervous person who was obviously emotional and agitated .
I assumed that someone near to her had died ( the proper phrase is “ passed into spirit ” ) , and that she wanted to make contact .
“ I ’m sensing several people that have passed over , either parents or a parent - like figure to you . ”
It was her father who died , and she clearly had unfinished business with him .
From the ensuing conversation I discovered that her father had died when she was 27 , so I deduced that it must have been a sudden death ( correct ) and that she did not have the opportunity to make her peace with him ( also correct ) .
Finally , I accurately deduced that she was sad because she would have liked to share her many life experiences over the past two decades with her father . . . “ such as having a child . ”
Wrong — she is childless .
Without missing a beat I offered this riposte : “ Oh , what I mean is . . . giving birth to a new idea or new business . ”
A three - pointer from downtown !
This was an entrepreneurial woman whose father was a successful businessman with whom she would have loved to share the success .
It was n’t long before this subject was nearly sobbing .
This was an emotionally fragile woman of whom I could have easily taken advantage by jumped in with some inane line such as “ your father is here with us now and he wants you to know that he loves you . ”
But I knew I would have to look in the mirror the next morning and just could n’t do it , even for a worthwhile exposé of a very evil practice .
Instead I said “ your father would want you to keep him in your heart and your memories , but that it is time now to move on . ”
I wanted to give her something specific , as well as lighten up the reading because it was getting pretty glum , so I said “ and it ’s okay to throw away all those boxes of his stuff that you have been keeping but want to get rid of . ”
She burst out laughing and confessed that she had a garage full of her father ’s belongings that she had long wanted to dispose of but was feeling guilty about doing so .
This exchange was , I hoped , a moral message that violated no trust on my part and still had the desired effect for our show .
In the post - reading interview this subject said that she had been going to psychics for over ten years trying to resolve this business with her father , and that mine was the single best reading she had ever had .
Wow !
That made my psychic day .
The Disclosure
Our original plan was to tell all of the subjects after the readings that this was all just a set - up to expose psychic phonies as nothing more than scam artists out to rip - off people .
We were not particularly worried about the college - aged subjects because , after all , if the biggest crisis in your life is trying to decide whether to major in Theater Arts or English Lit , the veracity of a psychic ’s reading is a minor wrinkle in the greater cosmic scheme .
But for the last two readings we decided that they needed to be handled a little more delicately .
Bill and the producers came up with this explanation : “ We wanted you to know that Michael is not a psychic .
He is a psychologist .
We wanted to see if he could do what psychics do in terms of so - called intuitive readings .
While we realize that this probably seemed real to you , it was not real for Michael in any psychic sense . ”
The Grace of Scruples
I am not a psychic and do not believe that ESP , telepathy , clairvoyance , clairaudience , or any of the other forms of psi power have any basis whatsoever in fact .
There is not a shred of evidence that any of this is real , and the fact that I could do it reasonably well with only one day of preparation shows just how vulnerable people are to these very effective nostrums .
I can only imagine what I could do with more experience .
Give me six hours a day of practice for a couple of months and I have no doubt that I could easily host a successful syndicated television series and increase by orders of magnitude my current bank balance .
There — if not for the grace of evolved moral sentiments and guilt - laden scruples — go I .
I can not do this for one simple reason — it is wrong .
I have lost both of my parents — my father suddenly of a heart attack in 1986 , my mother slowly from brain cancer in 2000 — and I cannot imagine anything more insulting to the dead , and more insidious to the living , than constructing a fantasy that they are hovering nearby in the psychic aether , awaiting some self - proclaimed psychic conduit to reveal to me breathtaking insights about scars on my knees , broken appliances , and unfulfilled desires .
This is worse than wrong .
It is wanton depravity .

I srael has opened “ windows ” for the foreign powers to evacuate their terrified nationals from Lebanon .
Obligingly , the foreign media have turned these “ windows ” into an opportunity to avert their gaze further from the death and destruction in Lebanon , Gaza and the West Bank .
On BBC World , for example , we have been following the progress of one 12 - year - old British boy fleeing Beirut .
When he observed that he was worried for the Lebanese family members he was leaving behind , reporter Clive Myrie noted his was a “ very mature attitude ” .
If only the BBC was demonstrating such maturity .
I have to keep reminding myself that this is BBC World , not its domestic news service .
You would hardly know it watching the coverage of the past couple of days .
On Tuesday , when at least 35 Lebanese were killed -- possibly many more as no one seems to know who is lying under the rubble or has been incinerated in their fleeing cars -- we had the BBC ’s Ben Brown in Beirut giving a blow - by - blow account of every facet of the evacuation of foreign nationals in general and British nationals in particular .
If anyone doubted the racism of our Western media , here it was proudly on display .
The BBC apparently considers their Beirut reporter ’s first duty to find out what meals HMS Gloucester ’s chef will be preparing for the evacuees .
Lebanese and Palestinian civilians die unnoticed by the Western media ( though not by the Arab channels ) while we learn of onboard sleeping arrangements on the ship bound for Cyprus .
Did we really need to hear a lengthy live speech from the commander of HMS Gloucester telling us how “ delighted ” he was to be in Beirut ?
With the long minutes of rolling news to fill this might have been justified had the other minutes been stuffed with reports from the areas where civilians are dying by the dozen each day .
But such reports are the mean filling in the thick sandwich of the main story of the evacuees .
In the 4 pm GMT broadcast , I watched 45 minutes of coverage , most of it dedicated to “ live ” footage of the British warship ’s arrival and the relieved faces of the Brits about to leave .
Even so the BBC still managed to squeeze in other bits of reporting in the lulls in the drama of evacuation .
At different points there was a interview from Tel Aviv with former Israeli cabinet minister Yossi Beilin and a live link - up between Ben Brown and Lyse Doucet in Haifa .
She informed us of the “ barrage ” of 50 Katyushas that had landed on northern Israel that day , killing one man .
Supportively , Ben Brown , added that there was “ shock ” at the death and destruction spread by Hizbullah ’s rockets and opined that what the Israeli army was “ really after ” was Hizbullah ’s long - range missiles .
So we had the BBC in Haifa and Beirut speaking with one voice -- that of Israel .
Back in Beirut , Brown repeated with bafflement statements by the British ambassador that some British nationals preferred to stay put for the time being and would not be taking advantage of Israel ’s “ window ” .
It occurred to neither of them that many of these British nationals have loved ones in Beirut and may not want to leave them in the coming desperate hours .
Ben Brown also told us that it was “ understandable ” that the British evacuees were “ pretty scared ” because they were not accustomed to this kind of bombing .
Not like , he added , war correspondents such as himself or the people of Beirut , who had grown used to such assaults .
The outrageous racism implicit in this comment was clear the moment one paused to consider its possible meanings .
Did Brown mean that the Lebanese do not mind being bombed ?
Did he mean that Lebanese children understand from birth that it is their fate to be attacked by Israel , that they get used to the explosions around them ?
Did he mean that their parents are less terrified than a British mother and father by the thought that their family might be obliterated at any moment ?
Or did he mean that Lebanon ’s civilians will not be as traumatized by their experiences as other human beings would be ?
This is the racist subtext of the foreign media ’s evacuations story .
That once the foreigners have been moved to safety , we in the West can leave those who understand only the language violence -- the Israeli army and , apparently , the whole population of Lebanon -- to carry on with their unfinished business .
And we can be sure that this is exactly what will happen as soon as Israel ’s “ window ” is shut .
When the foreign powers no longer have even a small vested interest in the safety of Beirut , can we expect the coverage to improve ?
Do n’t hold your breath .
